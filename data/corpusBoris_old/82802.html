Visits to the Doctor Could Help Brighten the U.S. Economyâ€™s Grim Winter - Real Time Economics - WSJ The U.S. economyâ€™s first-quarter contraction could look less grim thanks to new data showing stronger-than-expected revenues at doctorsâ€™ offices. Eight of 12 broad categories of service-providing businesses saw annual revenue growth decelerate or drop outright in the first quarter compared with the final three months of 2014, the Commerce Department said Wednesday in its Quarterly Services Survey . However, year-over-year revenue growth accelerated in one of the largest sectors, health care and social assistance. The evidence of stronger-than-expected spending on health-care services led several private economists to upgrade their estimates for gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the U.S. economy. The Commerce Department last month estimated GDP shrank at a 0.7% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the first quarter . But J.P. Morgan Chase on Wednesday estimated GDP shrank at just a 0.2% pace. Barclays projected a 0.3% decline, and forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers projected GDP shrank at a mere 0.1% pace in the first three months of 2015. â€œConsumption of services was a bit stronger than the [Bureau of Economic Analysis] had estimated, and most of that was tilted toward health care,â€? Barclays economist Jesse Hurwitz said. The QSS, as itâ€™s known, doesnâ€™t get much attention in the world of economic indicators. Still, itâ€™s one of the U.S. governmentâ€™s only sources of timely and reliable data on how much Americans spend on services Â such as surgery, day care, freight trucking and legal advice. It forms the basis for roughly a fifth of the GDP calculation. It can sometimes lead to big revisions for official estimates of consumer spending on services and business spending on software, which in turn can shift readings on overall economic growth. Data from the QSS deepened the economyâ€™s first-quarter contraction in 2014 , in large part because the Commerce Department had anticipated an immediate boost in spending from the rollout of the Affordable Care Act that failed to materialize . Later in the year, the report led to upward revisions for health-care spending and broader economic growth. In addition to the services report, recent readings on construction spending, inventories and international trade have bolstered expectations for a shallower first-quarter contraction when the Commerce Department issuesÂ  a revised GDP estimate on June 24 .
