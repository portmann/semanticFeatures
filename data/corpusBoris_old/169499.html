Five Fiscal Deadlines to Watch This Fall - Real Time Economics - WSJ Political analysts are taking more seriously the risk of a partial government shutdown at month’s end, even thoughÂ Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) has repeatedly insisted that this will not happen. What’s going on? Here’s a quick primer on five fiscal deadlines lawmakers face before the year is out: 1.) GOVERNMENT FUNDING, PART ONE: Republicans struggled to pass spending bills this summer in the face of near total opposition from Democrats. President Barack Obama has said that he won’t accept spending bills that keep in place discretionary spending caps, known as the sequester, and that those caps must rise equally for defense and nondefense spending. The fiscal year ends Sept. 30, which means Congress will need to pass some type of short-term spending extension, possibly to December. The hitch: Conservatives are boiling over a series of videos that purport to show Planned Parenthood profiting from the sale of fetal tissue to medical researchers. Several Republican lawmakers are demanding that any funding bill cut off money for Planned Parenthood, even though Republicans don’t have the votes to overcome procedural hurdles in the Senate, let alone to override a presidential veto. There’s aÂ possible lose-lose scenario here for Republican leaders: Even if they avoid a shutdown, they risk angering a restive base emboldened by several anti-establishment presidential candidates–causing headaches for them overÂ the remaining fiscal items on the agenda. 2.) GOVERNMENT FUNDING, PART TWO: If Congress passes the short-term spending measure, it will need to decide how to fund the government through the remainder of the fiscal yearâ€”and probably the one after that, since lawmakers probably won’t be spoiling to do this again next summer in the middle of an election. One option: Extend funding at current levels through the rest of the year. That’s a nonstarter with Democrats because it would essentially keep the sequester in place for two more years. Another option: A bipartisan agreement to ease the sequester thatÂ offsets spending increases with new revenues or entitlement-program savings. Many Republicans see the sequester as one of their greatest accomplishments and could object loudly to any rollback. 3.) HIGHWAY FUNDING: In July, Congress authorized until late October funding for the Highway Trust Fund, the latest fix for a program that has been chronically depleted because construction costs have outpaced gas-tax revenues. Initially, lawmakers thought the $8 billion extension would last until December, but the Department of Transportation now says the funds could last until next June. This matters because it could allow for yet another short-term extension, even though both parties prefer a multiyear extension. The White House has sought a deal with Republicans , including HouseÂ Ways and Means ChairmanÂ Paul Ryan (R., Wis.), to use corporate tax changes to pay for a multiyear infrastructure deal. Mr. McConnell has poured cold water on that effort, and it isn’t clear that it will come together. 4.) DEBT CEILING: The Treasury Department has used emergency measures to avoid breaching the federal borrowing limit since mid-March. The Congressional Budget Office said last month that those measures could be exhausted by mid-November or early December, after which the Treasury would be out of cash. It isn’t yet clear how Congress will resolve the latest debt-limit increase, and past episodes have gone down to the wire. In 2011, the U.S. saw market volatility spike and its debt rating downgraded. In 2013, a debt-ceiling extension emerged only after a government shutdown. Deadline: mid-November or early December 5.) TAX EXTENDERS: Every year, Congress extends a series of temporary tax provisions that businesses and households have come to rely on. The Senate Finance Committee earlier this year voted to extend dozens of the credits, which expired Jan. 1, through next year. While many expect these provisions to be extended, the real drama centers on how Congress will pay for them, particularly given the two other spending issues on the table: Highway funding and overall government spending. BONUS ISSUE: Lawmakers whoÂ support the Export-Import Bank will likely use one or more of these “must-pass” measures to attach a reauthorization of the export-financing agency, whose charter lapsed in July. Conservative opponents, already distrustful of Republican leaders, will fight just as hard to make sure that doesn’t happen.
