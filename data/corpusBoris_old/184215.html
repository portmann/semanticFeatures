Low Oil Prices Fuel U.S. Economic Recovery - But Not For Long | Seeking Alpha The GDP for Q2 grew by 3.9% -- higher than expected. The rise was mostly due higher consumer spending, in part driven by low energy prices. Other factors could come into action such as higher U.S. dollar and rise in interest rates could curb down the growth in GDP in the coming quarters. The recent GDP report for the second quarter exceeded market expectations with a growth rate of 3.9% compared to 3.7% in the previous estimate. The upward revision in GDP was mostly due to higher consumer spending. The higher spending is attributed, in part, to the soft energy market. Even The FOMC revised up its GDP outlook for 2015, and sees the transitory effects of low energy prices as a net positive for the U.S. economy. Let's review the relation between energy prices and consumer spending and the outlook of the U.S. GDP for the near term. As you can see, the relation between the two hasn't been consistent over the past several years. But over the past year, the plunge in oil prices seems to have coincided with the rise in personal spending. If oil prices were to remain low -for now the EIA still expects oil prices to remain below $50 at least until the second quarter of 2016 -- this could keep pushing up the U.S. GDP. According to one report by the World Bank the drop in oil prices is projected to increase global GDP by 0.7-0.8% and cut inflation by 1% over the medium term. And since the U.S. doesn't export oil, the adverse impact of lower oil prices will be less severe compared to oil exports countries such as Canada. Nonetheless, the U.S. has seen a modest fall in jobs related to mining. These lost jobs, however, were offset by growing jobs in other sectors. Although consumer spending, which had a positive impact on the GDP, rose in the past year, its impact may start to subside in the coming quarters. After all, the FOMC could still start to raise rates in the coming months. Chair Yellen slightly alluded to the possibility of a rate hike in a recent speech in which she reiterated that : "…most of my colleagues and I anticipate that it will likely be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate sometime later this year." And if the upcoming non-farm payroll report shows a stronger than expected gain in jobs of say close to 250,000 jobs, this could further increase the implied probabilities for a rate hike this year by the FOMC. For now the market places only 11% chance for a hike in the October meeting and 39% in December. This shift in Fed's policy along with the dovish sentiment of other major central banks will keep driving up the U.S. dollar, which will increase imports and make exports less competitive - in both cases, these factors will cut down the GDP. And higher rates could also reduce spending via less loans granted by banks. That's perhaps why the FOMC revised down its GDP outlook for 2016-2017. Low oil prices contribute to the growth of the U.S. economy via higher consumer spending. But these effects are, as the Fed stated, transitory and could subside in the coming quarters as the U.S. dollar keeps rising, the Chinese economy isn't doing well, and Fed prepares to, eventually, raise rates.
