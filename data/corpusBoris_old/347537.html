In addition, during today’s call, we'll be reporting certain financial information on a non-GAAP basis, which is described in more detail in our earnings press release, along with a detailed reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results. Thank you, Ken. I would like to start by thanking all of you for joining us today and for your continued interest in Sigma. Persistent with the guidance we provided in the last earnings call, we are reporting $51.5 million in revenue for the fourth quarter. While our Smart TV platforms showed the expected seasonal decline, we are confident that its underlying strength and design wins will drive revenue growth in fiscal 2017. We also continued to build momentum in IoT Devices with our Z-Wave family, which showed some sequential growth in the fourth quarter. We are also pleased with our financial results for all of fiscal 2016. Our revenue grew 20.7% for the year, reaching a total of $227.3 million, with Smart TV and Z-Wave being the largest contributors to the growth. Supported by a blended non-GAAP gross margin of 51.4% for the year, our non-GAAP net income grew this year, reaching a total of $13.2 million, or $0.36 per diluted share. As we enter fiscal 2017, I am confident that we will see another year of revenue growth and continued profitability driven by our strong and differentiated product offerings serving both our established and new customers alike. As we indicated in our last earnings call, moving forward we have consolidated our business into two primary product families. Our connected Smart TV platform which we include our Smart TV, set top box and connectivity lines as well our industry leading IoT device which include our Z-Wave family and our new mobile IoT platform. Each of these product families will be focused on the application markets where we can enable a richer connected experience through superior technology innovation. This consolidation will provide efficiencies of scale through the integration of common functions. I would like to begin by discussing our Smart TV platform family. Our Smart TV product line contributed $24.5 million of revenue this quarter down from last quarter in the manner consistent with industry seasonality. Our Smart TV SoCs and frame rate converters offer leading edge features and the full complement of the over-the-top software that has enabled us to differentiate ourselves from the competition in the market. Our demonstration of our HDR technology, the emphasize in our unique movie support SES, and follow on customer visit has been well received and continues to create ongoing engagement with greater adoption. Fiscal 2016 was a year of significant momentum for our digital TV chips. The revenues increased more than 100% over the previous year driven primarily by growth in Smart TV SoCs. Our position as the primary provider of 4K television solution of VIZIO is strengthening as a percent of 4K TV growth in the marketplace. This translates into ongoing shipment to VIZIO, suite of large ODM manufacturers including TPV, Foxconn, Wistron and Amtran. We continue to offer new product features to enhance VIZIO offerings and secure additional business from this partnership. Our participation in the local based televisions now produce by six different brands including TCL, Hisense, Sharp, Hitachi, Insignia and Haier has proven to be very successful. These new Smart TV are selling well and will continue to fuel our growth. Moving in the same direction, VIZIO now has launched its new VIZIO smart cast enabled PCs representing the first integration of Google Chromecast into VIZIO award winning 4K TV. The new PC is based on Sigma’s unique SoC which brings ultra-HD and HDR technology to the most advanced new technology provided by the Google Cast. In Europe we continued to service demand through Metz [indiscernible]. At the same time we are also making steady progress toward expanding our engagement with other TV manufacturers and hope to announce additional design wins later this fiscal year. During the fourth quarter we announced several milestones that we enforced our overall momentum and position in the Smart TV platform. We are now the industry’s first single chip frame rate converter that support 4K TV with multiple HDR standards. This unique chip enables TV manufacturers using any SoC chipset to add full HDR support without changing their base TV platform. We also announced the first single 4K TV SoC with Dolby Vision a unique Sigma offering has entered volume production, enabling the highest quality visual experience yet available for premium Smart TV offerings. In the move intended to secure our leadership in yet another fastest of TV innovation, we entered into a strategic partnership with QD Vision, the global leader in quantum dot display technology. This partnership will enable low cost LCD displays to effectively compete with OLED offerings. As a result of the new product introductions and positive trends with new and existing customers, we remain confident that the strength around new DTV product will lead to further growth during the coming year. Now to our set top box line. Our set top box chipset contributed $3.2 million revenue in the fourth quarter which was down from the third quarter as the market continued to transition to streaming device, Sigma has likewise shifted its focus to this evolving market. Moving ahead, we are leveraging the majority of Smart TV development to deliver chipset for smart streaming box that turn current television into smart television. This chipset will deliver both 4K TV and HDTV television solution similar to those used in the local for cinemas. On the connectivity product line, our chipset contributed $11.8 million revenue in the fourth quarter down sequentially from the third quarter. As we have previously discussed, we expect demand for HD device to continue to slow down. Further, we expect demand to continue for the foreseeable future. Within our connectivity line, our G.hn chips are now wide spread evaluation and are achieving high marks for performance by interoperability. In summary, as a group, we are confident in our lineup of connected Smart TV platform to position to achieve growth through our fiscal 2017. Now let’s turn our attention to Sigma IoT device. As previously announced, we are substantially expanding the range of our IoT offering to now include both smart home and mobile IoT devices. We believe the IoT business is ripe for expansions and offers a wealth of revenue growth opportunities that will also continue to yield attractive margins. Our Z-Wave line contributed $11.3 million in the fourth quarter, an 11% increase over the prior quarter. Most importantly, fiscal 2016 was a year of emerging opportunities and tremendous growth for Z-Wave with revenue increasing about 50% over the previous fiscal year. During the fourth quarter, we issued two key announcements. We announced that our 500 Series Z-Wave modules have successfully met UL standards for home security, enabling new applications for use in two-way security sensors and other devices. We launched our Z-Wave S2 security framework, the most advanced security for smart home device in our market today that will become critical for acceptance in the new range of consumer initiatives. In addition, by the end of calendar 2015, Verizon has deployed approximately 2.5 million gateways with the Z-Wave controller building, setting up a large new potential opportunity for Sigma Z-Wave enabled end device. Our efficient Z-Wave business has currently faced some sharp turn fluctuation that will normalize in the second half of fiscal 2017. The primary causes are the dynamics within the telco service provider sector. As a background, over the past two years, we have won a substantial number of telco accounts that have been challenged to determine how to successfully generate efficient the end user demand. We expect to launch the new offering with some quantity of product line which will create a spike in demand for our productions incorporated into this new gateways as well as end device. Recently several markdowns of product lines that inadvertently has altered in timing, had some change in promotional strategy and number one, operational issues beyond our control that affect installation, all of which are resulting in lumpy revenue for Sigma. In part of the separate issues we are confident in the growth of our Z-Wave business. First, we continue to be the leading supplier in the smart home market with significant market share in the service provider sector, new design wins for all top security providers in North America and 15 top tier telcos around the world. Second, we have design win in 10 new carriers that are scheduled to begin deploying them throughout this year. These launches will include strong operator penetration in both China and Korea. Third, we have entered the imaging market for the new generation of two-way door and window sensors which is the largest TV demand in security business. These are now UL approved and now being driven one of the largest security providers in the country. Deployment is planned to begin in the fourth quarter and should result in entirely new segment of demand. Fourth, as Apple, Amazon, Google and others roll out the IoT initiative this year, we anticipate yet another segment of demand to begin to grow in the retail sector as well increase attach rate as service provider. Overall, we feel our Sigma business is fundamentally strong with multiple growth opportunities. The second piece of our IT business is the mobile IoT technology we acquired last fall. As we discussed in our prior call, we remain on track for initial product to be sampled in the market in the middle of this year and currently expect revenue contribution to start in the beginning of next fiscal year. We are excited about the prospects that this mobile technology as we expand our total addressable market to include outdoor applications as an ideal complement to our existing Z-Wave product line that covers indoor applications. At this time, we are heavily focused on completing the overall offerings that will enable rapid market adoption. In parallel, we are engaging with a number of leading worldwide telcos, brand OEMs and integration partners to establish pending demand for deployment. We believe very strongly in the future of IoT, our combination of technologies and our ability to achieve substantial market share in this high growth market. In summary, we had a very good fiscal 2016 delivering significant financial improvement and greater shareholder value. As we enter fiscal 2017, lined up with differentiated products serving connected Smart TV platform and IoT devices are leading the greater market opportunities. It is our intention to continue delivering long term shareholder value through consistent revenue growth and ultimately strong orders. Thank you, Thinh. Good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report that our fiscal 2016 was a year of significant financial improvement. Non-GAAP revenue increased approximately 20% of fiscal 2015 and we delivered strong gains in both net income and earnings per share. As Thinh discussed earlier, we expect continued revenue growth in fiscal 2017 which in turn should lead to another year of profitability. I will start my review with a summary of our fiscal 2016 results, before moving into the Q4 performance. All the fiscal year 2016 results I provide will be non-GAAP. Please see the tables included with our press release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial information. Non-GAAP net revenue in fiscal 2016 was $226.2 million, an increase of $37.9 million or 20.1% from $188.3 million in the previous fiscal year. Non-GAAP gross margin in fiscal 2016 was 51.4% compared with 53% in fiscal 2015. Non-GAAP operating expenses in fiscal 2016 were $102.9 million compared with $101.2 million in fiscal 2015. Non-GAAP operating income was $13.4 million compared with an operating loss of $1.3 million in fiscal 2015. Non-GAAP net income in fiscal 2016 was $13.2 million or net income of $0.36 per diluted share. This compares with a non-GAAP net loss of $4.1 million or net loss of $0.12 per share in fiscal 2015. Now moving to our Q4 performance. Net revenue for the first quarter was $51.5 million, down $10.1 million or 16.5% from $61.6 million reported in previous quarter and down $3.4 million or 6.2% from $54.8 million reported for the same period in fiscal 2015. The revenue breakout by our served target markets are as follows. Smart TV were $24.5 million representing 47.6%, media connectivity $11.8 million representing 23%, IoT devices $11.3 million representing 22%, set-top box $3.2 million representing 6.2%, license and other $0.6 million or 1.2%. The sequential changes include the following, Smart TV sales decreased as expected following normal seasonal patterns declining by $7.8 million. Media connectivity was down by $2.2 million while set-top box sales were lower by $1.5 million. Sales into our IoT devices market increased by $1.1 million, while license and other was up by $0.2 million. When compared with the fourth quarter a year ago, Smart TV sales increased $8.2 million while license and other was up by $0.4 million. This was offset by a decline in IoT devices of $0.2 million, media connectivity $8.5 million and set-top boxes $3.2 million. Now moving onto the primary items of the income statement and balance sheet. Non-GAAP gross margin was 49.6%. This compares with 51.7% in the previous quarter and 50.8% for the same period in fiscal 2015. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $27.4 million compared to $26 million in the previous quarter and $26.1 million for the same period in fiscal 2015. The increase from the third quarter was mainly due to expenses associated with the purchase of Bretelon, Inc. on November 4, 2015. GAAP operating loss was $5.2 million compared with $1.5 million in the previous quarter and a loss of $2.3 million for the same period in fiscal 2015. Non-GAAP operating loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was $1.9 million compared with an operating income of $5.8 million in the previous quarter and then operating income of $1.7 million for the same period in fiscal 2015. GAAP net loss was $6.2 million or $0.17 per diluted share. This compares with a net income of $6.4 million, which included the one-time gain of approximately $7.6 million from the resolution of a lawsuit of $0.17 per diluted in the previous quarter and a net loss of $3.6 million or $0.10 per share for the same period in fiscal 2015. Non-GAAP net income was $0.9 million or $0.02 per diluted share. This compares with a net income of $4.7 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the previous quarter and a net income of $1.5 million or $0.04 per diluted share for the same period in fiscal 2015. Again, please refer to our press release for a more detailed reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP performance. From our balance sheet; cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities totaled $73 million at the end of the fourth quarter compared with $95.6 million at the end of the previous quarter. The sequential change was primarily due to the approximately $23 million used for the purchase of Bretelon. Working capital was $92.5 million, a decrease of $25.7 million or 22% compared with $118.2 million at the end of the prior quarter. The decrease was also due to the acquisition of Bretelon, Inc. Net accounts receivable was $30.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter, a decrease of $0.6 million when compared with $31 million in the previous quarter. And that increase of $3.9 million compared with $26.4 million the same quarter last year. The average days sales outstanding, DSO for our receivables as of end of the fourth quarter was 54 days, an increase of approximately 8 days compared with the previous quarter and an increase of approximately 10 days compared with the same quarter last year. Net inventory $26.7 million at the end of the quarter compared with $28 million in the previous quarter and $20.4 million at the end of same quarter a year ago. This brings our inventory turns for the quarter to 4.0 on an annualized basis in line with the previous quarter and 4.5 in the same quarter a year ago. Accounts payable was $26.2 million at the end of the quarter compared to $26.7 million in the previous quarter at $21.2 million at the end of the same quarter a year ago. Accrued liabilities was $14.6 million at the end of the quarter compared to $12.5 million in the previous quarter and $22.9 million at the end of the same quarter a year ago. This concludes my review of the fourth quarter financial results. I will now cover our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal '17. So once again reiterate fiscal 2016 was a year of very strong growth. Our revenues increased 20%, compared to the prior year and we generated $13.2 million of non-GAAP net income versus non-GAAP net loss of $4.1 million over fiscal 2015. In looking at the make-up of our revenues for Q1, we expect revenue to increase compared to the fourth quarter for the Connected Smart TV platform. For the reasons discussed by Thinh earlier in the call, we expect revenue to decrease compared to the fourth quarter for IoT devices and resuming growth in subsequent quarters. Moving onto our formal guidance on the first quarter we currently expect the following. Total revenues to be in the range of $52 million to $56 million, non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 46% to 50%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $28 million. For fiscal 2017, we are confident in another year of revenue growth and profitability. That concludes my prepared remarks for this session, thank you all for joining us today. Wanted to start out with a question relating to Google Chromecast VIZIO TV launch through the P-Series that SoC that you're supplying for this particular model, was this in close collaboration with VIZIO and really my question really is to the stickiness of the design win, sort of goodwill you built with VIZIO and what the margin potential for this type of solution maybe? It's a standard SoC that we provide to the market. However, there is lot of features that we can do custom for VIZIO in our chip because our chip is very programmable and if our customer would like to do some special features or custom things we are able to do that. So pretty much it’s a standard chip but we have custom features designed primarily for VIZIO. And relating to the Bretelon products, you mentioned that they are on track to samples starting the mid-point of calendar 2016. Is that in essence a carrier qualification and if so, what sort of timeframe for final qualification are we looking at? As we indicated in our call, we're going to sample the product in the second half of this year. We have some production starting in Q4 but the majority of that would be Q1 next year. Reason being there is a long certification cycle with the carrier, so we expect to go through that, normally it probably takes six months or so to finish all the certification and so on. So that's what we have been telling. And Elias, with respect to OpEx for all of 2017, I understand that it increased in the fourth quarter and it's expected to further increase in Q1, mostly because of the Bretelon acquisition and the ad expenses and whatnot. But you mentioned in the past maybe the option of reducing OpEx in other areas and perhaps it relates to consolidation of three business units into what is in essence a Smart TV segment. Is that what you're referring to in putting numbers to that is Q1 the high watermark for OpEx for the full year and might we see some declines thereafter? Just wanted to dig into gross margin a little bit. It seems like the kind of long-term model has been slightly downshifted to 47% to 49% from 47% to 50%. Is that largely just due to mix? Exactly. And as you know Jaeson, in the past we have repeatedly said that we are going to get to certain quarters where the product mix especially from TV as we increase TV sales will result in a bit of erosion in gross margins. So this is something we are prepared for and I've telling everybody that there is going to come a couple of quarters where the margins will be eroded a bit but the company's goal, our goal as a management team delivering to you the shareholders is 50% that's our goal. But for the short-term for now, I think that's where we're kind of heading, we're heading to that erosion stage because TV is growing and the product mix is affecting it. And then looking at the IoT devices segment it seems like there is going to be a little pause here this quarter. Are you seeing anything significant from a geographical perspective either strength or weakness within that segment? No, basically the way that we’ve characterized this is that the dynamics within the telco service sector is what's been causing the lumpiness in the revenue. And there is an underlying strength that's going to pull out as we move down further in the year and so we're not reading anymore into than that. Okay. And the last one and I'll jump back in to queue. On the media connectivity business, should we think about that business continuing to decline or do you think it sort of troughed here? Yeah. It will be a very slow wind down over long period of time, flattening out for periods, but it's generally flat to decline. Hi, guys. Just a couple of topics here. First off, on the IoT, this is not the first time you guys have been talking about lumpiness quarter-to-quarter and is that more representative than we might have seen the peak as far as the quarterly revenue goes? No, not at all. Not even close to it. There is a robust underlying market here. We have no doubt as do the analysts in the industry that the market is headed upward like all of the rest of the IoT markets. What we’re seeing is, we’re seeing again this dynamic within the telcos, they are still challenged to figure out exactly how to have consistent growth after they will product out, and as they move forward. So we’re struggling with them and we’re seeing that demand cost fluctuation with us and we’re pretty steady in going with the security sector and retail is slowly creeping up over time. So that's really what we’re looking at and then we’re going to have growth in subsequent quarters. So for the whole year, we’re going to be higher than we were last year. So is it more of like a consumer education or is this just service providers don’t know how to market it or what's causing this lumpiness? If it’s growth, it should be just steady growth. Yeah. They’ll launch, they’ll get overaggressive on their lunch, they’ll launch with a high expectation, which means that not only they produce more gateways than they need, it also means it triggers a bunch of end device production that's expected to attach to it. And then if it doesn't pan out, if they really are not really sticking to an aggressive promotional plan and they run into install problems, then it ends up, they don't get all the flow that they need. And so it ends up being up and down for a while until they figure out exactly how to do it. So they are constantly adjusting their order rate. Okay. And the other topic I want to discuss was on the TV side, you're guiding up sequentially, is that mostly because of VIZIO or are you seeing anything from Dolby side. Any update as to any new Tier 1 customers as well. Yes. VIZIO and others, this part of the spring refresh part of the TV product going through, we see a big push ended the year and then you can see a refresh again for the - spring refresh. And every year is the same. Q1, we start growing, Q2, Q3 are strongest two quarters and Q4 come down. So we see the same thing repeating this year. Okay. And as far as the product mix goes within TV, most of that uptick in revenue that you’re expecting, is that from a full SoC sellthrough or is it partial that you were discussing last quarter that you were seeing more with the HDR side? Thanks for taking the question. This is Justin calling on behalf of Tristan Gerra. So last quarter, you were saying that about 15% to 20% of the legacy TVs will be wind down. So till now, how much percentage of that has been completed? All of our new SoCs, all of our new HDR capable products, this is all brand-new and it’s all the core of what we’re trying to drive business to. You’re trying to understand if the gross margin you’re seeing is the true gross margin associated with the SoCs? Because last quarter, you were saying 15% to 20% of legacy smart TV products will be winding down, but they had higher gross margins, so that's why the gross margin would be going down. So now, since all of them have been wind down, does that mean that we don't have the headwind for gross margin anymore? Right. Moving ahead, you’re going to see a little bit of drop in gross margin and it’s going to be spent on the product mix as well as the type of SoCs, so we do have 4K and we do have HD generally speaking. Well, the 4K streaming devices are going to be the majority of our volume. We don't really break that down into exact portions, but that's going to be the majority. We don't break it down that way. We basically, we look at it internally in several different ways, but externally, we're not breaking it down right now in those segmentations. Okay, thank you. So my last question would be, when would you expect initial 4K TV cable content to be available and what's your expectation for the 4K TV growth this year? Well, there is the rollout of the WAD [ph] content that's already happening by Netflix and then it's going to continue to move to WAD from the major carriers and then it's going to move from that to where - it probably is not going to be this year that you’re going to see any street programming, as you will still see WAD. There won't be until next year you start seeing - that you start seeing the regular program TV. Oh, we expect handsome growth this year in 4K. I think if you look at the signs that are being projected, indicators from people like VIZIO and other people participating, there is definite growth in 4K going on, large growth. Good evening, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question. Couple of questions on Z-Wave. First of all, wanted to get an update on the do-it-yourself channel. I know it's been more of a slower ramp in the past few quarters, so if you can provide any details on any of the development for new engagements that you have and also if you can share a little bit more color - you’re engaged with a major Chinese telco with new rollouts for Z-Wave, so wanted to understand the nature of this rollouts, whether it’s regional and what type of expectations for growth we have in China in the current fiscal year? Does this entire question relate to Z-Wave? Okay. So do-it-yourself, that first part of the question that relates to the Z-Wave question, right. Yeah. So the do-it-yourself channel is continuing to grow. We get good sellthrough from Amazon and some other retailers. It's starting to increase fully overtime, but we don't expect to get a big kick out of that until towards the end of this year, when some of the big consumer initiatives come out from people like Apple, Amazon, Google, et cetera and I think that's really going to spark much more consumer interest and awareness. And then your second question relating to China, would you kind of rephrase that? Sure. Yeah. I wanted to understand the nature of the rollouts with the major Chinese telco, whether these are regional deployments or more of a countrywide type of effort and what are the growth expectations that you have for China in this current fiscal year? Okay. So interesting, we have three major carriers in China that are going to be rolling out the product. It's going to be countrywide, it's not regional at all. They have different goals with their rollouts, but it's going to go all the way across China and the type of dynamic there is that we’re seeing generally a very aggressive tone by the Chinese manufacturers and Asians that we’re dealing with, but we’re being very conservative in our expectations the way we’re baking this in. So this is something that, this could go very big this year or it could be modest, but we’re betting that the rollouts are going to contribute greatly in the second half. Okay. And then one last question for me on Bretelon. And more so I guess for the investment community, if you can give us just your read on why your solution is better than other competitive technologies out there such as LoRa or SigFox? What gives you confidence, I’m a big believer in Z-Wave, but I want to hear it from you as well as Bretelon how - what should investment communities be excited about? We’re extremely excited about it. We’ve been putting together our rollout materials and getting prepared to let the market know about it. This is going to be kind of a groundbreaker in terms of the ability to take the only ubiquitous cellular network that's available, which is LTE CAT 3 and produce the kind of low-power profile that allows it to be used for any applications where people are tracking our telemetry and additional apps. So we see this as a huge differentiator. We’ll be able to match costs with anybody, we will be able to provide features that are differential, the GPS location abilities we have are superior to what other people have. We have a lot of positives in this thing, and moreover the entire infrastructure of this product is built on top of a cloud platform. So it’s naturally scalable, the network is scalable, the platform is scalable. This thing was built to go out into the high hundreds of millions. So this is differential to, there are products from Sequence and Alter and other things that did not think that they approached it from a standpoint of let’s just take an LTE transceiver chip and turn it into an IoT offering. This was designed from scratch to be an IoT offering. And that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I’d now like to turn the call back over to Ken Lowe for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you. We’d like to thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you again when we report our first quarter financial results in early June. Thank you.
