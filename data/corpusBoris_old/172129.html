Unilife's (UNIS) CEO Alan Shortall on Q4 2015 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Unilife Corporation Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you.

These financial measures are included for the benefit of investors and should be considered in addition to and not instead of GAAP measures. With nothing further, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Alan Shortall, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Unilife Corporation. Alan, the floor is yours. Thank you, Todd. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Joining me on this call is Dr. Ramin Mojdeh, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and David Hastings, our Chief Financial Officer. On this call, we want to emphasize four key things. One, with the development of our Imperium platform of insulin patch pumps announced last month, we now have a full portfolio of products and capabilities to serve customers across all target market segments. By completing the development stage of our strategy, we can now focus our resources entirely on the customization and commercialization of existing products under current and prospective customer supply agreements. This will result in a significant reduction in our operating expenses in fiscal 2016, particularly when compared to the annualized run rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Two, this cost reduction and realignment will enable us to dedicate resources to support customer ramp schedules under existing supply agreements, and enter into additional strategic relationships that represent attractive opportunities for growth. Active programs and discussions with all previously disclosed strategic customers are moving forward. Three, cash receipts during fiscal 2016 are expected to remain lumpy due to the milestone based nature of these existing programs, and the timing as to when additional upcoming agreements are formalized. While there is potential to receive upfront or exclusivity fees associated with some of these upcoming agreements, we expect that existing and future customization programs will continue to represent the majority of our cash receipts this fiscal year. Product shipments from device platforms including prefilled syringes and wearable injectors will gradually increase this fiscal year to support customer timelines for commercial rollout and clinical drug trials, and become more meaningful as programs advance through the start of fiscal 2017 and beyond. Four, in addition to cash receipts from existing and prospective customers, we have a number of other options available to manage our cash position, including a previously disclosed equity line and an ATM program. And as we've recently announced in response to third party initiated expressions of interest, we have engaged Morgan Stanley to conduct a review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. This review may result in the acquisition of our Company, a strategic investment with one or more parties, and or the licensing of one or more of our proprietary technologies. We cannot provide any commitment regarding plan or if this review process will result in any type of transaction, and we are continuing to operate our business as normal during this review process. We continue execute to existing customer program. For our prefilled syringes, we continue to scale up our production capacities to support the commercial ramp schedules of exiting customers including Sanofi and Hikma. For our wearable injectors, we are preparing to commence product shipments to support customer requirements including clinical trials. We believe we continue to lead the market for wearable injectors with users' studies and other customer driven evaluations confirming the superiority of our technology. While each new agreement takes significant time and resources by both Unilife and the customer to formulize, I am pleased with the status of our pipeline. In particular, I am pleased to provide the following update regarding our relationships with AbbVie. The exclusivity period for the parties to form and enter into a mutually agreeable development and supply agreement for access to the Unifill Finesse prefilled syringe and the LISA reusable auto injector for target therapies within AbbVie's drug portfolio for the treatment of auto immune diseases continues. And the parties are also working on a development and supply agreement for other Unilife drug delivery systems, the relationship between Unilife and AbbVie continues to be strong. I'd now like to hand the call over to Dave Hastings to run through our financial results and outline how today's resource reduction and alignment activities will impact our financial performance. Thanks, Alan. Good afternoon, everybody. I'll review some of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 financial results. And then give some color on our cost reductions initiative announced today. Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 and for the fiscal year 2015 was $3.5 million and $13.2 million. This compares to revenue in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2014 and for the fiscal year 2014 of $6.5 million and $14.7 million. For our most important financial metric, cash receipts from customers for the fiscal year 2015 was $22.7 million compared to cash receipts from customers of $23.7 million for the fiscal year 2014. Deferred revenue increased to $22.5 million as of June 30, 2015 from $13.3 million on June 30, 2014. Now for my operating expense discussion, the numbers are for the fiscal year and quarter and exclude share based compensation and depreciation expense. Research and development expense for the fourth quarter of 2015 and for the year was $15.5 million and $48.7 million. This compares to research and development expense in the fourth quarter of 2014 and for the year 2014 of $11.3 million and $31million. The increase in R&D expense in 2015 compared to 2014 reflects the additional investment we made to complete the development of new products including Imperium. Selling, general and administrative expense for the fourth quarter of 2015 and for the year 2015 was $7 million and $28.1 million. This compares to selling, general and administrative expense in the fourth quarter of 2014 and for the year 2014 of $7.2 million and $22.7 million. We had $14.7 million in total cash and cash equivalent including restricted cash of $2.4 million as of June 30, 2015. As we announced earlier today and mentioned by Alan in his opening remarks, we've now developed a full and complete product portfolio. R&D investment moving forward of the allocated either to existing customer programs or to support the formulization of additional supply agreements. Now to compliment this new commercialization phase of our business strategy, we've implemented the cost reduction and business realignment initiative effective today. As a result, we've reduced our workforce by approximately 50 employees, or approximately 17% of our workforce. Additionally, we've carefully streamlined operation throughout the company to allocate resources towards current programs and anticipated perspective customer collaboration. We expect that as a result of this initiative, R&D expense in fiscal 2016 is anticipated to decrease by 25% to 30% and SG&A expense by approximately 20% compared to the annualized run rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. Importantly, these reductions for operating expenses will start to have effect beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Now these comparison exclude share based compensation and depreciation expense. As a result of this initiative, we expect to record a charge of approximately $400,000 for severance and related cost in the first quarter of 2016. Now parallel with these measures to reduce our costs, we've a number of opportunities to strengthen our cash position. We continue to be in an ongoing discussion with various pharmaceutical companies who are seeking access to product from our portfolio. And should be finalized additional customer agreement, they will generate cash receipts that will be incremental to the cash already scheduled to be received under existing programs. Additionally, as we announced previously, we have put in place an after market facility with Cantor Fitzgerald and an equity line with Lincoln Park Capital. Thank you, Dave. Now that we've reached this commercialization stage of our strategy, we are fully focused on delivering value for customers and shareholders. But before we turn the call over to questions, I'd like to thank and recognize the members of our team who are adversely affected by the reduction in our workforce. This is a high quality and very talented group of professionals who made a great contribution to the success of Unilife. We are sorry to see them go and we wish them much continued success in their future endeavors. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, Alan, I am wondering if you could provide any additional color on AbbVie. You provided an update saying that the exclusivity period continues. Can you give us a sense of any -- any sense of timing on that or what your goals are for that interaction over the next 12 months? Thank you, Charles. Look, as I've said in the past and more generally, one of our challenges as a business is that we often have lots of great things that are going on and for reasons of clients commercial sensitivity, we are not authorized to say more about that. And with respect to AbbVie, I can only repeat what we've been authorized to say at this time and that is the exclusivity period for the parties to form and enter into a mutually agreeable development and supply agreement for access to the Unifill Finesse prefilled syringe and LISA reusable auto injector for target therapies within AbbVie's drug portfolio for the treatment of autoimmune diseases continues. And the parties are also working on the development of supply agreement for other Unilife drug delivery systems. The ratio between Unilife and AbbVie continues to be strong. So we are obviously we are very delighted to be working with such an important biotech company, and we are very pleased that this relationship continues to be strong. And other than that, Charles, I have just not have liberty to say any more this time but as appropriate we will and have further updates in the future. Okay. That's helpful, Alan. And I certainly understand the current situation with perspective collaborator. I am wondering if there are any industry standard or benchmarks or anything along those line say 12 months or 18 months evaluation period that you might be able to point to that might be used as guide or would you just prefer to let it lie at this point. Well, look, I can't be fair to because every situation is different with every customer and every collaboration. What I can say is one of the things is we are doing something the base of the innovative is ever done before. And that is coming up with very innovative differentiates injectable delivery system that enable our customers to differentiate against their competitors and to drive physician and patient preference. You start to look at the supply agreement that we've already put in place, 10 and 15 years supply agreements, now if you take the Sanofi wearable injector where Sanofi have committed for 15 years exclusively to use our wearable injectors, there is no template of cookie cutter type of deal. So unfortunately I can't give you a timing and relation to them. But obviously it is challenging for us and is challenging for our shareholders. And we will continue to push as much as we can to get as much of the really positive things that are happening within our business into the market. And often times I feel like our hands are tied behind our back but we got to look at the long-term value ability of our shareholders and respect our customers' requirements for the commercial sensitivity of these programs for them, and that's how we will build long-term really profitable relationships for our shareholders. And it is challenging and I understand it is difficult for our shareholders as well. No worries. I appreciate the sensitivity. One quick question on Imperium, pretty interesting innovation here recently announced. I'm wondering if you could provide any color on early perspective collaborate or response to that platform. Charles, all I could say is again Imperium we believe is game changing technology for insulin delivery. It would provide our partner the insulin provider or device provider, the first complete therapeutic solution for the delivery of insulin in one delivery system at a very competitive price. And allow them to target Type 2 diabetic particularly the uncontrolled diabetics and that are not managing these very well. It is so simple and easy to use. When I say it really talk about the collaboration, I would say you could pretty much look across the Board of the key players within insulin and also slightly outside of that because of the opportunity it creates. We are working on a number of parties in that arena and typically we've been -- it has been recognized with the parties we are speaking to, as it is game changing. To the extent that in fact some of those parties have actually completed or carried out extensive due diligence and reiterate to fact towards that they believe that this game changing technology. And could we see any additional feasibility with regard to collaborations perhaps in the next 12 months or is that to be seen? I think in terms of timing that would be very reasonable. And obviously with such an impactful category of delivery system with an insulin which is very valuable therapeutic class. We want to maximize the revalue of this for our shareholders but also we are also conscious that with Imperium if any many ways could flip the switch for us in terms of -- and not only cash input of the company and otherwise but recognition within the marketplace. So consequently in those discussions we are always conscious of potentially looking at trade off but it short to medium term gain and not necessarily compromising too much in the longer term. That's something that we are constantly reviewing as a management team and we have a lot of confidence in Imperium making a re-contribution to this business going forward. Hi, gentlemen. Can you hear me, okay? Okay so could we talk about -- it sounds like your headcounts going from about 270 to 220 and they will occur as far as the income statement under Q2. Yes. The headcount will end up somewhere approximately on 250 people, Jeff. And yes the impact really begins at the end of October when the severance period is over. Okay. So with the reduction numbers that you specify could you give us an indication of what areas that is coming from, is it mostly R&D? Yes. The impact really is felt in the R&D organization and really, Jeff, it was to really put our imprint on the realignment in terms of where the company is from an evolution perspective. So R&D was the primary focus as we now really trying to transition from building out the product portfolio which we feel is quite robust but complete into commercialization phase and exploiting that technology for our customers. Okay, great. And then when you talk about percent reductions 25% to 30% and greater than 20% for SG&A, you are referring to the annualized nine digit run rate of OpEx from the fourth quarter? Yes. So simply if you just look at our financial charts and take the Q4 R&D and SG&A number and annualize that and we are expecting somewhere between 25% and 30% of the R&D run rate and about 20% of the SG&A run rate. Okay. And Q4 share count was 131,976, so could you give us an indication what the current share count is approximately? 136,000 now and then could you talk about a little bit ATM and equity line, what's existing and what's available? So as we've previously disclosed the Lincoln Park line with 45 million which we look in initial drop by 1 million, we haven't drawn anything else under that so it is 40 million available there. And that we've taken approximately 3.8 million of the ATM so there is approximately 21 million available under that one, Jeff. So OpEx you got -- we've given probably the most explosive guidance in a long time for OpEx, so that's kind of baked in now with our disclosure today, revenue, we prefer not to give guidance at this point in time as you know and as Alan mentioned, it is lumpy in nature and it's quite variable. There is some variability within our existing contracts but certainly under this development side, signing of those contracts and timing and the amount there is a little bit of unpredictability there. So I wouldn't want to give guidance around revenue or cash receipt at this time. Well, we can't do that. Yes, Jeff, I appreciate the question. We can't do that because we are still in the quarter. Obviously, we are focused on cash; it is an important component from a financial metric perspective. I can say is what we have the equity line in place. We have the ATM in place. And we have existing customer contracts that will generate baseline amount of cash receipt for the company. And we are doggedly pursuing other deals. So there are avenues to generate cash and we are aggressively pursuing those. Jeff, If I can just add to that in terms of potential exclusivity fees to my prepared statement I spoke off, and also with the Imperium and we are focusing as Dave said and chasing down those deals, another deals as well which can actually contribute quite a bit. Okay. And we will see 4c filing as far as cash position through the quarter in September in a few weeks. Hi, thanks for the taking my question. I was just wondering if you might be able to give us some guidance as to what your capital expenditure budget is for this fiscal year. And I think Keith, sorry, as you know that, if I can add to tha as well, one thing has become apparent in some of the actual supply contacts that we are currently in negotiations with, it is quite apparent now that it seems to be consistency within that, that many of our customers as part of the deal are anticipating that they would actually buy the capital equipment, so in order for them to have dedicated line particularly where we've got customized delivery systems. So as we go forward I think you find that will be more general methodology of funding our CapEx as part of those supplies agreements going forward. That sounds like basically an offset so you are actually cash utilization in a sense is going to be reduced by a like amount. Well, in term of -- we believe that would start to form somewhat nearly standard within the supply agreement as you see them coming forward. And I can make that comment with a level of confidence because of current discussions and negotiations that is going on. So I think it is going to workout very favorably for our shareholders and also for our business. And I think the market will start to see that as these pharmaceutical partners are investing in that CapEx. And not only is that a contractual obligation but it is a very strong indication of their commitment to the program going forward for 10 or 15 years. Yes. That's very -- appreciate that. I know that you were building out bricks and motors in terms of physical plant expansion last fiscal year. Are you nearly completed with that portion of the -- under the CapEx then or -- Hello, Keith. This is Ramin. Yes, we are nearing the end of that project and we anticipate that's going to be completed shortly. Fantastic, okay. And I am just wondering if you might be able to provide a little bit of information about where you are with respect to the strategic partnering that you are working on with Morgan Stanley and if you could perhaps talk a little bit about when you might think that you come to a conclusion. Keith, couple of things, as I said in my earlier comments in response to the third party initiated expression of interest and it was initiated by third parties. We have engaged Morgan Stanley to conduct that review of the strategic alternatives. And our expectation is that this process -- it will drive, we believe it will drive shareholder value. We are obviously not able to comment further but on a slightly different topic going back to your previous question to some extent. In one of the challenges for us in the business is this commercial sensitivity of programs with our customers and partners, and we've spoken to this before but in many over time as I said earlier it is a bit like having our hands tied behind our back. We've got a number of very exciting programs running that are generating a cash receipt for customers. In fact, we completed a supply agreement recently for a highly anticipated late phase biologic and we just can't talk about it. I mean we are just not able to say anything about it because it damage -- potential of damaging the relationship. And as a management we got to make that decision which is challenging. Do we damage the relationship beyond repair possibly or do we focus on the basis of, it will come into the public arena as we go forward. And we've got a number of those programs that are really very exciting, we are very confident with those programs and that they are moving forward very well for us. But that's just difficult; we can't say anything more than that. I understand. I appreciate that. If I could add one question remaining to that. Would it be reasonable to think that you and your partners will be willing to and able to put up and sort of press release related to initiation of a clinical trial that involve one of your device and standard drug of one of your customer since that kind of trial I would imagine would be posted to clinical trial.gov and therefore would be public knowledge. Yes, Keith, as you know, customers do announce their clinical trials and whether they announced the device that goes with the drug or not varies depending on what clinical trial it is. So I can't really speak for them, what their plans are. With respect to us making announcements, we would certainly work with our customers and if we are able to gain their agreement to disclose any pertinent information at the appropriate time, we will absolutely do so. But at the end of the day we are balancing all these different requirements by our customers and by our shareholders. And we will just have to see on a case by case what will be the best that we can do separately from what the customer might disclose in their publicly stated clinical trial information. Hi, good afternoon. Wonder if could just ask a little bit about the commentary you made on commercial sales, commercial product being sent to customers, I think in the release you noted that you expect to receive some in 2016 and that just start to get more meaningful in 2017. I am curious which of the projects will start to generate commercial sales over the next couple of quarters here in 2016 and then as we move into 2017 which do you expect will start to get more meaningful? Sure, Raj. Certainly I can't really comment specifically on customers but in general I can say that product shipments from device platforms including prefilled syringes and wearable injectors and in fact other devices as well will gradually increase in this fiscal year. And these sales are to support customer timelines for their commercial rollout and clinical drug trial. And the sales will become more meaningful as these programs advance. We anticipate these will gradually increase and become more meaningful in 2017 and beyond. And that's fiscal 2017 that is. Okay. But if you just think about the piece relative to commercial sales, the commercial programs whether it is Sanofi or Hikma or some of the one that have been announced for couple years now where your partners taking product from you and then ultimately selling into the marketplace. Are those getting close to market? I would imagine that those partners would need to give you a fair amount of lead time as they are expecting to take product and then sell it -- and ultimately sell it. Yes. Certainly, Raj, again we will not comment on one specific customers, they go to market with their drugs and our devices but we can certainly tell you that we continue to scale up our production capacities according to plan. And we are pleased with where we are with all these different programs and hopefully in the future we can provide additional update as the sales increase and you will see these products in the market from our customers. And Raj I'd like add to that. We do have insight in terms of what those rollout plans in many occasions are. But it is as Ramin said commercially sensitive to customer. And it is very hard to expand on those without actually breaking that commercial sensitivity requirement. Okay. May I could ask how much lead time typically -- and I am speaking now of commercial sales and not product for clinical trials but actual commercial sales for customers. How much lead time do you typically have on those or will you have on some of those deliveries? So, Raj, in general as you recall probably for the last couple of years, we've always said that typically takes about two to three years from the time that you start a deal until you see a commercial sales. This is something we've said and it is not specific number but it is really an average across a number of different programs and/ or sense about these programs and the length of time that it takes for our customers to develop what they need to develop and the regulatory process that is involved. So typically that's a number give or take 6 or 12 months depending on the program and by the way this is only for drugs that are commercial. And then for those drugs that are pipeline drugs, obviously there might be additional time that the approval of the drug will take. So having said that if you look at the first agreement that we signed with --which was one of the first agreement of the one that you mentioned is the Sanofi Finesse agreement which was in fiscal year 2014. We just started fiscal year 2016, so we are well within that timeline that we mentioned. And we are hoping that we are nearing the end of that and hopefully pretty soon you are going to see the outcome of that on the market. And again our programs are going very well. And we are very pleased with the status of them and I think all those timelines that we mentioned in terms of approximations still hold and apply and we are well within those timelines. Raj, I'd like to add to that as well if I can is that, that timing I believe we've clearly said that's between two to three years. That the benefit we get from that is once a progressive customers commit to our delivery systems that are unique it is for that reason and the timing that the benefit we get as a trade-off is the 10 or 15 years supply agreements, so typical as it is and maybe a bit painful for the shareholders and challenging for us as management team and you as a analyst, that two to three years timeline the benefit is that recurring particular revenue with some of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world for the next 10 or 15 years. And longer term I think that's going to be a very valuable trade off. No. I don't disagree that but it is just the -- as you have noted and you are still not expecting to really generate those commercial sales until late this fiscal year and into next year. So it is still going to be a period of time before you start to appreciate those -- and in the meantime there is just very little visibility in terms of either inventory is increasing for you or anything we can look at that which suggest that those commercial sales are imminent. It just doesn't appear that they are. I guess we just leave it there. Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue at this time. I'll turn the call back over for closing remarks. Thank you, operator. And I also want to thank the long-term investors for their continued support at this time. I believe the fundamentals of our business remains strong. And we look forward to keeping you updated and getting as much information on these exciting customer programs out as quickly as we can and as we execute to our strategy for the longer-term growth. So thank you for joining us today. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.
