European Central Bank Finally Unleashes The Correct Monetary Policy | Seeking Alpha ECB has announced yet more QE for the eurozone. This is the right thing to be doing. The pity is they didn't do this 5 and 6 years ago. Mario Draghi of the European Central Bank has announced that said ECB is finally doing to so some seriously sensible monetary policy. This doesn't mean the end of the eurozone's economic worries, of course not, but it is at least the end of monetary policy being a hindrance to the end of such problems. As a result of the announcement financial asset prices bounced and the euro fell: just what we would want to happen anyway. The ECB announced six steps, cutting all of its key interest rates and increasing its monthly bond purchases under its asset-buying program. It also announced a new program of cheap loans for banks that it hopes will be passed on to businesses and households, as well as its intention to buy bonds issued by nonfinancial companies. The euro sank a full cent against the dollar to a one-week low of $1.0863 per dollar from around $1.0970 before the announcement. It also fell by more than half a percent against the Swiss franc, yen and sterling. German Bunds rallied, with futures hitting the day's highs at 163.00 and 10-year yields down 5 basis points to 0.19 percent. Shares surged too, with the FTSEurofirst 300 index jumping 2.5 percent to add to the 13 percent it has gained over the last month. The euro zone blue-chip index soared 3.6 percent, with banking stocks among the strongest gainers. This is all just as we would hope it would be. The basic economic problem within Europe has been that we've got two different forms of economic policy, fiscal and monetary. Either works: either can boost demand or constrict it according to the state of the economy under consideration and what we want to do to it (or it to do perhaps). And the eurozone has definitely been having a problem with deficient aggregate demand so a looser fiscal policy and or a looser monetary policy could aid what ails. However, we've also had two pernicious problems. The first being that the continent is overcome with a very strange insistence upon fiscal rectitude. This might actually be sensible for Greece, which really did go bust, Portugal and Ireland which nearly did and so on. But however much or little you like Keynesian economics the idea that the greatest recession of the past 50 years should be met by people not being allowed to run budget deficits of any size is, well, it's odd. Fiscal policy has been out. Which is fine, monetary policy can take up the slack. Except we've also had this strange insistence that we shouldn't be doing quantitative easing, the only monetary policy that really works when interest rates are at zero. Actually, it's been worse than that as the ECB has only just lowered interest rates, all of them, to that zero. So despite not being able to use fiscal policy we've also been having a monetary policy that is simply too tight. Today's announcement means that we now at least have a sensible monetary policy even if fiscal is still up that creek sans paddle. and thus of course the reaction of the markets. That reaction of the markets being useful as that's how it all will work. The euro falls, that makes imports more expensive (and lowers the volume of them) exports cheaper for foreigners (and increases the amount of them). Thus is aggregate demand within the eurozone boosted. We also deliberately want to drive up asset prices. Because when that happens then people will move out further along the risk curve in search of yield. That means more investment in more marginal projects and thus another boost to demand. Higher asset prices isn't a fault of QE, it's the point. So, the end result here is that the eurozone should do better as a result of today's announcement. How much better financial assets do in the short term depends upon how much everyone believes the ECB is really committed. Leaving us with our important questions: why didn't they do this years ago? The answer to that sadly being politics. For in the short term politics does trump economics, however much we might wish that it didn't. In the long of course even politics has to succumb to the real world but there can be an awful lot of pain before it does.
