Government Sector Needs To Contract For Strong Growth | Seeking Alpha Government expenditure as a percentage of GDP remains marginally above 35% for the US and I believe that government spending needs to be curbed. The private sector is the dynamic sector of the economy and should expand with the contraction of the government sector for strong and sustainable GDP growth. If the current government spending trend continues, debt will swell and this will be negative for the household and private sector with higher national debt burden on individuals. In one of her recent speeches , Janet L. Yellen had the following to say: While the overall level of real activity now appears to be much closer to its potential than it was a year or two ago, the economy in an "underlying" sense remains quite weak by historical standards, for the simple reason that the increases in hiring and output that have been achieved thus far have required exceptionally low levels of short- and longer-term interest rates, reflecting a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy. Interest rates have been, and remain, very low, and if underlying conditions had truly returned to normal, the economy should be booming. I am in complete agreement with Yellen's view and the money velocity that continues to trend lower is just one of the indicators of a weak underlying economy. Way back in 2009, I had written an article on the "Diminishing Impact of Debt on GDP Growth" and the points discussed in the article are relevant even today. The article also pointed to weak economic growth even when debt continues to swell. The reason for discussing these data at the onset is to underscores the point that real economic growth remains weak and headline GDP growth or headline unemployment numbers do not actually reflect the real economic scenario. In my view, the private sector is the dynamic sector of the economy and if the real economy needs to expand at a robust pace, the private sector needs to expand and the government sector needs to shrink. However, as the chart below shows, the government sector expenditure as a percentage of GDP has remained above 35% during the period 1995 and 2013. I am looking at relatively recent data as US government debt started to expand from 1980 and the government debt still continues to swell. Readers will argue that government expenditure as a percentage of GDP has remained largely the same in 2013 as compared to 1995. However, a more critical part of the government expenditure discussion comes from the chart below that gives the government's social expenditure as a percentage of GDP for 1995 and 2013. Social expenditure as a percentage of GDP has increased from 15% in 1995 to marginally over 20% in 2013. With the CBO estimating deficits of $7.2 trillion over the next 10 years, continued increase in social expenditure (as a percentage of GDP) will continue to have a negative impact on the real economy. If the debt and debt servicing burden for the government increases in the coming years, it is entirely likely that individual and corporate tax rates will be increased in order to keep deficits in control. This will negative impact corporate as well as household spending. Therefore, government expenditure needs to be controlled in the coming years if the policymakers want to avoid continued sluggish GDP growth. This is especially true in a scenario where a significant portion of the government expenditure does not provide an incremental impact to the long-term GDP growth trajectory. Even if the social consumption expenditure boosts the overall consumption basket of the GDP, it is a near-term impact that is associated with swelling government debt that has negative long-term implications. When viewing all these points from an investment perspective, I am of the opinion that the swelling of government debt in the coming years will translate into higher global liquidity and I am also of the opinion that with high government spending as a percentage of GDP, the QE will continue in some way or the other. This will help equities (NYSEARCA: SPY ) trend higher over the long-term. I would also remain invested in sectors where government spending will continue and it includes the healthcare and the defence sector. The Vanguard Healthcare ETF (NYSEARCA: VHT ) and the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSEARCA: ITA ) are good investment options in the respective sectors. In conclusion, the financial crisis of 2008-09 necessitated an increase in government spending in order to stabilize the economy. While that job is done, the government sectors needs to contract and the private sector needs to expand if robust GDP growth has to come over the next few years. It would be best for the government sector to create a favorable environment for the private sector with favorable policies in sectors such as infrastructure and manufacturing.
