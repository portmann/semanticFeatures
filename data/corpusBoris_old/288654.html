UPDATE 1-Russia seeks spending cuts to ready for low oil price era | Reuters Related: Currencies, Bonds, Markets, Financials MOSCOW Jan 13 Russia will need to take hard decisions about government spending to prepare for a period of possibly prolonged low oil prices and an era of "new realities," Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Wednesday. Siluanov warned the budget would only balance at an oil price of $82 per barrel, well in excess of the $50 per barrel assumption used for this year's calculations, let alone the $30 per barrel it is currently trading near. Although he said oil prices could start to recover in the second half of the year, he told the annual Gaidar Forum in Moscow that the average oil price set in the 2016 budget should be revised down to $40 per barrel. "Our task is to adapt our budget to the new realities," Siluanov said. "Our budget will be balanced when the price is $82 per barrel so there are still a lot of decisions to be made when it comes to budget policy." He said last year's budget deficit was around 2.6 percent of gross domestic product, slightly less than forecast. But that did not mean Russia had adapted to low oil prices, he warned. This year's budget envisages a deficit of 3 percent of GDP, but that assumes the oil price will average $50 per barrel - a level that now looks optimistic. Siluanov said the first steps towards adjusting spending had been taken, after the government ordered ministries to find 10 percent cuts in "non-protected items" of expenditure. Officials earlier told Reuters that the planned cuts had been approved by the government last month, but would exclude areas such as public sector pay and pensions. The finance ministry, which typically emphasises the need for fiscal caution, is likely to face resistance to spending cuts from other government departments as it did last year. Speaking at the same conference, Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev also warned that Russia needed to brace for a long period of low commodity prices. "I am convinced that the period of low commodity prices will be protracted," Ulyukayev said. "One needs to fear that there will be (an oil price) of $20 or $15. By the logic of markets the bigger the fall today the larger the rebound tomorrow, and this isn't the biggest risk. "The biggest risk is that there will be low prices for a long time: that is for years, for decades."
