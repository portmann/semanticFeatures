MCBC Holdings - Investors, Hold On To Your Hats - MasterCraft (NASDAQ:MCFT) | Seeking Alpha MCBC Holdings sells MasterCraft-branded sports boats, and has seen strong growth post 2008-recession. The company faces significant risks from a heavily cyclical industry, but market share gains may offset any downturns or slow downs. MCBC Holdings (NASDAQ: MCFT ) manufacturers performance sports boats under the MasterCraft brand. The company is preparing to make its IPO and raise about $75 million in net proceeds. The market for performance sports boats has also been on a tear over the past few years, but shows signs of being heavily cyclical. The company has significantly widened gross margins over the past few years backed by steady revenue growth. The current IPO price range and valuation presents a great opportunity for early investors. The performance sport boat segment of the boating market has been on a rapid growth trend. Growth has largely been driven by two factors. First, growth in the overall boating market has driven some of that growth. Second, PSB has made large gains in overall market share. Since 2011, sales have increased by over 40%, and market share has increased by over 50%. The largest obstacle to future growth is the cyclical nature of the market. During economic downturns not only do boaters stop buying boats, but they also stop participating all together likely due to the high costs like fuel associated with the activity. The good news for PSB is even if market growth slows, the trend in market share signals potentially less volatility than the overall market. MCDC has recorded very strong improvement in financial performance over the past few years. The company recorded sales growth of 29% from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2014. The more impressive statistic is the 144% growth in gross profit over the same time period. Gross margin grew from 11% in fiscal year 2012 to 21% in fiscal year 2014. The company ended fiscal year 2014 with almost $20 million in net profit. Results through the first three quarters of fiscal year 2015 are largely unrevealing. The company posted a large income tax benefit during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. If the performance is not replicated, profits would shrink considerably. The company currently faces a considerable amount of debt and contractual obligations. Within the next year the company owes $15 million in obligations, but has only posted $3 million in profits during the previous 3 quarters combined. The company plans to use IPO proceeds to repay a large share of senior debt notes. The repayment will also improve cash flows for MCDC by substantially reducing interest expenses. Based on the proposed IPO price range, MCDC is eyeing a $250 million market valuation. The valuation implies a PE ratio of 13.2 based on fiscal year 2014 results. Additionally, based on fiscal year 2014 sales, the resulting price-to-sales multiple is 1.4. The valuation appear to be in line with comparable peers' valuations. The peer group average a slightly lower price to sales multiple, but is likely on pace with MCDC fiscal year 2015 sales. Additionally fiscal year 2015 earnings will be very telling. If the company doesn't record the same tax benefit as the previous year the PE ratio could increase dramatically. The boating industry is extremely cyclical, and this is only amplified by the $50 thousand to $150 thousand price range in the performance sport boat market. An economic slow down either in the U.S. or abroad could threaten current growth trends and profitability. Additionally, part of MCDC's strong performance in 2014 was hinged on a tax benefit, this performance may not be replicated. MCDC looks like a solid investment. It comes with a few key risks, which will need to be continually evaluates. However at the current valuation and given the strength of the MasterCraft brand, investors can expect a short-term price boost.
