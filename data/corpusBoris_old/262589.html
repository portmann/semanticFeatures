Everyone agrees – other than ISIS and a handful of crazies – that we have to stop the epidemic of mass shootings  ( mass shootings have skyrocketed under Obama ; 5 of the 12 deadliest mass shootings in history took place during Obama’s first term alone). President Obama plans to introduce – through executive action – a gun ban on those on no-fly lists.   So does the governor of Connecticut . But as Daily Beast points out, in an article called “ My Fellow LIBERALS, DON’T Support Obama’s Terror Watch List Gun Ban “: As Americans we understand well how important due process is. No one, for instance, should be thrown in jail just on the say-so of some government official who declares they deserve it. Such is the behavior of tyrants, the Founding Fathers understood, and so we enshrined in our Constitution the right to counsel, the right against being compelled to testify against oneself, the right to trial by jury, etc.All of these rights are checks to ensure the government can’t simply pluck innocent people out of their lives and strip them of their life, liberty, or property. Only after fairly testing the charges against them can the government punish people with such deprivation. But none of these hurdles must be overcome for the government to put someone on a list, especially not a list like this, which is a watch list. It is a list of people that for whatever reason (a reason that no one outside the government knows) the government has decided deserve closer scrutiny of their actions. Is the government right to be concerned about these people? Maybe yes, but maybe not, and there is no way for ordinary citizens to know. Which means there is also no way for ordinary citizens to know whether any of them, even people who in no way intend to commit acts of terrorism, are also on that list. In other words, there is no way to know whether you are on that list. Nor is there any way to know how to get off it. That there is any list at all should give us all pause. It has not historically been the hallmark of a healthy democracy when governments have kept lists of people they didn’t like. It is hard to be a government of the people, by the people, and for the people when the government keeps track of the people, including those dissidents who would challenge it (which is something that in a democracy they are allowed, and even supposed, to do). What this proposal calls for is the government using the list as a basis to deny the people on it a right to which they were otherwise entitled. Based on the plain text of the Second Amendment and subsequent jurisprudence it is clear that some right is in there somewhere, and what this proposal calls for is for the government to arbitrarily and un-transparently deny this right to certain people without any sort of the due process ordinarily required. And that’s a problem. With this proposal we would be authorizing the government to act capriciously and unaccountably for any reason, including—and this point cannot be emphasized enough—bad reasons or no reasons at all, and against anyone, including—and this point cannot be emphasized enough, either—people just like you. There would also be no reason why, if the government could take away this right this way today, it couldn’t take away other rights you depend on having tomorrow the same way. Liberal journalists Jeremy Scahill and Ryan Devereaux document : The Obama administration has quietly approved a substantial expansion of the terrorist watchlist system, authorizing a secret process that requires neither “concrete facts” nor “irrefutable evidence” to designate an American or foreigner as a terrorist, according to a key government document obtained by The Intercept. The “March 2013 Watchlisting Guidance,” a 166-page document issued last year by the National Counterterrorism Center, spells out the government’s secret rules for putting individuals on its main terrorist database, as well as the no fly list and the selectee list, which triggers enhanced screening at airports and border crossings. The new guidelines allow individuals to be designated as representatives of terror organizations without any evidence they are actually connected to such organizations, and it gives a single White House official the unilateral authority to place entire “categories” of people the government is tracking onto the no fly and selectee lists. It broadens the authority of government officials to “nominate” people to the watchlists based on what is vaguely described as “fragmentary information.” The document’s definition of “terrorist” activity includes actions that fall far short of bombing or hijacking. In addition to expected crimes, such as assassination or hostage-taking, the guidelines also define destruction of government property and damaging computers used by financial institutions as activities meriting placement on a list. They also define as terrorism any act that is “ dangerous ” to property and intended to influence government policy through intimidation. This combination—a broad definition of what constitutes terrorism and a low threshold for designating someone a terrorist—opens the way to ensnaring innocent people in secret government dragnets. It can also be counterproductive. When resources are devoted to tracking people who are not genuine risks to national security, the actual threats get fewer resources—and might go unnoticed. “If reasonable suspicion is the only standard you need to label somebody, then it’s a slippery slope we’re sliding down here, because then you can label anybody anything,” says David Gomez, a former senior FBI special agent with experience running high-profile terrorism investigations. “Because you appear on a telephone list of somebody doesn’t make you a terrorist. That’s the kind of information that gets put in there.” In 2004, [liberal] Sen. Ted Kennedy complained that he was barred from boarding flights on five separate occasions because his name resembled the alias of a suspected terrorist. Two years later, CBS News obtained a copy of the no fly list and reported that it included [liberal] Bolivian president Evo Morales and Lebanese parliament head Nabih Berri. One of the watchlists snared Mikey Hicks, a Cub Scout who got his first of many airport pat-downs at age two. In 2007, the Justice Department’s inspector general issued a scathing report identifying “ significant weaknesses ” in the system. And in 2009, after a Nigerian terrorist was able to board a passenger flight to Detroit and nearly detonated a bomb sewn into his underwear despite his name having been placed on the TIDE list, President Obama admitted that there had been a “ systemic failure .” Bleeding heart Huffington Post noted last year: A federal judge ruled in June that the government must develop a new process under which individuals can challenge their inclusion on the no-fly list. The judge found the current process “wholly ineffective.” In fact, the rules for putting someone on the list are so weak that it’s acceptable for entire “categories” of people to be considered threats at a White House official’s choosing. Scahill told HuffPost Live . “The government will not tell you if you are on the list, but it will share its labeling of you as a ‘known or suspected terrorist’ with foreign governments and private contractors. These policies make it nearly impossible to challenge your secret designation. The American public has a right to understand the policies of what amounts to a shadow legal system.” The U.S. government’s reliance on “predictive judgments” to deprive Americans of their constitutionally protected liberties is no fiction. It’s now central to the government’s defense of its no-fly list—a secretive watch list that bans people from flying to or from the United States or over American airspace…. Worse, the U.S. government launched its predictive judgment model without offering any evidence whatsoever about its accuracy, any scientific basis or methodology that might justify it, or the extent to which it results in errors. In our case, we turned to two independent experts to evaluate the government’s predictive method: Marc Sageman, a former longtime intelligence community professional and forensic psychologist with expertise in terrorism research, and James Austin, an expert in risk assessment in the criminal justice system. Neither found any indication that the government’s predictive model even tries to use basic scientific methods to make and test its predictions. As Sageman says, despite years of research, no one inside or outside the government has devised a model that can predict with any reliability if a person will commit an act of terrorism. Because the government’s predictive model results in the blacklisting of people who are not terrorists, individuals on the no-fly list need a meaningful method of redress—a fair way to demonstrate their “innocence” of crimes they will never commit. The government refuses to provide these safeguards in its current so-called redress system, which violates the due process guarantees of the Constitution. It refuses to tell our clients all the reasons the government has for predicting future misconduct, leaving them to guess. It won’t provide the evidence underlying those reasons, including government evidence that would undermine its predictions. And it refuses to provide a hearing for our clients to press their case to a neutral decision-maker and challenge government witnesses’ hearsay or biases. Indeed, the government has a history of labeling dissident as terrorists .  Any type of criticism of the fatcats may get you labeled as a terrorist in post-9/11 America. Are any of the government’s so-called “terrorism” programs really only focused on stopping terrorism?  Of course not. Liberals might remember that George W. Bush said that “you’re either with us or against us” … and stripped Americans of many of our liberties . Another example: indefinite detention . Postscript: What does the Daily Beast article linked above mean when it says that – while liberals may dislike the Second Amendment – it’s still a Constitutional right? A top liberal Constitutional law expert explains : Like many academics, I was happy to blissfully ignore the Second Amendment. It did not fit neatly into my socially liberal agenda. It is hard to read the Second Amendment and not honestly conclude that the Framers intended gun ownership to be an individual right. It is true that the amendment begins with a reference to militias: “A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.” Accordingly, it is argued, this amendment protects the right of the militia to bear arms, not the individual. Yet, if true, the Second Amendment would be effectively declared a defunct provision. The National Guard is not a true militia in the sense of the Second Amendment and, since the District and others believe governments can ban guns entirely, the Second Amendment would be read out of existence. More important, the mere reference to a purpose of the Second Amendment does not alter the fact that an individual right is created. The right of the people to keep and bear arms is stated in the same way as the right to free speech or free press. The statement of a purpose was intended to reaffirm the power of the states and the people against the central government. At the time, many feared the federal government and its national army. Gun ownership was viewed as a deterrent against abuse by the government, which would be less likely to mess with a well-armed populace. Considering the Framers and their own traditions of hunting and self-defense, it is clear that they would have viewed such ownership as an individual right — consistent with the plain meaning of the amendment. None of this is easy for someone raised to believe that the Second Amendment was the dividing line between the enlightenment and the dark ages of American culture. Yet, it is time to honestly reconsider this amendment and admit that … here’s the really hard part … the NRA may have been right. This does not mean that Charlton Heston is the new Rosa Parks or that no restrictions can be placed on gun ownership. But it does appear that gun ownership was made a protected right by the Framers and, while we might not celebrate it, it is time that we recognize it. Fri, 12/11/2015 - 21:12 | 6913053 dchang0 Thank God there are some liberals who see the inherent problem with the lack of due process in these latest calls for gun bans. I think it is becoming more and more important to differentiate between liberals, leftists, and progressives. Each term has a specific history, context, and meaning. Even the term liberal can be divided into classical liberalism (similar to libertarianism) vs. the social liberalism that replaced it in the 20th century vs. modern liberalism of the last few decades. Each of these terms has different meanings even to different experts, so there is no consensus on what each term means. National Review has coined the term "illiberal left" as the real threat. The illiberal left advocate using gov't lethal force (sending armed cops to people's homes with or without warrants) to push their usually-progressive policies. I can only wish/hope that mainstream liberals will turn away from the leftists and return to classical liberalism, but this will probably never happen. True "live and let live" attitudes have left our politics. Yes, Millenials poll like libertarians, but they so far haven't acted in a truly libertarian fashion. We will find out if they will ever walk the talk soon enough as they continue edging out the Baby Boomers. A lot of the USA's ills could be solved just by following a few Commandments plus the Golden Rule: 1) Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. (No hypocrisy, in short.) 2) Thou shalt not steal. (No property crimes of course, PLUS no personal welfare, no corporate welfare, no gov't-entity-welfare like civil asset forfeiture, nor any bailouts.) 3) Thou shalt not bear false witness (No accusing or punishing the innocent of committing crimes someone else committed. This covers gun bans that punish innocent law abiding gun owners for crimes other violent criminals committed. It also covers these nebulous charges of racism where no racism could possibly be proven--at least not without accurate mind-reading or time travel.) 4) Thou shalt not covet... (No class warfare.) 5) Thou shalt not kill. (No use of gov't lethal force except in self-defense, i.e. no interventionist wars and no no-knock SWAT team raids flash-bombing babies in playpens, no ATF door-kickers coming to take your guns, no IRS door-kickers coming to take your money.) No, I am not of the Religious Right (Bible thumpers). In fact, I became a libertarian primarily because of the authoritarian tendencies of the Religious Right. But the Commandments still have value in that some of them absolutely would fix a lot of society's ills. The illiberal left would not be able to exist if they actually followed the Commandments and Golden Rule above...

That's obvious, but you're afraid to acknowledge it. And don't say it's all banksters. You have 300 milion guns in free circulation, so you've been content with what your banksters have been doing while you were allowed to be fed from the crumbs which fell from their table. But the table no longer have enough crumbs, so "work harder to fulfill the american dream" Fri, 12/11/2015 - 21:03 | 6913037 Midlife Rambler Gun violence today - particularly the mass shooting kind- in the US is a byproduct of the pharmaceutical industry and the failed war on drugs.

Period. End of story. There are no charges ever brought against "the accused", their rights were confiscated in the mists of a bureaucratic Star Chamber somewhere, the thieves never deigning to allow DUE PROCESS in open court to present their evidence and "the accused" never given any opportunity to refute said evidence in open court, which is of course, in itself a violation of the BoR's. This is apart & besides infringing on the "the accused" Second Amendment rights. Obama has somehow managed to attack not only the 2nd but the 5th, 14th and it's genesis in the Magna Carta (setting aside "the kings" desire for control) when he made his blanket statement of "its insane that anyone on a fly-list can buy a gun." proving once again that he's not a "constitutional law professor". Fri, 12/11/2015 - 20:00 | 6912849 LibertarianMenace Negative rights are so boring, and, um, un-proggie like anyway. We're so much more sophisticated than the Magna Carta by now. We must be-cos we're proggies!

Fri, 12/11/2015 - 19:57 | 6912840 Joebloinvestor I thinks anyone who threw a shit fit on a plane and was taken off or forced a landing can make it onto the list and fine by me. They should only not be allowed to fly, and that shouldn't have anything to do with gun ownership. Fri, 12/11/2015 - 20:46 | 6912987 Miffed Microbio... I was on a flight for 5 hours with a passenger throwing a shit fit ( could not land, we were over the pacific). The physical abuse the flight attendants took was pretty bad. Mr and four other guys made plans to subdue this guy if it escalated. Fortunately they didn't have to and everyone cheered when the cops stormed the plane and hog tied him. When you are trapped in a box with a belligerent drunk asshole with no means to defend yourself except with a flimsy plastic fork, it's fucking Hell. All of us would probably vote he be banned from flying for life. Clear cut case. Fri, 12/11/2015 - 20:18 | 6912906 nmewn Well it's fine by me too except when it's the government doing it. If an airliner wants to say "Ya know, you're an idiot & a fucking menace and really screwing up the other paying passengers good vibe about what we do, so if you ever try to book with us again we will REFUSE SERVICE." Completely different...akin to...No Shoes No Shirt No Service...or forcing a hetero baker to bake a ghey wedding cake...however you want to frame it. Fri, 12/11/2015 - 19:25 | 6912738 Reaper What if Obozo declares that anyone owning a gun could be a potential terrorist and places them on the no-fly list?  Are we to trust our courts with appointed judges for remedy? Rights without remedy are non-existent. Trust in government is an opiate of fools.  All governments become malignant.  "Power comes from the barrel of a gun, whether in government hands or the people's. Fri, 12/11/2015 - 19:21 | 6912697 Laddie GW, the DHS has primarily focused on White veterans, those opposed to immigration, 2nd Amendment supporters as TERRORIST THREATS,seriously. They said Whites were a greater threat than Muslims from Middle East. Jews and Jewish organizations lead the gun control campaign by Professor Kevin MacDonald And by successfully changing immigration policy , Jews have reduced the political power of the rural White subculture of America to the point that even though roughly 7 in 10 White males voted Republican (and ~60% of White females), Obama and the Democrats won the recent election. Even if the current push for gun control fails, we can expect that Jewish organizations will continue the push to disarm White males. Jewish organizations are not at all against guns when they are in the hands of the police and other authorities. The ADL (see the ADLâ€™s Law Enforcement Agency  Resource Network) and the SPLC (Law Enforcement Training and Law Enforcement Resources) have made strong alliances with law enforcement in America. Further, it has often been observed that Jewish organizations have historically favored a strong central government rather than statesâ€™ rights. For example, Jacques Berlinerblau, writing in The Chronicle of Higher Education ( (see here ), notes that â€œJewish voters â€¦  prefer cities and federal governments to backwaters and volatile statehouses. â€¦ All things equal, Jews like strong central governments, not a pastiche of local decision makers catering to majorities.â€? Although Jewish organizations would not phrase it this way, the net result is that the thrust of Jewish activism has been to favor a strong central government with a monopoly on lethal force. Given Jewish hostility to the traditional people and culture of White America, this is a very foreboding combination as we head into the era of a non-White majority America.
