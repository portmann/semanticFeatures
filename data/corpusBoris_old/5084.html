Despite Oil Fears, Spending by Major Businesses Set Records in December - Real Time Economics - WSJ Surprise: Big U.S. energy companies didn’t slash capital expenditures in the fourth quarter — and in fact, business investment by major companies overall hit new records in December. Companies in the S&P 500 reported capital spending of $192 billion in the fourth quarter, up 10.3% from third quarter and up 17% from fourth-quarter 2013, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. For the year, capex rose 16.3% from 2013 to $681 billion â€” which even beats 2001?s inflation-adjusted $637 billion, Senior Index Analyst Howard Silverblatt notes. The data reflect reported results from 95% of the index’s companies. The energy sector stayed hot, clocking its own record and spending 19.5% more than it did in third quarter, while remaining the biggest chunk of the index’s overall figure at about a third. The Wall Street Journal reported an increase in capital spending among big companies earlier this month using data for a smaller group of companies in the index. The S&P data reflects global spending, which means it’s of limited use in forecasting the U.S. economy. Many large U.S. companies generate a third or more of their business outside the country. And there’s little doubt pullback is coming from energy companies, of course: Plenty of oil and gas companies have announced plans to slash spending, including Chesapeake Energy, which said it would reduce investment by more than a third in 2015, and Pioneer Natural Resources, which said it would cut capital spending by half . Figures from Wolfe Research early this month indicated energy companies planned to cut capital spending by 30% overall, with the steepest cuts from oil exploration and production companies and smaller cuts from gas producers and integrated oil companies. But last quarter, despite a 6.5% drop from fourth-quarter 2013, Chevron still led the S&P 500 in business investment, at $35 billion, Silverblatt said, while Exxon Mobil followed at $33 billion, down 2.1%. AT&T and Verizon came next, with spending up slightly at $21.4 billion and $17.2 billion. Separately, Silverblatt said cash and equivalents held by S&P 500 companies also set a new record at the end of the fourth quarter, at $1.33 trillion â€” up from $1.25 trillion at the end of the third quarter and enough to match 82 weeks of estimated operating income for companies in the index.
