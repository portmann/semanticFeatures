U.S. Economy Lacks Catalysts Heading Into 2016 | Seeking Alpha Consumer spending won't be economic driver in 2016 it was in 2015. Easy credit, not wages driving spending. Uncertainty as to which GDP numbers will show up in next report. As 2015 starts to wind down, it's worth it for investors to take some time to contemplate whether or not there is much economic momentum as 2016 approaches. From half to half GDP numbers in 2014 and 2015 have been volatile, with the last half of 2014 performing well, coming in at a 3.6 percent pace. That was followed by an anemic 0.2 percent in the first quarter of 2015, and a stronger 3.9 percent GDP growth rate in the second quarter. In the third quarter GDP shrank once again, falling to an annualized rate of 1.5 percent, according to the Commerce Department, cited by Fox Business. It is becoming apparent to me consumer spending is slowing down, and that is likely to continue on into 2016. What has yet to be determined is what will replace the expected decline in spending during the next year. At this time there is nothing has emerged to give any clarity. It's possible there won't be any sectors replacing the decline in consumer spending. If that's how it plays out, it will be a much tougher year for the country, including many retailers. It has been suggested by some that wage inflation has been a driver of consumer spending, and if that continue into 2016, the economy will do okay. I disagree with that assessment. I don't think anyone can refute the fact it has been easy and cheap credit that has driven consumer spending, with the bulk of that coming from the auto sector. Consumers that couldn't afford the monthly payment would simply have a year or two tacked onto the loan to get them into vehicle. For that reason I don't see that as a catalyst next year. Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) will increase its wages on the lower end to about $10 an hour, but I don't see that as having much impact on spending. The total increase in wages for a month in that case, assuming an increase of about $1 dollar an hour over the base $9 put in place in 2015, it would add up to about $170 a month, depending on the number of work days in any particular month. After deductions for taxes, etc., it won't leave a lot left over to spend. I understand the psychological aspect of the increase, but it still has to place money in the bank accounts of consumers, no matter how confident it makes them feel. On the borrowing side, I don't see it making much if any difference. That means challenges to the economy going forward. With consumer debt in the U.S. at record levels, I find it hard to believe they will continue to use debt to make acquisitions in 2016, which if true, means consumer spending is likely to drop, especially with big ticket items. Goldman Sachs recently came to a similar conclusion, saying it will fall from a range of 3 to 3.5 percent to a range of 2.5 to 2.75 percent next year. Real income growth will also probably drop over the next 12 months because of the impact low oil prices had on inflation in 2015. While I don't think oil prices are going to be near as strong as a number of analysts and economist have projected, there is a decent chance it will be above the current price level. If not, then it could change the consumer spending scenarios as it relates to real income growth. In that case it would surprise to the upside. That has a very slight chance of happening in my opinion, but it is a possibility. If consumer spending won't occur at levels it did in 2015, then we have to look at other sectors of the economy for growth. At this time there doesn't appear to be any. Only in one of the last four quarters has consumer spending not accounted for all the headline economic growth in the U.S. That includes public spending, net exports and investment. If there isn't an increase in any of those areas, it's hard to see the U.S. economy gaining any momentum in 2016; rather, it is probably going to start declining. The only unknown to me is if the economy starts to slow in an election year, whether or not government spending will be increased in an attempt to strengthen the economy. Investment and exports will remain subdued, if not weaken further. Manufacturing could even start to approach contraction levels if the U.S. dollar surges on an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve. The U.S. economy has never fully recovered from the Great Recession, and it appears what weak legs it did have are starting to get even weaker. All of this will center on how well consumer spending does, because there is nothing outside of a significant increase in public spending that has a chance of having any meaningful impact on the U.S. economy in 2016. With consumer debt at a record level, and wages really not being much of a factor in consumer sentiment, it's hard to see what would encourage more spending next year, or even spending at the level it has occurred this year. My thought is we're going to experience a weaker economy in 2016. The mixed results from retailers points to consumers abandoning some of the higher end stores for discounters. If that is more than a one-off quarter, big ticket items will not be as attractive next year. What I'm most interested next is what the next report on vehicle sales in the U.S reveals. If they start to decline, it would reinforce my thesis that economic strength in the U.S. is waning. Consequently, it would lead to a much tougher year for companies and investors.
