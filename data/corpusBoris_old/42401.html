5 Things to Watch in the First-Quarter GDP Report - WSJ 5 Things to Watch in the First-Quarter GDP Report The government on Wednesday releases its first estimate of economic growth in the first quarter of the year. The headline gross domestic product number isnâ€™t expected to be pretty. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal are forecasting growth at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1%, which would be the worst performance in a year. Hereâ€™s what to look for in the report: Forecasts compiled by The Wall Street Journal range from a paltry 0.2% to a more palatable 2.4%. A number of factors are expected to drag overall GDP lower, including bad weather, slow growth overseas, port disruptions on the West Coast, a stronger dollar and the mixed impact of cheaper oil. Some of those effects should show up in trade numbers. In the fourth quarter, trade was the single biggest drag on GDP. The second-biggest anchor was falling federal government spending, which knocked more than half a percentage point off of GDP. To sift out some of the impact of the often volatile categories, the White Houseâ€™s Council of Economic Advisers has looked closely at real private domestic final purchases. The sum of consumption and fixed investment, an indicator of underlying trends in the economy, rose at a 4.3% annual rate in the fourth quarter. If youâ€™re looking for a bright spot on Wednesday, this may be it. U.S. households got a big boost from cheaper gasoline and robust job creation in the second half of 2014. That helped fourth-quarter consumer spending accelerate at the fastest pace since 2006. But prices at the pump have ticked up this year and the labor market slowed noticeably in March. As a result, confidence has tumbled, the personal saving rate has increased and spending on goods has looked tepid. In March, retail sales rose for the first time in four months but still havenâ€™t climbed back to last yearâ€™s high. In the fourth quarter, consumers picked up their spending while businesses slowed down. Business investmentâ€”which reflects spending on software, research and development, equipment and structuresâ€”grew at a 4.7% rate, well down from the third quarterâ€™s 8.9% pace. Cheaper oil may be one culprit as exploration and production companies have been slashing capital spending since prices started falling last year. One key measure of business investmentâ€”new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraftâ€” has fallen for seven straight months . U.S. trade has been reshaped by a surge in domestic oil productionâ€”which has slashed energy importsâ€”a rising dollar and most recently a labor dispute at West Coast ports. According to the most recent data, U.S. exports fell in February but the trade gap still narrowed , reflecting an even bigger drop in imports amid bottlenecks at dock terminals from Long Beach to Seattle. The disruptions are over but U.S. companies still have to contend with a stronger dollar, which has made domestically produced goods more expensive overseas and foreign products cheaper inside the U.S. For purposes of calculating GDP, a smaller trade deficit would help the headline number. The Federal Reserveâ€™s preferred gauge of inflation, the price index for personal consumption expenditures, has been running below the central bankâ€™s 2% target for 34 straight months . Itâ€™s not likely to show much of a pickup in the first quarter of the year, leaving the Fed room to leave interest rates lower for longer. • You must enter the verification code below to send.
