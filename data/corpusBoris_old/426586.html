As most of you have seen, diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $1.19 compared to $1.05 a year ago. Year-to-date diluted earnings per share were up 24% to $5.73 compared to $4.62 a year ago. The increases in earnings per share of both periods were driven by strong sales increases across all major categories and slightly higher fuel margins. EBITDA for the quarter was up 10.2% to $125.6 million. For the fiscal year, EBITDA was up nearly 17%. A reconciliation of EBITDA to GAAP can be found in our 10-Q and 10-K reports. In the fuel category, we experience the favorable fuel margin environment in the fourth-quarter that caused the margin to rise above our annual goals to $17.8 per gallon compared to $16.9 a year ago. During the quarter we sold $12.7 million renewable fuel credits commonly known as RIN's for $9.1 million. It's represented a $1.9 favorable impact to the fuel margin. Currently RIN's are trading around $0.80. Year-to-date we experienced a record fuel margin of $19.6 per gallon well ahead of our annual goal. The lower retail fuel prices we experience this quarter compared to the same period a year ago as well as increased promotional activity with our fuel saver program rose same store gallons up 4.6% during the quarter. Total gallon sold in the fourth quarter increased 8.4% to $482.2 million. The average retail price of fuel for the quarter was $1.81 a gallon compared to $2.27 last year. Fuel gross profit for the quarter was up over 14% to $85.8 million due to the higher fuel margin and increased sales previously mentioned. Same store gallon sold for the year were up 3%, while total gallon sold for the year up 7.4% to nearly 2 billion gallons. In the grocery and other merchandise category, same store sales were above our annual goal increasing 7.4% in the quarter. Total sales during this period rose 9.4% to 477.5 million. We experienced high single to low double digit total sales growth in every area of this category including cigarettes. Cigarette sale continue to benefit from lower retail fuel prices. The margin in the fourth quarter for the category was 32.1% which was in lined with our annual goal and the fourth-quarter of last year. Overall we are pleased with the gains in this category. Over the quarter gross profit dollars rose 9.3% to $153.3 million, year-to-date same store sales were up 7.1% with an average margin at 31.9%. Prepared food and fountain category continued a strong performance during the fourth quarter. Total sales were up 12.2% to $218.3 million over the quarter. Same store sales in the quarter were up 8.2% with an average margin of 61.9%, up 100 basis points from the same time a year ago. The margin gain was primarily due to the benefit of the price increase and lower commodity cost. Company currently has locked in for the majority of our cheese cost at $1.86 per pound through December 2016. Even though same store sales still below our annual goal in the quarter, gross profit dollar is increased nearly 14% in a period. Year-to-date same store sales were up 8.4% with an average margin of 62.5%. Gross profit for the year was up 18.1%. We remain optimistic about future sales growth in this category as we convert additional stores to a 24 hour format, add Pizza delivery stores and complete more major remodels. We should also benefit in fiscal 2017 from the major re miles and pizza delivery stores we completed late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. In addition to this effective May 1, we implemented several strategic price increases. These increases should represent approximately 1% benefit to the total prepared food and fountain category. We were also pleased with the results of the introduction of our new mobile app. Subsequent to the roll out in January total downloads of the app at a heated 400,000 it continues to grow. Currently we are seeing a low double digit increase in the basket lane from an online order compared to a telephonic order. Also approximately 7% of all pizza orders are now done online. We believe the contribution will continue to grow as the number of downloads of our mobile app increases. For the year operating expenses increased 9.7%, for the quarter operating expenses were up 12.9% to $262.6 million. Majority of this increase in the quarter was due to a rising wages primarily rated to operating more stores this quarter compared to the same time period a year ago and an increase in the continued roll out pizza delivery service and major remodels. On the income statement, total revenue in the quarter was down 4.3% or $1.6 billion. This was due to a 20.3% decrease in the retail price of fuel offset by an 8.4% increase in gallon sold and an increase in the number of stores in operation this quarter compared to the same period a year ago. Year-to-date total revenue was $7.1 billion, down about 8.3% primarily due to a 24% lower retail fuel price from a year ago offset by an increasing gallon sold and the sales gains inside the store. The effective tax rate in the quarter was down slightly primarily due to an increase in favorable permit differences and a decrease in state tax expense. We expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 to be between 35% and 36%. On the balance sheet, our balance sheet continues to be strong. As of April 30, cash and cash equivalents were $75.8 million. Long-term debt net of term maturities was $822.9 million while shareholder equity rose to $1.1 billion up $208.2 million from the prior fiscal year end. In addition to this, as previously reported, subsequent to this fiscal year end the company issued an additional $100 million of senior notes, $50 million of this was issued in on May 2, the remaining $50 million in on delayed draw and will be taken down in October 2016. The blended interest rate of these two series of senior notes is approximately 3.7%. We generated $464.7 million in cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter. For the year capital expenditure were $400.1 million compared to $401.9 million a year ago in the same period. In fiscal 2017, we expect capital expenditures to be between $496 million and $614 million. More detail on the capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 will be outlined in our annual report and 10-K to be filed at later date. This quarter we opened 20 new store constructions and completed two acquisitions. For the year we acquired five stores and completed 51 new store constructions. We also replaced 11 stores this year. We currently have 21 new stores under construction and have additional 75 new site under contract. Our store count at the end of this quarter was 1931 corporate stores. In addition to the unit growth, in fiscal 2016 we converted 110 more locations to a 24 hour format, adding 110 additional store to the pizza delivery program and completed 102 major remodels. This completes the review of the quarter. I would now like to discuss our goals and outlook for fiscal 2017. I would like to start by outline our performance goals for the next fiscal year. They are to increase same store gallon sold 2% with an average fuel margin of $18.4 per gallon. The fuel margin goal for this year represents our three year average fuel margin of $16.8 per gallon combined with our three year average RIN value which $1.6 per gallon. Increased same store grocery and the merchandise sales 6.2% with an average margin of 32%. Increased same store prepared food and fountain sales 10.2% with an average margin of 62.5%. Build or acquired between 77 and 116 stores which represents approximately 4% to 6% unit growth. In addition to these goals, we planned to replace 35 stores and complete 100 major remodels. At this time, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our growth programs and our plans for fiscal 2017 ending periods. I will start with our major remodel program. We are encouraged by the uptake in performance of the stores that have undergone in major remodel. Specifically experience a lift of about 25% to 35% in prepared food sales and a 5% to 15% lift in the grocery and other merchandise sales in the first 12 months after completion. As a result we are experiencing low to mid-teen returns on after tax basis in the second and third years following a major remodel. We feel that we have an opportunity to continue this program for several more years into the future. As we have mentioned previously, the major remodels last fiscal year were weighted towards the backhalf of the year. Our plan this year is to more evenly distribute then throughout this fiscal year. The conversion of stores to a 24 hour format continues to go well. In fiscal 2017 we planned to convert approximately 100 additional stores to a 24 hour format. Like last year we will convert nearly all of these in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Specifically experienced to 20% to 30% lift in prepared food sales and 10% to 20% lift in grocery and other merchandise sales in the first 12 months after the store is converted to this format. In fiscal 2016 we weighted the roll-out of pizza delivery conversions to the backhalf of the year so we could complete the conversion of our online ordering program to introduce our mobile app. Our plan in fiscal 2017 is to convert about 100 more stores to a pizza delivery format. This will be spread out evenly throughout the year. We typically experience a 20% to 30% increase in prepared food sales upon the roll-out of pizza delivery to a store in the first 12 months. We have a strong track record of growing the business while also returning values to shareholders through dividends. As June board meeting, the board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share, which is a 9.1% increase from the year end dividend amounted fiscal 2016. The dividend has increased approximately 45% in the last five years. Finally, I would like to make a few comments about our practice of disclosing monthly same-store sales. We began as practiced about 12 years ago in an effort to increase transparency and narrow the wide range of earning estimates we were experiencing at the time, thus lowering volatility. We've always been focused on driving long-term share holder value. However, over the year we have seen that one of the unintended results over the releasing monthly same-store sales has been an increased focused on our short-term results, which in turn created more volatility around our monthly numbers. This concerns us because we do have a longer term focus regarding how we manage the business. For these reasons and after discussions with many of our investors about these issues beginning in fiscal 2017, we will no longer report monthly same-store sales information. We’ll continue to report our private stores and annual goals on a quarterly basis, which is consisting with the practice of vast majority of our peers. In closing we are very pleased with the performance of our company at fiscal 2016. We're excited about our growth opportunities in fiscal 2017. We’ll now go and take your questions. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Lots of color and guidance around the initiatives which is helpful; wondering if you could comment on the expense outlook and how we should be thinking about that? It seems like there was an uptick in Q4, but a lot of the initiatives were I think weighted towards Q4, 2 so, just curious how we should think about operating expenses in fiscal '17 and what kind of underlying gas price here assuming within that, given the credit card expense related to that? Yeah, I’ll start. Hope like I catch all of your questions there, if I don't please let me know, but I’m going to start with the Q4 operating expense increase and then kind of move into the 2017 expectation on an operating expenses. First of all, you saw that we had 12.9% increase in operating expenses in the fourth quarter it was sequentially is up and several things are going on. You’re right on point, Kelly, that one of the reasons obviously is due to an increase in number of store opening in the fourth quarter. Obviously the increase in piece of delivery and major remodels that were introduced in the fourth quarter contributed to the operating expense. Those initiatives tend to ramp up merely from and OpEx perspective. But it take several months before the earnings contribution catches up. Also as you can imagine we had a record year so that means that we do pay off additional bonuses to store operations personnel and others and so there was little bit about $1.5 million extra bonus paid in the fourth quarter as the result of our strong performance. And then as you know, in February we did open the second distribution center and we do have some additional expenses that running through in the fourth quarter as well by another $1.5 million as well. And so, that kind of gives you kind of an idea some of the nuances of the fourth quarter operating expense. Now going into fiscal 2017, if you take a step back and talk about the programs that we have going forward all of the pizza delivery, all the other growth programs in addition to that we have increased major - so the increase replacement stores next fiscal year with increase unit growth next year. We have the full distribution center as well in the next fiscal year that rolls up into, what we anticipate to be low teen increase in operating expenses year-over-year. And that’s where I think that, that what put your guidance there. Did that catch everything Kelly? Yeah, that’s very helpful. And then in term of the new stores I think this year was slightly below the original goal, [indiscernible] things, I think below the goal but, really I think because of the acquisition front and I’m just curious how you feel about the target for '17 at 77 I think to 116 new stores? And how should we think about the build acquire mix? What are you seeing on the acquisition front? And then if you could tie that in with the CapEx and what the step up in the CapEx there if forth? Yeah and so our plan - you are exactly right the acquisition activity in fiscal 2006 was a bit light and that was due to a disconnect in solar expectation what we are willing to pay and so we're going to patient in that regard and so as we look forward one of the indications that they should take away is the number of new sites that we have under contract. Typically some will fall out but typically when we say sites under contract the next 12 months that store will be up and operational. If you might recall our third quarter conference call we had 60 sites under contract, now we have 75. The units going forward in fiscal 2017 will be weighted to organic growth and will be augmented with the acquisitions as they come through. But our intent is to continue to accelerate that number and get the organic growth to a higher number. It wasn't too far in the distant past we would build 80 to 90 sites a year. So we think that’s not unrealistic for us to get to that level and augment that with acquisitions on top of that when that disconnect starts to [indiscernible] scenario. So having said that with the CapEx step up next year, if you look at the activity that we have rolling through next fiscal year that we have increase in new store constructions. Until the units relative in fiscal 2006. We also have an increase in replacement store activity in 2017 relative to 2016. But that will lend itself to a higher CapEx rate. And again there will be more detail when the 10-K comes out here later this month. That’s very helpful. If I could just ask one more going back to the expenses, in terms of some of the cost headwinds that are facing the industry whether it’s the minimum exemption that I think you talked about that you have the shift liability just ongoing wage pressures some of those I guess start to hit later in the next fiscal year. But I was just curious how you’re planning those or any color that we should be thinking about in terms of modeling for those? Yeah. Sure, a good question and so on the first part of that is the minimum salary for exempt employees changes to effective December 1st, it raises to a little bit over $47,000. Our average store manager and totals compensation is about $46,000 when you include the bonus. So right now we are evaluating alternatives and how to approach that except in September conference call that we will lay out the detail of that. But certainly either direction that we go there is going to be an increase in wage expense relative to that whether we move their salary up or whether we change in hour whatever other direction that we choose to go. But that’s not necessarily unique to us, that would be true for anybody in the C-store space and many retailers. And so that will be an interesting dynamics to see how that plays out going forward across the retail space. And then EMB I think you mentioned EMB, Kelly, that what you’re talking about I believe is the EMV technology, that will be at the pumps for us. We already have inside the store. That liability shift that goes in effect October 2017, it’s not a mandate necessarily. But certainly something we're evaluating how to approach that to give you kind of perspective the average it will be actually between $30,000 and $40,000 of depending on the number of pumps on a per store basis for that EMV conversion. So hope that helps you out. Okay just a couple of questions to start off with, what was the CapEx for fiscal 2016 and do you have an average gas price for the full year? For 2016 it was $400 million with the total CapEx. I can break that down for buckets, if you like if that’s helpful. Yeah, new store constructions was about $144 million, acquisitions 49 million, replacement activity was $23 million, major remodels was $74 million, transportation was $18 million, the corporate warehouse DC was $40 million and about $18 million of information technology and then the remaining piece would be just general maintenance. Alright, thanks. What do you thinking about in terms of cigarette margins in fiscal 2017? Any indication that they will continue to contract? Well, I'm not been here a long time and cigarettes is a category that's as this in [inaudible] decline and for a number of reasons. So for us, if you look at fiscal 2017, the best case scenario where margins will be stable to slightly down in the cigarette category. So that's one of the reason, Chuck, it's really challenging for a convenient store operator to really drive grocery and other merchandise margin because cigarettes are such a large piece rested about 40% of the grocery and other merchandise category. So that's why you see we're maintaining margins as a goal for fiscal 2017. Got it. And how about the wide range for CapEx?. I guess the increase is going to be driven by new store spending, But what explains the wide range? Yeah, you are right on point. It's at 4% to 6% unit growth goal. That low end would represent a 4% unit growth to high end of represent of 6% growth. Then all, I'm sorry go ahead. And could you talk a little bit about the new higher goal for gas margin and management's confidence in moving towards that? Yeah. Well for us, Chuck, it's a 3 year average. And I cannot broke down the details, it's $16.8 of that cent of that 18.4 [ph] is the what I will call underlying fuel margin, the remaining 1.6% is the average rent value over the last three years. The couple of takeaways there is to kind a think about, I mean first of all, we're not sitting here trying to predict where crude is going to go. We're not trying to predict where retail fuel prices are going to go and we're not predicting what competitive landscape is going to be necessarily. That just not our 4K. And so I can tell you that to the three year average fuel margin is been kind of the way we handle the gold for many years. In the last two years, we've only been underneath the actual results that came in twice below than last 10 years. The couple of takeaways, retail fuel price shift to remain relatively flattish over the year hopefully. But RIN values right now that indicated were $0.80 and EPA has come out in a couple of times here in the last 6 months and given some indications there. And so rents have been treating in a relatively tight window between $0.60 and $0.70 and more recently and despite up as EPA come out with some commentary recently. So to put in perspective, it stays in that area and we average about $0.55 on the RIN value of 2016. So it stays in that area, we have opportunities for a tail one in that regard. And just as a point of reference about every $0.35 of RIN value represents of penny to the fuel margin. I have just a quick follow on to an earlier question on your new store growth and acquisitions. I guess I was hoping if you could talk a little bit about the current M&A environment especially in light of the speculation at be excuse for sale. If I'm curious how do you see this changing the competitive environment is that all? A lot of what's going on right now. And I just love to hear some color from your on what you guys are hearing and seeing and again how you think that might impact the overall environment. And then you mentioned earlier you're hoping things might changed and may [inaudible] target multiples might down and just trying to get a sense from you if you're seeing any signs of that if you're still pretty elevateedd. Yeah, as we see there today, the environment continues to be the same as it was in the most of fiscal 2016. And in fiscal 2016 we did see certain expectations to be quite high. As you probably know, Bonni, many of the acquisitions that we're announced in fiscal 2016. That's in pretty high multiples that are associated with them. So business is all be that might be smaller ones in our market area are still cognizant of those multiples and it's slightly the little bit more challenging from a disconnect perspective. So one of the things that we're not going to do is just roll for growth say and run out and buy 100 or 200 stores and you might can do this you had enough money to do that. But that may not be the right thing for the shareholder base. So we're going to be patient with one of the reasons that we are looking to continue to accelerate the number of new store constructions, trying to get that to a higher level beyond where we're at now and beyond what indications are in the press release. And so that we have a stable stream of units coming into the mix and then when expectations do become a little bit more narrow from our but we are willing to pay. I think we can have an opportunity then to really accelerate that piece of it. With respect to the CST information, I don't necessarily think it depends on what that transaction will go for, if it goes for double digit multiples that will probably will give a signal that it might continue to be a higher multiple environment. Competitive for us it's the CST stores most of those are in the Texas market, not in all marketplace in the direction that we're heading. That make sense but I'm just thinking about it. I recognize the industry is still pretty fragmented. But for an acquisition of that size by larger company as just thinking about the consolidation and maybe where this industry could ultimately have XPNF at three to five years as some of the bigger chains get even larger. Well I would agree I think you'll will continue to see consolidation at some level. most of the consolidation that have the larger size that to your reference are not having in our market area. But then that's probably a function of our marketplace two thirds of the operators of C-stores in our markets are operates of 10 stores or less. So that's why it's lot of larger to little bit smaller. That's not just say that that we would not be looking at larger acquisitions. But the right one that came up that make sense for the company with shareholders, we will certainly have that opportunity, we certainly have a financial where with all to do it. Okay that's helpful. And then, just my other question is on your prepared food and your ability to reach the 10.2 comp growth goal in FY'17 that you discussed. I guess what gives you the confidence that you'll reach this target especially in light of the past few quarters which fell below that growth rate. I do understand you implement some of the growth initiatives more recently. But I guess I'm just trying to understand one while taking little bit to these to kick in. And then two, how do you expect them to help drive accelerated growth for prepared foods? Yeah, well couple of things in that regard, you're exactly right. Some of the deceleration on the sequential basis, I mean little bit to do it whether, but it also have to do with the timing issue and the back loading of those two particular growth programs for the piece of delivering the main remodels. We taking the steps internally to make sure that we have these more evenly distribute throughout the year. So we don't have that kind of temporary disconnect. And so keeping those keep in the mind couple of things, one we give the price increase that we will come that comes forward. Secondly the backload we've backloaded the piece of delivery major remodels pretty heavily this past year. 75 piece of delivery in 75 major remodels of backload primarily in the fourth quarter. And so that take a month or so to really kind a start getting that traction in that regard. And so those will benefit us as we head into Q1 of this year and beyond. But in addition to that you just obviously heard the plans for our growth programs next year. And so we think all of those rolling up, and we have confidence we can get back to that double digit area. And we are evaluating those on a regular basis. We still continue to see the programs that we rolled out in 2016 had the same lift than we had back in 2015 and 2014 we rolled similar set of stores out. So I would say we're cautiously optimistic. That’s in our goals. Thank and good morning everyone. It's been the three four months since you opened the second DC in Terra--. Wondering how that's ramping up, how the truck lines are evolving, whether you're on track how you're seeing and how we should be thinking about the benefits of that as we go through the year. Yeah, great question. As far as on track, we are way ahead of pace. When we open that back in February, our plan was to convert roughly about 100 of our stores to that second distribution center, 600 stores to that distribution center in the first 12 months of its operation. We did that 600 stores in first, roughly four to six weeks. So we are way ahead of schedule. We had no hiccups in that. Things are running very smoothly. Obviously our growth plans are centered around moving East and South to leverage that distribution center. So we are very pleased with that roll-out and excited. You can obviously, if you saw in the press release that we’ll have stores open in Ohio this fiscal year and continue to fill in and move into that direction. So, as we get further down the line we’ll give you more information on the accretion, dilution time factor. But we’ve always indicated that with the original plan of trying to roll 600 in the first 12 months, we thought it would be relatively neutral and here we did 600 in the first quarter, six week. You can infer that obviously, may be toward the back end of the, of this fiscal year we should start seeing accretion from that particular program. That’s great. That’s really helpful. And is it safe to say that if you got more of your newer stores opening in the newer geographies that these would be the higher throughput stores both from inside stores and gas volumes? The answer to that would be, I guess it is on the slide-by-side basis but all the stores that we build are the new store design, which typically have more pumps in our legacy stores. And the new state that we are building these stores and we are seeing a very nice ramp up of gallons and the nice ramp up of grocery and other [Inaudible] what we see in some of the more seasoned state that we operate. The challenge for us as we go forward as to work on programs and an initiatives to ramp up the prepared food category as quick as we can. Because we are not as well known in some of those newer markets and so we want to make sure our customers getting introduced to our prepared food offerings. And so that would be our challenge as we move forward. And that brings up for next question which is, can you just outline for some of the key initiatives that you do have in place to help you drive food sales in these newer markets where you're lesser known? Yeah, well outside of the normal promotional activity that you might expect with advertising and one of the things that we have done in the past probably year to two years that we had very good success with the pump promotion activity. And really what that is, is we offer cents off per gallon for buying a large pizza. And it seems a really resonating with the customers. And so it’s a way to introduce our, obviously our to one of our key - one of our key products at the same time drive people back to the store to help with fuel. And that's been very successful. We’ve seen some very nice results in the newer state like Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana for instance. So we’ll look to that program as we move forward. That’s great. And then just a finally if I might, question around consumer spending patterns, are you continuing to see an ongoing shift towards more premium products in beer, cigarettes and other categories as gas prices remain low? Yeah, we do. With the differential in fuel prices period-over-period, we are seeing a trade, continue trade up I should say into premium brands of cigarettes, looking more card purchasing versus packed purchasing and the slight pickup in more premium beer and craft beers. Just Bill, starting off with the new market growth, is there any additional color you can provide aside from the quick comment in the releases, released a few Ohio stores? When you say, may be to clarify your question a little bit. Are you looking for a pick up or the ramp up in new stores and in the new markets? I guess just a pose given the number that was tossed out between 77 to 116 stores for the coming year. Any expectations in terms of what percentage come from new markets like Ohio? Yeah, I would say little over majority of those stores will coming, I will call new markets. I guess that would be kind of the legacy states or. Alright, and then looking at the grocery comp, of the guidance of about 6.2%, I guess I’m just kind of the curious why one would guide to a sequential decline in year-over-year basis, given that you’re kind of instituting a similar amount of initiatives and you’re expecting an acceleration in prepared food comps that just a level of conservatism or…? No little bit down to cigarettes I mean we don’t put out the same-store number for cigarettes. So we’ve been tracking at a high single-digit comp in cigarettes for a multiple years. That’s a result really something that we did back roughly about two years ago when we moved the majority or a good piece of our stores to the marble leadership program. We were not necessarily comparing the pricing all markets back then and so by doing that we became in line with our competition and start to gain market share back in cigarettes. At some point that will plateau a cycle over those and so as we look forward to fiscal 2017 part of that 6.2% goal that you see progressing to a merchandise is in fact is a function of cigarettes moderating back in the mid-single-digits on a comp basis. Okay and then on Q4 itself you had mentioned that [Inaudible] has some aggressive promotion is really giving you fuel for your favorite card. Can you just provide some color on what that contributed to the fuel comp for the quarter? Yeah and just to let you know what that was the fuel [Inaudible] program in partnership with Hy-Vee they ran some promotional activities in the month of March primarily to in tie with some of their customers to switch over to a new card and doing so the operator a nice enticement on cents off per gallon and so we saw in the month of March enough taken same-store gallon movement that tripled over into April because you do have roughly 30 days to redeem those points. To give an answer to your question roughly about half of the same-store gallon change was coming from stores that we had in the heavy fuels favorite network and so roughly half is the answer for you. Okay that’s helpful. And then looking at the guidance again for prepared food margins I guess I'm just trying to understand why one should expect flat margins in light of the 1% price increase as well as the fact that you’re locked gaining that modestly lower pricing for [inaudible] December? It's a number of things it’s not just one thing. First you’re exactly right commodities will be a slight tailwind for us in fiscal 2017 at least the December of 2016 cheap prices, we’re not sure when they will go in the back half of the year so part of it has to do with make a little bit of unknown in the back half of the fiscal year with cheese cost and that can be a big swing as you know every ten per pound swing is 35 days as once the margin. Secondly some of the new stores that we are focusing on are newer states where we may not have the dust brand recognition from our prepared food, we’ll start to cost obviously to get those up and underway like I mentioned that piece of promotion that could be somewhat diluted to margin as we necessarily ramp those out. Okay that’s helpful and then last one from me, in light of the fact that you no longer going to be providing monthly comps is there anything you can discuss related to the quarter to the trends? We typically don’t do that in the call in quarter day trends. So I would probably not be able to do that at this point, Chris. Just a few follow ups on previously questions. The monthly same-store sales understand not giving those out anymore. But are there any discussions or thoughts around kind of releasing fuel margin goal or update? That’s a good question in fact when I spoke to a number of shareholder in the last couple of months that was one of the comments said and the question they had. We have some internal discussions on that we don’t have any plans at this point. We’ll continue to have those discussions because that is one of the pieces that probably creates the most volatility, kind of most unknown and quite honestly its most out of our control so nothing planned at this point. We’ll evaluate that into the degree that we make some decision to give guidance on a more periodic basis, but we’ll sort of get back to everyone on that. Okay and on the RIN volumes as were down year-over-year in the fourth quarter and given the lift in same-stores gallon was the difference there just to the Hy-Vee promotion and that RIN's actually been down year-over-year? Not really it relate to the Hy-Vee fuel promotion, you’re exactly right RIN's from a quantitative perspective were down in the fourth quarter and really all that it with a timing issue Ben. We attempt to have contracts done roughly the middle of the month, and at the end of the month. Occasionally what happens is you get one of those contracts shifted by a day or two into the next month and that's exactly what happened in the fourth quarter. There about $1.8 million worth of RIN's contract that shifted into May that probably would have been into the month of April. So $1.8 million incidentally represents about $0.03 on earnings. Hey, good morning guys. Just a follow up on RIN's, I'll be curious to know, with the proposed targets for 2017. What your thought is on that, I mean it seems to me that it elevated pricing and it could be situation RIN for the next quarter or six quarter, but I love to hear your thoughts. Yeah. We're not in necessarily RINs experts per se. But I think everything thing that we have seen over the last six months or so with respect to commentary on RIN values and blending all requirements. It lends itself to a higher RIN value. I don't where that will go specifically, but if it does stay say that $0.80 range where it's at now, that will be a tailwind of about $0.30, $0.25 or $0.30 above and beyond 2016 numbers, which almost puts you to an extra penny on fuel margin. Got it. And then just had a curiously, you're talking about the industry absorbing wage pressure. Historically what's been the respond, I mean I suspect that you have a lot of benefiting operators out they look to either manage CPG higher or install margins or maybe both. And this is something that even you could write the coat tails off. But historically what how has it been managed? Yeah. I've been in 26 years, I've seen quite a few minimal wage increases or wage increases. And every time that happens they've been passed through the customer. I would say one or two things will probably happened in regards to what's you're referring too. Either those will be passed on to the customer in some form. And if you think about some of the smaller operators that are in our marketplace, one of the most logical places in the past that would be in the fuel margin. If it doesn't get pass through, that will definitely put a competitive pressure on many people. And that could create a maybe an increased activity and acquisition opportunities for us. So I think we have positioned very well in either direction to take advantage, but typically to answer your question those get pass through. Okay. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I mean that CPG is really the fulcrum that drive sort of whether when a favorable acquisition environment or not, right? It's one of the things that and that does - it really does point to that. Typically you see a higher fuel margin you have the smaller operator looking to sale maybe on higher cash flows, on higher multiples. So it does play in factor until you are there. Good morning thank you. Wondering Bill if you could remind us we're in a situation where the corn crop is seeing pretty significant reaction in the futures market. If that been there maybe drought this year. And if there were a drought and corn will become considerably more expensive relative to the price of ethanol. Does that help you typically with evaluating your RINs? I can't say a 100% whether or not, but we have seen about 3 years ago. I think Brent you followed market very closely, and it might correct me if I'm wrong it's like three or four years ago we saw a drought in the summer. Right, about six months later we saw a spike in RIN values to historic levels. Part of that had to do with we believe that drought and ethanol supply or corn supply. Hey Bill, just a follow up on, you say you opened 100 new stores this year. What kind of size range we will be looking at? I know you want to go towards that new design, but is that one size fits all or we see a range of store sizes in pump setups? It will definitely be range. I mean right now currently we have two store designs one is of 4200 square foot design, that's typically for a little bit larger community or more heavily trafficked area. Typically you see six to eight quads out in front. Again depending on traffic, we can go higher than that we have. The other design is about 3600 square foot and we see about easily four quads setup upfront of that. And that's designed usually for a bit smaller popular area or a bit lower traffic area. However, this fiscal year we are introducing a new store design. It is a design that I could take a step back those two that I just mentioned the first one is roughly about $3 million and the other one is about $2.5 million. The new store design that we are going to be rolling out is significantly below the 2.5 million, but still have the same amenities that the other stores have and so we’re excited to see that how that works and perform maybe traditional for all smaller community and so we will introduce that. So once we do that we’ll kind of give you better gauge about really what the actual cost will be for that, but we do believe it’s going to be below that $2.5 million number. So again we’re looking to the end of the day, Chuck, the thought process we’re looking to continue to keep the top line where it’s at, a decrease the denominator on the investment that’s driving ROI over the long term. Now, is this new design you’re talking about will it be still a 3600 square foot building just put up at a lower cost? It will be smaller than the 3600 square foot and just to basically re-engineering kind of what we’re looking at, what we need actually in some of these communities by a way of pump configuration size of concrete around the store just a number of things. It will still have the kitchen also it will serve all the full array of prepared food products just a cost engineered type store geared again for the smaller communities, because those smaller communities are where we’re still continuing to focus especially as we had in these new states With Hy-Vee's plans to grow convenient storage which there seem to be so much larger 10,000 to 15,000 square feet almost many groceries with gas, how do you feel they differ from Casey’s, how do you feel about the competition especially in the grocery category and would you consider selling any sites or stores if the price was right? Yeah first of all the Hy-Vee the community stores that they’re quoting up are not quite that size. They’re actually similar maybe slightly smaller than the size that we put up. They typically put those up in front of their grocery stores it kinds of compliment kind of a convenience offering to their customer. So in that regard I don’t necessary see them as a moving into many grocery store by concept. Now to answer your question about for us to sell we evaluate on our quarterly basis assets that may not be meeting our expectations. Like this year we closed three stores that don’t meet expectations, we in turn close, get a sell those, we may derestricting before we sell and sometimes we don’t depending on the circumstance. But at this point we’re not looking to sell a wide portfolio of our stores I mean they are I think we are performing pretty well for us. And how do you feel as a competitor? Do they sell some sandwiches or pizza or anything like that in their stores compared to you guys? Yeah. They sell a little bit of prepared food offerings. It’s really more geared towards grocery items, packaged beverages, salty snacks some of those types of offerings. [Inaudible] in course fuel and it would be a competitor just like any other convenient store operator that we have run up against in whatever market that maybe. Yes, good morning thank you for taking the questions. So Bill you mentioned in the press release as far as growth in Ohio I was wondering ultimately how do you see that market as far as number of stores potentially and what are your plans for Michigan as well? We’re excited about Ohio, on the East of sides that we’re choosing right now in the Western side of Ohio and when we went out there we noticed that it was a very similar demographic to some of our more season stay like Iowa, Missouri and Illinois, less small communities, very close by for efficiency, distribution of groceries and so we think we have a tremendous opportunity there in Ohio currently looking into the state of Michigan. Right now we don’t have any sites under contract in Michigan. But we’ll continue to look there and that will be state that we will penetrate in the relatively near future and in addition to that Anthony we continue to penetrate Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas and Oklahoma. Got it thanks. I have just a couple of housekeeping items here. So can you just give us the number of stores up deliverable piece or now at the end of the fiscal year and also how many stores now are operating on the 24 hour basis? Yeah right now, we have about 400. We'll start with the 24 hours. We have about 980 or so stores that deliver 24 hours. On piece of delivery we're about 420 and then on major remodels we're just we're about between 400 and 420 major remodels. Got it, okay. And then last thing what are the credit card fees for the quarter and for the fiscal year? Sure. Credit card fees for the quarter were $23.5 million, for the year they were up right about $101 million which is relatively flat to last year, and it's just slightly down. Yeah good morning guys thanks for taking my questions. Just a lot of my questions have been answered already. Just wanted to circle back on the price increase from early May. Which categories do you say was that kind of a cross, is that in the prepared foods? Yeah, it's in the prepared food category. Pizza slices was the big one and we also took up specialty sandwiches. And then also some of that what I will call the specialty bakery items as well. Well, it's not much cost increases, because commodity that have been in our favor necessarily. It's just we do monthly pricing surveys on key products throughout the year and obviously pizza and a lot of the other prepared food items are key products for us. And so we always look for opportunities to maintain competitive structure with our peers. We just happen to see an opportunity to strategically raise the prices to be in line with some of the people in our area. It wasn't necessarily to offset cost. Have you guys - I mean it might be kind of early, have you guys can have any impact in terms of elasticity and you have the consumers noticed too much, or are you guys still seeing pretty good unit sales? Yeah. We have not seen any elasticity from that price increase. I mean it's obviously to obviously early. But in my time obviously I have not seen any elasticity from any of the price increases we've taken. We're very calculated when we take those price increases to make sure that we're not out of the market. Okay great. And then just a last one from me, are you guys seeking out any other partnerships similar to the Hy-Vee 1 that you have out in the Midwest as you guys move a little bit further East? Obviously you will be moving into Ohio. You guys seeking any types of similar partnerships there? We are. We are doing that, we have a couple of small partnerships currently. Just a sample of stores right in that partnership, but as we get more penetration easterly that really don't cover the Hy-Vee fueled area. We will look for opportunities to partner absolutely. Hey, two quick follow up to you from me. Bill you'd mentioned that are you seen over 400,000 downloads on your mobile app. Can you discuss maybe what the conversion rate is, as it related to that, maybe a percentage of those are actually putting forward orders? Well I don't have that information with me. As far as the number of people that download the app relative to the number of people that actually order a pizza. I think probably the direction I would give you is coming back to the comment we made in the opening narrative about 7% penetration of whole pie right now. And so that's the number that we continue to look at moving forward. I mean and so obviously that's one of our goals to get a higher penetration. Okay I missed that, sorry about that. And then lastly, just look into fiscal '17's guidance, and specifically in prepared foods. Are there any kind of one-time items from cadence perspective that we should be monitoring other than obviously Q4 or you're lapping a leap year? Well, leap year would be one I would mention there and I will bring that up when we get to that time period. Outside of that it's really nothing else. And we always going to have in a monthly basis as you probably know calendar shift from time-to-time that can still a monthly number or even a quarterly number. You're come from time-to-time you're going to have some weather anomalies that might skew that. But as far as one time there is really outside of leap year. Hi Bill you mentioned that the consumer is buying more premium cigarettes, premium fuels and some craft beer. Because price for fuel is down year-over-year. I'm wondering if you're seeing anything on just sequentially as prices picked up here in the last couple of months. Are you actually seeing a slowdown in growth or even decline in growth in those categories? No not yet. We will continue to monitor that. That's a great question, but right now we have not seen any type of trend in that area. Okay. And then just one more, when you look at M&A, how do you look at fuel margins, I mean do you actually average out the last three years for your target in terms of what you think it should be valued at. Or how does that worked when you just look at the last 12 months? Now here is always we handle that, Damian. We put a discount cash flow model for every site. And so when I say every site every store. So if the 10 store chain every store in that channel have a DCS. And so with respect to the fuel margin, more times than that we have stores in that area. And so we know the fuel margin environment like that and we will use three year average of that. If we don't have stores in that area we're going to get their financials and look to have some confidence level of their three year financials with respect. We rarely take the 12 month because you never know if there is just anomaly in the years’ time that's going to skew that. And we hate to pay a multiple on top of a cash flow that may or may not be there. So that's what we do. I just like to thank everybody for joining us this morning. And look forward to speak with you in the future. Have a good day. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference you may now disconnect. Good day.
