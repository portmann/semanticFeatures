A Scenario Analysis Shows Electronic Arts Has Room To Grow And Not Much Room To Fall - Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) | Seeking Alpha Electronic Arts was extremely successful in fiscal 2015: the company increased EBITDA almost five-fold, and its stock grew by over 80% in the same time period. I ran a DCF model with three scenarios to see what price ranges it produces, given various variables. It seems that, in the absence of extreme values, the stock does not have a lot of downside risk from current price levels. In my opinion, the $80-per-share benchmark is what investors should be aiming for, given the expected values for each of the scenarios. Game software producers' stocks seem to be very volatile because underlying fundamentals are largely unpredictable and depend on qualitative variables. My previous analysis of Glu Mobile (NASDAQ: GLUU ) showed that investors welcome a scenario approach towards valuing software companies that make computer/mobile/console games. I decided to use the same approach to value Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ: EA ) with slight modifications in the end. Note that I am not trying to be accurate in my predictions: I see my role as being able to capture an expected price range that existing and potential investors can rely on in their judgment. To start, let us look at the price chart and see how the stock fared over the last year in comparison to alternatives. Over the past 52 weeks, Electronic Arts has shown a remarkable price return of over 80% (which was backed by strong fundamentals) to its shareholders: Note: the stock's price returns are compared to S&P 500's performance and returns of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI ), UbiSoft ( OTCPK:UBSFY ), Sony Corp. (NYSE: SNE ), Nintendo Co. ( OTCPK:NTDOY ). I chose these companies because they operate in the same market niche and have similar market capitalizations. The stock's price has ballooned in relation to most of its peers and the market as a whole. Investors may be concerned about the greater possibility of a strong correction in the event the company's fundamentals shift in an unfavourable direction. I present three scenarios, by which investors can evaluate their risks and/or opportunities in relation to Electronic Arts at current price levels. Please see my model for more information. The base case is a scenario that holds the Street's estimates provided by Capital IQ. I consider this scenario as more of a conservative guidance. Here is the list of the underlying assumptions: The next three years' CAGR in sales is expected to be ~5.1% (5.1% in fiscal 2016, 5.7% in 2017, and 4.3% in 2018). This translates into values of $4.4B in 2016, $4.65B in 2017, and $4.85B in 2018. Note that the company's fiscal year ends in March, which means that fiscal 2015 has recently ended. An average EBITDA margin of 32.1% in 2016-2018 (growing from 30.8% in 2016 to 33.3% in 2018): $1.35B in 2016, $1.49B in 2017, and $1.62M in 2018. Exit EBITDA multiple of 14.0x-18.0x in Q4 2018. This range is above the median figure of 9.0x and the average figure of 10.5x, as found in the comp set: In all scenarios, I use a 9.8% discount rate (currently, the weighted-average cost of capital, as calculated by the CAPM model, is 7.9%). The discount rate is reasonable for a publicly-traded company in the industry where Electronic Arts operates. (Source: Capital IQ. Calculations by author) Note: the percentages indicate an upside move in the share price from the Friday's close of $73.47 required for the stock to reach the fair value range. The base case implies that the stock is currently trading at fair value. This means that if investors buy the stock at current price levels, they should expect a 10%+ annual return without any downside protection (i.e. no margin of safety). 6% CAGR in revenues over the next three years. This CAGR in the top line is comparable with a historical average rate of 5.4% over the last 4 years (2011-2015). The company provided a meager revenue growth projection of 1.9% for fiscal 2016, according to the most recent annual report (slide 3). An average EBITDA margin of 33% over the same period of time: 31.50% in fiscal 2016, 33.00% in fiscal 2017, and 34.50% in fiscal 2018. These assumptions translate into the following values: $1.39B in 2016, $1.54B in 2017, and $1.72B in 2018. (Source: Capital IQ. Calculations by author) Note: The percentages indicate an upside move in the share price from the Friday's close of $73.47 required for the stock to reach the fair value range. According to this scenario, the stock is undervalued by about 5%-7%. If we consider the above assumptions reasonable, we should go long and remain long for the next three years. The pessimistic case's assumptions are as follows: CAGR of 3% in the top line for the next three fiscal years. Average EBITDA margin of 29% in 2015-2017 ($1.16B in 2016, $1.29B in 2017, and $1.42B in 2018). This margin is about 4% higher than what the company demonstrated in fiscal 2015. (Source: Capital IQ. Calculations by author) Note: The percentages indicate an upside move in the share price from the Friday's close of $73.47 required for the stock to reach the fair value range. The downside price risk does not encompass the 10% expected rate of return as presented by the discount rate. Adjusting the price range for the expected rate of return would substantially erase the downside potential. This means that there is not enough magnitude in the potential price decline to trigger a SELL recommendation in this scenario. (Source: Capital IQ, Google Finance , NASDAQ . Infographics by author) Note: The book value of Electronic Arts' equity is $9.73 per share ($3,036M divided by 312.1M shares outstanding). This can be considered as a "floor price" per Electronic Arts' share. I issue a BUY recommendation on the shares of Electronic Arts Inc. with a target price range of $78.7-$83.7, which represents a 7%-14% upside opportunity in the next twelve months. Investors may expect a lot more, depending on how well they can predict cash flows from either revenue segment (or product). On the other hand, I do not think the possibility of the pessimistic scenario is high; in other words, I believe chances of EBITDA slipping below the levels shown in fiscal 2015 are rather slim. In any case, let us apply the following distribution of outcomes to the presented three cases: (Source: Capital IQ. Infographics by author) Assuming that the base scenario carries the most weight in the distribution (as the most reasonable), while the other two cases carry equal weights: If investors want a specific price rather than a range, I recommend using the $80.00-per-share mark as a benchmark for expected returns.
