A Tectonic Shift In Japanese Politics After The Earthquakes Could Affect The Yen | Seeking Alpha I agree with expert consensus that the economic impact of the recent earthquakes should be limited. Nevertheless, the disaster has taken the attention off of the economy and the Bank of Japan, so the Abe administration can get aggressive again with its policies encouraging inflation. I believe the governments genuine concern with the debt and irregularities in the government bond market won't stop them from using fiscal stimulus very soon. I expect the Fed's speech in April to be more hawkish than expected, and the Japanese government to announce a stimulus package after the May G7 meeting in Japan. I believe investors are discounting the recent disaster in Japan too much. While the experts seem to agree that the recent earthquakes in Japan might not have a significant effect on Japanese businesses or the economy, they will exacerbate the problems that recent yen strength has created, and I believe they will mark a shift in Japanese politics that will create a weak yen once again. Japan's export-reliant companies are suffering from the strong yen. The recent disaster should hurt them more. Source Even though the Bank of Japan has been hesitant to do more ever since becoming the target of widespread criticism after introducing negative interest rates, the Abe administration could still run a larger budget deficit and increase government spending to pour more yen into the system. This seemed politically impossible because of the increased attention people had been paying to Japan's government debt problem. The introduction of negative interest rates has lowered volumes and increased volatility in the Japanese government bond market, and everyone is aware that the Bank of Japan cannot stop buying government bonds and run the risk of having the interest rates on those bonds rise, since this would make paying interest on the debt an impossible proposition. People are also worried that buyers will stop showing up to government bond issuances, but I believe these fears are unfounded because it is easy enough for the Japanese government to force the big banks and corporations to attend. Increased volatility and a lack of buyers in the Japanese government bond market are just some of the irregularities that have put pressure on Abe and Kuroda to normalize central bank policy and reduce the deficit. Source All of this lack of confidence in the Bank of Japan and the country's government bond market has lead people to believe that they have run out of ways to weaken the yen and create inflation. Haruhiko Kuroda, the governor of the Bank of Japan, has been appearing regularly in parliament since he introduced negative interest rates, and he has been the subject of great criticism from business leaders and the media for creating so much anxiety. While the political situation had been preventing the government from taking further measures, especially through monetary policy, I believe this disaster will encourage the Abe administration to implement a stimulus package. Before this disaster, Abe had only promised to "front-load budget spending" to boost the economy and had rejected the possibility of extra fiscal stimulus. He was also quite adamant about raising the consumption tax from 8% to 10% on April 1st, 2017, barring a major incident. Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda at the parliament. He's been a mainstay there since the failure of his negative rates had put him in the national spotlight and made him a target for the political opposition. Source I believe this disaster will shake Abe's resolve to start tightening at this point in time, in addition to giving him the political leeway to take extraordinary measures. The Japanese media has shifted away from reporting on the Bank of Japan, the government bond market, and detailed economic figures to report on issues surrounding this incident, like transporting emergency supplies, the state of the infrastructure, water, and power, evacuation and search-and-rescue efforts, the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant (near the earthquakes), and the Abe administration's response. Abe told the parliament that the government will "take every necessary measure" to deal with this situation, refusing to reject a stimulus package outright. After the first earthquake, Shinzo Abe states, "There is not enough food and water in Kumamoto. We will do everything in our power to deal with it." Source Even though Abe seems genuine in wanting to raise the consumption tax, reduce deficits, and get the country on track toward a balanced budget, I do not believe he would willingly give the political opposition ammunition against him by not doing enough. He also might doubt the ultimate wisdom of tightening right now, considering a great number of very influential Western economists have been advising him against it. On March 22nd, for example, Paul Krugman advised the Japanese government that they " ought to spend without concern for budget deficits for two or three years." Paul Krugman, after his meeting with the Japanese government. He told Abe to encourage inflation with more government spending, now that the Bank of Japan needs to take a break for political reasons. Source If there is significant fiscal stimulus and a delay in raising the consumption tax, this should boost consumer spending and economic activity enough to create inflation and yen weakness. In addition, insurance payments to the afflicted areas "may exceed $7B," which should also contribute to extra spending. On top of this, losses from disrupted supply chains and damaged factories will weaken corporate earnings even further, encouraging the government to take extraordinary measures to ensure yen weakness. I believe the extent of these easing measures will be revealed strategically after the G7 summit in Japan on May 26th and 27th. Yen movement may be lacking a definitive direction until then, but should weaken decisively if fiscal stimulus is much larger than expected. I believe the safest way to bet on yen weakness is with the Gartman Gold/Yen ETF (NYSEARCA: GYEN ), which allows you to buy gold with yen. With this ETF, you don't have to worry about what other central banks are going to be doing. Another way to play this is by shorting the Japanese Yen Trust ETF (NYSEARCA: FXY ), or buying put options on it. This is a bet that the yen will weaken against the US dollar. Put options on this ETF would limit your risk while providing you with extraordinary upside potential. If you believe that the Fed futures market is underestimating the chance of a Fed rate hike in June (currently only giving it a 13% chance), or if you believe the Fed's statement after their April meeting will be more hawkish than expected, then this is the way to go. Buying the $85.00 put option expiring in June or September will provide extraordinary returns if the yen weakens significantly by then. The riskiest way to bet on yen weakness against the US dollar is with the UltraShort Yen ETF (NYSEARCA: YCS ). Timing is key for ETFs like this one, but if you are unable to go short or buy options, then this might be a good bet.
