For Shoppers, Itâ€™s Not What Gas Costs Now, It’s What It Will Cost Tomorrow  - Real Time Economics - WSJ Ever since gasoline prices began falling in earnest last summer, economists expected consumers to go out and splurge on other items. Instead, shoppers played hard to get with retailers ( except for auto dealers ).Â  From November through February, while pump prices were generally falling, store sales excluding autos and gasoline went nowhere. It was not until March that sales popped up . A survey of consumers done by credit card issuer Visa offers one explanation for the lackluster shopping performance.Â Â  â€œWhat drives consumer spending are expectations of future gas prices, not prices today,â€? said Wayne Best, Visaâ€™s chief economist. Because consumers thought last yearâ€™s pump plunge was temporary, Mr. Best said they chose to save the windfall or use it to pay down debt. According to Visa, only 30% of households spent the savings elsewhere. Â Mr. Best said younger adults were most likely to spend the savings. The notion that future expectations drive current spending isnâ€™t confined to gas prices. Consumers also make current buying decisions depending on what they think their incomes will do in the future, not just what their present earnings look like. Gasoline prices bottomed out in January and are up about 60 cents since then. No surprise, then, that 70% of consumers in the Visa survey think gas prices will continue to increase and consequently consumers modified their spending habits, Mr. Best said. To gauge consumer spending, Visa created a Retail Spending Monitor that uses data from the companyâ€™s payment network. Ahead of the Commerce Departmentâ€™s April retail report on May 13, Visa estimates nonauto, nongas retail sales were up 4.5% in April compared with year-ago spending, down from theÂ  5.3% gain posted in March. Still, Mr. Best is optimistic about consumers, forecasting their inflation-adjusted spending will increase 3.2% in 2015, better than the 2.5% increase in 2014. Consumers are more confident and jobs and the economy overall. â€œConsumers are finally ready to start spending their gas savings,â€? he said.
