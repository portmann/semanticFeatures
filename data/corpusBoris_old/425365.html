Xylem Is A Solid International Water Infrastructure Play - Xylem, Inc. (NYSE:XYL) | Seeking Alpha Xylem operates through two segments: Water infrastructure and applied water. Aging water infrastructure internationally presents a major opportunity. The Flygt Concertor, Xylem's newest product, is the world's first wastewater pumping system with Integrated intelligence. With increases in investments in water infrastructure expected across the globe, analyst estimates of 11% CAGR may be understating Xylem's growth potential. In October 2011, ITT Corporation spun off their water-related businesses, and Xylem was born. Xylem (NYSE: XYL ) is now in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and is an S&P 500 Component with a market cap of $8.18 billion. The company is broken down into two segments : Pump systems to transport water from aquifers, lakes, rivers and seas Water treatment using ultraviolet and ozone systems Wastewater transport from institutions to treatment facilities Treatment processing with mixers, biological treatment, monitoring and control systems Xylem provides the infrastructure to bring water full circle, from sources to consumers and businesses and then to treatment facilities. The company estimates their "served market size in this sector to be approximately $21 billion." This segment deals with all uses of water: drinking, HVAC, fire protection, irrigation, etc. The company estimates their served market size in this sector to be approximately $16 billion. Why am I excited about this company? A few months ago I wrote an article that provides a look at the current state of America's aging water infrastructure and exigency toward the issue. With the EPA spearheading an effort to secure investments in the area, I pegged American Water Works (NYSE: AWK ), Aqua America (NYSE: WTR ) and SJW Corp (NYSE: SJW ) as the companies to take advantage of the Water Infrastructure and Innovation Act ( WIFIA ), which "authorizes financing for water-related infrastructure of national or regional significance and authorizes the EPA to provide federal credit assistance to eligible entities." Xylem also has positioned itself to become a major player in the coming years and a top candidate for providing the actual pipe assets (thanks to topper1296 who brought this company to my attention in a comment on my last article). The EPA recently addressed the issue by requesting $2.3B for the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Resolving Funds, with over $1B going toward replacing and repairing infrastructure. For some context, water requires more capital investment per dollar of revenue than any other utility, at 2.8x vs. electric, the next highest at 1.9x. Xylem could benefit from an increase in spending on infrastructure both domestically and internationally. They are located in 150 countries. The OECD estimates that by 2025 water will account for the majority of global infrastructure investment, with $1 trillion in spending by the BRIC nations alone. Xylem is producing innovative solutions to the world's aging water infrastructure and could earn the lion's share of investments if they are able to scale to accommodate the demand. American Water Works President and CEO Susan Story said , "In this country, 44% of America's water infrastructure will be considered poor, very poor, or life elapsed." In 2013, The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) released a report condemning our drinking water infrastructure as well. The pipes that carry our drinking water do not last forever. They break down over time due to corrosive soil and shifting geography. The ASCE says that there are an estimated 240,000 water main breaks per year. Xylem launched the Flygt Concertor , the world's first wastewater pumping system with Integrated Intelligence, at the IFAT 2016 trade show this past week in Munich. The purpose of creating this "smart" pump was to optimize energy consumption and minimize lifecycle costs. Critics of the pump cite the expensive price tag and complexity of installation, operation and maintenance. Proponents believe that the reduction in maintenance and operation costs, coupled with an increase in efficiency and quality result in an overall lower cost of ownership than traditional pumps. "Tight environmental regulations designed to reduce greenhouse gas and carbon emissions lend significant support to the smart pumps market," said Frost & Sullivan Industrial Automation & Process Control Research Analyst Niranjan Paul. "This includes the Euro 2020 directive, which targets a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the levels experienced in 1990, and the Ecodesign directive that sets rigorous ecological requirements for energy-related products sold across Europe." Field tests across the globe have returned positive results : Energy savings of up to 70 percent compared to a conventional pumping system by consistently operating at the lowest possible energy level. Reduced inventory of up to 80 percent due to flexible performance - the system self adjusts or can be adapted to suit different conditions, without changing the impeller or motor size. This versatility eliminates the need for pump station managers to keep large inventory stocks. A built-in sump and pipe cleaning function - a world first for a wastewater pumping system delivering clog-free pumping and clean wet wells saving up to 80 percent in vacuum cleaning costs. Xylem is trading at an all-time high, and the optimism toward the increase in infrastructure investment in the U.S. seems to be fairly priced in given the risk. The stock is trading 39% over its historical multiple (PE = 24.07), resulting in an industry-average earnings yield of 4.16%, a book to market of 0.2654, and a lackluster dividend yield of 1.27%. However, the high share price is partially justified by strong fundamentals. Five-year ROE is 17.37%, even with relatively low debt compared to the industry. Debt/equity is 1.457, and long-term debt is 3.653x average net income (five years). I am bullish on Xylem because I believe the company is in a good position to capitalize on the world's aging water infrastructure. In addition, they are well diversified, with significant operating capacity devoted to water usage rather than infrastructure. With increases in investments in water infrastructure expected across the globe, analyst estimates of 11% CAGR may be understating Xylem's growth potential.
