Helen Of Troy Set To Beat Revenue Estimates - Helen of Troy Limited (NASDAQ:HELE) | Seeking Alpha Helen of Troy is set to announce Q1 earnings after the market closes on Wednesday, July 8. The Street is looking for EPS of $1.02 on revenues of $337.69 million for the quarter. Helen of Troy Ltd. (NASDAQ: HELE ) is set to announce earnings after the market closes on Wednesday, July 8 . The Street is looking for EPS of $1.02 on revenues of $337.69 million for the quarter. We are bullish on HELE heading into earnings, forecasting a beat on the topline and a meet on the bottom-line. When looking at HELE, it is important to understand the company's four operating segments: Housewares, Healthcare/Home Environment, Nutritional Supplements, and Personal Care. The household product industry includes the following sectors: appliances, furnishings, housewares, electronics and home-building. Primary industry concerns include fuel costs, other input costs and international competition. Further environmental instability comes from exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, as well as variable employment levels and consumer disposable income levels. In order to adapt to this instability, companies in this industry resort to price increases and cost-savings initiatives. The Household Electronics industry has been primarily affected by globalization and outsourcing. Consumer use of these electronics continues to rise, but spending is marginal due to product price decreases. The Home Furnishings market includes flooring, furniture and textiles. This highly concentrated sector competes through efficient marketing, merchandising and volume purchasing. Consumer disposable income directly correlates to sales, which corresponds to market concentration and price wars. The Homebuilding sector feeds off of low-interest rates and, as such, has yet to fully recover from the housing crisis almost a decade ago. The industry does account for half the construction sector and is returning to prosperity now post-crisis-recovery where homes are no longer in surplus. The Household Appliances sector has been thriving alongside the US housing market. Huge brand success can be attributed to large acquisitions and mergers in recent years; however, Asian manufacturers continue to acquire more market share. As a whole market, we believe these consumer goods face short-term issues like lack of activity. Given this, we believe it would be overly bullish to expect even higher growth rates than the company sported during its "breakout year" in fiscal 2015. Historically, HELE has proven relatively predictable with an upward trend and is now institutionalizing company-wide organized and efficient strategies that resulted in margin expansion in fiscal 2015. In the Personal Care sector, HELE is benefiting from a new experienced management team implementing consumer focused and margin targeting strategies. These strategies have slowed the sector's annual decline in growth. Despite industry-wide declines in the Personal Care sector, HELE is differentiating itself from its competitors through core brand reinforcement, decreasing SKU count, and intensified consumer research, which has sparked innovation. HELE Beauty announced (during a release) that a unique innovative personal care product will be launched around the end of summer 2015. Give these initiatives, we believe the Personal Care sector will approach topline stability and eventual growth in fiscal 2016. Helen of Troy has announced promising developments in recent news releases. Most apparent are the company's steadfast efforts to eliminate poor performing products and to enter high margin categories within their existing sectors. Additionally, all HELE industries will focus efforts on core brands and invest in innovative products derived from consumer research and technology advancements. These actions are being implemented companywide in order to secure customer loyalty and increase efficiency. Specifically, the houseware sector will capitalize on increased leverage, new consumables and less corporate overhead to maximize operating income. Healthy Directions success in auto delivery in fiscal 2015 will result in financial benefits to Q1 revenue by integrated synergies and accretion from 2015 Q4 investments. These initiatives will support Helen of Troy's revenue growth, stock price performance, earnings per share increases, efficient cash flow spending and goals for higher margin. Combined with historical performance, reasonable decline from fiscal 2015 earnings, 2015 Q1 results, and the auspicious developments of recent announcements, we are modeling for net sales to increase 10.00% YoY to $343.73 million with EPS up $0.42 to an estimated $1.02. Although Q1 is not seasonally strong for HELE, strong momentum and benefits from fiscal 2015 investments will boost this fiscal year's revenue, including Q1. EPS will be down sequentially due to seasonality, but up YoY. In fiscal 2015, the first quarter was the only quarter to not beat earnings estimates.
