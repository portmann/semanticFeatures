"Zero Hedge long ago gave up discussing corporate fundamentals due to our long-held tenet that currently the only relevant pieces of financial information are contained in the Fed's H.4.1, H.3 statements... macro economic data now is essentially one big joke." "we have been saying since day one [...] that when it comes to securities price formation in a centrally-planned regime, it is flow not stock that matters." Those were the rantings of a "tinfoil hat-wearing", "conspiracy theory-heavy" website, which dared to speak up time and again against widely-accepted economic and financial dogma, which has been the foundation of the Fed's flawed experiment now in its 8th year. Here is what the global head of credit strategy at Citigroup just said this last Friday. If there were any lingering doubt, this weekâ€™s gyrations demonstrate neatly that it is central bank liquidity, not  fundamentals, driving markets. It is the flow, not the anticipated stock, of QE which counts. ... Central bank policy pronouncements are almost the exclusive driver of market movements at the moment, not fundamentals. Almost all the fixed income investors we meet bought into this idea some time ago â€“ perhaps unsurprising, given the extent to which credit spreads have been diverging from corporate leverage, and seem likely to continue to do so even as leverage rises further (Figure 4). In equities, there are still a few holdouts â€“ but the longer that downward revisions to earnings revisions are met with record highs in markets (Figure 5), the more widely accepted the idea becomes. ... In govies, it has been slightly harder to fathom what is going on â€“ but what remains clear is that it doesnâ€™t have much to do with fundamentals. No wonder the backup in US yields is now fading when it occurs against the most protracted period of negative economic surprises since 2011 (Figure 6). Each successive monthâ€™s disappointment on retail sales adds to the likelihood that consumersâ€™ appetite for spending vs saving has fundamentally altered â€“ not just that the benefits from the oil price drop are a little slow to feed through (Figure 7). ... with central bank liquidity the ultimate source of all market movements, investors [are] forced to shun fundamentals and instead hang on the central banksâ€™ every word. At some point, of course, the risk is that the taps are turned off: recent speeches from Yellen, Draghi and others do demonstrate an increasing unease with market behaviour, and an increased emphasis on financial stability and the need for structural reforms. But with the underlying economy still weak, and vulnerable to a sharp sell-off in markets, we fear they will find that mangling, once started, is hard to stop. Particularly when they remain at least partly in denial as to the extent of it. And since the market no longer exists, and soon, courtesy of double seasonally adjusted "data" economic reporting and analysis will be just as meaningless, soon the Fed, having destroyed trading as we know it not to mention the US middle class, will also succeed in ending financial reporting once and for all.

Congressional dysfunction and partisan warfare have made the possibility of economic recovery through fiscal measures or other legislative initiatives remote; monetary policy and the Federal Reserve have become the last hope. The Fed has responded energetically with initiatives such as quantitative easing (buying bonds in large amounts to push down long-term interest rates), which was an unprecedented and massive exercise in policy innovation. As the financier Mohamed El-Erian observed in 2012, the Fed and other major central banks were "neck deep in extreme policy experimentation mode." As a result, the two salient features of the economic crisis have been political gridlock and technocratic entrepreneurship. Compare this to the nation's response to last major economic crisis, the Great Depression. In those days, it was the political class that took the initiative, while the Federal Reserve took a secondary role. President Franklin D. Roosevelt himself set the governmentâ€™s tone, working with Congress to pass a battery of legislative initiatives aimed at restoring confidence. "The country needs bold, persistent experimentation,â€? Roosevelt said. â€œTake a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something." Today, the same mantra applies -- but it applies to central bankers, not to politicians. In that sense, the last few years have upended our understanding of the role of central bankers and the reason for central bank independence. Before the crisis, during the years when countries were beginning to take the idea of central bank autonomy more seriously, many people asked how it could be justified in a democratic society. The response from some advocates of central bank independence was straightforward. Banks had a simple goal -- price stability -- and well-established techniques for achieving that goal. They did not engage in much policy innovation and, above all, they were not in the business of picking winners and losers in the economy. In other words, the power that was being given to central banks was limited, so the threat to democratic principles was not substantial. But the game has changed. The objectives of central bank policymaking are no longer so simple: for example, there is an active debate among central bankers about the relative importance of job creation and inflation control. At the same time, the techniques for achieving those goals are less certain. Finally, the Federal Reserve and other major central banks are now unambiguously in the business of picking economic winners and losers. Recent studies have highlighted the extent to which such central bank policies as quantitative easing have conferred big rewards on some groups while penalizing others. A 2012 study by the Bank of England conceded that the benefits of its quantitative easing program "have not been shared equally," with wealthy households benefiting disproportionately. But the critical point is this: although the premises on which U.S. politicians and the public initially accepted the delegation of authority to independent central banks have been blown apart, that delegation persists. In practice, central bankersâ€™ power has broadened, while legislative power has atrophied. And this is true in other countries as well. This is a troubling shift, and it has not gotten the attention it deserves. The people who advocated for central bank independence in the 1980s and 1990s had to make their case explicitly, since, in many countries, they were calling for legislative change. But the current shift has happened in an ad hoc way, under the pressure of the moment, without a compelling explanation of how it can be squared with democratic principles.

What the Hell, we may as well be amused rather than annoyed sifting through the subterfuge, and propaganda, I always say. There is much truth in this story. https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2014-08-11/print-less-transfer-more Today, most economists agree that like Japan in the late 1990s, the global economy is suffering from insufficient spending, a problem that stems from a larger failure of governance. Central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, have taken aggressive action, consistently lowering interest rates such that today they hover near zero. They have also pumped trillions of dollarsâ€™ worth of new money into the financial system. Yet such policies have only fed a damaging cycle of booms and busts, warping incentives and distorting asset prices, and now economic growth is stagnating while inequality gets worse. Itâ€™s well past time, then, for U.S. policymakers -- as well as their counterparts in other developed countries -- to consider a version of Friedmanâ€™s helicopter drops. In the short term, such cash transfers could jump-start the economy. Over the long term, they could reduce dependence on the banking system for growth and reverse the trend of rising inequality. The transfers wouldnâ€™t cause damaging inflation, and few doubt that they would work. The only real question is why no government has tried them. In theory, governments can boost spending in two ways: through fiscal policies (such as lowering taxes or increasing government spending) or through monetary policies (such as reducing interest rates or increasing the money supply). But over the past few decades, policymakers in many countries have come to rely almost exclusively on the latter. The shift has occurred for a number of reasons. Particularly in the United States, partisan divides over fiscal policy have grown too wide to bridge, as the left and the right have waged bitter fights over whether to increase government spending or cut tax rates. More generally, tax rebates and stimulus packages tend to face greater political hurdles than monetary policy shifts. Presidents and prime ministers need approval from their legislatures to pass a budget; that takes time, and the resulting tax breaks and government investments often benefit powerful constituencies rather than the economy as a whole. Many central banks, by contrast, are politically independent and can cut interest rates with a single conference call. Moreover, there is simply no real consensus about how to use taxes or spending to efficiently stimulate the economy. Steady growth from the late 1980s to the early years of this century seemed to vindicate this emphasis on monetary policy. The approach presented major drawbacks, however. Unlike fiscal policy, which directly affects spending, monetary policy operates in an indirect fashion. Low interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing and drive up the prices of stocks, bonds, and homes. But stimulating the economy in this way is expensive and inefficient, and can create dangerous bubbles -- in real estate, for example -- and encourage companies and households to take on dangerous levels of debt. That is precisely what happened during Alan Greenspanâ€™s tenure as Fed chair, from 1997 to 2006: Washington relied too heavily on monetary policy to increase spending. Commentators often blame Greenspan for sowing the seeds of the 2008 financial crisis by keeping interest rates too low during the early years of this century. But Greenspanâ€™s approach was merely a reaction to Congressâ€™ unwillingness to use its fiscal tools. Moreover, Greenspan was completely honest about what he was doing. In testimony to Congress in 2002, he explained how Fed policy was affecting ordinary Americans: "Particularly important in buoying spending [are] the very low levels of mortgage interest rates, which [encourage] households to purchase homes, refinance debt and lower debt service burdens, and extract equity from homes to finance expenditures. Fixed mortgage rates remain at historically low levels and thus should continue to fuel reasonably strong housing demand and, through equity extraction, to support consumer spending as well." Of course, Greenspanâ€™s model crashed and burned spectacularly when the housing market imploded in 2008. Yet nothing has really changed since then. The United States merely patched its financial sector back together and resumed the same policies that created 30 years of financial bubbles. Consider what Bernanke, who came out of the academy to serve as Greenspanâ€™s successor, did with his policy of â€œquantitative easing,â€? through which the Fed increased the money supply by purchasing billions of dollarsâ€™ worth of mortgage-backed securities and government bonds. Bernanke aimed to boost stock and bond prices in the same way that Greenspan had lifted home values. Their ends were ultimately the same: to increase consumer spending. The overall effects of Bernankeâ€™s policies have also been similar to those of Greenspanâ€™s. Higher asset prices have encouraged a modest recovery in spending, but at great risk to the financial system and at a huge cost to taxpayers. Yet other governments have still followed Bernankeâ€™s lead. Japanâ€™s central bank, for example, has tried to use its own policy of quantitative easing to lift its stock market. So far, however, Tokyoâ€™s efforts have failed to counteract the countryâ€™s chronic underconsumption. In the eurozone, the European Central Bank has attempted to increase incentives for spending by making its interest rates negative, charging commercial banks 0.1 percent to deposit cash. But there is little evidence that this policy has increased spending. The broader global economy, meanwhile, may have already entered a bond bubble and could soon witness a stock bubble. Housing markets around the world, from Tel Aviv to Toronto, have overheated. Many in the private sector donâ€™t want to take out any more loans; they believe their debt levels are already too high. Thatâ€™s especially bad news for central bankers: when households and businesses refuse to rapidly increase their borrowing, monetary policy canâ€™t do much to increase their spending. Over the past 15 years, the worldâ€™s major central banks have expanded their balance sheets by around $6 trillion, primarily through quantitative easing and other so-called liquidity operations. Yet in much of the developed world, inflation has barely budged. To some extent, low inflation reflects intense competition in an increasingly globalized economy. But it also occurs when people and businesses are too hesitant to spend their money, which keeps unemployment high and wage growth low. In the eurozone, inflation has recently dropped perilously close to zero. And some countries, such as Portugal and Spain, may already be experiencing deflation. At best, the current policies are not working; at worst, they will lead to further instability and prolonged stagnation.

Question: to Tylers and ZH community Why is the default bias of High Frequency Trading to ramp markets up (as opposed to down or churning?) If the bulk of HFT profits come from front running orders, why would it matter to them where the market level sat?  It's apparent the algos are programmed to ramp upwards. Why is that so? Unfettered HFT wouldn't exist without government acquiesce. Are the HFT firms simply hand maidens attending to the wishes of their sponsors? Mon, 05/25/2015 - 19:20 | 6130936 foghorn leghorn Oh those HFT algos move in the opposite direction too. Just do what you can to piss off the Fed and its banksters and you'll find out.

You can create as many sell orders as you want. The bid clearing is still what moves the market in otherwise liquid scenario. It's when that liquidity disappears that we see the Market drop. It doesn't matter what the thing is. There's always an offer for everything. Meaning everything has a price. But not everything has a buyer. Mon, 05/25/2015 - 20:29 | 6131109 OC Sure This sounds about right. The principle you are describing applies to all of economics. It is the primacy of demand. Supply is only secondary.  Mon, 05/25/2015 - 20:57 | 6131183 essence that Joe 6 pack isn't in this stock market to any significant degree. Pensions (i.e. 401k's) supposedly can fall back to corporate bonds even if they have dabbled in stocks .... albeit at lower yields. Does HFT exist solely as an avenue to keep pension returns above water? To keep the remnants of the middle class onboard just the same as EBT and other bennies do the lower class. The question stands: Why is HFT allowed to continue? Whom amoung the PowersThatBe does it serve a purpose? Again, I'll state, HFT wouldn't exist without government acquiesce. And not just U.S markets either, although, of course, it's the most egregious example.  We know governments are bought. Ergo, HFT serves the purpose of the ultra-wealthy who lie behind CBs & governments. Why?  One would think they would prefer to herd the masses into govie bonds and drive stocks lower so that they could hoover them up at bargain basement prices. Mon, 05/25/2015 - 20:36 | 6131134 Cloud9.5 As long as the market goes up those tax sheltered annuities and IRAs can boast a profit.  That keeps the money parked in those funds.   Down trends would cause an exit that would feed on itself crashing the market.
