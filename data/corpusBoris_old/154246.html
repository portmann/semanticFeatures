Paylocity: Unjustified Selloff A Buying Opportunity - Paylocity Holding Corp (NASDAQ:PCTY) | Seeking Alpha Paylocity has sold off post earnings and I can't figure out why. The company reported a healthy quarter and plans to stay the course that has built an HCM powerhouse - where's the fire to sell? Growing HCM player Paylocity (NASDAQ: PCTY ) has sold off in a big way since reporting FQ4/15 and FFY15 earnings and I don't really know why. Yes, Paylocity reported some variance in guided eFFY16 EPS but that was broken out on the post earnings investor call as a recognition of amortization and depreciation difference between the company and the Street models. So, certainly - it can't be that, can it? I mean, I just don't get it because everything else reported was stellar financially and everything non-financial reported was in-line with prior guidance and/or spatial norms being reported by peers. Paylocity reported its usual 40% topline growth on the quarter and on the full year - posting record revenues of ~$153 million on the full year. Despite having an R&D spend that was up 56% Y/Y on the fiscal year, which helped yield the company's new enhanced ACA product - a product expected to drive total revenue volumes and ARPU going forward, the company also reported margin expansion across the board. It should be noted on the R&D uptick, this is normal for the space with all HCM names covered by this author reporting huge increases to spend - Paycom (NYSE: PAYC ) reported 103% increase to its Y/Y spend as of Q2/15. Regarding margins, Paylocity noted (broken out from the 10-K filing ): Adjusted recurring gross margin (non-GAAP) increased a whopping 530 bps to 71.8% for the quarter, up from 66.5% for the same period last fiscal year; Recurring gross margins (GAAP) increased 450 bps to 70.7% for the fiscal year, up from 66.2% last fiscal year; Adjusted gross profit (non-GAAP) in the fourth quarter was 23.1 million, representing a gross margin of 57.7% compared to 15 million or 52.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014 - up 550 bps; Adjusted gross profit (non-GAAP) for the fourth fiscal year was 87.2 million representing a gross margin of 57.1% compared to 57 million or 52.5% for the prior year - up 460 bps Margin expansion is something that I'm expecting from Paylocity to continue, as I'm expecting this from competitor and peer Paycom. Paylocity has historically been able to drive margins with maturation as it realizes model leverage on a larger topline. With its seemingly constant new product introductions coming from R&D, the company's version of ARPU has continued to climb over the years. I expect Enhanced ACA, which coincidentally is the exact same name for this product as that at Paycom, to drive both topline volume and profitability per customer going forward. Average recurring revenue per client across Paylocity's client base was $13,900 in fiscal year 2015, up from $12,000 last fiscal year - a very healthy sign for the growing company. It's also important to keep in mind regarding ARPU at Paylocity that the company has very much so been focused on the "land" strategy rather than the "expand" strategy. I believe this to mean that there's plenty of organic opportunity already on the books for better topline expansion and total ARPU. Paylocity did express on the investor call, and I'm totally behind this, a continuation of the current strategy. Paylocity plans to continue business as usual but with the help of a scaled up spending program which will still be kept in line with historically prudent income statement and cash flow management. The company plans to continue to be aggressive with hiring efforts as well as step up its referral channel marketing. This of course is pointing to the large broker channel of 401k advisors, insurance brokers, and TPAs (third-party administrators) from which it receives referrals - a unique advantage I'm happy to see the company try to scale up further. With cash on hand of $81.3 million (total C&CE) and generating healthy amounts of cash from operations I don't see any reason for Paylocity to be reluctant with scale-up efforts. All told, as indicated in the intro, I don't really understand this selloff. HCM is in a secular bull and Paylocity is a fundamentally sound player. I view the current post-earnings selloff as a buying opportunity and recommend that investors consider adding to or initiating a position at current pricing. Disclosure: I am/we are long PCTY, PAYC.
