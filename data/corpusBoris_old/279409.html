I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Under the relatively well-accepted assumption Japan is undergoing yet another period of sustained deflationary/recessionary conditions, this article assumes the BoJ will need to take further action beyond unconventional monetary policy. Recent policy decisions have made it abundantly clear the BoJ has either reached the end of its asset purchasing ability or lacks consensus to continue QE purchases. This article outlines three new "arrows" of monetary reform that the BoJ can take to combat secular stagnation in spite of ineffective fiscal policy. Click to enlargeWhen I lived in Japan, I lived in a rather odd town called Warabi (åŸ¼çŽ‰çœŒã?®è•¨å¸‚), not too far from the Tokyo Metropolitan Area, but far enough to notice significant changes in the lifestyles and customs of the people. On the surface, the town was a typical Japanese suburb, but there was something... flawed with the way the town operated, not least because of the exorbitant local taxes. Going to the local government office to file health insurance, for example, was more of a nightmare than one would usually expect for a bureaucratic office. Picture walls and walls of file cabinets filled to the brim with paper records, as Japanese salarymen shuffle to and fro desperately trying to find the right paperwork in a fruitless endeavor. Unbeknownst to me at the time, I was living in one of the few strongholds of the Nihon KyÅ?san-tÅ? (æ—¥æœ¬å…±ç”£å…š) or Japanese Communist Party (JCP), one of the last Marxist political parties to survive nearly a century of global liberalization. The reason I bring up this anecdote is because I am personally concerned the reactionary Tokyo-based government is taking actions that are increasingly less capitalistic in nature every year. The steady re-nationalization of corporations through direct (å…¬å›£) or indirect (å…¬ç¤¾) ownership, specifically heavy industry and utilities, has gone unabated and uncriticized within Japan for some time; and while, for example, the nationalization of TEPCO ( OTCPK:TKECY ) ( OTCPK:TKECF ) (TYO : 9501) was excusable after the Great East Japan Earthquake, there has been scarce reasoning to nationalize other businesses, other than to manipulate the marketplace and mask reality. The primary mechanism that the incumbent government has been utilising to achieve its aims has been through the Bank of Japan. Despite the reluctance and indignation with which Japan's bank governors have historically viewed requests by the government to "stimulate" the economy, since the appointment of Haruhiko Kuroda (é»’ç”°æ?±å½¦) in 2013, the desires of the government have gone through with little resistance, leading many to quietly speculate that the appointment of the former currency chief to bank chair was merely a ploy to achieve the government's aims, i.e. to prioritise the profits of "TNCs" (trans-national corporations) via driving the yen weaker through quantitative easing. For a brief overview, in the name of combating secular stagnation, the BoJ has been pumping up the Japanese equity markets for nearly two decades now, injecting a constant stream of forced liquidity through "ZLB" (zero lower bound) interest rate policy and massive scheduled asset purchases. However, despite these efforts of the central bank to encourage economic stability, the only objectives that the BoJ has indeed managed to reach is the weakening of the yen and full employment, yet extensive debate of course surrounds that subject as well. Thanks to the BoJ's persistent QE policy, the economy now sits in an unusual position, having achieved full employment but coupled with tepid capital investment, poor wage growth, and dismal household consumption. Indeed, this trend is most visible in the behavior of investors and movement of capital in and out of Japan. According to official UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) data on investment/capital flows, Japan is now the highest-ranking country for foreign direct investment, or FDI, outflow-to-inflow ratio, at over ~$140B in FDI outflows with a ratio of ~67.5. Of course, focusing on the past and present of Japan's macroeconomic trends is important, but even more important is - what can the Bank of Japan do right now to improve the situation, because as it stands, if the BoJ continues its slow drip-feed of liquidity injections into the economy, nothing will improve. "When Virgil guided Dante through Hell, he at least knew how to get out. Japan doesn't have a clue." - Peter Schiff, Euro Pacific Capital Contrary to recent comments by former Finance Ministry currency chief GyÅ?ten, the BoJ is not out of options to "stimulate" the economy, and clearly, relying on the Abe administration/LDP (Liberal Democratic Party) to enact fiscal policies that would be death sentences for their political careers is like waiting for a raindrop in a drought. So, the BoJ could introduce three new "arrows" of monetary policy to combat recent deflationary and recessionary trends, and slowly but surely dig itself out of this decades-long monetary mess. The first objective the BoJ needs to set, which unfortunately may require some amount of government cooperation, is to take steps to reduce financial leverage. Thanks in part to the quantitative easing policies, indebted or insolvent entities may still operate on high levels of leverage, which naturally fuels a financial bubble whose bursting leads to debt-deflation and eventual deleveraging, i.e. default; this is generally unavoidable. However, according to the quantity theory of money , the bank can rectify the situation. Forced reduction of leverage in financial markets causes financial instruments to become less attractive; this also induces domestic inflation in consumption goods. For example, by forcefully reducing leverage ratios, via increasing the leverage requirements on banks, such as with the Basel III guidelines, the potential reward/risk ratio from such derivatives skews towards the risk, leading to the desired effect - intentionally stimulated inflation. Long-term interest rates serve as an effective tool for stimulating liquidity, i.e. encouraging financial institutions to lend more freely; however, buying up ETFs and other equity purchases, such as the BoJ has performed since January 2011, have been ineffective at achieving their intended goal. These outright asset purchases are far more dangerous than, for example, buying municipal or corporate bonds, as equities have no redemption date; at some point, they must be sold and it is then extremely risky and greatly impacts investor psychology. Recent policy minutes , in which the BoJ predictably had to increase its ETF purchase quota and REIT maximum before the end of the year, left investors angered at further meddling in the equity market. This policy must be stopped, as there is no evidence it has helped stabilise the Japanese economy and its legality within the framework of the central bank's mandates is questionable at best. In regards to interest rate policy, as the other Advanced Economy central banks did following the BoJ's lead, the bank has at least taken positive steps in decreasing long-term interest rates (albeit perhaps for too long) and serving as a "lender of last resort". According to Bagehot's dictum and elementary monetary theory, during periods of financial distress/panic, central banks should lend freely at a penalty interest rate to solvent borrowers on collateral, i.e. toxic loans and other assets, and decrease long-term interest rates to encourage further lending, which the BoJ has sensibly done. However, the BoJ has also been too plodding and pedantic in enacting interest rate policy, following basic rules and conservative targets, exacerbating illiquid economic conditions. From Monetary Policy and the Dangers of Deflation: Lessons from Japan , "...the [BoJ] policy rule respects the Taylor principle and is forward-looking. Such a rule was regarded as best practice at the time and was also followed by other central banks...it follows that monetary policy was not solely responsible for the economy's poor performance. However, the Bank's orthodox policy rule had an Achilles' heel. Aiming for a low inflation level and responding to the economy according to the standard Taylor rule provided insufficient insurance against the contractionary shocks that occurred over the 1990s. Moreover, when I run a counterfactual simulation with the 1990s estimated policy rule but with the large shocks that occurred over the 1970s, the economy also goes into a liquidity trap. This finding suggests that the Bank's policy rule did not provide sufficient insurance against the type of shocks that occurred in two out of three decades." - Daniel Leigh, Dep't. of Economics, John Hopkins Univ. If the BoJ had, for example, set higher inflationary goals (e.g. 3%), with more aggressive, acute policy actions, the BoJ could have avoided the zero lower bound and liquidity trap entirely! This should serve as a lesson that following basic theories and formulas like the Taylor rule is important, but is not the be-all-end-all. Further discretion, plurality, and advanced dynamic systems models must be used in monetary policy decision making. In a previous article , I explained in detail about how the government/bank created a massive "deficit financing bond" feedback loop and how Japanese financial institutions had regrettably gotten tied up in the mess. However, as many economists and speculators in the public blogosphere have quipped lately, what's to stop governments from simply pressing the "Delete" button on their debts with central banks, as ultimately, both institutions are part of the "public sector". In essence, such an action would create a pseudo-consolidated public sector balance sheet, at least to the extent that such a policy was pursued. "...consider what would happen if the bonds held by the central bank were cancelled, instead of being one day sold back into the private sector. Under this approach, the long-run restraining effect of bond sales would also be cancelled, so there should be an immediate stimulatory effect on nominal demand in the economy. If done without amending the path for the budget deficit itself, this would increase the expansionary effects of past deficits on nominal demand, and would also reduce the outstanding burden of public debt associated with such deficits." - Gavyn Davies of Financial Times The only reason such an option has not been publicly considered by central bank policy makers has been the fear of highly inflationary consequences that such an elimination of central bank capital would induce; after all, many of those policy makers grew up in the days of Paul Volcker and the fight against inflation. However, I would warn those policy makers - the effects of debt-deflation can be just as terrible, if not worse. In spite of ineffective political leaders and the opinions of certain members of the Japanese monetary experts, there are significant measures that the BoJ can take to combat secular stagnation and lift the country out of the deficit bond mess. By reducing financial leverage, following aggressive interest rate policy, eliminating equity purchases as a consideration entirely, and restructuring the public debt, the BoJ does have the ability to incentivize demand and consumption, which is so desperately needed for investment and capital formation to return to Japan. Ultimately, the success of such measures would also depend greatly on cooperation with the government, but I have high confidence that Kuroda would be able to eventually convince Abe to "return to Earth" and enact serious fiscal and monetary reform.
