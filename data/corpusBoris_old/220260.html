U.S. Third-Quarter GDP – At A Glance - WSJ TheÂ  U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.5% Â in the third quarter of the year, theÂ Commerce DepartmentÂ said Thursday, matching the estimates of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. That was off from theÂ  second quarter’s torrid 3.9% growth rate . Compared with the same quarter a year ago, the economy grew 2%, the slowest pace of growth since the first quarter of 2014.The number, while not spectacular, suggests the economy continues to grow at a steady pace despite the pressures from a strong dollar and weakness abroad. Last winter’s cold weather and the labor slowdown at West Coast ports are distant memories but their impact is still being felt in economic growth numbers. Those January and February disruptions held down growth in personal spending in the first quarter, leading firms to accumulate inventory on their shelves. In the third quarter, those firms sold off that inventory faster than they replenished it. The Commerce Department said the change in private inventories shaved 1.44% off the 1.5% growth rate in the July to September period. That’s a significant headwind but one that should prove temporary. Private domestic investment tumbled at an annualized 5.6% rate in the third quarter, the first drop since the first quarter of 2014, when winter storms held back investment. The latest drop reflects a slowdown in construction of commercial and health-care facilities, the department said. Business research and development and software investment also slowed. But firms invested more in information processing and transportation equipment. The pace of government spending slowed to an annualized 1.7% in the third quarter, down from 2.6% in the second quarter. Much of that increase comes from state and local governments, where spending rose 2.6% over the second quarter. At the federal level, spending was almost flat, rising 0.2%. That reflects a 1.4% drop in federal defense spending offset by a 2.8% increase in nondefense federal spending. Over the past few weeks economists have speculated that the strong dollar and economic weakness overseas, particularly in China, would hold down net exports. Thursday’s report, however, suggested that the U.S. economy has mostly shrugged off trade-related disruptions. Exports rose 1.9% in the third quarter, while imports climbed 1.8%. Net exports subtracted an almost insignificant 0.03% from economic growth. Consumer spending rose 3.2% in the third quarter, a slight pullback from the previous quarter, when it grew 3.6%. But the growth in durable goods spendingâ€”long-lasting items such as washing machines and automobilesâ€”continued strong, rising 6.7% in the quarter. The tailwind provided to the economy from the housing sector eased somewhat in the third quarter. Residential investment added just 0.2 percentage points to overall growth in the July through September period. That’s the smallest contribution from home building and improvements in a year.
