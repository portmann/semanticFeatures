null (Recast with comments from two sources and debate inside cabinet) BRASILIA, June 15 Brazil interim President Michel Temer will propose a time limit for a public spending cap of up to 20 years, signaling a victory for economic hardliners in his cabinet after a more political faction pushed for a shorter period, two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. A third source close to the discussions, which went on until early on Wednesday, had previously told Reuters that Temer was considering a time limit for the spending ceiling until the end of the next presidential term at the start of 2023. The two sources said the terms of the spending cap could be relaxed after 10 years, by which time the government hopes Brazil's public debt situation will have improved. Brazil posted a fiscal deficit of more than 10 percent of gross domestic product last year as its economy slid into the worst recession in decades. After Temer rejected the idea of making the ceiling permanent, Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles pushed for a longer time limit. Other cabinet ministers supported a shorter term to facilitate the approval of the constitutional amendment which is seen as unpopular with ordinary Brazilians. The constitutional amendment requires three-fifths approval from the legislature. Meirelles told Reuters on June 2 that the government would implement a permanent spending cap, via a constitutional amendment, to plug a massive budget deficit in a country struggling to regain investors' confidence. The rapid deterioration of Brazil's public accounts after years of heavy public spending and a sharp drop in revenues due to a recession has cost the country its coveted investment-grade credit ratings.
