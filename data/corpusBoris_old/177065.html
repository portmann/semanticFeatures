Too Hot And Too Cold Is The New Just Right | Seeking Alpha The systemic risk, from the parochial view of some FOMC members, has been mitigated by Janet Yellen's global perspective. The risk inherent in divergent central bank monetary policies in advanced economies has caused a reappraisal of the situation. Investors are being nudged to revalue risk assets based on high real rates of economic growth combined with low real interest rates rather than on QE expectations. Japan's dissatisfaction with the G20's position on China has some justification. Divergent monetary policies in the advanced nations have been predicated on central bankers' perceptions of the state of their own domestic economies in isolation from each other. In the article entitled, " A Mean Reversion to Exter's Inversion ", it was suggested that this parochial view of some members of the FOMC had become a systemic threat to the global economy aka the "Taper Tantrum". The pressure was, therefore, building on the FOMC members with a global perspective to temper the enthusiasm of their more parochial colleagues. America allegedly risks overheating, whilst Europe risks dramatic cooling, and Japan is allegedly "just right". Beneath this level of general perception, however, there are signs of multiple divergence from the overlying consensus that makes up the accepted baseline scenario. Consequently, observers with a true global mandate are more inclined to say that overall economic conditions are "just right", so monetary policy should be kept on hold by all the players; thus avoiding an event horizon at which further divergence becomes self-defeating for all. On the eve of the latest FOMC meeting, the Fed stood alone as the only advanced nation central bank expected to tighten imminently. This expectation had been reinforced at G20 Ankara. The IMF is on record for stating the view that other advanced economies should not follow the Fed with higher interest rates and that the Fed should hold off on rate increases until 2016 at the earliest. Larry Summers has opined that the Fed will be making a " major policy failure " by tightening prematurely. The BIS followed Summers' prognosis, prior to the FOMC meeting, suggesting that tightening by the Fed will induce a global credit crisis by triggering a wave of rate increases by other central banks. The BIS did not, however, advise against this tightening because it believes that central banks should be dealing with the aftermath of QE rather than the aftermath of the "Credit Crunch" at this point in time. The BIS has moved on but the IMF is still either living in the past or in a new depressing future. The FOMC, or rather its less parochial members, also seems to be living in the same universe as the IMF. The latest decision to keep rates unchanged, accompanied by the reference to the current global headwinds and the deflation risks created by them, suggests that Janet Yellen has heeded both Summers' and Lagarde's warnings. The one thing that gives the Fed the room to hold off on interest rate increases is the inflation backdrop. The Fed has never been so far away from meeting its inflation target of 2% established in 2012. This benign inflation picture could also be interpreted as saying that the Fed does not need to act prematurely or even dramatically on interest rate increases. This view seems to resonate with the more balanced position adopted by the OECD in relation to the Fed. Chief Economist Catherine Mann recently opined, "What we want to emphasize is what matters is not whether they move tomorrow or whether they move in December. What matters is the path they take after that and how they communicate it." Applying the overused analogy, conditions are, therefore, "just right" and the stronger economic growth does not risk creating inflation. In theory, this is a great time to buy and hold American risk assets and let real economic growth do the heavy lifting for said asset price valuations. This view also seems to be shared by junk bond legend Michael Milken, who affirmed the OECD's perspective on the path of Fed interest rate increases. Unfortunately, this fundamental principle behind equity investing has been canned ever since central bank QE, rather than fundamental economic analysis, took over as the driver of equity market momentum. A recent survey by Gallup shows that US investors have become addicted to investment analysis based solely on their views of QE rather than true risk-adjusted return evaluation. The shock to this cohort of investors from the FOMC taking away their equity valuation yardstick will be palpable enough to test the Fed's nerve to continue with its rate increasing process. A period of churn in equity markets is, therefore, required for some time to come until investors get over their addiction to QE and then finally concentrate on discounting the impacts of high real rates of economic growth combined with very low (even negative) real interest rates instead. Dips should, therefore, be bought. If producer price inflation is lower than consumer prices, and consumers have money to spend thanks to lower energy prices, then perhaps things (and equity valuations) aren't so bad after all. AB InBev's (NYSE: BUD ) move to buy SABMiller ( OTCPK:SBMRY ) ( OTCPK:SBMRF ) clearly evinces the pricing power that corporations can achieve in this new universe by scaling up. This is presumably the parallel investing universe that central bankers have been nudging markets towards. The problem is that investors' perceptions have not arrived there quite yet. The next task for central bankers is to convincingly nudge them in this direction. The Bank of England is closely shadowing the Fed . The latest MPC decision to stay on hold was framed by comments immediately after the announcement made by Martin Weale and Kristin Forbes that the next move in interest rates will be up. Governor Carney then took back the sense of urgency and pressure on UK interest rates by suggesting that early 2016 was the most likely take-off period. Carney thus slipped the Bank of England back into the Fed's slipstream. In practice, he now has the policy option of being able to tighten without waiting for the Fed to go first. All these comments were undermined by the big disclaimer from the latest inflation data , which showed that deflation is an ever present risk. British workers should be rejoicing since the latest wage data shows compensation at a six-year high. They should, therefore, be able to avail themselves of all the bargains on the high street, where inflation is allegedly dead. The latest retail sales data confirms this thesis. But why would the Bank of England wish to spoil the party since high wages have yet to show up in the CPI data? George Osborne is cutting the fiscal economic driver so that the UK economy only has the consumer to rely on in the absence of a strong global demand for its exports. It was, therefore, fitting that Jeremy Corbyn, a man who wishes to renationalise the Bank of England and print "Helicopter Money", achieved a landslide victory in the Labour Party leadership election. Corbyn has been vilified as a "national security threat" and latterly by Mark Carney ; however, the brand of populism that he espouses represents the seductive rhetoric that will become increasingly attractive in advanced economies, as real economic growth disproportionately rewards capital at the expense of labour. The immediate threat that he presents to Britain is that he will inspire the Scottish devolution question to return. New Labour was killed by the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP), whilst Corbyn's Old New Labour seems more likely to cut a deal with the SNP and hence bring out the worst in the Conservative Party that will make the Scots rebel. No sooner had Corbyn been elected than the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon began to send out smoke signals about the exact conditions for a new referendum. David Cameron will, therefore, face the EU referendum and another Scottish referendum in short order, whilst Corbyn promises to honour cheques that the taxpayer can't guarantee by printing Sterling. To undermine "Corbynomics" and woo the voters, who are themselves consumers and taxpayers, George Osborne will provide tax cuts to feed the consumer growth engine. Mark Carney will oblige by allowing the consumer party to continue for as long as falling commodity prices allow. Sterling and Sterling assets are looking attractive again. Within the Eurozone, the dramatic economic cooling theme generalisation is challenged by the facts on the ground, which show overlying economic growth with divergence between the individual nations. The latest Eurozone industrial production data showed a strengthening economy. Southern European nations such as Italy and Spain , which embraced Germany's demands for fiscal austerity, have rebounded the most. The notorious Spanish real estate market is bubbling again , as Spanish banks, flush with ECB emergency funds and no other place to lend, go back to their old ways. The ECB-driven Eurozone property bubble is not limited to Spain though. In Northern Europe, the Netherlands is abandoning fiscal austerity altogether with an alleged pro-cyclical income tax cut (that is really counter-cyclical), which conflicts directly with Germany's policy of building a fiscal surplus with rising tax receipts. France, which has resisted fiscal austerity so far, is deteriorating . Policy makers ostensibly have no question to answer by adhering to the German fiscally austere framework based on the current Eurozone growth data, or so Germany will argue. Neither has the ECB any cause for further stimulus, or so Germany will also argue, in relation to economic growth. The ECB, therefore, in theory, should be following the Fed higher with interest rates. Once again, as in America, the latest benign inflation picture is framed as a headwind by Mario Draghi in order for him to continue with QE. ECB Governing Council Member Ewald Nowotny signalled that the ECB will press on with some form of expanded QE, presumably predicated on the assumption that deflation remains a significant threat. ECB Governing Council Member Vitor Constancio then kicked the door on QE, that Nowotny had unlocked, wide open. According to Constancio , the ECB has only done about 5% of its QE potential relative to Eurozone GDP, compared to the 25% relative to US GDP by the Fed and the 64% relative to Japanese GDP by the BOJ. European risk asset prices, therefore, have the potential to massively overshoot on the upside because of the pro-cyclical monetary policy stance from the ECB. The risk of overheating is, therefore, the greatest in Europe. Germany, however, is alert to this risk and is moving swiftly to mitigate it. The Eurozone is rapidly becoming an economic battleground between the Bundesbank and the ECB. This thesis is supported by the latest partisan stance taken by France's ECB member Benoit Coeure who opined that, although there is real economic growth in the Eurozone, this is sub-optimal. This battle within the ECB is echoed by the mirror image across the respective finance ministries involved. The renewed push towards greater fiscal integration is trying to bind economies which are fundamentally diverging even tighter together. Something, therefore, has to give. The emerging conflict between France and Germany over the basis of greater European integration took on a wider dimension as Germany opened up a second front of the conflict directly with the EU in Brussels. Not only does Germany reject the French Finance Minister Macron's Keynesian vision of a collective European Treasury transferring wealth from the strongest to the weakest, but it also rejects the principle of direct government from Brussels. The second German front with the EU was opened up by Klaus Regling, the head of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), who outlined yet another version of how fiscal integration will be engineered. Regling's vision seems to be more in line with the German view than Macron's. He envisions a European Treasury that is legitimised by a new separate political chamber and that mirrors the democratic principles in the 19 member nations it represents. Mr. Regling said that any transfer of budgetary powers should occur without "permanent fiscal transfers or further debt mutualisation" - both concepts which are red lines in Berlin. Regling was ably supported by his fellow countrymen, who signalled that Germany is in principle open to mutual risk sharing in the banking sector on the condition that national governments put their own taxpayers on the hook to shoulder the lion's share of the burden first. The scale of the conflict between France and Germany has been exacerbated by the divergence in their relative economic performance to date. Germany currently risks economic overheating , as its latest trade and fiscal surpluses show. Germany, therefore, requires a tighter fiscal and monetary policy than France, where the economic recovery has not been as strong and which now shows signs of deterioration. Wolfgang Schaeuble has used a combination of clever tautology and sound economic theory to try and deflect the criticism of the German position. He has made the case that Germany is the epitome of Keynesian orthodoxy by creating a fiscal surplus in times of economic strength. France would like to get its hands on said German fiscal surplus via the unified European Treasury. Germany, however, argues that France should create its own surplus by following German policies. Angela Merkel gave the German game away when she said that Germany was creating a fiscal surplus to mitigate "newly emerging risks". Merkel clearly expects the worst. Wolfgang Schaeuble provided a little more clarity on what these risks may involve when he extemporised off-piste from a prepared text and opined that "it is certain that we are moving towards the next bubble". German attempts to mitigate this bubble through tighter monetary and fiscal policies may ultimately create an economic slowdown in its weaker trade partners. The evasion of the German bubble will, therefore, come at a great cost to its weaker partners, especially the French. An irate Schaeuble broke his usual measured demeanour by audibly demanding that America back off from its meddling behaviour in European financial affairs to reverse the German strategy of enforced fiscal austerity across the Eurozone. To demonstrate that there is more substance to Schaeuble's bubble rhetoric, the Bundestag moved to legislate more national control of its banking system through the Finance Ministry, a move which directly vitiates against the European strategy of greater unity through a unified Eurozone Treasury. Not only has Germany built in a redundancy that provides it with greater autonomy and flexibility in the case of another banking crisis, but it has also sown the seeds of the said crisis by removing a pillar of support for the unified European banking system. The risk premiums in the Euro and Eurozone risk assets, therefore, remain under pressure from the economic and political conflict between an "overheating" Germany and a rapidly cooling France, and then all those other fissile divergent heterogeneous national economies in between. Meanwhile, the ECB remains on hand to reduce these risk premiums through further QE buying. The last report in the series highlighted the centripetal force that the EU's enforced immigrant quotas and Germany's leading from the front on immigration was having upon further European integration. Chancellor Merkel swiftly retreated under a challenge on the immigration issue from within her own government. She was swiftly followed by the lawmakers effectively sealing Germany's borders to immigrants. Both events signal that domestic political sentiment is overwhelmingly against further immigration which translates into less European integration. Germany is, therefore, now in the absurd position of taking the lead on anti-immigration policy, having initially taken the Kantian moral and ethical high ground in favour of it. Germany's principled stance in favour of immigration, however, is not without its own pecuniary motivation. Germany sees a great opportunity to recruit cheap workers who do not qualify for the generous mandatory perks of European national employees courtesy of European Union labour law from the ranks of the incoming migrants. Jens Weidmann was swift to articulate the productivity benefits that the immigrants could bring. The German motivation was evinced by the eponymously named town of Pfungstadt , which is offering immigrants work for one Euro an hour. The conclusion is that German productivity of the future can only be delivered by immigration from outside the Eurozone. This conclusion, therefore, strongly circumscribes Germany's intentions and capabilities on deeper European integration going forwards. Germany could have lived with QE at the ECB's "zero bound" without overheating if its borders were open to cheap non-EU labour. Now it will wish to tighten monetary and fiscal policy because unit labour costs are under pressure from xenophobic German workers. The one consolation for Germany from the U-turn on immigration may come in the form of further Eurozone integration along its prescribed lines on fiscal austerity. The rise in Eurozone risk premiums in currency and asset prices has, therefore, been tempered by the U-turn on immigration. The hardening of attitudes on immigration is hardening the Euro. (Source: Madama Butterfly, New Zealand Opera - link ) Japan's economy is allegedly "just right" based on Governor Kuroda's verdict; however, this generalisation is contradicted by the facts too. In the last report, entitled " The Blind Guiding The Blind From G20 To Dalian ", Japan was noted as the next volatility shoe to fall in the global markets. Current perceptions amongst analysts hold the consensus view that the BOJ's next move will be a monetary easing next month. No doubt this conviction has been strengthened by the recent downgrade of Japan by Standard and Poor's from AA- to A+ based on its stated opinion that "We believe the likelihood of an economic recovery in Japan strong enough to restore economic support for sovereign creditworthiness commensurate with our previous assessment has diminished". This consensus view on the next easing is strongly contradicted by Governor Kuroda, who recently opined that target inflation of 2% will soon be achieved. Kuroda also made it clear, as have many other developed nation central bankers, that he is looking through the deflation being caused currently by falling oil prices. In fact, he made it abundantly clear that any decision about easing by him will not be influenced by falling oil prices. Kuroda, therefore, clearly risks creating greater volatility by continuing to stubbornly hold out against easing until those who expect him to ease capitulate and liquidate all risk-on positions in Japan predicated on further easing. The risk inherent in his strategy was evinced when the BOJ kept policy unchanged at its latest meeting on the eve of the FOMC meeting. Far from being madness, Kuroda was giving himself a free call option on any economic growth provided by the potential for Yen weakening versus the US Dollar created by any future FOMC tightening. If this free option expires worthless, he can then go to the nuclear option of more QE on October 30th, a situation which the majority of observers now expect. Any intervening Yen strength and volatility in equities between now and October 30th just gives him the catalyst and excuse he needs for more QE. The red flag for equities was created by the public pension funds. These institutions had been presented as the new bid for Japanese equities, as they switched their portfolio mix away from traditional bond holdings. This portfolio shift was also supposed to vindicate and affirm the success of Abenomics. Unfortunately, recent data has shown that they have become net sellers of Japanese equities. In the absence of both the international equity bid and domestic pension bid, the thumbs-down verdict on Abenomics is looking unanimous. A further thumbs-down seems to have been given by Japan Inc. also, based on analysis of the recent data , which shows that cash hoarding by companies has reached yet another record. Japan broke with the expedient consensus formed at G20 Ankara by openly criticising China's framing of its current travails as a "managed" hard landing. Japan's Taro Aso openly rejected the veracity and the details of China's explanations of its policy in the face of the intense scrutiny by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew , as China moves to take over at the helm of G20. Japan's position is based on the lack of details in the Chinese communications of its overall economic strategy. The grounds for Japanese suspicion were supported by the latest developments in Chinese strategy for its State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), the location of the economic inefficiency, combined with mountains of unsustainable debt that continue to compound exponentially. This compounding of debt is also evident in the companies listed in Shanghai. The problem with the SOEs has become so acute that the veteran former leader Zhu Rongji has allegedly been consulted about how this elephant in the room can be meaningfully concealed from the eyes of hostile observers. The current situation can be likened to a huge game of three card monte. The Chinese wish to open up their capital account and gain IMF SDR basket entry in order to shovel foreign investment into their dying bankrupt SOEs, whilst at the same time precluding foreign participation in the new domestic growth industries. The current leadership of Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang has lost all credibility at home and abroad, so a new old face is being presented in order to perpetrate the scheme. With the Fed staying on hold and the prospect of more QE from the ECB, the damage that China can do to the developed economies has been limited. Going forward, the next test will be to see if developed economies can be totally insulated from further negative developments in China. If this is framed through the lens of falling commodities being a tailwind for the global economy, then negative developments in China can be presented as positive for the advanced economies. Prudent incremental interest rate increases by the Fed then become buy signals, as they can be presented as normalisation and not tightening.
