I'd now like to turn the call over to Gary Douglas, our Chief Executive Officer. Thanks, Paul and good morning to everyone listening in today and thank you very much for being with us. As is customary, I do have a brief set of prepared remarks, after which we'll open the lines for questions and comments. As I reflect on Fiscal 2015, I believe it represents a year of significant accomplishments, especially compared to the goals we established at the beginning of the year. Several of these accomplishments included record earnings growth. Our reported earnings per share of $1.17 was 33% higher than the $0.88 reported in Fiscal 2014. Excluding the impact of insurance recoveries, our earnings per share would have been $1.06 or 21% higher than Fiscal 2015 and still at record levels. We also delivered outstanding returns in Fiscal 2015 on both average assets and average common equity of 1.01% and 12.09%, respectively. In addition, book value per share grew 9.5%. Secondly, I want to talk a little bit about loan portfolio growth in a challenging growth environment. Our overall loan portfolio grew 7% with our commercial and residential portfolios both growing at that approximate pace. When you consider the relatively low-growth commercial market in which we operate, we're certainly pleased with what our commercial team has accomplished. As it relates to our commercial growth, we were pleased to see that our targeted CNI and owner-occupied CRE portfolios both grew at a 10% clip year-over-year, outpacing the overall portfolio growth rate of 7%. All of the growth in our residential portfolio came in our First-Lien portfolio, principally from several niche adjustable rate products that were well-received in the marketplace and more than offset the expected runoff in our legacy Second and HELOC portfolios. While we saw our overall loan growth moderate in the September 2015 quarter, compared to the June quarter, it had more to do with the outsized June 2015 quarter growth followed by $25 million of commercial payoffs in July 2015. As I've said on numerous occasions, asset generation has not been our problem; instead, it has been the unexpected, unplanned level of payoffs. Thirdly, I would like to talk about our restart of deposit growth. One of our key objectives for Fiscal 2015 was to fund all of our loan growth with deposit growth We accomplished that goal and then some, by growing our deposits 11% for the year. I'll talk a little bit about our outstanding mortgage division performance. Mortgage revenues increased from $3.9 million in Fiscal 2014 to $9.9 million in Fiscal 2015, a 152% increase. The large increase was driven by substantial growth in originations and sales, as well as an 18 basis point improvement in net profit margin. We capitalized on a continuingly favorable refinance market and an improving purchase market. Our ongoing channel diversification, the maturation of our newer loan production offices and the increasing size of our overall loan officer footprint, continue to drive the growth in originations and sales. Of special note was the outstanding first year performance of our consumer direct channel which doubled our level of origination expectation -- $238 million versus $115 million -- and has increased the size of its loan officer footprint from 10 at acquisition to 25 at September 30, 2015. And finally, credit costs remain well under control, as a result of our historical and ongoing quality improvement efforts, asset quality improvement efforts. Non-performing assets declined an additional 31% in Fiscal 2015, lowering the ratio of non-performing assets to total assets to 1.49% at September 30, 2015. Excluding TDRs that are performing in accordance with their modified terms, that ratio falls to 85 basis points. With those comments as a backdrop, I would now like to shift focus to our outlook for Fiscal 2016. While we were extremely pleased with our record earnings growth performance for Fiscal 2015, not surprisingly, we do not expect to be able to replicate it in Fiscal 2016. Given the ongoing intensely-competitive environment for commercial lending and the uncertain outlook of the impact of potential Federal Reserve interest rate moves on funding costs and mortgage originations, especially refinance volumes, our goal for Fiscal 2016 is to deliver a moderate level of earnings growth compared to Fiscal 2015 results, excluding insurance recoveries. We expect that 2016 performance to be driven largely by another year of mid-single-digit loan portfolio growth in both of our commercial and residential divisions, partially offset by an additional year-over-year decline in net interest margin which we do expect, however, to stabilize following a 5 to 8 basis point decline in the first quarter of Fiscal 2016. Also, we expect increased mortgage revenues which are likely to be driven by a slight decline in origination and sales volume, but be more than offset by margin improvements from various profitability improvement initiatives surrounding our conversion to new core loan origination, pricing and sales management systems. We also expect continued low net credit costs and finally, we expect generally-stable overall levels of non-interest expenses, similar to the level recorded in the September 2015 quarter. This concludes my prepared remarks, so at this time, Paul and I will be pleased to respond to any questions you may have. Just talk a little bit more about the mortgage revenue or the mortgage business, like what you're seeing going on into this quarter, just with purchase activity and any slowdown in refi? No, good question. Actually, the refi activity has kind of picked up a little bit more. As long as that 10-year treasury, even though that's not the determining factor, that thing stays in the low 2s, we seem to do very well with refinance activity. And, if anything, I would tell you that in terms of our locked portfolio, that refinance activity has moved up, as opposed to moving down. But, the purchase activity continues to be relatively strong also, although starting to reflect a little bit of seasonality as we get closer to the winter months. But, things look very good. The warehouse continues to remain robust and as usual, our focus is what happens in that March quarter and I will tell you that if interest rates aren't -- if they stay where they are now or close to where they are now, we would expect to be able to minimize the seasonality that we typically expect in that March quarter when you are largely-dependent upon purchase business. So overall, I think things are going very well. A lot does depend in terms of what does happen to interest rates and when and how much. And while we plan a little bit of seasonality into that, our March quarter 2016, we also remain optimistic that it won't dampen this refi volume too much. And then, just on the salaries and benefits line, looked like that's -- in the income statement, this looks like that's bounced around a little bit. Just kind of curious to what some of the dynamics are going on in that? I think most of it, there's a lot of compensation costs, obviously, that goes along with a large increase in mortgage volumes. And also, you have some year-end incentive compensation stuff based upon a record year, that is impacting that line. As I did say in my comments Andrew, though, I think that kind of what you're seeing for that fourth quarter, for varying degrees of reasons, probably in each quarter, is probably your more typical type run rate you're going to see for the four quarters of Fiscal 2016. Say, just one question, Gary. Maybe I missed it. Just your comments on kind of your outlook for mortgage in 2016, just kind of, I guess maybe go over that one more time? And then in that context, maybe just give a little color on -- it sounded like you talked about the profit margins maybe being a bit better, kind of what level of margins you're kind of expecting in 2016 along with that, just be your comments, guidance? No, that's a good question. I think that the conventional wisdom is that the Fed will make some moves in 2016. The question is, when. You look at the futures market and I think what we've kind of planned, is 25 basis points in January, 25 basis points in July. Who knows if that's right? But, all in all, we would expect -- it's not unreasonable to believe that refinances will moderate and we get back into a little bit of a seasonality mode, especially in our March quarter. Given that, we have kind of, for the year, we've projected slightly lower sales and origination volumes, but those would be more than offset by what we believe to be our ability to impact positively our net profit margins by 8 to 10 basis points, something like that. And we're doing that -- you know, as you probably know, we're in the midst of finalizing our conversion to a new core system that is our origination system, our pricing model and our sales management model and we think that through a combination of all of those initiatives, that we've got some margin improvement on our horizon. So, we expect mortgage revenues to moderately grow. It'll just be a slightly different mix, slightly lower volume, slightly higher margins and as I was telling Andrew, if we're -- if we're wrong about the timing and impact of interest rates and they stay low through our March quarter we've got a little bit more upside potential to our numbers because we conservatively plan to have a little seasonality in that quarter. And, as you know, we haven't had a whole lot of seasonality in that quarter for the last few years, because of the refi business remaining strong. Hope that helps? And then, maybe just to the organic, the commercial and consumer pipelines, just what -- maybe just talk a little bit about the St. Louis economy and where you think there's opportunity and I guess how things are today? Okay. Well again, I think we generally have a fairly low growth environment, here. Getting a little bit better as the days go on, but still, it's not a robust growth environment. As I said, we hold our own and then some, on asset generation, but our challenge has been to get net growth. It's hard to get substantial net growth when you're having substantial payoffs and these payoffs come from the normal culprits. As I told you, we had $25 million in early July which is why we only had moderate growth in the fourth quarter, in terms of our portfolio. But, the normal comforts on these payouts continue to be permanent market, non-recourse lending, long-run amortization periods. We also see the competition from time to time getting in our opinion, what we think is a bit irrational in terms of other rate term and covenants or lack thereof. We see some of our customers still with a lot of excess cash on hand and using it to pay down debt. And so, those are the types of things that -- and we've had a couple tax credit deals that paid off just because of the end of life of the tax credits. And so, those are the primary drivers. Pipeline still looks good. Again, asset generation has not been the problem, it's trying to keep the stuff from going out the back door which is certainly a challenge. But I think that we'll continue to grow, both our commercial and our residential mortgage portfolios in that mid-single-digit range in 2016. Not without a lot of effort, but that's part of the deal. You can see the numbers are not big, not as big as we had anticipated. Now, part of that is self-inflicted. We have actually put some of that stuff in portfolio to bolster the portfolio growth, where we look at it economically and look at what the net gain on sale would be versus what we would gain in terms of putting in portfolio. We've actually done that on a couple of the deals that might have had a slightly shorter term and therefore were not as valuable in the secondary market. So, I think that they are meeting expectations. It just doesn't look like it when you see the fee income side, because of some of the decisions we've made to portfolio some of the loans. And we kind of make those on a case-by-case basis. Just if I could clarify, on the net interest margin, were you saying that you expect to see a little bit of compression coming into the December quarter and then stabilization going forward? That's exactly what I was indicating, Dan. I think that, you know, it's likely we could see 5 to 8 more basis points coming off the fourth quarter margin into the December quarter and then as we see it, stabilization throughout the balance of Fiscal 2016. All right and what's driving your expectations for the drop? Is that going to be more just on loan yields contracting or is it [indiscernible] expected to go up? Yes, every time we renew a commercial loan, it still, it's a very intensely competitive environment. Even on the mortgage side right now, when we do a portfolio loan it replaces a loan that rolls off. You know, we're still losing some yield. But, I think that if we're right about the timing of Fed funds increases and everything like that, that's why we think we're going to get stabilization for the final three quarters. But, most of its just competitive rate competition right now and it's still in this December quarter, is driving I think our outlook and a little bit of increase in deposit costs. You know, they popped up a little bit and I would assume that -- we've extended a few maturities and moving a little bit, but not huge. But I think mostly competitive rates on the lending side. Okay, good. And then just a quick question on the tax rate, how should we be thinking about your tax rate for the coming year? I don't have the computation in front of me, but I'd use the fourth quarter run rate, maybe tick it up just a little bit. Well, thank you again for being with us today. We certainly do look forward to our next call in January and as in always, if anyone has any further questions or comments, please feel free to contact either Paul or me. So, Jennifer, with that I think you can conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call and you may now disconnect.
