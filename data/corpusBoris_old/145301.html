Cogentix Medical's (CGNT) CEO Rob Kill on Q1 2016 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha Good day, and welcome to the Cogentix Medical Fiscal Year 2016 First Quarter Conference Call. At this time all participants are in listen-only-mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this call will be recorded. Thank you, operator, and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us for Cogentix Medical’s conference call to review financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 which ended on June 30, 2015. The news release announcing the results crossed the wire this afternoon shortly after the market closed and is currently available on the Cogentix Web site. We have arranged for a taped replay of this call, which can be accessed by phone. This call is also being streamed live on the Investor Relations section of our Web site at cogentixmedical.com and it will be archived there. Before we get started during the course of this conference call, Cogentix management will make projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events, including, but not limited to, statements about sales, profitability, the potential market opportunities for our products, and new product initiatives, and expectations related to our post-merger integration plans and execution. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. These risks and uncertainties, as well as others, are more fully discussed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 25, 2015 as well as subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other information filed by the company with the SEC. Additionally, the statements made on this conference call are made only as of today, August 10, 2015 and we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statement to reflect future events or actual outcomes and do not intend to do so. Finally, the reported basis for the financial presentation of the Company’s first quarter fiscal year 2016 -- '15 or a year ago financial statements of operations includes only the former Uroplasty Inc. operations consistent with Uroplasty being deemed the accounting acquirer under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. Management will make certain statements today regarding historical pro forma financial measures which are non-GAAP but which we believe are helpful in more fully understanding fiscal Q1 and future performance. And with that out of the way now let me turn the call over to Rob Kill, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cogentix Medical. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us today. With me on the call is Brett Reynolds, our Chief Financial Officer and Darin Hammers, our Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing. Let me begin with a brief review of our performance during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. We had a strong start to fiscal year as a team executed on the revenue and cost synergies consistent with the merger integration strategy that we outlined for you at beginning of this fiscal year. Revenue in our fiscal first quarter was $11.2 million which represented growth of 10% over the pro forma combined results for the same period of last year. Revenue growth was slightly above our expectation of mid-single digits revenue growth that we communicated to you in May as our sales organization maintained a high level of focus in sales execution in selling our Urgent PC product while at the same time completing additional sales training and beginning to build their sales pipeline for our EndoSheath technology platform. Urgent PC achieved revenue of $4.7 million for the fiscal first quarter of 2016 representing growth of 15% compared to the prior year. This performance was driven by 25% growth in the U.S. market. Strong sales execution and increased awareness among neurologists and gynecologists of the patient benefits of Urgent PC continue to be the key growth drivers to this technology. Over 40 million Americans suffered from OAB and its symptoms and of those who seek treatment for this condition the overwhelming majority will fail the primary therapy which is meds. Of that patient population currently less than 2% are being treated by the third line therapies of which Urgent PC is one option and this suggests a significantly underpenetrated market. We're seeing an increasing reorganization by physicians of the value provided by the only commercially available non-drug, non-surgical treatment options or refractory OAB patients suffering from this chronic condition. In addition, the growth in Urgent PC also reflects the productivity benefit of time and territory for our sales team. As you will recall over the last two years we've upgraded the talent in our sales organization replacing over 60% of our sales reps and a 100% of our field sales managers. At the same time we also made investments to elevate the clinical and competitive selling skills of our sales team. The combination of this investment in advance training with the fact that the majority of these sales reps have now being with us for over one year has had a positive impact on their performance. Next our Endoscopes and EndoSheath products including related service and peripherals generated revenue of $3.8 million which is growth of 26% compared to the prior fiscal year on a pro forma basis. This performance was also driven by the domestic market which grew $1.2 million or 79%. In the first quarter we continue to invest in training of our Urology sales team on his new products while they also begin to build their pipeline. As we just discussed this in-depth training is critical to our success as we know that there will be a learning curve associated which being able to effectively educate our customers on the value of this innovative technology. Furthermore the sales cycle of selling Endoscopes is typically six to nine months. As such we expect our fiscal 2016 revenue to ramp faster in the second half of the year as our sales team become more proficient with the EndoSheath technology platform and builds their pipeline of opportunities. Even with that as the case, we've already seen several practices make their purchasing decisions less than 30 days. As an example we have one position who was introduced to the EndoSheath technology for the first time at a recent society meeting and was immediately interested in bringing it into her practice. She contacted our office managers with a Skype, while still at the conference and had an evaluation scheduled upon her return and after a successful evaluations she purchased a system for her officer three weeks after first seeing the product. Her comments for our sales rep is that she wanted the ability to see and treat patients immediately without having to wait for an Endoscope that is being reprocessed. While we certainly don’t expect this to be the norm, it does speak to the EndoSheath value proposition, improve productivity and efficiency that makes this a really exciting technology to sell for our sales team. It also supports our diligence at the time of the deal which suggested market awareness to the EndoSheath technology in urology practices wasn’t high. With the good progress we've made to date in executing against our integration plans, we are reaffirming our guidance for total Cogentix Medical revenue of approximately $49 million to $51 million for fiscal year 2016 ending March 31, 2016. As well as the other guidance metrics we discussed in our last earnings call. Brett will discuss this in more detail, so with that I'll now turn the call over to Brett Reynolds our CFO to discuss our financial performance. Thank you Rob. Good afternoon everyone. As a reminder some of the items and comparisons that I will discuss today will focus on pro forma combined financial results that reflect the combined results of Uroplasty and Vision-Sciences as if the merger that happened on April 1, 2014. The GAAP and pro forma information to be discussed in my remarks can be found in our earnings release. Further our earnings release contained a rational behind why we believe investors may find this pro forma information useful and how we use such information as well as a reconciliation of such pro forma information to the directly comparable GAAP financial information. As Rob mentioned, our recently completed first quarter was a great start to our fiscal year. Total Q1 revenue increased 75% over the prior year on a GAAP reported basis and increased 10% over the pro forma combined revenue from a year ago. Excluding the impact of changes and currency exchange rates our growth was 13% over the pro forma combined revenue of year ago. The drive of this growth was revenue from product sold in U.S. which total $8.4 million in the current quarter, up 28% from the year ago period on a pro forma basis. Revenues from our international business totaled 2.7 million in the first quarter, down 23% from a year ago on a pro forma basis. Approximately one-third of the decreased international revenue is due to changes in currency exchange rates with the remainder due primarily to fluctuations in the buying patterns of our international stocking distributors. Our Urgent PC product had global revenue of $4.7 million in the first quarter, which represent a growth of 50% compared with a prior year period. In the U.S. Urgent PC revenues totaled $3.9 million, up approximately $800,000 or 25% from the year ago period. We sold 5,021 lead set boxes of Urgent PC in the U.S. in the first quarter compared to 4,222 boxes in the prior year period. This growth was due to an increase in the number of active customers. We had 973 active customers during the first quarter of this year for Urgent PC, compared to 801 active customers one year ago. The average utilization in the fiscal first quarter was 5.2 boxes per customer, similar to 5.3 boxes a year ago. Average utilization by our top-50 accounts was 23.1 boxes, up from 22.3 a year ago. Global revenue from Endoscopes and EndoSheath technology inclusive of service and peripheral revenue totaled $3.8 million in the quarter, up approximately 800,000 or 26% from the year ago period on a pro forma basis. In the U.S. revenue from these products totaled 2.6 million, up 1.2 million or 79% from the year ago period. The domestic urology business was up 108%, while the airway management business was up 42%. Each product scope, sheath, service and peripherals had revenue growth in the quarter. Further the growth in our urology segment benefited from the fact that in the first quarter of last year Vision-Sciences ended the agreement it had with Stryker to distribute the cystoscope and related [indiscernible] and undertook the steps to sell these products through its own direct sales force. As such the pro forma urology revenue in the first quarter of last year reflect the combination of distributor pricing and the higher direct to physician pricing. The current quarter revenue reflect solely direct to physician pricing which obviously is more beneficial to us than selling through distributor. Global Macroplastique revenue was 1.9 million in the first quarter, representing a decrease of 7% compared to the first quarter of last year. However, on a constant currency basis Macroplastique revenue was flat with the prior year. As we have mentioned in the prior call, our best in class bulking agents serves a small market that is not growing and is not a primary focus of our sales team. However, Macroplastique does continue to have attractive gross margins above 85%. Now turning to consolidated gross margin. The company’s gross margin for the first quarter was 67.2%, up from 66.5% pro forma gross margin in the year ago period. Our first quarter gross margin is in line with our expected gross margin for the full year of fiscal ’16. Operating expenses for the first quarter totaled $10.7 million as reported, excluding amortization of identifiable intangibles and merger related costs, operating cost totaled $9.6 million in the first quarter. This is a decrease of $1.2 million from the pro forma combined operating expenses in the year ago quarter. Approximately 700,000 of the decrease was due to reductions in G&A primarily related to personnel, professional fees and public company cost, approximately 400,000 of decrease was due to reductions in R&D spending, reflecting lower personnel cost and lower project spend. Total pro forma combined operating cost excluding intangible amortization and merger related costs totaled 41.4 million in fiscal ’15 and we have committed to delivering at least $3 million in cost synergies for the current year resulting in expected total operating cost of approximately 38.4 million for fiscal 2016. Our first quarter results are in line with that expectation. We had non-operating expense in the quarter of approximately $340,000 compared to essentially zero in the year ago period. This increase is due to interest on related party debt that Vision-Sciences had outstanding. We accrue interest of the approximate 1.1% stated interest rate on the debt with this interest not being payable until the maturity of the debts which is in March of 2020. That interest totaled 75,000 in the quarter further as part of the purchased priced accounting related to the merger we added discount to debt to fair value and then each quarterly we amortized a portion of the debt discount. And this first quarter the non-cash amortization of the debt discount totaled $266,000. Cash operating loss excluding merger-related cost totaled $1.8 million in first quarter compared to a $3.3 million pro forma combined operating loss a year ago. We continue to anticipate our cash operating loss for the full year to be in the range of $2 million to $3 million as profitability improves sequentially each quarter due to expected higher revenue levels and expected expense levels in line what we incurred during the first quarter. And now continuing with additional details on our outlook for fiscal '16, as Rob mentioned this afternoon we reaffirmed the guidance we initially provided in our last earnings call in May. This guidance excludes any merger related cost as well as non-cash expenses related to the purchase price accounting, the most significant of which is amortization of the intangibles. With this in mind for fiscal 2016, we expect revenue in the range of $49 million to $51 million which represents overall revenue growth in the range of 9% to 13%. We expect a fiscal '16 gross margin of approximately 67%. These expectations combined with our expectation that we'll achieve $3 million in cost savings in fiscal '16 yield an expected cash operating loss in the range of $2 million to $3 million for the year. This is down substantially from the pro forma combined cash loss, excluding merger related cost in fiscal '15 of $6.8 million. And again the cash operating loss for fiscal '16 is expected to be heavily weighted to the first half of the year as illustrated by our first quarter results and consistent with our expectations of higher revenue levels and profitability in the second half of the year. Turning now to our balance sheet. At June 30, 2015 we had cash in equivalent of $6 million as we mentioned in our last call we anticipated our cash balance this quarter would decrease as we incurred our expected cash operating loss and pay the amounts accrued for year-end, including certain accrued merger-related costs. We have worked diligently in the quarter to obtain various proposals for debt financing ranging from a line of credit to a term loan and we are currently evaluating our different options. We expect this process to be completed soon. So all in all, the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was a very good start to the year. We believe that our already established presence and relationships in the Urologist office creates a significant opportunity for the combined company to expand EndoSheath sales which will in turn make our sales team more valuable and more meaningful to their customer. We remain on track to achieve the guidance we laid out at the beginning of fiscal 2016, at the same time we continually devote significant time and effort on business development activities to expand our product portfolio beyond our current products. We've build a strong distribution platform and we believe that overtime we can add additional innovative products to our sales reps product portfolio and in doing so we believe that we can accelerate Cogentix growth to create greater value for our shareholders. Good morning that is Dougherty & Company, but I'm hoping maybe Darin could just give us a little feel anecdotally you gave us one anecdote, but what the response of Urologist that you do business with has been to the new product offering and the combination of your historic products with the new products you are now offering? Sure as Rob mentioned earlier in the call, we did during diligence find out that there was a low recognition rate by Urologists and we've found that to be very true as we executed through the first quarter. But it's still early, Brooks, we are very optimistic that we're going to continue to improve execution. We’re happy with where we are; and a lot is still to come and we expect big things in the second half of the year. Great. And then it sounds like everything went real well and I'm just curious if there were any meaningful surprises for you guys as you got into the integration and the growth execution phase of what you are trying to pull off? Brooks it's Rob, I don’t believe there been any real surprises. We executed as per the plans that we said we would and the rational for the merger is being validated, I think under Darin's leadership the sales team continues to deliver the result as expected. So I don’t believe there has been any real surprises. Yes. The business -- we’re performing and we’re comfortable with where we are -- we’re happy with where we are. And then you mentioned obviously the potential for continuing to expand the product line and the things you can bring to the marketplace, I am curious if you’d be willing to share with us any kind of feeling you might have about when you might be ready to or feel like you are ready to take another step forward? I mean obviously as we’ve talked about it in the past is, the ebbs and flows of BD takes time and when we have something we’ll announce it, but other than that I don’t have much comment. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I am showing no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks. Well thank you operator and thanks everyone for participating today. We appreciate your interest and we look forward to updating you on our progress on next quarters call.
