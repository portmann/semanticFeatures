Reality Bites For OPEC's Sovereign Wealth Funds | Seeking Alpha Reality has begun to bite as low oil prices have continued to take their toll. Thus far, OPEC’s sovereign producers have tried to stay afloat by cutting spending, running down reserves and increasing borrowing efforts. These efforts are most important for the ‘fragile five’. Total sovereign wealth fund AUM has largely flat lined as the fall in oil prices has curtailed increases. With the prolonged nature of the current price environment, the potential call on these funds to cover fiscal deficits could be as much as US$ 200 billion. Even with the recent uptick in oil prices, the vast majority of sovereign producers are facing a difficult outlook for the remainder of 2016. As we have noted before, the spectrum of pain remains wide among OPEC with the 'fragile five' at imminent risk for systemic crises while the smaller, flusher GCC states are better placed to ride out a continued 'lower-for-longer' storm. Yet, even some senior GCC officials have expressed anxiety about the current price environment and there is a real desire to see prices rebound to at least $50/bbl. Hence, we continue to believe that more proactive market management measures may be on the table later this year if the recent production freeze announcement, along with improving supply and demand dynamics, fails to keep prices at current levels. Given that many Middle Eastern producers vastly expanded social spending in the aftermath of the Arab Spring and have largely stuck with those policies, the fiscal gap will remain substantial even with a reset to $50/bbl. In fact, many of these producers saw their budget breakevens balloon to over $100/bbl following the toppling of successive regional autocrats. In turn, it is this gap that we believe represents a significant fiscal drag, a growing need for borrowing, and potentially a call on sovereign wealth fund assets. For now, sovereign producers are trying to stay afloat through a combination of spending cuts, running down reserves, and increased borrowing. Iraq and Angola, two of the more stressed producers, have announced plans to slash capital spending this year by 39% and more than 50% respectively. In January, Iraq signed onto to an IMF staff monitored program in the hopes of securing $6-7bln in direct budgetary support and is reportedly looking to revive plans to issue U$2 billion in Eurobonds this year. Also, Angola opened discussions with the World Bank about obtaining new funding. Algeria, which saw its budget deficit nearly double from 6.2% in 2014 to 11.5% in 2015, has just announced plans to issue local debt and is also seeking Chinese financing for key infrastructure projects. Nigeria, which like Iraq is also coping with the twin challenges of a fiscal crisis and a virulent extremist threat, has also approached the World Bank and the African Development Bank for US$3.5 billion to meet its severe budget shortfall. Africa's largest producer has recently postponed plans to raise an additional US$1 billion from Eurobond investors, and is instead seeking US$1-2 billion in new loans from China. Venezuela is facing perhaps the greatest economic headwinds, with inflation projected to hit as high as 720% while the economy is set to contract by 8% this year. The country is unable to tap the World Bank and IMF for immediate assistance, having severed ties with both organizations during the Chavez era; hence, it will have to hope that China continues to keep its cheque book open. Since 2007, Venezuela has borrowed more than US$50 billion from China through oil for loan agreements. The situation in the GCC is less dire, but certainly is still suboptimal. UAE, Kuwait and Qatar, with their small populations and large sovereign wealth funds (SFWs), are the best situated to weather the fall in energy prices. Yet, they too have all had to rein in spending to preserve their fiscal buffers. For example, UAE was one of the first GCC countries to begin rolling back subsidies and streamlining the government bureaucracy, despite having one of the more diversified regional economies. In January, the IMF cut UAE's 2016 GDP growth forecast from 3.1% to 2.6%, the slowest projected growth in ten years. The IMF also increased the country's fiscal deficit forecast from 4% to 7.5%. Last month, Ministry of Finance officials announced plans to raise Dh80-100 billion via bond issuance, pending the passage of a law allowing such federal debt issuance. Like UAE, Qatar has also announced a 30% reduction in subsidies and in January received a US$5.5 billion loan from international lenders. Originally, Qatar was expected to borrow US$10 billion but the offered interest rates were reportedly too high. Compared to the rest of the smaller GCC nations, Qatar may have much less leeway to cut capital spending than some of its peers due to the high infrastructure costs associated with hosting the 2022 World Cup. Saudi Arabia, which has a much larger population than its GCC peers, has also opted for adjustment measures. In late December, the government unveiled the National Transformation Program which calls for phasing out subsidies, privatizing certain sectors, and introducing new taxes and fees. Ministries have already had their budgets slashed significantly and a number of large capital spending projects have been cancelled. Backed by an army of Western management consultants, Saudi officials hope that these measures will reduce the pressure on the country's FX reserves which dropped from US$732 billion at the end of December 2014 to around US$600 billion currently. The government is also increasingly relying on borrowing to bridge the financing gap, tapping the domestic market in 2015 for the first time in decades and now turning to international lenders. Earlier this month, it was reported that Saudi Arabia was seeking US$6-8 billion from international banks and is preparing for a bond offering later this year. Even with these measures, the Saudi deficit (which reached US$98 billion in 2015) will likely remain large in part because of the substantial defence and security spending commitments, especially the military campaigns in Yemen and Syria. Moreover, Saudi officials may move more slowly with implementing austerity measures if they begin to encounter significant public pushback. There is always the risk that once the government starts rescinding benefits and asks citizens to shoulder a larger share of their upkeep, the populace in turn may demand a greater say in how they are governed. At the same time, a significant challenge facing these oil producing countries is that their borrowing costs could rise on the back of potential ratings downgrades. Earlier this month Moody's announced that it was placing five of the six GCC countries (Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, and Bahrain) on review for a possible ratings downgrade citing the structural shock posed by the low oil price environment. Russia, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Angola, Gabon and Trinidad and Tobago were also placed on the Moody's watch list. This followed last month's Standard & Poor's downgrade of several producers, including Saudi Arabia, Oman and Bahrain, Kazakhstan and Brazil. There is US$7.1 trillion held by sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) globally, a number which largely flat lined starting in 2014 when oil prices first began to fall. Overall, US$4.1 trillion has commodity origins, US$4.0 trillion of which is of energy origin specifically; in percentage terms, around 56% of SWFs come from energy, 1% from other commodities, and 43% from other sources. Looking deeper into that data, thus far, Gulf funds have actually done better than other funds of energy origination on a relative basis. The reason is that they are heavily invested in developed markets and have likely drawn down on their funds to a lesser extent than their less wealthy, energy-producing peers. The small, wealthy GCC nations are actually best positioned to ride out the 'lower-for-longer' storm when compared to their peers, even if the pressure is indeed mounting. The first order effect of the dip in oil prices has been the flat line in AUM driven by the slowing in new contributions as little or no extra revenue is available. The second order effect, one which the market may have to reckon with this year, is what funds could be drawn down to cover deficits. Thus, we have narrowed down the field to those funds/countries which have projected fiscal deficits for 2016, those funds total US$3.8 trillion overall. To get an idea, of what effect the oil rout could have on global markets, we exclude funds that do not contribute to fiscal budgets and exclude funds that are not large enough to cover deficits. Looking at the actual dollar value of the fiscal deficits of this narrowed fields of funds, this implies that up to US$236.5bln is at risk to cover fiscal deficits by our estimates, of which, more than half resides in OPEC member funds (note that in our analysis we have treated some FX reserve funds as SWFs where they can be called upon for direct budgetary support, namely Saudi Arabia's SAMA). When looking at these funds across OPEC, most of our 'fragile five' has a larger fiscal call in our high scenario than the total AUM held in their respective sovereign wealth funds (i.e. Nigeria, Iraq and Venezuela). Libya and Algeria, also part of our 'fragile five,' have significant calls on relatively small funds. Meanwhile, while the GCCs certainly look flush even in a high fiscal call scenario, but Saudi Arabia has the most at risk on a relative basis compared to its GCC peers. Overall, the oil roller coaster has taken its toll on sovereign producers and the vast majority of sovereign producers are facing difficult outlooks for the rest of 2016. Thus far, OPEC's sovereign producers have tried to stay afloat by cutting spending, running down reserves and increasing borrowing efforts. While these efforts are most important for the 'fragile five,' even the wealthy GCC nations have joined the party. An additional hurdle however is the prospect of credit rating downgrades as their outlooks become drearier, making additional borrowing more difficult and more expensive. This leaves their sovereign wealth funds as a potential means to cover upcoming fiscal deficits. Such AUM has largely flat lined as the fall in oil prices has curtailed increases, but with the prolonged nature of the current price environment, the potential call on these funds to cover fiscal deficits could top US$200bln in 2016. In a next article, we will look at who owns what and how a ''lower for longer'' oil price will impact the different asset classes all over the World financial markets.
