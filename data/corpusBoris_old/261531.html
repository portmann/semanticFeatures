How Much Do You Spend on Christmas? - See Debt Run | See Debt Run Posted  by Sarah on Dec 11, 2015 in Saving Money | 0 comments Itâ€™s estimated that Americans will spend over $800 on Christmas this year, up from $720 last year, according to a Gallup poll . Keep in mind that this is just a poll on what people think they will spend on Christmas gifts, not food, dÃ©cor and impulse purchases for yourself. That got me wondering where I happen to fall in regards to my Christmas spending. Maybe Iâ€™m a scrooge (or maybe I have significantly fewer people to buy for), but I donâ€™t plan on spending anywhere near the so-called â€œaverage.â€? Hereâ€™s a look at what I plan on or already have purchased: The biggest purchase I will be making this year is a KidKraft Frozen Ice Palace for $119 on Amazon for my two little girls. They will also get a few books, some new clothes and some extra Frozen items to play with in the dollhouse. We are planning on spending no more than $200 total on our daughters.

We usually spend $20 on each sibling and $50 on our parents, for no more than $200 total. I realize people with large families and tons of nieces and nephews are put in a different situation. However, if this is you, I strongly suggest doing a â€œSecret Santa.â€? Thereâ€™s a good chance youâ€™re not the only one who doesn’t want to spend their entire holiday bonus on gifts for other people. As far as coworkers and gifts for my childrenâ€™s teachers, I plan on spending minimally. For the teachers, all of the parents are pitching in $5-$10 for a gift card. Iâ€™ll also make homemade Christmas cookies for the girls to deliver. My coworkers and neighbors will also get homemade baked goods. Itâ€™s thoughtful, extremely inexpensive and always appreciated. That wraps up my Christmas spending list at no more than $500 total, and honestly that is probably an overestimate. You may think Iâ€™m forgetting about my spouse, and you would be correct. John and I sometimes purchase gifts for each other and sometimes we donâ€™t. This year, weâ€™re not. We purchased a house two months ago and have been having fun decorating it. We also want to remodel the kitchen, which knowing us will be done sooner rather than later. Instead of buying each other gifts we donâ€™t need, we will cook dinner together, share a bottle of wine and enjoy a holiday movie. So, Iâ€™m curious, how much do you plan on spending this Christmas solely on gifts for other people? Are you at the average amount of $830, or significantly higher or lower? Share in the comments!
