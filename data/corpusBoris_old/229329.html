Prospect Capital's Results For Fiscal Q1 2016 - My Assessment - Prospect Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:PSEC) | Seeking Alpha On 11/4/2015, PSEC reported results for the fiscal first quarter of 2016. PSEC reported NII of $0.256 per share, earnings of $0.078 per share, net ICTI of $0.264 per share, and NAV of $10.17 per share as of 9/30/2015. In this assessment article, I will summarize my previous account projections versus actual results. There were several events that occurred with PSECâ€™s investment portfolio during the fiscal first quarter of 2016. This article discusses the impacts these events will have on future operations. My buy, sell, or hold recommendation for PSEC is stated in the â€œConclusions Drawnâ€? section at the end of the article. On 11/4/2015, Prospect Capital Corp. (NASDAQ: PSEC ) reported net investment income ("NII") of $0.256 per share, net assets resulting from operations (also known as EPS) of $0.078 per share, net investment company taxable income ("ICTI") of $0.264 per share, and a net asset value ("NAV") of $10.17 per share as of 9/30/2015. In my prior PSEC fiscal Q1 2016 NII and NAV projection article , I projected the company would report quarterly NII of $0.242 per share, EPS of ($0.091) per share, net ICTI of $0.258 per share, and an NAV of $10.00 per share as of 9/30/2015. As such, PSEC's NII and net ICTI was a slight "outperformance" when compared to my projections while the company's EPS figure was a notable outperformance. When calculated, my NII, EPS, net ICTI, and NAV projections had a variance of ($0.014), ($0.169), ($0.006), and ($0.17) per share, respectively. While all these projections were within my stated range, it should be noted PSEC's EPS and NAV per share figures were near the top end of my range. I will now summarize my prior article's account projections and compare each account to PSEC's actual results. If a specific account had at least a modest variance between my projection versus PSEC's actual results, I will also provide an explanation on the variance. I will discuss PSEC's accounts in the same order as projected in my NII and NAV projection article (see link provided above). To begin this discussion, Table 1 is provided below. Table 1 shows my prior account projections, which were referenced in the linked article above, and compares these figures to the company's actual results for the fiscal first quarter of 2016. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using PSEC data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database ) In my prior PSEC NII and NAV projection article (link provided above), I stated the company's total investment portfolio would decrease approximately ($50) million for the fiscal first quarter of 2016 (prior to all quarterly "fair market value" ("FMV") fluctuations and scheduled principal payments). PSEC reported loan originations and add-on investments of $438 million while having portfolio sales/repayments/restructurings of ($529) million. When calculated, PSEC had a total investment portfolio decrease of ($91) million for the fiscal first quarter of 2016 which was fairly close to my projection. Using Table 1 above as a reference, I projected PSEC would report "total interest income" of $186.5 million for the fiscal first quarter of 2016. In comparison, PSEC reported total interest income of $191.3 million which was slightly above my projection but within my stated range. The main reason for this slight outperformance was due to the fact PSEC did not put one of the company's oil and gas portfolio companies, CP Energy Services, Inc. (CP Energy), on "non-accrual" status during the fiscal first quarter of 2016 (contrary to my assumption). For readers unfamiliar with this term, when a company puts a specific debt investment on non-accrual status, there is no recognition of interest income and/or "payment-in-kind" ("PIK") income. In actuality, PSEC decided to put all three of the company's debt investments with CP Energy on non-accrual status at the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2016 (effective 9/30/2015). The calculated difference between putting PSEC's debt investments with CP Energy on non-accrual status at the beginning of the quarter, which I anticipated because this specific portfolio company has been "struggling" for several consecutive quarters, versus at the end of the quarter was approximately $4.2 million. This was a majority of the $4.8 million variance between my projection and PSEC's reported total interest income for the fiscal first quarter of 2016. It should also be noted I correctly anticipated PSEC "reversed out" all accumulated PIK income during the quarter. Moving down Table 1, PSEC's reported dividend and structuring/fee income were very close to what I projected. I projected PSEC would report dividend and structuring/fee income of $2.0 and $6.1 million, respectively. In comparison, PSEC reported dividend and structuring/fee income of $3.2 and $5.7 million, respectively. Both figures were well within my stated range. Further discussion of these two accounts is unwarranted. Still using Table 1 above as a reference, I projected PSEC would report total operating expenses of $108.8 million for the fiscal first quarter of 2016. In comparison, PSEC reported total expenses of $109.0 million. When calculated, this comes out to be a variance of only $0.2 million. Again, this was well within my stated range. When taking a look at all the accounts that make up this figure, since PSEC reported a slightly higher total interest income when compared to my projection (see discussion above), the company also reported a slightly higher "income incentive fee" for the fiscal first quarter of 2016. In addition, PSEC's interest expense was slightly lower when compared to my projection. This was due to the fact I projected a slightly higher weighted average debt outstanding figure pertaining to PSEC's revolving credit facility during the fiscal first quarter of 2016. This directly equates to a slightly higher interest expense projection when compared to actual results. Continuing to move down Table 1, I projected NII of $85.8 million for the fiscal first quarter of 2016 while PSEC reported NII of $91.2 million. When calculated, PSEC reported NII that was $5.4 million above my projection. Again, this was well within my stated range. This minor NII variance was mainly due to the accounts already discussed earlier. When just reviewing PSEC's "top-line" numbers, I believe the company's investment portfolio, as a whole, outperformed my expectations which ultimately led to the company reporting EPS of $0.078 per share when compared to my projected EPS of ($0.091) per share. As such, this directly led to PSEC reporting a NAV of $10.17 per share as of 9/30/2015 versus my projection of $10.00 per share. While PSEC's reported NAV per share was still within my stated range, it was near the "top-end." This quarter's NAV variance was the highest amount I have had since I began covering this stock at Seeking Alpha (going back to the quarter ending 3/31/2014). My quarterly PSEC NAV per share variance for the fiscal third and fourth quarters of 2014 was $0.01 and $0.00 per share, respectively. My quarterly PSEC NAV per share variance for the fiscal first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015 was $0.01, $0.01, $0.03, and $0.06 per share, respectively. As such, since this quarter's variance was near the top-end of my range, I wanted to understand why my projected valuations within PSEC's investment portfolio as of 9/30/2015 differed modestly when compared to reported valuations. Continuing to move down Table 1, I projected PSEC would report a net loss on the extinguishment of debt of ($0.5) million for the fiscal first quarter of 2016 while the company reported a net loss of less than ($0.1) million. Most would agree this was only a minor variance. Next, I correctly projected PSEC would report a minor net realized loss during the fiscal first quarter of 2016. Through professional experience, I correctly assumed since management sold a portion of the company's small business whole loans to Jefferies Asset Funding LLC, who then provided an equity tranche of the newly created securitization, these loans were sold at a slight discount to PSEC's cost basis at the time of the sale. As such, along with several other sales during the quarter, my projected net realized loss of ($2.5) million was very accurate when compared to PSEC's actual net realized loss of ($2.1) million. This leads us to one last projection with PSEC's income statement, the company's "unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments" account. I projected PSEC would report net unrealized depreciation of ($115.0) million in regards to the company's entire investment portfolio for the fiscal first quarter of 2016. In comparison, PSEC reported net unrealized depreciation of only ($61.3) million for the fiscal first quarter of 2016. As I began to research the cause of this variance (by calculating PSEC's quarterly unrealized appreciation (depreciation) fluctuations within each portfolio company), I discovered several notable events that occurred during the quarter which I believe should be mentioned. A discussion of these events will also help explain several differences between my projected valuation changes, in regards to PSEC's investment portfolio, and what the company reported. First, PSEC restructured the company's investment in "Arctic Energy Services" (Arctic). On 9/30/2015 (the last day of the quarter), PSEC performed a "debt to equity" exchange in regards to the investments within this portfolio company. Since Arctic is classified as an "oil and gas" portfolio company, this restructuring was not that surprising due to the recent negative trends that have occurred within this sector (generally speaking). With that being said, upon this restructuring, PSEC did not "write-down" the newly created Class D and E units (actually slightly increased these two classes of equity). I personally believe this should be deemed more of an "aggressive/optimistic" valuation as of 9/30/2015. As such, this should be a portfolio company which has heightened monitoring in future quarters regarding possible equity write-downs if oil prices remain suppressed (amongst several other sector factors). Simply put, I had more severe net unrealized depreciation in regards to Arctic during the fiscal first quarter of 2016. I had a projected net unrealized depreciation range of ($12.0)-($16.0) million whereas PSEC reported net unrealized depreciation of only ($4.0) million. Second, I had materially more severe net unrealized depreciation regarding PSEC's investment in CP Energy for the fiscal first quarter of 2016 (another oil and gas portfolio company). As discussed earlier, CP Energy has had several consecutive quarters of deteriorating operating performance. This began to occur even when oil prices were materially higher versus recent valuations. As such, the quick, sharp drop in oil prices during PSEC's fiscal first quarter of 2016 was just another negative trend directly affecting CP Energy's operations. As stated earlier, I anticipated PSEC would put all three debt investments with CP Energy on non-accrual status at (or near) the beginning of the fiscal first quarter of 2016. However, PSEC decided to put CP Energy on non-accrual status effective 9/30/2015. In addition, two of PSEC's debt investments with CP Energy were still valued near 100% as of 9/30/2015. Initially, this was a valuation I strongly did not agree with, at least without being provided addition information on the recent/current situation regarding that particular portfolio company. Generally speaking, there is a higher probability that future FMV write-downs will occur on debt investments that are classified as "non-performing" versus "performing." However, as I continued my research in regards to CP Energy, PSEC provided a material disclosure within SEC filings that was not disclosed in the company's prepared remarks or its earnings conference call. The following quote is a disclosure within PSEC's 10-Q for the fiscal first quarter of 2016 : "…As of September 30, 2015, due to a pending sale transaction, we reversed $4,616 of previously recognized payment-in-kind interest from CP Well of which we do not expect to receive…" The key phrase within that quote is 'pending sale transaction'. This three letter phrase helps explain why PSEC decided to keep two of its debt investments in CP Energy near a valuation of 100% as of 9/30/2015 (even when the loans were put on non-accrual status effective 9/30/2015). Simply put, it appears PSEC is in the process of selling CP Energy. As such, there is a higher probability PSEC will receive the outstanding principal balance of these two first-lien senior secured loans versus if CP Energy was not in the process of being sold. So, if PSEC can "recoup" the outstanding principal balance of the two larger debt investments (upon the sale of the portfolio company), I believe selling CP Energy is the wise decision. However, due to the recent/current negative trends in regards to the oil and gas sector as a whole, I also believe PSEC may have to agree upon a sales price that is "below expectations." In other words, PSEC may ultimately not receive an amount equal to the combined principal balance of the two loans. As such, this is an event that needs to be monitored going forward. So, without knowing PSEC was currently in the process of potentially selling CP Energy, I had more severe net unrealized depreciation during the fiscal first quarter of 2016. I had a projected net unrealized depreciation range of ($35.0)-($45.0) million whereas PSEC reported net unrealized depreciation of only ($5.3) million. Side Note: Regarding unrealized FMV fluctuations, it should also be noted within my prior quarter's PSEC quarterly assessment article, I stated the main reason why my projected net unrealized appreciation of $17.0 million was lower than PSEC's recorded net unrealized appreciation of $37.4 million was mainly due to the valuation adjustment in regards to "Harbortouch Payments, LLC" (Harbortouch). During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, PSEC recorded unrealized appreciation of $40.8 million on Harbortouch. In comparison, I anticipated net unrealized appreciation within Harbortouch of $15 - $20 million during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. As such, PSEC's recorded net unrealized appreciation was basically double the amount of my projection. When calculated, this was a difference in valuation of $20 - $25 million. Within my prior article, I stated I did not totally agree with PSEC's recorded net unrealized appreciation of $40.8 million and continued to believe my $15 - $20 million net unrealized appreciation was a more appropriate "write-up." With that being said, PSEC recorded net unrealized depreciation of ($17.3) million on Harbortouch during the fiscal first quarter of 2016. This adjustment was nearly the variance between my projected valuation of Harbortouch as of 6/30/2015 versus PSEC's recorded valuation. In the end, I believe the "more appropriate" current valuation of Harbortouch is reflected within PSEC's investment portfolio as of 9/30/2015. Third, even though PSEC's weighted average yield on the company's collateralized loan obligation ("CLO") portfolio slightly increased during the fiscal first quarter of 2016 (which slightly increased quarterly interest income which I correctly projected), this portfolio also had a reduction in its cumulative unrealized appreciation balance as well (which I also correctly projected; recognized quarterly net unrealized depreciation). This is due to the fact that the projected percentage of defaults, regarding assets within all the structured securities on a net basis, had a minor "uptick" during the quarter. As such, projected future discounted cash flows were mildly "trued-down." This factor, in addition to an overall weakness for such securitized products during the quarter (which caused prices to decrease within this specified sector), caused PSEC to record net unrealized depreciation within the company's CLO portfolio during the fiscal first quarter of 2016. With that being said, PSEC's CLO portfolio actually outperformed most other structured credit portfolios during the quarter for several reasons. First, PSEC's CLO portfolio continued to experience a default rate modestly below the structured credit/CLO market average which is a result of good due diligence/underwriting. Second, as I originally stated in my quarterly projection article (see link above), the "deferment" of the increase to the Federal ("Fed") Funds Rate was a mitigating factor regarding valuations within PSEC's CLO portfolio. "Lackluster" U.S. economic data during late summer/early fall, along with the more "dovish" tone regarding the Federal Open Market Committee's ("FOMC") monetary policy in September 2015, materially impacted the forward LIBOR curve during PSEC's fiscal first quarter of 2016. Since most of PSEC's CLO investments have leveraged "floating-rate" liabilities, a deferment/drop to the forward LIBOR curve positively impacts projected future discounted cash flows under most scenarios. Simply put, an increase to the CLO's "cost of funds" rate is delayed. Also, in some cases, refinancing can occur which leads to more attractive term sheets. Third, since most CLO investments continued to reinvest runoff (either through prepayments/repayments etc…) so asset levels remained relatively stable, market volatility during the quarter enabled management teams to acquire new investments at discounted prices/more attractive yields as there was a short-term "price dysfunction" in the market. As of 6/30/2015, PSEC's "residual interest" (equity) CLO portfolio was valued at a "FMV versus cost" ratio of 1.0376. As of 9/30/2015, this portfolio had a FMV versus cost ratio of 1.0236. When calculated, this was a percentage decrease of (1.40%). Again, while PSEC's CLO portfolio had a slight increase in quarterly accrued interest income (shown within the income statement), the actual valuation of the portfolio itself net decreased (shown within the balance sheet) during the fiscal first quarter of 2016. This specific "separation of characteristics" was not disclosed within PSEC's prepared remarks or specifically brought up on the earnings conference call. One particular analyst on the earnings call was having trouble understanding how PSEC's CLO portfolio was not "marked down" during the quarter (made the point that "current yields" increased so he assumed the CLO portfolio's valuation net increased as well). However, with factual evidence as support, PSEC's equity CLO portfolio was written-down during the quarter by a minor percentage. Again, current yields increasing during a quarter does not always equate to an overall higher valuation of a particular portfolio at a specified point in time. Current yields run through the income statement while projected future discounted cash flows are represented as a value on the balance sheet. I believe this is an important notion for readers/contributors/analysts to understand. PSEC's CLO portfolio had slightly less severe net unrealized depreciation during the fiscal first quarter of 2016 when compared to my projections. The difference between my projected net unrealized depreciation and the company's reported net unrealized depreciation was approximately $15 million during the fiscal first quarter of 2016. Since PSEC's CLO portfolio had an FMV balance of $1.20 billion as of 9/30/2015, I believe this should be seen as a minor variance. Therefore, when analyzing PSEC's entire investment portfolio, I had the following overvaluations (undervaluations) when compared to PSEC's reported FMV fluctuations during the fiscal first quarter of 2016 (rounded to the nearest million): 1) undervaluation of Arctic by approximately ($10) million; 2) undervaluation of CP Energy by approximately ($35) million; 3) undervaluation of CLO portfolio by ($15) million; and 4) net overvaluation of the remainder of the company's investment portfolio by $6 million. Readers have continued to request that I provide these types of "update"/"follow-up" articles showing how my quarterly projections "stacked-up" to PSEC's actual results. I believe the analysis above accomplishes this request. Since a company's operating performance (quarterly earnings) is one of the key drivers to stock price valuations, I believe these types of projection/assessment articles are appreciated by most investors. I believe PSEC's results for the fiscal first quarter of 2016 were above my expectations. NII and net ICTI were slightly above my expectations while the company's FMV fluctuations on its investment portfolio were above my expectations. As I began to research the cause of this variance (by calculating PSEC's quarterly unrealized appreciation (depreciation) fluctuations within each portfolio company), I discovered several notable events that occurred during the quarter. These events were discussed above. In my opinion, the following positive trends should be highlighted for existing and potential PSEC shareholders: 1) quarterly economic returns continue to be generated; 2) possible growth of CLO, online lending, and real estate investments through spin-offs; 3) recent quarterly net ICTI figures continue to be in excess of quarterly dividend distributions; 4) continued strong cumulative performance regarding several control and CLO investments; 5) continued gradual increase of the company's annualized weighted average yield on its debt investments without a material increase in risk; 6) continued high percentage of floating-rate debt investments; and 7) recent utilization of share buybacks when the company is trading at an excessively material discount to CURRENT NAV. However, the following cautionary/negative trends should cause heightened awareness for existing and potential PSEC shareholders: 1) continued suppressed dividend and structuring/fee income; 2) continued modest to material depreciation on several control/non-control investments (including most oil and gas portfolio companies); 3) Prospect Capital Management L.P.'s stance regarding not amending its Investment Advisory Agreement with the company (regarding the "2%/20%" fee structure); 4) recent minor net unrealized depreciation within the company's CLO portfolio (has to be monitored going forward); 5) another delay to the company's three proposed spin-offs (now first spin-off likely "pushed back" to the calendar year 2016); 6) fairly high weighted average cash LIBOR floor when compared to sector peers; and 7) continued modest exposure to the oil and gas sector. PSEC recently closed at $7.47 per share as of 11/6/2015. This was a ($2.76) per share discount to PSEC's NAV of $10.17 per share as of 9/30/2015. This calculates to a price to NAV ratio of 0.7342 or a discount of (26.58%). When combining the analysis above with various other factors/analytical metrics not discussed within this specific article (other topics/trends were covered in prior PSEC articles), I currently rate PSEC as a SELL when the company's stock price is trading at less than a 20% discount to NAV as of 9/30/2015, a HOLD when trading at or greater than a 20% but less than a 25% discount to NAV as of 9/30/2015, and a BUY when trading at or greater than a 25% discount to NAV as of 9/30/2015. As such, I currently rate PSEC as a BUY. My current price target for PSEC is $8.15 per share. I believe most of the risk associated with PSEC's investment portfolio is already priced into the company's current stock valuation. A detailed analysis of PSEC's NAV and dividend sustainability will be provided in a future article. Final Note: Each investor's BUY, SELL, or HOLD decision is based on one's risk tolerance, time horizon, and dividend income goals. My personal recommendation will not fit each investor's current investing strategy. I first initiated a position in PSEC in October 2013 at prices ranging from $10.80-$10.85 per share. Prior to these positions, I did not own PSEC as an investment. I took both cash and reinvested stock dividends depending on PSEC's stock price when the company's monthly dividends were distributed. On 7/28/2014, I sold 50% of my position in PSEC at a price of $11.00 per share. On 8/26/2014, I sold my remaining position in PSEC at a price of $10.69 per share (initial goal was to obtain a price of at least $10.75 per share) due to the disappointing results reported by the company after markets closed on 8/25/2014. This disclosure was originally provided within subsequent PSEC articles, at the time, over the next several months. On 8/27/2015, I once again initiated a position in PSEC at a weighted average purchase price of $7.325 per share. This weighted average per share price excludes all dividends received/reinvested.
