SolarEdge: Sector Weakness Creates Buying Opportunity - SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG) | Seeking Alpha SolarEdge’s share price was driven down by the overall weakness in the solar sector and by SolarCity’s lower-than-expected installation guidance. The company has a lot of growth opportunities ahead and is trading in value territory. Commercial market penetration and new products to drive growth in fiscal 2016 and beyond. SolarEdge's (NASDAQ: SEDG ) share price has been under pressure in the last five months. The weakness was mostly due to the sector selloff (see the chart below) while the last week's drop was due to SolarCity's (NASDAQ: SCTY ) lower guidance for next year's installations. SolarEdge's forward valuation is in value territory while the company is delivering robust top and bottom line growth. New product launches and the commercial market penetration bode well for the company's growth prospects and cost controls and innovation should help offset the ASP pressure in the following quarters and might even lead to margin expansion. I am initiating SolarEdge with a buy and expect the company to outperform the sector in the following years. The solar sector (NYSEARCA: TAN ) is 40% lower compared to just five months ago and the sector weakness has brought SolarEdge's share price from $40 to around $18 as of this writing. I think that the fundamental changes do not warrant such a steep decline and I believe that the probabilities are on the side of higher future expectations due to all of the things the company has done in the past quarters and due to the things that it intends to do in the following quarters. A look at the top and bottom line growth rates in the last couple of years paints a really good picture. Shipments of optimizers and inverters have tripled since fiscal Q4 2013 and gross margins are up from 19.6% in fiscal Q4 2014 to 28.7% in fiscal Q4 2015. Source: SolarEdge fiscal Q4 presentation Revenues have increased from around $30 million a quarter in fiscal 2014 to almost $100 million in fiscal Q4 2015. Operating cash flow in the latest fiscal quarter was $15.7 million compared to negative $13 million in fiscal Q4 2014. Source: SolarEdge annual report , Sentieo.com The substantial top and bottom line growth, as well as the margin expansion, were achieved despite the pricing pressure, which management pegged at 7% to 10% for this fiscal year. The company has also managed to grow its market share in Germany despite the overall decline in the country's solar market. Shipments in the Netherlands and the U.K. remained strong and SolarEdge is well positioned to grow in these markets in the following years. New products, cost controls, commercial market penetration and international expansion to drive growth in the following years New products. SolarEdge has launched its new three-phase 25 to 33-kilowatt inverters. The new inverters have improved efficiency, reduced heat dissipation and they will enable the company to expand more broadly into the commercial markets. Management noted on the fiscal Q4 conference call that they are already seeing strong demand for the products. The new inverters are also cheaper to produce and should enable more aggressive pricing and lead to more rapid market penetration. The company also has a collaboration with Tesla and it expects to have the inverters available for sale in the calendar Q4 of 2015 in both the EU and US markets. These product launches should enable more rapid top and bottom line growth in the following quarters and I expect SolarEdge to continue to outgrow the market in the following years. Commercial market penetration and international expansion. SolarEdge has been very strong in the residential market and has been working on expanding its presence in the commercial market. The company intends to achieve this by increasing the energy yield, through design flexibility and by reducing costs, while the latest launch of the 25 to 33-kilowatt inverters should also help the cause. The international expansion is on track as well and the company is doing well in the Netherlands, U.K. and Germany. However, most European governments have reduced solar incentives in the last couple of years which has led to lower demand, especially in Germany, but SolarEdge has managed to increase market share in Germany despite the shrinking market. The market in the Netherlands remains quite strong and this country has increased the number of incentives in recent years, and SolarEdge has been one of the beneficiaries. International growth remains one of the long-term growth drivers for the company and we should see continued growth in this segment in the following years, based on both the expansion to other countries and the expansion into the commercial market. Cost cutting. SolarEdge has managed to expand margins due to increased scale and cost-cutting. The company is increasing the level of automation of its manufacturing lines and has recently opened a fully-automated assembly line in Hungary. The automation lines should reduce the cost of optimizers by approximately 10% and the majority of optimizers should come from automated lines by the end of fiscal Q2 2016. The cost optimization should lead to higher margins in the following years. Based on these growth initiatives and cost controls, I expect SolarEdge to continue to deliver solid top and bottom line growth in the following years. Solar stocks have been weak in the last couple of months and a part of the weakness is likely related to the expected tax credit reduction in the United States. The tax credit is scheduled to be reduced from 30% to 10% in January 2017, which will likely lead to lower demand in 2017 and beyond. If the credit is not extended beyond 2017, the market is expected to experience a 57% decline in solar capacity in 2017. The market should stabilize and bottom in 2017 if the credit is not extended and should continue to grow in the following years. I believe that SolarEdge will be able to grow despite the expected decline in solar installations in 2017 due to its commercial market penetration and international growth. This is what the analysts are basically expecting, as they expect single-digit revenue growth in 2017, according to Sentieo.com. This means that the market is currently underestimating the company's growth potential given its low forward valuation. SolarEdge is currently trading at just 13x its expected fiscal 2016 EPS and just 9x its fiscal 2017 EPS. Based on the high future growth rates and market penetration, which should lead to the company outperforming the industry growth, I expect SolarEdge to outperform the solar sector in the following years. If SolarEdge manages to fetch a valuation similar to the one it had six months ago, the upside potential in the next 12 to 18 months should be in the triple digits. I am targeting a $28 to $40 range in the mentioned timeframe, based on EPS expectations for this fiscal year ($28) and the next ($40). Both targets are based on a forward P/E ratio of 20, which I believe to be appropriate and maybe even conservative given the expected growth rates in the following years and past valuation trends. Given SolarEdge's low valuation, the downside risks seem largely priced-in. The expected weakness in the solar sector in 2017 should not affect the company to a large degree given its new product offerings and the expansion in the commercial market as well as the strong growth in international markets. The growth in these areas should help offset the potential declines in the solar sector in the United States in 2017. Customer concentration is another considerable risk factor. SolarCity accounted for 19.1% and 24.6% of total revenues in fiscal 2014 and 2015 respectively and SolarEdge stands to lose a substantial portion of its revenues if it loses SolarCity as a customer and its revenues might also be negatively affected by SolarCity's lower installation growth in 2016. Competition is another factor that investors should consider, but SolarEdge has been able to increase its market share on improved product offerings and I believe that the company is well positioned to grow and deliver strong gains for its shareholders in the future. The weakness in the solar sector in the last five months has created a solid buying opportunity for long-term oriented investors. I think that SolarEdge is well positioned to deliver long-term gains to its shareholders and believe that the risk/reward ratio is significantly skewed to the long side given the low forward valuation and the strong growth prospects. New product offerings, cost reductions and commercial market penetration should keep the top and bottom line growth above the industry level in the following years and should also help offset the potential weakness in the U.S. market in 2017. I am targeting a $28 to $40 price range in the next 12 to 18 months, which I believe to be realistic and maybe even conservative given the growth expectations. The first catalyst might be the fiscal Q1 2016 earnings report, which is due Wednesday after the close. The company managed to beat the Street consensus by a solid amount in the last two quarters and another good report would likely positively affect its share price.
