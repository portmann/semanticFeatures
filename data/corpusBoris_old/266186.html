Chevron's 2016 Spending Cut Is Massive, But It Should Have Gone Even Further - Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) | Seeking Alpha The last time oil prices were this low for a prolonged period of time was in the 2003-2004 period. Chevron spent three times less then compared with 2016 budget. Current level of capital spending at $26.6 billion is a step in the right direction, given that in 2014, it spent almost $40 billion and it is ahead of peers. Further cuts in capital spending are needed in order to reflect the new reality of oil & gas prices going forward. After a 13% cut in spending from 2014 level in 2015, in order to cope with the lower oil & gas prices, Chevron (NYSE: CVX ) is now planning to cut its capital spending by a further 24%, to $26.6 billion for 2016. It is a long way from the almost $40 billion it spent in 2014, which was the last year when the $100/barrel oil price plateau was still believed to be the new permanent normal. In just one year, the new consensus view on oil prices has become that we are looking at low oil prices as far as we can see. It seems the consensus is starting to get more and more traction with companies, therefore we are seeing deeper and deeper cuts in spending. In fact, Chevron is considering cutting capital spending further in 2017 to a level in the $20-24 billion range. This of course means that future production will be sacrificed, which oil & gas companies are afraid of doing, due to the image they want to present. It has been especially hard to do so in the past five years as shale companies were increasing production exponentially and were grabbing the spotlight in the process, together with investor interest. Back then, it would have been a disaster for any oil major to announce sharp declines in production. Things have changed however. Shale companies are having their stocks obliterated and their debt is now the focus of much worry, given that at current oil & gas prices, there is a high probability of a large number of defaults next year, in addition to the few companies which already defaulted this year. 2015 is also the year which saw an end to the exponential growth in shale oil & gas production, with most companies going into production decline. The pressure is off therefore on companies like Chevron to continue to show steady or increasing production. Reality is that at current prices, there are plenty of Chevron upstream projects which are far from profitable, therefore investment in them should be halted for now and only re-started when the price of oil & gas warrants it. As we can see, even though the cuts in spending compared to the 2014 record year seem drastic, we have to go all the way back to 2010 to find a year in which capital spending has been lower. And if we are to look at capital spending in previous years, in relation to oil prices, we can see that the last time prices were in the current range, Chevron was spending only about a third of what it intends to spend in 2016. We are after all in a price range which was last seen for a more prolonged period in the 2003-2004 period. To be fair, we are not comparing apples to apples when looking at capital spending in the 2003-2004 period, which is when oil prices were last in the current range, versus 2016 capital spending. Upstream production costs have gone up significantly since then. Just to give us an idea, in 2003 Chevron spent $6.4 billion on upstream operations in order to keep production going at 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, while in 2015 it spent $31.6 billion to produce the same amount. Chevron's US upstream operations are not the most important when it comes to volumes, with less than 30% of total volume. It is however the place where in my opinion Chevron needs to cut investments further, given that it is in its US upstream operations that it recorded a Q3 loss of $600 million, which was offset by its net earnings of $660 million on its international upstream operations. Despite its US operations being unprofitable at current oil & gas prices, it is in the US that production still increased by 7%, while production outside the US declined slightly. Any international operations currently under development which are unprofitable should be cut as well. There is no sense in working to pump out oil at a loss, using up reserves in the process. Having said that, it seems Chevron is getting ahead of the pack in improving profitability though these tough times by cutting earlier and deeper than many of its peers, unlike last year when it cut considerably less. I am certain that Chevron's peers will cut spending compared with 2015 as well, but it remains to be seen whether the cuts will be as deep as Chevron is looking to go. Personally, I am skeptical about the negativity that is now surrounding the oil price outlook. Moody's for instance just cut its forecast for WTI to $40/barrel for 2016 and is forecasting an average of $45/barrel for 2017 and 2018. I remain convinced that we will see a balancing of supply and demand at some point in 2016, at which point prices will start rising rather fast as the realization will set in that the capital cuts we are seeing right now will cause supply constrains for years to come. But, the current price environment needs to be the main driver of capital spending, not my opinions in regards to future market prices and as things stand right now oil & gas prices are low and there is no indication of an immediate return to prices which might suggest that some of the more expensive projects will be profitable. In conclusion, Chevron is on the right path when it comes to its investment plans with the cuts it is making, but more would be even better. The capital spending we are seeing at the moment still reflects the four year period of the oil price plateau in the $100/barrel range, which I find to be highly inappropriate in my view, given my view of oil prices being very volatile in the next decade or so, with prices moving up from here, perhaps past $100/barrel again, but also re-visiting the current lows in coming years. I do recognize the fact that the cost of getting a barrel out of the ground has increased dramatically in the past decade or so, therefore we cannot expect Chevron and others to cut spending to levels seen in 2003, which is when oil prices were in the current price range. Having said that, it is also unreasonable to expect a return to the nice $100/barrel plateau any time soon, if ever, therefore companies need to plan accordingly.
