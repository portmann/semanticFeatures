Monetary Offset And The Time Inconsistency Problem | Seeking Alpha Monetary Offset And The Time Inconsistency Problem I recently ran across a very revealing article from April 24, 2012 : NEW YORK, April 24 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers are sounding the alarm over a "fiscal cliff" at the end of this year, when scheduled U.S. tax hikes and spending cuts could pose a big threat to the fragile economic recovery. Along with its official mandate of watching unemployment and inflation, the U.S. central bank is keeping a close eye on a potentially debilitating political fight over how to fix the budget deficit. If lawmakers in Washington do not get rid of the tax hikes and spending cuts due to take effect in early 2013, the country could easily careen into another recession. Any moves by Congress, however, aren't expected until after the Nov. 6 presidential election. The Fed is worried that individuals and companies could hunker down and curb spending, making markets antsy as the country awaits the outcome of an election that could pave the way for new tax and spending policies. Though few expect Washington to do nothing while fiscal policies push the economy into another downturn, partisan politics could undermine the Fed's unprecedented actions to revive the economy. "I have been disappointed that the president and Congress are not taking action until after the election," St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told reporters in Utah last week. "I'm also worried that markets will react badly to the fiscal cliff at the end of this year. Markets might start to speculate about what might or might not happen … after the election," he said. Asked what the Fed can do, however, Bullard seemed to dismiss the possibility of resorting to new bond buying to counter the effects of political gridlock over the budget deficit and economic policy. By the end of 2012, it was pretty clear that fiscal policy would sharply tighten in 2013. The Fed responded with QE3 and some additional forward guidance. Bullard was so confident that these steps would offset the fiscal guidance that he forecast an acceleration of RGDP growth in 2013, to around 3% to 3.5%. Actual RGDP growth (Q4 to Q4) turned out to be about 3.1%. So we have a nice example of monetary offset, with a happy ending. But notice something strange at the end of the long quote; Bullard seems to be warning Congress not to expect the Fed to bail them out if the send the economy into a recession with reckless fiscal austerity. When I was young I got a nice job offer from the New York Fed, at a salary 75% higher than my Bentley salary. My department chair took the offer to the Dean, who responded, "Tell him I hope he likes New York." In the end I stayed at Bentley. (Feel free to insert dog retreating, tail between legs metaphor here.) I learned a lesson, and indeed not once have I ever told my daughter "If I catch you smoking pot you can forget about me paying for your college education." My threats aren't credible, due to the time inconsistency problem. Matt Yglesias once wrote a post pointing out that the Fed denies that it engages in monetary offset: A curious issue that in my opinion he and other proponents of the full monetary offset thesis haven't fully grappled with is that Federal Reserve officials keep saying it's not true. I heard John Williams of the San Francisco Fed say it's not true at the Brookings event this morning. I heard Ben Bernanke say it's not true at the American Economics Association meeting in Philadelphia earlier this month. I separately heard William Dudley of the New York Fed say it's not true in Philadelphia. Janet Yellen has repeatedly said it's not true. And since full monetary offset isn't just an abstract economic thesis, it's specifically a thesis about the actual behavior of the Federal Reserve, the fact that nobody in a position of authority at the Fed believes in it seems like a big problem worthy of a more substantive response. You find lots of counterarguments in this post , written in response to Matt's post. That post is my best counterargument. But I'd add this post as a footnote, as it shows how statements by Fed officials regarding their intentions may not accurately describe the Fed's actual future policy response, but rather may reflect a desire to get Congress to do more of the heavy lifting. That's not to say that Matt's completely wrong, indeed his views are actually about halfway between my view and the views of more traditional Keynesians. Here's the very next paragraph of the Yglesias post: What I think clearly is true is that partial monetary offset is very real. The people who thought the tight fiscal policy of 2013 would crush the economy were wrong, and they were proven wrong precisely because of monetary offset. That's a reasonable argument, and if my version of monetary offset were proved wrong at some later date, Yglesias's view would be the alternative that I'd find most plausible. But thus far the data seem to support something close to full offset-both the 2013 case of austerity in the US, and the cross sectional study by Mark Sadowski. Of course "further research is needed." PS. Here's a perceptive observation from the April 2012 article: "We're naive if we think that [fiscal cliff] doesn't play into the Fed's thinking about monetary policy," said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York. "But the way that the Fed would want to present it is a minor consideration at best, because they don't want to be supplementing fiscal policy," Porcelli said. Porcelli clearly gets it, although the term 'supplementing' doesn't really capture the idea he's trying to express. He should have said, "offsetting."
