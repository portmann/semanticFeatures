ECB CoeurÃ©: Global Economy Seeing Divergence in Monetary Policy Cycles - Real Time Economics - WSJ BenoÃ®t CoeurÃ©, executive board member of the ECB, says the divergence between the monetary policies of large economies isn’t unprecedented. FRANKFURTâ€”The divergence between the monetary policies of large economies is elevated but not unprecedented, European Central Bank executive board member BenoÃ®t CoeurÃ© said on Wednesday, adding that central bankers must be mindful of the side-effects of their policies. “The global economy is currently characterized by an environment of diverging monetary policy cycles,” Mr.CoeurÃ© said in prepared remarks of a speech in Zurich. “While the U.S. Federal Reserve (and to a lesser extent the Bank of England) has signaled its willingness to embark on steps towards monetary policy normalization, many central banks across the world are on an easing bias,” Mr. CoeurÃ© said, noting that over 20 central banks have eased policy so far this year. This pattern is not unusual based on historical experience, Mr. CoeurÃ© noted. “When considering interest rate level differentials between the United States and the euro area as a simple indicator of differences in global monetary policy cycles, it appears that current divergences are not out of line with what was happened in the past,” he said. The ECB has taken the most aggressive stimulus measures this year, after it launched in March a 60 billion euros ($67.49 billion) a month asset-purchase programâ€”mostly in government bondsâ€”that is intended to last through September 2016. The euro’s exchange rate weakened sharply in the run-up to the bond-buying program and in its immediate aftermath. However, the euro has recovered ground in recent weeks on the back of some soft U.S. economic figures. Mr. CoeurÃ© said that while the exchange rate is important for economic growth and inflation, it isn’t a policy target for the ECB. “Also, the exchange rate movements we have seen over the past few months are not unprecedented relative to the experiences of other major central banks with regards to announcements of quantitative easing policies,” he said. In his speech, Mr. CoeurÃ© also called asset-price bubbles “a possible, but not an inevitable result of unconventional monetary policies.” Although bubbles can provide a short-term lift to economic activity, they also have destabilizing effects and influence the distribution of wealth, he noted. “Against this background, it would be wrong to treat bubbles as a welcome replacement therapy to a sustainable growth model,” he said. Economic policies are key in this regard to create the conditions for lasting growth, he said, while supervisory and regulatory policiesâ€”known as macroprudential toolsâ€”should be used to address any financial stability risks.
