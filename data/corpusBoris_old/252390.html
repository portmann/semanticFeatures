Why Business Investment Is Slumping in Five Charts - Real Time Economics - WSJ New York dairy farmer David Wood sold milk in the spring for less than it cost to produce it. Falling farm incomes, a reflection of commodity prices, have caused spending on tractors and similar equipment to decline. U.S. business investment advanced just 2.2% from a year earlier in the third quarter,Â  a slowdown that marks one of the worse performances of the six-year-old economic expansion .

Finally, businesses are receiving fairly uneven support from other aspects of the economy. Consumer spending has grown, but has not offered a breakout in demand. Government spending, which drives road construction and other infrastructure building, has fallen sharply during the expansion. And residential investment has swung wildly. Better spending on home improvements recently could support business investment next year, if it providesÂ stronger demand for appliances, furniture and other manufactured goods.
