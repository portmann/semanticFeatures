Corruption of government officials is currently Americans’ number one fear, according to a recent survey by researchers at Chapman University. The researchers asked a random sample of 1,541 adults to rate the level of fear for 88 different fear options across a variety of domains (like crime and natural disasters). Based on their findings, here were the top 10 fears for 2015: Last month, Gallup found that 75% of Americans said they believe corruption is widespread in the government (up from 66% percent in 2009). Also last month, Gallup found that a record low 38% of Americans trust the government to handle domestic problems. And half of Americans think that the government is an immediate threat to us. We at Washington’s Blog are non-partisan and non-dogmatic. We don’t believe that government is inherently good or inherently bad.  We instead believe that each government has to be analyzed to determine its degree of honesty or corruption. Unfortunately, it is T-H-O-R-O-U-G-H-L-Y documented  that systemic corruption has destroyed America … as admitted by politicians on both sides of the political aisle . (Sadly, America is not alone … governments worldwide are sliding down into mud pits of corruption .) Postscript:  Mainstream politicians and media are trying to browbeat Americans into trusting our government more. For example, Time Magazine tries to make fun of Americans who don’t trust the government … by comparing them to people who believe in  aliens and the paranormal. Likewise, Obama frequently chides Americans for distrusting their government. But we Americans don’t trust our government because our government has repeatedly demonstrated through its actions that it is corrupt and untrustworthy. Thu, 10/15/2015 - 10:25 | 6670920 Yes We Can. But... To me, gubmint corruption is not the fear, but gubmint itself.  Gubmint is by nature a cancer on the citizenry.  The sorts of people who gravitate toward political power - Obama being a perfect example - tend to be warped if not outright ill, and they fuel the cancer.  The citizenry is left to perpetually fight this disease that would consume it.  Remission/containment - limited gubmint - is the best that can be hoped for, the goal.  And when the citizenry goes soft, falls for the propaganda....  Stage IV.

Thu, 10/15/2015 - 09:52 | 6670803 Reaper Government is the moral hazard.  The good king is a fantasy.  "Absolute power corrupts absolutely." Courts provide no remedy. http://faqusajudicialcorruption.blogspot.com/ Thu, 10/15/2015 - 09:47 | 6670745 HardAssets Psychopath/sociopath control freaks come to rule government and use it for tyranny. This has happened throughout history. The only protection from this is an informed, educated people who are taught to recognize this. --Many of the American founders sought to keep government as small, limited, and divided as possible - in order to limit the resources available for tyranny. But, in less than a 100 years, that effort failed at the end of the American Civil War. The central government grew and later psychopaths led the nation on the path of imperialism (always disguised as something else). Thomas Jefferson also proposed that money be set aside to teach all Americans what's required if they were to maintain a free democratic republic. - -  His proposal was rejected. Thu, 10/15/2015 - 08:41 | 6670397 Phillyguy The US government is one part of the ?Team??. The team?s function is to maintain wealth distribution and class structure. At the top are major corporations and wealthy families. Elected and unelected people in government do the bidding of the financial elite (it appears the financial elite is preparing to install Hillary Clinton as President in 2017). The military is charged with maintaining the global status quo. Locally, social order is maintained by the police, court system, DA office, etc. Major media outlets, large corporations in their own right, put out non-stop propaganda supporting wealth distribution and class structure.  Recall Joseph Goebbels comment- ?If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it??. The overall goal of the team is to transfer as much wealth as possible from working people to the wealthiest segments of society. Thu, 10/15/2015 - 09:22 | 6670598 HardAssets People often react to news and facts in a naive way. They "don't believe it can be all that bad".  But, the entire established ruling system is criminal and rotten to the core. (And the politicians are only one part of that.) Its been that way for a very long time.  It doesn't have to be that way, but a naive citizenry who feels powerless won't change it. Thu, 10/15/2015 - 07:43 | 6670223 Dorothea Binz Thu, 10/15/2015 - 07:38 | 6670214 overmedicatedun... "no controlling legal authority"..time and time again the powerful escape justice, living like royalty with the unwritten "right of kings"..the majority see .gov as corrupt, but few understand the power of being above all laws.. few if any see the connection to NWO, so called free trade, off shoring of jobs and the debasing of fiat and corruption..the legal systems in the west are the enforcers for the criminal elite, hidden behind courts and "laws"  so many FBI, DOJ(add any legal system across the west) are paid to not notice they are the thugs for the. 01%..at one time DA's brought actions against the elite- no more.  and where are the law school profs stepping forward to expose the legal system criminals ??? silence. Thu, 10/15/2015 - 07:54 | 6670241 Huh Reeeally "no controlling legal authority"..time and time again the powerful  escape justice, living like royalty with the unwritten "right of kings" Thu, 10/15/2015 - 07:37 | 6670212 Secret Weapon Yes. It is corrupt. Government is a magnet for sociopathic and psychopathic individuals.  Read the book "Political Ponerology" for a deeper understanding of this issue.  Basically, psychopaths push out the good people from government. This is why civilizations fail.  Thu, 10/15/2015 - 03:55 | 6670046 Aquarius As one of the famous Beatles said in an interview: 'In an election it doesn't make any difference who you vote for as government always wins.' paraphrased.' Government is either by nature, bad, dishonest and corrupt to the core, or worse. And, Totalitarian control is always, a priori, its preference. "We don?t believe that government isinherently good or inherently bad.  We instead believe that each government has to be analyzed to determine its degree of honesty or corruption. Who cares?   They may be different, but their mode of implimentation and effect is the same - govt power.    If govt were limited, as founded in the US, govt/state would not control--say... "healthcare", other than as a legal entity to settle disputes and/or administer justice to lawbreakers.   As it is, govt/state is neck deep in all sorts of things like, "healthcare".    This gives them control.  They control the companies, invent regulations, buy the participants, decide who is in charge etc etc. Govt/state will always be corrupt.   The only solution is to keep them away from as much as possible.   Refer to The US Constitution.  Let them deal with roads, the border, treaties and interstate conflicts, oh, and of course the Indian Nations.  If this is all they control, then these will be the only totally corrupt entities.
