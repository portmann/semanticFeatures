I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Premier Li Keqiang has yet to "cull" the "Zombie" companies. A new demographic, known as the deserving rural poor, has been created by fiat to channel another fiscal stimulus to the manufacturing and housing sectors. The yuan will be devalued, against a basket of currencies, rather than the US dollar after IMF SDR basket entry. The magic 7% GDP floor has now become a ceiling. The last report , entitled "China 'Scales Up' The Risk", observed policy makers' attempts to gain competitive advantage by merging selected companies into national champions. Said selected companies all appear to have had significant overcapacity pre-merger. Despite Premier Li Keqiang's words to the contrary , about "Zombies" being "culled", post-merger the industrial overcapacity is still present in the merged entity. The national champions created have economies of scale; which will be deployed competitively against competitors, customers and suppliers going forward. These scale economies provide pricing power with suppliers and customers; in addition to enabling the national champions to sustain price cutting wars in the event that China is unable to significantly weaken the yuan further. The perverse and highly subjective way in which policy makers chose to interpret Premier Li's edict on "culling" the "Zombies", was characterized as a destruction of shareholder value reminiscent of a total confiscation of private wealth. This was evident in the latest headline about alleged "culling" in an eponymous "ghost town". The "ghost town" in question is called Ordos City in Inner Mongolia and its resident creator is the state "Zombie" known as the Ordos City Huayan Investment Group Co. Faced with the "culling" of this "Zombie", private bond holders sold back the bonds to the company at a deep discount. Then by a miracle of finance the company repaid the bonds that had been dumped at a deep discount by the private creditors. The confiscation of wealth has taken a new turn. Further perversity was observed in China's execution of Xi Jinping's policy objective of lifting the rural population out of poverty . This policy objective was first noted in the report entitled " Projecting A Global Macro 'Transition Phase' Into The Geopolitical Void ". This report observed how this section of the Chinese polity were singled out as the recipients for welfare transfers, targeted specifically at purchasing the output of China's idling manufacturers. It was therefore concluded that the rural poor were simply a vehicle for a fiscal stimulus aimed at the manufacturing sector. It seems that the oversupplied and over-indebted housing sector is now going to be the recipient of the next tranche of fiscal stimulus via the deserving rural poor. Sources report that 100 million farmers will be reclassified as urban residents. As a result, a new wave of buyers has been created by fiat. Said fiat buyers will presumably become the recipients of a welfare transfer targeted specifically at purchasing homes. Having thus prepared for the currency wars of attrition in the event that the yuan cannot be weakened further; China then set about trying to weaken it. Chinese policy makers began to move the goalposts as the country prepares the ground for a devaluation of the yuan. A new currency index is being presented to the FX market, to distract attention from the all-important exchange rate to the US dollar. Chinese policy makers are trying to frame perceptions of the yuan in relation to 13 other currencies, with the creation of the new CFETS RMB Index . Since the yuan is now a member of the IMF SDR basket, this new index allegedly has greater credibility. The intentions and capabilities of China are therefore to devalue the yuan against these other currencies rather than the US dollar. In practice, this means that China's exports will remain competitive. A supporting attempt was made to pave the way for further yuan weakness by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. This think tank is generally viewed as a mouthpiece that provides the intellectual and statistical bases to justify policy makers' decisions. According to the Academy, Chinese GDP growth may now slow to between 6.6% and 6.8% in 2016. The magical 7% GDP floor has therefore been officially penetrated; so that it has effectively become a ceiling. The Academy's gloomy growth forecast was supported by the PBoC's own forecast ; which showed growth slowing to 6.8% from 6.9% this year. The Chinese "Dot Plots" are therefore being plotted in a combined effort to justify a case for yuan weakness and further economic stimulus. The gloomy forecasts, emanating from these Chinese sources, were then given greater credibility by a foreign source. CBB International produces its own Chinese version of the Fed's Beige Book. The latest report showed deterioration in the economy, across the board, in the fourth quarter. Purchasing managers' indices seem to have been collateral victims of the downshift in economic activity; in addition to policy makers' attempts to reframe perceptions of this decay. Markit Economics suspended the Caixin PMI index in October. China Minxin recently followed suit , with both its manufacturing and service sector PMI's. Observers and investors are now flying blind, as there is no faith in the official statistics provided by government sources. The growing controversy, over the lack of accurate independent data, signals that Chinese asset class valuations have become a matter of guesswork rather than a rational investment process. Having officially pierced the 7% threshold on economic growth with projections, observers' perceptions have been framed to accept the policy response. Signals about the nature of this policy response were not short in coming. The Central Economic Works Conference (CEWC) made the initial signals. According to the CEWC, monetary policy will be made more "flexible" and fiscal policy will become more "forceful". Literally translated, this means that the PBoC will enable a fiscal expansion by loosening monetary policy further. Finance Minister Lou Jiwei signaled that the coming fiscal expansion will be measured and will evolve gradually. This signal suggests that policy makers are becoming aware of their finite economic resources. A decelerating economy is no longer throwing off huge tax revenues; and declining exports are also eroding the currency reserve position. China's economic resources are therefore constrained. Sources close to the decision makers have sent smoke signals, on the size of the anticipated fiscal stimulus, in order to gauge market reaction. The stimulus will need to be large enough to move the economic needle; but not so large that it recklessly threatens the country's reserves. The signals suggest that the deficit will be the largest in the last half century. It is estimated to hit 3% of GDP from 2.3% in 2015. The problem with these debt/GDP ratios however comes from the GDP denominator, rather than the debt numerator, in assessing the figures when economies are slowing. The debt/GDP ratio can easily seem much larger, because GDP is shrinking. China can therefore spend a little and make it look as though it has stimulated the economy significantly. It may therefore be more instructive to follow China's aggregate debt and fiscal spending going forward, in comparison with previous years of fiscal stimulus. Going forward, fiscal policy is going to be more focused, in order to conserve financial resources for priority investments. Mr. Lou also signaled that the policy mix will be weighted more towards corporate tax cuts, rather than direct spending. Tax cuts will have an immediate negative impact on revenues, further underling the need to conserve resources. It would seem that China has accepted that it can no longer throw a massive fiscal stimulus at the economy. The potential for economic growth to ever get back above the 7% level therefore looks to have gone for good. Premier Li's New Year message , to his economic team, underlined the developing thesis on the focused application of constrained economic resources to achieve maximum impact. He tasked his team with drawing up a new five year plan to take the country forward to 2020. This plan will emphasize coordination, based upon economic feasibility with emphasis on the following bullet points: The concepts of innovation, coordination, "green" and structural reform presumably involve the transitioning of the economy away from the State Owned Enterprises (SOE's). Thus far, Premier Li is still keeping these SOE "Zombies" alive. Evidently China has nothing to replace them with at this point in time. China's challenge is therefore to deal with this SOE legacy, whilst at the same time incubating global challengers in the new technologies that will drive global growth going forward. The buzzword "openness" confirms that policy makers expect the private sector to do its share of the capex and economic heavy lifting going forward. Such a business culture transformation away from state control is a step into the competitive unknown for China. At this point in time a large question mark must be placed over the managerial skills of China's business leaders; to be successful in a global competitive landscape in which there is less reliance upon the support of central government. The targets of China's latest coordinated fiscal and monetary stimulus are the rural areas, specifically the real estate sectors in these rural locations. The strategy of creating "scaled up" national champions, explained in the last report, entitled " China 'Scales Up' The Risk ", now looks set to occur with mergers in the real estate sector. Chinese policy makers also seem to have understood that the strong US dollar story is getting very long in the tooth , as are the long US dollar currency positions. If it transpires that the FOMC's normalization process is as swift and shallow, as the Fed speakers are signaling, then an inflexion point for the US dollar will soon appear. By retaining the US dollar peg and devaluing versus other currencies, China can avoid the wrath of Treasury Secretary Lew Jacob Lew whilst simultaneously boosting its exports. The Chinese economy and capital markets can also retain some semblance of credibility and support, through this period of leveraging off the weakening US dollar, by retaining the US dollar peg. The US Senate seems to have finally woken up to the threat posed by China; and belatedly come to the support of Secretary Lew. This awakening however remains an issue of due process brought about in reaction to international developments. China has already threatened the US dollar's global hegemony with its own version of the World Bank known as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). No doubt this awakening is because the AIIB was formally established on Christmas Day. This institution threatens the ability of America to advance its own project, for the future of the Asian region, with its Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) . The TPP is largely a set of protocols and rules that protect American intellectual property, business interests and market access to Asia; that are underpinned by the US dollar's reserve status. The TPP also makes sure that Anglo-Saxon rules of credit are enforced legally, so that the position of creditors is upheld at the top of the liquidation schedule. The World Bank can therefore lend to Asian nations in US dollars, which will then find their way back into American assets, goods and services. Failure to pay back debts will then invite the attention of the IMF to preserve the position of the creditors. The AIIB would substitute the American guarantee of creditor supremacy, with the Chinese government's worldview of who credit should be provided to. China would like to provide credit to the developing nations that will then support exports of Chinese goods and services. In order to take down this threat to American interest, America has adopted the strategy of keeping its enemy closer. The recent political decision, to increase China's participation in the IMF and the weighting of the yuan in the SDR currency basket, was made to facilitate this closer engagement. The Senate has now followed suit and approved China's increased participation in the IMF to a 6% voting share from 3.8%. In addition, the resources of the IMF will be increased. China will thus be financially stretched between its commitment to the AIIB and its expanded role in the IMF. A weakening of the yuan will undermine the stability of the AIIB and also weaken China's power within the IMF's global architecture. China's global ambition, to make the rules, will therefore oblige it to drop its traditional mercantile strategy of beggar they neighbour predatory tactics. If China wishes to be a superpower, it will now have to act like one. It will also have to back up its intentions with sound financial management of its own economy in relation to its global obligations. China is going to be put to the global superpower test in 2016. A true superpower should be able to sustain current and capital account deficits, with its trade partners, in order to enable its global reserve currency status. Thus far, it is falling well below the requirements to be taken seriously as a challenger to America. In 2016, China will be confined by its finite economic resources and stretched emerging superpower commitments. The best that China can hope for is for the US dollar to weaken; so that its superpower shortcomings are not painfully exposed. The red light is flashing again for Mr. Hao Hong, the Chief Strategist at Bocom International Holdings Co. Mr. Hong is famous for his great bull market call on Chinese equities. He is now bearish. What is most interesting about his strategic call is his choice of trigger signals. Rather than opine any specific domestic Chinese risks, he identifies the Fed's normalization process as the trigger for the Chinese equity sell-off. In his opinion, the tightening of US dollar liquidity is what will trigger the collapse in equity valuations. Looking purely at the Chinese domestic fundamentals there are clear signals of economic maturity. The government is counteracting this economic maturity with fiscal and monetary stimulus. The biggest potential stimulus may come from the rolling back of the one-child policy, which became effective on January 1st 2016. Assuming that this spurs a wave of procreation, it will take some time for this to move the economic needle. Given the lack of job opportunities, as the economy decelerates, it is moot whether there will be such a wave of procreation in any case. The economic maturity, symbolized by a failure to return to the 10% plus growth days, is therefore a catalyst for hot money to leave China looking for higher returns elsewhere. This capital outflow in Q3/2015 has been estimated as larger than the Greek economy. Combining this outflow of hot money with Mr. Hong's observation, on tightening US dollar liquidity from the Fed, the tightening liquidity in China becomes even greater. Things could get a lot worse. This certainly seems to be the view of Jim Chanos. His view of 2016 suggests that he will bet against China; through the proxies of the nations that derive their living and their national debts' collateral by supplying Chinese commodity demand. Given the various stimulus initiatives that Chinese policy makers have announced, the Chinese short squeezes along the way to meltdown could be extremely painful. Chinese policy makers also have a habit of making it technically impossible to run short positions. The proxy short on China may therefore be the only way to express a view. This view implies that the negative global impact of China will be far greater than the impact felt in its own domestic economy. China still has sufficient reserves to ride out another year of the storm. Its ability to continue to do this for a longer period, depends on how well it husbands its finite economic resources over the coming year. The Japanese banks also seem to share Chanos' view. They scaled back lending to China in 2015; which represents the first decline since 2008. Things officially got a lot worse when trading resumed in the New Year with Chinese equities down 7% in the first session; triggering the various support measures including an extension of the selling ban that was to end on January 8th. Chinese policy makers and the PBoC are in reactive mode rather than planning mode in early 2016. This is never a good place to start a trading year.
