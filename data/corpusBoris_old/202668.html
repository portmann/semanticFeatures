Here's How Long Saudi Arabia's US Treasury Stash Will Last Under $30, $40, And $50 Crude | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Never in history has the US entered a recession when rates were this low. And it spells serious trouble for the financial system going forward.   Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! On Friday we explained why the most important chart in global finance may well be the combined FX reserves of Saudi Arabia and China plotted against the yield on the 10Y.  Hereâ€™s the reason that graphic is so critical: Saudi Arabia and China are sitting on the first and third largest stores of reserves, respectively, and if these two countries continue to liquidate those reserves, it will amount to â€œ reverse QE â€? or, "quantitative tightening" as Deutsche Bank calls it.  For Saudi Arabia, the FX reserve pressure comes courtesy of the deathblow the country dealt to the petrodollar system late last year. In other words, the pain is largely self-inflicted as the kingdom is determined to â€œpreserve market shareâ€? by bankrupting US shale drillers. The attendant decline in oil revenue has resulted in a fiscal deficit on the order of 20% of GDP which, in the absence of sharply higher oil prices must either be financed by drawing down reserves or else through the bond market because between the war in Yemen (which escalated meaningfully on Thursday) and the necessity of maintaining the status quo for a populace thatâ€™s become used to a certain level of stability and comfort, fiscal retrenchment is a decisively difficult task.  On Thursday, we got the latest data on Saudi Arabiaâ€™s FX reserves and, thanks to new debt, the burn rate slowed. Hereâ€™s Reuters : The speed of decline in Saudi Arabia's foreign reserves slowed in July after the government began issuing domestic debt to cover part of a budget deficit created by low oil prices, central bank data showed on Thursday. The world's largest oil exporter has been drawing down its reserves to cover the deficit. Net foreign assets at the central bank, which acts as the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, have been sliding since they reached a $737 billion peak last August. But the latest data showed net foreign assets shrank only 0.5 percent from the previous month to 2.480 trillion riyals ($661 billion) in July, their lowest level since early 2013. They had dropped 1.2 percent month-on-month in June and at faster rates early this year. In July, the government began selling bonds for the first time since 2007, placing 15 billion riyals ($4 billion) of debt with quasi-sovereign funds; this month it sold 20 billion riyals of bonds to banks. The domestic debt sales appear to have reduced the need for the government to cover its deficit by drawing down foreign assets. Authorities have not publicly said how many bonds they will issue in future, but the market is expecting monthly issues of roughly 20 billion riyals through the end of 2015. The foreign assets are held mainly in the form of foreign securities such as U.S. Treasury bonds - securities totalled $465.8 billion at the end of July - and deposits with banks abroad, which totalled $131.2 billion. The vast majority of the assets are believed to be in U.S. dollars. And while taking on debt to offset the reserve burn is a viable strategy, especially when youâ€™re starting from a debt-to-GDP ratio thatâ€™s negligible, the reserves are still at risk of running out, even if 50% of spending is financed in the debt markets. Hereâ€™s more from BofAML on how long the Saudis can hold out under various price points for crude and assuming various mixes of debt financing and spending cuts: Safeguarding Fx reserves will require deep budgetary cuts at current oil prices, in our view. Our dynamic analysis suggested that current low oil prices could rapidly erode the sovereign creditworthiness, even as the sovereign balance sheet is at its strongest on an historical basis. Despite the rapid drawdown over 1H15, SAMAâ€™s Fx reserves still stood at c100% of GDP in June, and government deposits at SAMA represented US$294bn or 42% of GDP. Another way to look at sustainability is a static analysis to calculate the number of years required to exhaust government deposits under various oil, spending and financing scenarios. Based on the narrow definition of resources available to the government, we think that there is no realistic mix of debt financing and spending cuts at US$30/bbl that can decrease pressure on Fx reserves, and pressure on the USD peg would be acute if oil prices were to be sustained at this level. However, at US$40/bbl and US$50/bbl, debt financing and deep capex cuts (to bring spending 25% lower) can keep government deposits at SAMA covering 7 years and 11 years of government spending, respectively. Government spending has historically adjusted to oil prices with a variable lag. It is worth recalling that spending was 50% lower in 1988 compared to its 1981 peak as oil prices tumbled, and government spending in 2000 was at the same levels as that of 1980 in nominal terms.

Russia / China have actually implemented non-USD and non-US controlled financial systems - bilateral currency swaps, SWIFT alternative, BRICS, SCO, etc. The only way out for the US is to take out both China and Russia and that will involve nukes. The US mainland will be a target in spite of US hopes to confine the destruction to Asia and its NATO fall guys in Europe. Sat, 08/29/2015 - 06:53 | 6484222 Oracle 911 Well, while this article got its fact right, but it doesn't mean that the author is right. And you my friend have a huge point. Reason, the US dollar will became soon-ish irrelevant: -US treasury sell of began-open QE is coming; -US treasury recycling stopped working approx. a year ego; -the RMB bilateral trade settlements are live; -the Saudis and the Chinese are friends now; -the Chinese, Indian and Pakistani relationships are normalizing; -the Russians are supporting the unification of the Arab world, and this week the Arabs formed a military pact/agreement in Egypt (the ISIS/ISIL days are numbered therefor). EDIT: I want to say, the Saudis will soon take also non US dollar payments, the hottest candidate is the Chinese RMB. The Ruble is in the toilet for the same reason the Saudi's have problems. Russia depends on high oil prices for cash flow and the Ruble is near all time lows - 65+|$ The Yuan is in the toilet because they have been lying about the state of their economy for at least 4 years and now need their 'dollars' to help prop up their economy. As much as some hate the US dollar it is still the safe haven in the world and until that changes it will remain as such. Sun, 08/30/2015 - 16:20 | 6487954 Oracle 911 And one more thing, the entire RMB swap thing is meant as temporal solution for the mess after the US dollar crash.

Sat, 08/29/2015 - 01:26 | 6484069 Ms No Speaking of which and a little off topic, MSM has decided to pretend to do some journalism now that the oil boom is about over.  You see, crooked companies bought all of the toxic FEMA trailers and were paid as much as 4,000 a month rent.  Had a friend that lived in one and was sick all of the time.  Of course out there it is hard to distinguish what you are sick from but still..  Fri, 08/28/2015 - 21:13 | 6483652 KnuckleDragger-X Fri, 08/28/2015 - 21:16 | 6483658 km4 Fri, 08/28/2015 - 21:16 | 6483663 tribune who buys treasuries when they are dumped on the market ? is the us government?. is the money extinguished? or does it represent more us dollars floating around?. to me i'm not sure if china an saudi selling increases liquidity or decreases liquidity. Fri, 08/28/2015 - 21:21 | 6483679 samjam7 Well apparently they are not bought in the same quantities as they are being sold, otherwise it wouldn't result in a yield rise. Imagine, a single foreign country has the powerl to influnce 10 Y yield by as much as 108pp indistinctive of market data and other news happening in the market that in itself should be very worriesome for the FED. Fri, 08/28/2015 - 21:30 | 6483697 chubbyjjfong I guess it will have to be the FED proxy's Belgium, Luxembourg etc. The FED will end up being the only buyer soon, if not already. The true stats are never released anyway so who really knows. When nations dump the petrodollar scam, that will be the time it all blows up, and we're not far off that moment.

It cannot be any other way because they are wealth destroyers. Forget stuff like peak oil. We are living in an era of peak government. World markets have gotten too powerful for them to control effectively. I can't say what exactly what will replace what we have now. Whatever it is, they won't have any where near the power they have now. There won't be a recovery until that day comes. Fri, 08/28/2015 - 22:19 | 6483805 daveO Right.

Those waves themselves continue to be controversial.  However, they may have some predictive value to the extent they clarify the historical relationships between war and military spending on the one hand, and inflation and economic growth on the other.  The 1990s mainly followed a predicted long-wave phase of sustained low inflation, renewed growth, and reduced great-power military conflict.  If this pattern were to continue, the coming decade would see continued strong growth but new upward pressures on military spending and conflict, eventually leading to a new bout of inflation in the great-power economies.  Since scholars do not agree on the mechanism or even the existence of long economic waves, however, such projections are of more academic than practical interest." http://www.joshuagoldstein.com/jgeconhi.htm "During the Cold War, high military spending contributed (among other causes) to the economic stagnation of the Soviet Union and the collapse of North Korea, whereas low military spending relative to GDP contributed to Japan's growth and innovation. During the 1990s, as real military spending worldwide fell by about one-third, the United States and others reaped a "peace dividend" in sustained expansion.  However, effects of military spending are long-term, and sharp reductions do not bring quick relief, as Russia's experience since 1991 demonstrates." 1811: The charter for the Rothschilds Bank of the United States runs     out and Congress votes against its renewal. At the time Andrew     Jackson (who would become the 7th President of the United States     from 1829 to 1837) says, â€œIf Congress has a right under the     Constitution to issue paper money, it was given them to use by     themselves, not to be delegated to individuals or corporations.â€? Nathan Mayer Rothschild is not amused and he stated, â€œEither the     application for renewal of the charter is granted, or the United     States will find itself involved in a most disastrous war.â€? Andrew Jacksonâ€™s response to this is to say, â€œYou are a den of     thieves vipers, and I intend to rout you out, and by the Eternal     God, I will rout you out.â€?"  He's got a currency that's been pounded-undervalued  He's got MICEX trading @ a P/E of just under (5).    I'd love to be Vlads friend for the next few years.

Fri, 08/28/2015 - 22:01 | 6483766 johny2 it just shows the Nuland and co made mistake by showing to russian population sure that EU and USA are always going to want to dominate everyone. Great job at uniting russians, otherwise the oil weapon may have even worked. observe Brazil and Russia, both being in economic trouble, but the fortunes of the ppresidents very different. And it is Saudi Arbia who is getting deeper and deeper in trouble invading Jemen. ( funny how USA, Saudi Arabia and Israel assume their rights of sending armies in other countries without any regard to international laws.)  Sat, 08/29/2015 - 02:26 | 6484110 Free_Spirit yeah funny how I don't see anyone sanctioning Saudi right now....  Where TF is kerry anyway, he should be looking ridiculous on TV repeating"there will be costs"...while simultaneously trying to extract his leg from his own backside.  Putin is in great shape but the Russian people hate him more than expected.  Like that term?  I am getting grief from my Russians who are pissed off at me now because to the exchange rate.  I have been telling the Russians I know for a long time to get out of the ruble and buy about anything else.  There is an issue with PM ownership there in good old Russianlandia that I do not think a lot of people realize.  There are mulitple issues in fact.  I still Merican. I see the play Yen.  Mrs. M's mother who very could well have inside dope says the ruble will fall all the way to 100.  That woman is not dumb so I give respect and I will never underestimate her.  I wasn't going to risk much but I will listen to her to see if she is accurate.  I will add this, it is DAMN HARD to get anything out of Russia right now that might be a coin.   I know what you mean Yen.  I could throw a grand at it and hold but I need physical.  I really don't think that we will be able to get that very easily.  I see great value in the Eastern European markets.  When you have these insane valuations in western markets, and all of their manufacturing is off~shore, you should probably plan ahead.  I respect your post and ideas, but "facts are facts".  If you have an opportunity to invest in a product under market value, I'd hope you would be prudent.  How you grow that investment, is at your discretion.

Fri, 08/28/2015 - 21:46 | 6483729 madbraz Hey zerohedge, so saudi arabia increases output to crush oil prices and they are worried about this issue they caused willingly?  Just like China devaluing their currency and you claiming as a fact that they will sell $100 billion in treasuries to counter their own devaluation? Did Goldman's interest rate swap team hire you to spew this BS in favor of primary dealers losing positions in multi billion dollar interest rate swaps or are you spewing gold theoretical nonsense into fixed income? Or, as seems more obvious, do you only care that you get 100,000 clicks on silly articles that confirm readers biases? You did realize that risk assets were in freefall and the yield curve was collapsing, which is what Dudley can't syand, right?

Sat, 08/29/2015 - 10:29 | 6484493 fattail Anything brokered by a war criminal like kissinger is not enforceable in a legal sense.  The only reason we need a petro-dollar is because Nixon and Kissinger abandoned the gold standard so they could bomb civilians in North Vietnam and expand the war on drugs and the war on poverty.  All fascist big government policies that were the seed of our destruction as a country.
