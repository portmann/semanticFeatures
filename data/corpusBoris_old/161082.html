1-800-FLOWERS.COM: This Unloved Stock Has Over 16% Upside - 1-800 FLOWERS.COM, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLWS) | Seeking Alpha FLWS is trading at a significant discount to the market due to concerns over its customer service. However, FLWS and its peer FTD always had angry customers - nothing here is new. 1-800-FLOWERS.COM (NASDAQ: FLWS ) operates as a florist and gift shop. The company operates in three segments: Consumer Floral, Gourmet Food and Gift Baskets and BloomNet Wire Service. The company is trading at a significant discount to the market largely due to concerns over its customer interaction and experiences . However, its reviews have always been very mixed, but it didn't stop the stock from handily beating the market over the past year. My hunch is that flower delivery companies tend to evoke strong emotions, and customers are particularly keen to express their anger online. FLWS's key competitor, FTD Companies (NASDAQ: FTD ) is also plagued with horrifying online reviews. Here is just one example , but you can easily see for yourself by Googling "FTD.com review" and "1-800-Flowers reviews". Terrible reviews have not stopped FLWS's doubled digit revenue growth, nor has it hurt FTD's results. There is nothing new here, so investors shouldn't unduly discount the stock using old information. On the other hand, FLWS has a strong balance sheet and the Street is expecting significant margin expansion, which will drive EPS growth. Revenue expectations are not high, and given the strong US economy, FLWS can significantly outperform if they beat on revenues. Even if we assign the stock a 10% discount to the S&P 500 valuation metrics, we can get over 16% upside from here. IPOing on 8/3/1999, the company has been public for about 16.1 years. FLWS is currently trading at $8.39 per share, a market value of $547.5 million, and an enterprise value of $651.7 million. The stock does not pay a dividend compared to a dividend yield of 2.0% for the S&P 500. FLWS performed very well over the past year, returning 6,249 basis points relative to the S&P 500, or 62.9% in absolute return. The stock is trading 14.7% below its 200-day moving average and over the past 52 weeks have traded at a high of $13.46 and a low of $5.12 per share. Short interest is high at 16.1%. FLWS's revenue grew by a CAGR of 16.1% over the past 3 full fiscal years. Sell-side consensus is forecasting revenues to grow by 6.5% this fiscal year, reaching $1.2 billion and to grow by 5.5% the following fiscal year, reaching $1.3 billion. These revenue expectations are not high relative to FLWS's historical growth and relative to its ability to acquire growth. Over the past three fiscal years, FLWS's EBIT margin increased by 11 basis points from 3.2% to 3.4%. Street consensus is forecasting EBIT margin to expand by 94 basis points this fiscal year to 4.3%, and expand by 93 basis points the following fiscal year to 5.2%. Over the past 3 years, management increased its diluted outstanding common shares by 1.9%. As a result of the revenue, margin, and share dynamics, EPS grew at a CAGR of 14.9% over the past 3 fiscal years. Going forward, consensus is forecasting EPS is to increase by 41.3% reaching $0.42 this fiscal year and to increase by 42.7% reaching $0.61 the following fiscal year. Profitability metrics are OK. ROA is 5.0%, ROE is 8.7%, and ROIC is 7.6%. The balance sheet looks solid. With net debt of $104 million, FLWS is 1.2 times levered to its trailing 12 month EBITDA of $73 million. Debt to Equity is 18%, current ratio is 1.3 and Altman's Z Score is 3.9. However, expected FCF conversion from EBITDA this fiscal year is low at only 39.7%. Using consensus estimates for next fiscal year's results (FY2), FLWS is currently trading at an EV/Sales multiple of 0.5, an EV/EBIT multiple of 9.9, a P/E multiple of 13.9, and a FCF multiple of 12.2. Relative to the S&P 500, FLWS is trading at EV/Sales discount of 68.1%, an EV/EBIT discount of 24.3%, P/E discount of 7.1%, and FCF discount of 30.2%. Focusing in on the key EV/EBIT, P/E, and FCF metrics, FLWS deserves a 10.0% discount to the S&P 500 due to its fast growth, margin expansion, and strong balance sheet, offset by concerns over its customer service. (This is being conservative!) Applying such a discount to these valuation metrics implies a price target of $9.74 or a 16.1% upside potential from the current price.
