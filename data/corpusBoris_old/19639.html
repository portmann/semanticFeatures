How To Safely Invest In Infrastructure | Seeking Alpha I will summarize some important points I have learned about investing in infrastructure. BRK, BIP and KMI share many elements in their strategy. I have recently perused SA transcripts of Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE: BIP ) earnings calls, trying to learn about investing in infrastructure. I will summarize some of my findings in this article. As we know from the history, extraordinary people have produced extraordinary results in suitable circumstances. There are many businesses showing great success thanks to great leadership. However, many of those compete in industries which are inherently unpredictable. I have a strong preference for businesses whose results depend very little on genius leadership, great insights or just pure luck. An example is Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.A , BRK.B ) with its insurance businesses. There are two factors of utmost importance. First, it is their focus on disciplined underwriting --- they are willing to accept a sharp drop in volume if pricing in inadequate. Second, it is avoidance of catastrophic risks threatening the very existence of the company --- every issued policy has a cap, they do not borrow money and always keep at least $20 billion on hand. What I like about this is that both these elements of their strategy do not demand anything special from the management except the emotional discipline to carry them out. The situation in infrastructure is similar. Infrastructure assets tend to have very reliable cash flows which can be predicted with reasonable certainty and are usually backed by long-term contracts. Of course, you can create your own disaster: either by overpaying for assets or by assuming too much risk, especially political risk. If you are significantly overpaying, you are almost sure to get very poor (though reliable) returns; there is little to add. While political risks are more complicated thanks to their unquantifiability, the history of the 20th century is quite clear: markets with significant political risks did not produce extraordinary returns, but featured occasional losses of extraordinary magnitude, often 100%. An infrastructure company thus needs firm discipline to avoid overpaying and patience to avoid risky markets if the safer ones are overvalued. Again, nothing requiring a true genius. But the crucial factor here is whether the management has incentives to maintain the discipline. The simplest way to achieve this is to have the manager own a significant portion of the business -- exactly as it is with Berkshire Hathaway, Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI ) or Brookfield Infrastructure Partners. The management of BIP targets long-term annual returns of 12 to 15 percent. They plan to issue equity to acquire new assets if they can get the target return. It is noteworthy that they do not change the target with market conditions or the stock price -- an important sign of the discipline. How do we know how to judge management? Well, there is nothing better than comparing their words with their deeds. That takes a reasonably long track record, and all the three companies are among the top in management quality (and business results) ranking. To avoid lengthening the article unnecessarily, I am referring the reader to check the company websites for details on past business performance. As far as my knowledge goes, all three managements do what they say. I also like that although they could boast quite rightfully, they are humble and avoid praising themselves. Regarding the political risk, BRK and KMI operate almost exclusively in the U.S. and Canada, which offer perhaps the lowest level of political risk available in the world. BIP focuses its operations on the U.S., Canada, Western Europe (UK and recently France), Australia, and selected regions of Latin America (Chile, Brazil, Colombia). I believe that their exposure to political risk is also quite low and threatening mostly only certain assets and not the company as a whole. (They are qualified as a partnership for tax purposes; loss of this status might adversely affect the distributions, but not the growth potential.) Another element of safety comes from maintaining reasonable levels of debt. BIP avoids deals structured as PPP (at least for now) because the equity levels are too thin and there is a lot of debt involved; consequently, they cannot compete on price with more aggressive competitors. Whenever possible, BIP utilizes non-recourse debt, thus limiting the catastrophic risk; they prefer to borrow in local currency to avoid currency risk. They also utilize currency swaps because U.S. markets offer much longer bond durations compared to Australia. At all times, the management aims for investment grade credit rating not only at the parent entity (BBB+ at present), but also at subsidiaries (BBB-). Similarly to BIP, Berkshire uses non-recourse debt for its infrastructure subsidiaries BNSF (a railroad) and BHE (a utility, formerly known as MidAmerican). BNSF's debentures are rated BBB+ and BHE's debt is rated A- by S&P. As far as I know, Kinder Morgan does not utilize non-recourse debt much, but they hold a stake (together with BIP) in NGPL which was recapitalized to decrease the debt level. KMI's debt is rated BBB-; you can find more details in their latest fixed income investor presentation . There is another common element in all the three companies: they are quite diversified, getting only a limited exposure to any single regulatory body. Of course, BRK and KMI are mostly confined to the U.S., but this comes with little currency risk compared to BIP, which might actually please some investors. Also, note that both BHE and KMI have top track records regarding safety of operation, which surely helps when negotiating with the regulators. (I could not get much data on safety regarding BIP, but I did not find any evidence of a lack of attention.) I have learned that there is one very important element when judging the future possible returns of an infrastructure business. It is that returns on organic infrastructure projects tend to be higher than on acquisitions. In addition, when you have little organic expansion opportunities, you are dependent on acquisitions and thus on prices others are willing to take. Therefore, a smart infrastructure investor would prefer to own assets with expansion potential. It is exactly what all the three infrastructure companies featured in this article do. BIP has recently sold out of assets with little perspective for future growth (timberlands and certain utilities) and entered railroads in Brazil and telecom towers in France. BHE is in the process of building an extensive portfolio of renewable power generation and BNSF spends about $6 billion a year on capital expenditures (about one third of that is maintenance). Finally, KMI, with its access to almost all corners of the country, has plenty of potential in pipeline capacity enhancements and natural gas exports. A must-have requirement for any expansion is to have access to lots of cheap capital. BHE gets it by retaining all of its earnings (and having access to Berkshire's almost endless pool of cash), which gives it a definite competitive advantage against other public utilities owned mostly be dividend-seeking shareholders. BIP retains about a third of its cash flow to fund future investments, and issues equity opportunistically. KMI has acquired its MLPs to lower the cost of capital and improve excess dividend coverage. Thus far, we have established that our three companies have proven earnings power and a good potential for future expansion, sufficient access to capital to fund the expansion, capable management focusing on safety of investment and operations first and returns second. The remaining element is on the investor's part: one has to get the right purchase price. Fortunately, all the three businesses trade for a reasonable price which promises returns in the 5-15% range. It is not possible to buy BHE or BNSF without the rest of Berkshire, but as is publicly known, Buffett considers BRK to be meaningfully undervalued at 1.2 times book value and overvalued at 2 times book. The current price of about 1.5-1.6 times book value is thus close to intrinsic value, perhaps even giving a small margin of safety and some downside protection. KMI trades at $42 with forward dividend yield of slightly less than 5% and with a promise of 10% dividend increases for the next five years. BIP, trading at $46, offers a dividend yield of 4.6%. Management is targeting long-term annual dividend increases of 5 to 9%. I believe that all the three mentioned companies offer promising returns, especially in the current investment environment. I would definitely choose any of them over bonds and most other stocks in a retirement account. They also provide a tough benchmark for any utility or infrastructure play you are considering as an addition to your portfolio.
