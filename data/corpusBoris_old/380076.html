Canadian finance minister Bill Morneau and Canadaâ€™s new Liberal government are breaking with the policies of Conservative predecessors to ramp up spending on infrastructure while cutting taxes for the middle class. Photo: Chris Goodney/Bloomberg If the International Monetary Fund needs a poster childÂ for their prescription for the global economy, it need to look no further than Canada and its new finance minster, Bill Morneau. The IMF has been pushing theÂ  worldâ€™s largest economies to boost government spending â€”or slow down belt-tightening plansâ€”to help give central-bank efforts traction as their easy money policies run out of steam Â and theÂ  global economy risks stalling . Few countries, from the U.K. to Japan and China to Germany , are heeding that advice. Then comes Canada and its freshly installed Liberal government, which is now breaking with the policies of its Conservative predecessorsÂ to ramp up spending on infrastructure while cutting taxes for the middle class. All of this will add to Canada’s debt, but as Mr. Morneau is eager to point out, Canada is uniquely well positioned to take on more debt. â€œIf you look at our balance sheet, our net debt to GDP, weâ€™re in a very advantageous position compared to all other G-7 countries,â€? he said, referring to the Group of Seven industrialized countries. Unlike most other of the group’s rich-country members, Canada has far more room in its budget to maneuver. Besides its moderate debt levels, its health-care and pension-fund liabilities are covered for the next several generations and hasÂ a relatively low budget deficit, all legacies of former governments. In contrast, Japanâ€™s debt levelsâ€”at nearly 250% of gross domestic productâ€”risk sparking financial catastrophe if not managed well. The U.S. is still struggling to keep its debt under control and figure out how to cover its longer-term Social Security obligations. And, in the shadow of the European debt crisis, thereâ€™s still fear of borrowing more now to invest in an uncertain future. Thatâ€™s one reason why few expect German Finance Minister Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble will suddenly convert from fiscal hawk to expansionary disciple. Mr. Morneau estimates the first $12 billion of a 10-year, $120 billion plan should add 0.5 percentage point to growth this year and 1 percentage point next, reviving souring growth prospects for the major oil exporter. In designing the new spending package, he said, the government was “influenced by the things we heard from the IMF, the [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] and around the table at the [Group of 20].” While perhaps not as optimistic about the growth-boosting effects, the Bank of Canada agrees.Â Wednesday, the central bank kept rates steady afterÂ  raising its outlook for the year on the back of the governmentâ€™s new fiscal plans . Tuesday, the IMF cut its forecast for Canadaâ€™s growth in 2016 and 2017 by 0.2 percentage point year to 1.5% and 1.9%, respectively, amidÂ weak oil prices. But it said the governmentâ€™s public investments, aided by a cheaper Canadian dollar, should partially offset the drag from the energy sector. Mr. Morneau is now proselytizing, hoping to convert some of his more skeptical colleagues at the gathering of world financial leaders this week in Washington. â€œWhat Iâ€™ll be talking about with colleagues around the world is the need for us to consider fiscal measures in order to deal with what is a challenging growth environment,â€? he said. â€œItâ€™s not only about making investments, but itâ€™s also about not declining investments at a time when global growth is challenged.” The IMF Is Sounding the Alarm.
