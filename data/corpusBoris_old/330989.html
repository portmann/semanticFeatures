I’ll now turn the call over to Mr. Zhu to discuss the operational highlights. Mr. Zhu, please go ahead. Thank you everyone for joining us for our first record fiscal year 2016 financial results conference call. Our operating result were released earlier and are available on our company website as well as on the internet from [indiscernible]. I will begin on slide 4 with an overview of our results. We’re pleased to kick off fiscal year 2016 on a high note by exceeding our revenue guidance range and posting strong growth in cash receipts from online course registration. This strong performance in the first quarter demonstrates that students and professionals continue to appreciate and trust our ability to develop and provide high quality courseware and services. Our total net revenue increased by 13.5% year-over-year to $24.4 million in the first quarter exceeding our guidance range of 21.5 million to 22.6 million. We also achieved a year-over-year increase of 32.7% in cash receipts from online course registration and a year-over-year increase of 11.9% in course enrollment in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. In particular we felt strong cash revenue across our key test preparation courses in our acaccounting vertical including APQE, CPA, as well as tax advisor all of which contributed through a year-over-year increase of 24% in cash receipts from online course registration from our acaccounting vertical. Moreover our healthcare vertical continues to deliver impressive results as well. Regarding a significant increase in cash receipts from online course registration of a 123% year-over-year. With significant growth in cash receipts from online course registration in the first quarter clearly demonstrates that our investments are bearing fruit and have strengthened our competitive position. We look forward to carrying this strong momentum we have built during our first fiscal quarter into our heavy enrollment season [ph] which is just now beginning. Our strong operating performance, financial strengthen and confidence in our outlook allow us to maintenance our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. In January we paid a special cash dividend of $31.1 million or 0.225 per general share for shareholders of record as of this close of trading on January 6, 2016. In addition as of January 31, 2016 the company has repurchased 1.122209 million [ph] ADS on the open market for consideration of $15.2 million since approval of our share buyback program in August 2015. Together this special dividend and share buyback activity through January 31, 2015 represent a return of $46.3 million to shareholders. Yesterday our Board of Directors further increased the share rate purchase authorization by an addition $20 million for a total of $40 million. We believe our balance of growth strategy will allow us to continue to grow cash and profitability and consistently increase value for the shareholders. I would like to talk about our previously announced listing application of our subsidiary Zhengbaoyucai on China's new third board [ph]. Zhengbaoyucai provides business 20 programs to investor students, job seekers and individuals who are interested in learning on how to launch new businesses. In collection, it's proposed listing of Yucai we issued equity interest in Yucai to select offices and employees representing 40% in large equity interest for approximately RMB31.7 million. [Indiscernible] approximately 16% equity interest in Yucai as disclosed in our 20F filing. We believe our successful domestic listing will further enhance Yucai's brand recognition and visibility across China while providing the opportunity to raise capital from China's dynamic capital market to fund future growth. Moreover we believe the listing of Yucai on China's New Third Board has the potential to unlock value that’s not been still be recognized by the U.S. capital market given Yucai's unique business model specific to China. For this reason we ultimately believe we will list on China's New Third Board is in the best interest of CDEL and our shareholders. In addition, I want to underscore that our intention is for China Distance Education to remain a U.S. listed company. We believe the combination of a U.S. listed entity with a China listed vehicle gives us the ultimate flexibility to slow [ph] value enhancing acquisition and investment opportunities in China. Our solid financial and operating results for the first quarter as well as a continued return of capital to our shareholders were underpinned by the successful execution of our growth strategy. First, our strategy continues to be focused on increasing enrollments in existing topics. In the first quarter total course enrollment was 1.2 million representing a year-over-year increase of 11.9%. Enrollment for our test preparation courses would generate the majority of our revenue will offer impressive 15% year-over-year in the first quarter. As a result we recorded $26.7 million of cash receipts from our online course registration in the first fiscal quarter representing growth of 32.7% year-over-year excluding the impact of the recent depreciation of RMB against the U.S. dollar, cash receipts for our online course registration increased by 38% year-over-year in the first fiscal quarter. Second as with strong growth opportunities in existing verticals we also see opportunities to find our core portfolio in another vertical. We now offer healthcare [indiscernible] continuing education courses and began generation revenue from this courses during the first fiscal quarter. With this education courses will generate many enrollments and revenue in the coming quarters. Our funding as course portfolio we understand the delivery of our high quality content and services to growing learning communities and to generate incremental growth across our business. Third, we continue to make progress in our urban learning platform, in the first quarter total cash registration revenue grew by 15.9% year-over-year to $2.6 million for courses and services delivered via our urban learning platform are included a component of services commitment that required us to deliver online video interactive courses. Our urban learning platform [indiscernible] in our long term strategy which is to develop China Distance Education and students, premium learning partner. China is the nation with tremendous emphasis on education with growing technology adoption, online education is evolving rapidly with broadened accessibility and reach. In particular, online professional education and live [indiscernible] are playing more critical roles in driving that development of the online education industry. There are significant opportunities ahead of us and we believe CDEL is well-positioned to enhance its presence in a lifelong learning market. Moving on to other mobile learning initiative, we remain committed to providing high quality courses and services that are generated superior outcomes and career advancement opportunities for our students while enabling students to learn in a convenient and effective manner. During the first quarter we continued to see a very strong adoption of mobile learning by our students, for example daily mobile traffic from our mobile website and mobile education in the accounting vertical is almost half the level of our daily record of internet traffic in counting. And average number of daily active mobile users in our first fiscal quarter was up 59% year-over-year in our accounting vertical. As of December 31, 2015 we offered 58 mobile applications with a cumulative download of 30 million up from 11.6 million as of the end of September 2016. Moving to our sixth pillar, College Cooperation Program, we believe this program is important strategic growth initiative as it allow us to expand our reach into China's large college student market and further solidify our leading position in China's online professional education industry. We’re extremely excited about our progress in the first quarter. Since the College Cooperation Program debut last year we have expanded the number of participating colleges to nearly 300 building a solid foundation for enrollment in the coming 2016 to 2017 full year. In addition they are over 10,000 vocational and career colleges in China housing great opportunities as we work with a growing number of universities and colleges across China. Now let me quickly walk you through some of our key operating metrics on slide 6 and 7. Before we begin I would like to highlight the impact of the recent depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. The average exchange rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was 6.3893 compared with 6.1459 in the prior year period representing RMB depreciation of 3.9%. Consequently the depreciation of RMB had a negative impact another ASPs and our revenue growth in the first fiscal quarter. In the first quarter enrollment start online services increased by 52% year-over-year while the ASPs decreased by 18.3% year-over-year many due to the enrollment mix as we stopped offering higher ASP multi-year courses beginning in fiscal 2016. Our online APQE courses during the first quarter enrollments increased by 13.7% year-over-year while ASP decreased by 8.8% year-over-year many due to enrollment mix as we stopped offering higher ASP multi-year courses beginning in fiscal 2016. For other online test prep courses during the first quarter enrollments increased by 53.6% year-over-year many due to resumption of the tax advisor exam, the ASP for other online accounting test prep courses during the first quarter increased by 4.8% year-over-year also mainly due to more enrollment attributable to higher tax advisor courses compared with the same period in the prior fiscal year. Enrollments for accounting continuing education courses in the first quarter increased by 3.6% year-over-year while the ASP decreased by 2.4% year-over-year, the virtually slow growth in the enrollment from accounting education courses if primarily due to seasonality. In the first quarter enrollments from online healthcare test preparation courses were very strong increasing a 135.2% year-over-year many due to early stops to the enrollment season for our national practicing medical doctor qualification examination test preparation courses compared with the year ago period. And the continuous popularity of our license to pharmacist for education test preparation courses. The ASP for online healthcare test preparation courses during the first quarter decreased by 8.4% year-over-year many due to enrollment mix. In the first quarter enrollments from engineering and construction online test preparation courses increased by 6.6% year-over-year while the ASP decreased by 9.7% year-over-year mainly due to enrollment mix as we stopped offering higher ASP multiple year courses beginning in fiscal 2016. Enrollments from other engineering and construction continuing education courses in the first quarter decreased by 46.6% year-over-year mainly due to seasonality. The ASP for EMC continuing education courses during the first quarter increased by 68.4% year-over-year. The increase in ASP was mainly due to more enrollments from location where ASP where higher. As we end our heavy enrollment season we aim to expand the momentum established during our first quarter with our leading brands, our commitment to deliver first in class courses and services and our problematic prompt growth strategy we remain excited about the future prospects of our business and looking forward to another year of success. This completes my update on the business operations. Now I will turn the call over to Mark, our Co-CFO to walk you through our financials. Mark? Let's turn to slide 10 to look at some of our key financial metrics. As a reminder our earnings release together with this call includes discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures. I encourage you to refer to our earnings released which contains the reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Total net revenue increased by 13.5% to $24.4 million from $21.5 million in the prior year period exceeding the company's guidance range of $21.5 million to $22.6 million which represented 0% to 5% year over year growth. The outperformance of top line growth relative to our first quarter revenue guidance was primarily due to the earlier release of results for the National Practicing Medical Doctor qualification examinations compared with the prior year which resulted in recognition of certain revenue tied to these exam results in the first quarter of 2016 or as such revenue is recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Excluding this revenue effect total net revenue growth in our first fiscal quarter would have been 5.5% year-over-year slightly above the top end of our revenue guidance range. As a result of the earlier recognition of this revenue compared with the prior fiscal year we expect our second quarter fiscal 2016 revenue will be negatively impacted correspondingly. Net revenue from online education services was $19.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. A 10.5% increase from $17.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Net revenue from books and reference materials increased by 40.3% to $1.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and $1.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Net revenue from other sources increased by 19.6% to $3.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 from $2.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 mainly due to higher revenue from in-person health care professional training courses and business start-up training courses. Gross margin was 52.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared with 54.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Non-GAAP gross margin was 42.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared with 54.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. The year-over-year decline in gross margin was attributable to increased salaries and related expenses, rental and related expenses and other miscellaneous expenses. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in lecture fees due to the delay and the timing of lecture recordings during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared with the same period of the prior fiscal year. Selling expensive increased by 25% to $5.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 to $4.3 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP selling expenses increased by 24.8% to $5.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 from $4.3 million in the prior year period. The increase in selling expenses was primarily driven by an expansion of our marketing promotional activities, higher rental and related expenses and other selling expenses in particular as a result of the earlier release of certain health care exam results as previously discussed we incur selling expenses for the next sitting of these exams earlier in the fiscal 2016 compared with the prior fiscal year. This increase was partially offset by decrease commissions for our distributors. General and administrative expenses increased by 49.9% to $4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 from $2.7 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses increased by 45.6% to $3.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 from 2.4 million in the prior year period. The increase in general and administrative expenses was due to higher share based compensation expenses and to a lesser degree higher other administrative expenses. Of note in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 general and administrative expenses included a reversal of bad debt provision. As a result of the foregoing, the non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was 16.6% down from 23.6% in the same period of the prior fiscal year. We continue to anticipate modest non-GAAP operating margin expansion in fiscal 2016 as a result of diligent expense control amid expectations of continued revenue growth. Income tax expense decreased by 13.5% $1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 from $1.2 million in the prior year period. The decline was mainly due to a decrease in taxable income. Net income decreased by 10.4% to $4.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 from $4.6 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income decreased by 4.6% to $4.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 from $4.8 million in the prior year period. Now let's turn to slide 11 to review our cash flow. Net operating cash inflow increased by 78.1% to $12.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 from $6.9 million in the prior year period. The significant increase in operating cash inflow was primarily attributable to the year over year increase in deferred revenue tied to the strong growth in cash receipts from on-line course registration. Cash and cash equivalent term deposits and restricted cash as of December 31, 2015 was 135.9 million down from $138.9 million as of September 30, 2015 mainly due to use of $9.9 million for the repurchase of our ADS in the open market and the exchange rate effect of recent depreciation of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar. This decrease was partially offset by robust cash flow generated from operating activities in the first quarter. This completes my financial overview. Now I will return the call back to Mr. Zhu for concluding remarks on our strategy and business update as well as financial guidance for the second quarter and fiscal year 2016. Mr. Zhu, please. With the successful first fiscal quarter behind us, we’re off to a solid start for the year we’re pleased to have driven a reacceleration of cash revenue during our first fiscal quarter and remain confident in our business outlook. As has been the case since inception of China Distance Education, our market growth strategy is underpinned by our steady fast [indiscernible] on growing our business organically. Strong execution across our core businesses such as accounting, healthcare and construction verticals net growth initiatives in healthcare and continue education and our College Corporation Program and others all helped building a strong foundation for sustained growth and shareholder values. While we remain focused on organic growth we will also increasingly look at selective measures and aggregation and other strategic value enhancing investment opportunities to further enhance our growth profile. More over I’ve a [indiscernible] both the U.S. and Chinese capital markets through our planned Yucai, China listed entity we can capitalize on opportunities that maximize returns for both CDEL and other shareholders. Turning to our outlook, we expect to generate total net revenue in a range of $24.1 million to $25.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 representing year-over-year growth of approximately 8% to 13%. While fiscal 2015 we expect to generate total net revenue in a range of $124.4 million to a $129.8 million representing year-over-year growth of approximately 15% to 20%. This concludes my prepared remarks. Thank you for your time. Operator we’re now happy to take questions. Couple of questions here, towards the end of the call Mark you talked about strategic alternatives and other uses of your capital. Do you see that as something that would impact the business in 2016 potentially or was that just a high level comment and then separately any thoughts about your dividend this year considering this amount up in the year share buyback would be helpful. Thank you. I will take that last one first regarding our dividend policy. Bottom line here is there is no change to our dividend policy to spike up in the share buyback we continue to have a policy where at the end of the year our Board looks at our excess cash position and decides based on our cash needs, our cash position going forward if and how much dividend to pay but there's no change at all in how we approach the dividend policy and Gene, could you touch on your first question again? Yes the business obviously is doing well and you talk about other ways to grow the business, I don’t know if it's through potentially M&A or other investments? I don’t know if I understand that comment correctly but if that indeed is the case would we be expecting something in 2016 or is that just a high level strategic initiative and they are drilling up in the works? I like to elaborate a little bit more of what I said in the conference call. We have always had an multi-pronged growth strategy but in the past we have been more taken than more conservative organic growth path, but going forward while our strategy will remain - we’re going to be bit more aggressive on the M&A speed both as a long term strategy and possibly something in the near future. So two questions, and number one is actually trying to ask Zhu, so in the past fiscal calendar year 2015 so when you look past one year what kind of challenges and/or opportunities you’ve seen in terms of both macro-environment and also specific company operation side and second question is about your average student's payment. I notice that from most of the courses you’ve actually the ASP is actually coming down quite big. So I apologize if I may, I may know what's the reason behind that? While our company growth strategy has always been lifelong learning and comprehensive learning in the past and to-date our focus has always been on career, our professional education. Within that professional sort of horizon we focus more on accounting healthcare, construction and engineer vertical. Giving [indiscernible] as example, test prep courses has always been our core focus and we have grown very strongly in that area but at the same time we also continue to build solid bases for future growth in other areas of accounting. For example College Collaboration or College Cooperation Programs we have signed up close to 300 colleges and universities creating a building of very solid foundation for revenue growth with this program. Healthcare on the same time has had very fast growth in the past and we have viewed grand recognition and vertical leadership with the vertical as well. Going forward we’re confident that we will continue to see fast growth in the healthcare vertical. On E&C [ph] vertical on the other hand due to the sort of relatively gloom industry outlook we don’t expect to see a significant or fast growth in this vertical in the short future. However at the same time we’re also expanding into other areas for example teacher's continuing education. All in all we’re very confident that we will maintain 15% to 20% kind of GAAP revenue. Because of the huge market potential we have we’re very confident that this kind of growth pace is highly sustainable. In terms of the macro economic conditions in China as well as the challenges and opportunities that pose the company we’re not as pessimistic about the macro-economic condition in China, at the same time we believe that the professional training and the verticals we’re in basically add [indiscernible] nature. In fact as the economies being a relatively difficult period of time, more people will seek to get professional designation and career training or sort of job related training to have better job opportunities which is an opportunity for us. Thank you. You’re right, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks we did see ASP declines in accounting and E&C in particular. The reasons are really twofold number one primarily here we stopped offering higher ASP multi-year courses starting in fiscal 2016 and secondly it's important not to overlook the act of currency. We saw 4% year-over-year headwind in the first quarter relative to the devaluation of renminbi. I actually have three questions, first one to Zhu, what is the revenue model for the College Cooperation Program right now since we’ve already had partnered with 300 schools. And second one is do we see an issue from like dispatching RMB like outside of China to pay dividends given the tighter capital control currently and the third question is I’ve noticed that we have started to offer some face to face classes in our healthcare segment, is there any financial impact that we should consider on this initiative. With the College Cooperation there are four areas of cooperation, first is joint offering courses whereby we provide online courses, question sort of online courses then question data bank and mark question and actual online exams. While the university and college teachers will be the in-class sort of tutors and assistant teachers for our courses. The second one is basically the real sort of we call real booking sort of simulation training. It's a software plus online real-time broadcast course kind of format. The real time online broadcasting will be provided by teachers. The third is actually an online internship that’s provided by [indiscernible] sort of solution with real jobs for our students. The last one being a job recommendation kind of course whereby we provide our students with a guidance on how to apply for jobs as well as big data base and students analytics [ph] to help them improve career prospects. Each program we charge students a separate fee, the first three categories of portions [ph] and services are charging a fee of about RMB400 while the job career recommendation based course actually we charge them a few thousand RMB. Of course the signing up of close to 300 college and universities and promoting the program to more colleges and university, it's only the first step of a successful college collaboration program after this promotions we will need to get ready both on software IT infrastructure as well as ground operations. In addition as we roll out those programs we will also need to monitor the progress and continue to include the delivery to make sure our students quality courses and services. It will probably take another year before we see meaningful revenue contribution from this project [ph]. The second question about whether we will be able to send U.S. dollar outside China to pay for dividend, we’re confident that in general the policy direction of the government is generally been more open and making the currency conversion more free. The tight foreign currency control especially U.S. dollar control especially U.S. dollar control in place right now are more in temporary in nature. Of course we will also make cooperation's with all sort of options we have to make sure we will have sufficient U.S. dollars to pay our shareholders. I want to emphasize that back in 2012 we formed a company policy whereby we were assessed company operations, financial projects, our [Technical Difficulty] and other sort of prospective and other areas of cash generation and cash needs to determine the excess cash we will have on balance sheet and based our dividend amount on that. I want to remind our investors that ever since 2012 we have been increasing our dividend amount every year. We believe that dividend is a very good way of paying our shareholders and returning value to our shareholders and we appreciate our shareholders support through the years. In terms of the three healthcare face to face or offline courses and the impact of financials first of all we believe that combining online and some offline sort of courses should give students better learning results and that’s the main reason why we offer supplementary offline courses. In addition the three offline courses serve as a very important marketing and promotion approach and the goal is to have in the end better sort of enrollment and revenue growth and overall better sort of market recognition of our healthcare training courses. We’re confident that the free course well taken. There are no further question. At this time I would now like to hand the conference back to today's presenter. Please continue.
