New Oriental: Attractive Growth And Value - New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. (NYSE:EDU) | Seeking Alpha New Oriental delivered fiscal Q4 earnings and revenue ahead of views. Product upgrades, learning center expansion and O2O investments to continue to weigh on New Orientalâ€™s operating margin in fiscal 2016. Renewed top line growth and "optimize the market" strategy to drive significant bottom line growth in the next three to five years. Reward/risk highly favorable for the bulls, but margin outlook for fiscal 2016 most likely puts P/E expansion on hold for the next couple of quarters. New Oriental (NYSE: EDU ) reported fiscal Q4 earnings and revenue ahead of analyst estimates. This is the second consecutive quarter of solid top line growth, which would have been $5.3 million higher if we add the deferred revenue related to the new loyalty program which will be recognized in subsequent quarters. Margins remain under pressure as the company continues to invest aggressively in its online and O2O initiative, but the weakness in China's stock market has weighed on New Oriental's share price in the last two months. I remain bullish on New Oriental and think that the latest pullback is a solid long-term buying opportunity. New Oriental's fiscal Q4 revenue increased 14.4% to $328.8 million, which was $2 million above the analyst consensus. Non-GAAP EPS was down 13% to $0.26, but this was $0.05 better than analyst expectations. Total enrollments in fiscal Q4 increased 35% Y/Y, which is encouraging, but reflects the delays in fiscal Q3, which rolled over to fiscal Q4, as well as the early demand for the summer class, which additionally exacerbated the figure. Management stated on the fiscal Q4 call that enrollment growth would have been in the 8% to 10% range on an apples-to-apples basis. The company guided fiscal Q1 2016 revenue between $441.3 million and $457 million, representing a 12% to 16% Y/Y increase. The mid-point of the guidance is roughly in line with the analyst consensus. New Oriental's "optimize the market" strategy is still in its early stage. The strategy aims to increase both the top and bottom line growth, and so far, the top line part of the strategy is working. Revenue growth was in the 13% to 14% range in the last three quarters despite the changes the company has made over the past few quarters. The revamped POP Kids segment has started to grow once again and the segment's revenue has increased for the second quarter in a row, while enrollment growth was 48% in fiscal Q4. On the other hand, bottom line growth remained negative in fiscal Q4, which was a fourth consecutive quarter of EPS declines. This was largely a consequence of increased spending related to the company's online and O2O initiative. The company spent $39 million on its online and O2O segments in fiscal 2016 and intends to spend $50 million in fiscal 2016. The initiative is divided into three segments: O2O, pure online offerings and minority investments in online education companies. These investments are a temporary drag on margins, but as they begin to scale in the following years, margins should start to trend higher. I was previously expecting margin expansion to resume in fiscal 2016, but management expects slightly lower margins in fiscal 2016 on higher spending. This was likely the reason for the negative post-earnings investor reaction (in addition to the weakness in China' stock market), as it delays the P/E expansion I was anticipating back in April. Since margins will not expand in fiscal 2016, I think that P/E expansion is off the table, at least in the next two or three quarters. I now expect New Oriental's P/E ratio to remain in the 15 to 20 range in the next six to nine months, but further contraction is not likely, as earnings growth will resume despite the modest margin contraction expectations for fiscal 2016. The return of EPS growth will likely drive the P/E ratio back to 20, and my price target on New Oriental is now $28.50, based on a forward 2016 P/E of 20. Looking at pure valuation and growth expectations, additional downside should be limited and a P/E around 15 will likely mark the bottom, which translates into 10% to 15% downside from the current price. However, the vicious selloff in China may lead to a more profound correction and the stock might continue to fall beyond a P/E ratio of 15, but I view the current price as very attractive for long-term holders and the P/E expansion scenario is possible once we get a clear picture on margins in fiscal 2017, and the upside in such a case should be in the 70% to 100% range in the next two to three years. Increased competition and online disruption remain the major risks to the long thesis, but I think that New Oriental remains well positioned to benefit from the secular growth trends in China's offline and online education market. The other risk is a low go private offer, as we saw plenty of them in the last three months. New Oriental's management clearly stated on the fiscal Q4 call that they do not intend to take the company private. However, the confidence of U.S. investors is shaken and it might take time for companies from China to regain their trust, which might translate into lower valuations for Chinese stocks in the following months or even years. The other important risk factor, at least for the short-term share price movement, is the bear market in China, which might weigh on New Oriental and bring its share price below a TTM P/E of 15. New Oriental is executing its "optimize the market" strategy very well and the renewed revenue and earnings growth (despite expectations for modest margin contraction) should positively affect its share price in the following months. The margin outlook for fiscal 2016 will likely delay the expected P/E expansion by six to nine months, but the reward/risk ratio is favorable for the bulls given the 28% upside to my $28.50 price target and the 10% to 15% downside, which is subject to additional downward adjustments in the case of a prolonged selloff in China (but should have a minimum effect on New Oriental's fundamentals). The company has a robust balance sheet and generates significant free cash flow, which it should continue to use for the benefit of its long-term shareholders. New Oriental's current market cap is $3.5 billion, while its net cash position is just over $1.1 billion (close to one-third of its market cap). The company should generate free cash flow north of $200 million this fiscal year and likely around $250 million in fiscal 2017, and may use the additional funds to buy back a significant number of outstanding shares. The robust balance sheet, solid growth prospects, a low valuation and P/E expansion potential make New Oriental a solid long-term investment and the stock should withstand the weakness in China better than other companies with high valuations and weaker balance sheets and those focused on short-term gains and going private.
