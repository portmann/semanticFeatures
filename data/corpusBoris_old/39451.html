Learn more about PRO » With over 33% of the company's float sold short, sentiment surrounding Vera Bradley has become far too negative; the situation is ripe for a short squeeze from good news. While it is true that fiscal 2015 P&L performance was weak, Vera Bradley's cash flows tell a different story, with record operating and free cash flow last year. In total, management and the board own over 40% of the company, giving them every incentive to successfully turn Vera Bradley around. Pristine, debt-free balance sheet (cash is ~20% of the market cap) will support continued investments in the business; all areas of the company are being restructured, leaving no stone unturned. Shares trade at a trailing free-cash flow yield of almost 12%, and over 9% based on our forward estimates. Both are well above the free-cash flow yields of peers. Over the long arc of time, a company's stock price should align with its fundamentals. But in the short run, the two can often diverge, leading to a mispricing of the company within the stock market. This divergence is often the product of sentiment as investor expectations and attitude toward a company become unhinged from the company's actual performance or potential. And that is the state of affairs today regarding Vera Bradley (NASDAQ: VRA ). In July 2014, Jeremy Raper published an insightful short thesis on Vera Bradley, arguing that the stock was overvalued given its growth prospects and forecasted 25% downside for the company. The call was well-timed, and from the close on July 2, 2014 (the date of his publication) to the close on April 23, 2015, the shares have lost over 35% of their value, falling from $21.65 to $13.96. But shorting Vera Bradley at almost $22 is far different than doing so at below $14, and at current prices, the company offers a far different value proposition than it did at $21.65. And yet, the market does not currently see it that way. In short, many investors know of Vera Bradley, but we believe that many do not understand the true state of business at the company. Currently, over 34% of Vera Bradley's float is sold short, a level of short interest and negative sentiment usually reserved for unprofitable companies in or nearing financial distress. And on a technical basis, shares of Vera Bradley currently sport an RSI of less than 19 (an asset with an RSI of less than 30 is considered to be oversold). This level of short interest highlights the decidedly negative sentiment surrounding the company, and at first glance, it is easy to see why this is the case. Since its record fiscal 2013 results, Vera Bradley has posted two straight years of declines in sales, gross margin, EBIT, EBITDA, and EPS, and while sales and gross margins are set to begin recovering this year (fiscal 2016), EBITDA and EPS are not, as Vera Bradley increases its investments in its business to reposition itself amidst a competitive retail landscape. But does this justify having over a third of its float sold short? It would be one thing if the company were losing money, in danger of breaching its debt covenants, and burning through its cash. But when it comes to Vera Bradley, none of these apply. Even with a projected decline in EPS this fiscal year, it will remain solidly profitable. The company is not in danger of breaching its debt covenants, because it has no debt in the first place. What the company does have, however, is over $112 million in cash, equal to almost a fifth of its market capitalization. And it is not burning cash. On the contrary, both operating and free cash flow reached record levels in fiscal 2015, as Vera Bradley prudently managed its working capital. All this has left the stock trading at a trailing free cash flow yield of almost 12%, more than twice as high as its peer average (much more detail on this to follow later). While cash flows are likely to decline in fiscal 2016 as the company increases its investments in its revamped product line, we still expect robust cash flow performance, and note that even after factoring in a meaningful decline in cash flows, Vera Bradley will still likely generate more operating cash flow as a percentage of sales than its peer average. We believe that the sentiment surrounding the company has become far too negative. We freely admit that Vera Bradley is decidedly in the midst of a turnaround, and EBITDA and EPS growth is only set to resume next year (fiscal 2017), and that the company's fiscal 2015 results leave much to be desired, with falling margins and double-digit declines in EBITDA and EPS. To be clear, we are not defenders of the company's fiscal 2015 income statement, which had little to celebrate. But we do not believe that it justifies a 34% short ratio. With a trailing free cash flow yield of over almost 12% (and a yield of well above 9% even on what we model as a modest forward basis), Vera Bradley is trading at a short ratio reserved for distressed companies, even though it is clear that the company is nowhere near distress. At under 6.5x consensus fiscal 2016 EBITDA, we see the company as positioned for a turnaround in both sentiment and valuation, with the stock ripe for a short-squeeze on good news. With Q1 2016 earnings due in early June, we believe that now is the time to begin scaling into a position in shares of Vera Bradley, ahead of what we believe will be a year of change and transformation at the company. With the management team and board of directors owning a huge portion of the company, we believe that they have every incentive to right the wrongs at Vera Bradley, and believe that fiscal 2016 will be a year of positive change for the company, and see upside of 33% from current levels as it moves to restore its business to what it once was. Unless otherwise noted, financial statistics, managerial commentary, and other corporate information used in this write-up will come from the following sources: Though founded in 1982, Vera Bradley only went public in October 2010, and the stock moved higher quickly as a new darling of the retail sector, rising to a peak of over $50 in May 2011. However, it has since moved steadily downward, driven down first by increased volatility in the retail sector, and then Vera Bradley's declining sales and profits in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015. We expect most readers to be at least tangentially familiar with Vera Bradley as a retailer and a brand, and will not devote much time to providing an overview of the company. That being said, for those unfamiliar with the company, we will provide some context. The company is a designer and retailer of women's consumer products, including handbags, luggage, eyewear, and personal accessories. As of the end of January 2015, Vera Bradley operates 96 retail stores and 29 factory outlet stores, all of which are located in the United States. While it does have a wholesale business in Japan, substantially all of the company's sales are currently booked in the United States, either through its stores, its indirect business (which sells Vera Bradley products to 2,700 specialty retail stores, most of which are in the United States), or its e-commerce operations. For much of its corporate life, Vera Bradley was a high-growth retailer, both before and after its IPO. However, beginning in fiscal 2014, the company's growth trajectory began to reverse, as revenue growth began to decline in the company's direct segment, and revenues declined on an absolute basis in its indirect segment, as shown below: Although sales growth at Vera Bradley has stalled on a consolidated basis, the larger problem for the company is its indirect business, which posted a more than 17% decline in sales last year, even as its direct business increased sales to over $335 million, a new record. The challenges that Vera Bradley has faced stem, in large part, from relevancy issues. As CEO Robert Wallstrom noted back in March 2014 when the company reported its Q4 2014 results, "we have a relevancy issue with our existing product..." The company continues to dominate the cotton casual handbag and travel accessory market, but its share within the larger accessory industry is far smaller. And as management has talked about in more recent calls, it has struggled to attract new customers to the brand, which had long been the source of the company's growth. Underinvestment in advertising and marketing has damaged Vera Bradley's growth prospects, and fiscal 2016 will feature a ramp-up in marketing spending to coincide with the company's continuing overhaul of its product portfolio to better respond to current and future consumer tastes. Importantly, much of the sales weakness at Vera Bradley can be traced to its accessories business. The company discloses sales by product line on an annual basis, and its fiscal 2015 10-K makes clear that its accessories business bears much of the responsibility for the recent decline in sales. While total sales have fallen by just under 5% between fiscal 2013 and 2015, accessories sales have fallen by almost a fifth - far more than any other product category. We note that absent the accessories business, Vera Bradley's sales would have grown by 32 basis points between fiscal 2013 and 2015. The company's challenge over the past two years has been attracting new customers. Internal data cited by management makes clear that loyalty within Vera Bradley's core customer base remains strong, and that these customers continue to be engaged with the brand and are purchasing product at consistent levels. However, efforts to attract new customers remain a work in progress, and this challenge, combined with an overall difficult retail environment for many retailers has had a clear impact on financial performance. As we have made clear in many other write-ups about U.S. retailers, we do not believe that the fault lies with the U.S. consumer. Amidst macroeconomic uncertainty, in an environment in which many consumers remain uncertain of their economic position, retailers that have on-trend products will continue to garner a growing level of retail dollars. But for retailers such as Vera Bradley, whose product portfolio has failed to keep pace with current trends, the current environment has not been kind to the company's financial performance, and it is reflected in its results for fiscal 2015. Vera Bradley's fiscal 2015 results, released on March 11, 2015, marked yet another year of declining sales and profits for the company. Q4 revenues of $152.629 and EPS of 48 cents missed consensus by $7.67 million and 2 cents, respectively, and Q1 2016 guidance (more on this to follow later) was well below estimates, leading to a sharp fall in shares of Vera Bradley of more than 16%. In the table below, we present a consolidated overview of the company's results for both Q4 2015 and the fiscal year as a whole (Notes: 1) Vera Bradley does not break down depreciation & amortization on a segment basis, meaning that EBITDA is presented only on a consolidated basis. 2) All results are unadjusted and presented in accordance with GAAP.) In Q4 2015, total revenue fell by ~2.4%, driven by an 8% fall in indirect revenue, which remains the company's weaker segment (total indirect sales fell by over 17% in fiscal 2015), versus a 13 basis point increase in direct sales. However, this growth was driven by the opening of 13 full and 14 outlet stores during fiscal 2015, and comparable sales at Vera Bradley fell by 14.4% in the quarter, as store traffic continued to decline during the course of fiscal 2015. And in the indirect business, revenue declines were driven by a lower pace of re-orders from the company's retail partners, as well as the closing of retail partner deals as Vera Bradley seeks to cull its unprofitable partnerships (more on this a bit later). For the year as a whole, comparable sales fell by 7.6%, with new store openings helping push direct revenues up by 4.5%. Indirect revenues fell by 17.36% for the year as a whole, driven by the same trends that played out in Q4 2015. As the earlier table shows, the primary culprit behind Vera Bradley's sales weakness is the company's accessories business, which posted a sales decline of more than 13% in fiscal 2015. We note that revenue from bags, which is the company's largest product category, grew by 3.25% in fiscal 2015. A promotional environment during the year helped push gross profit down by almost 8% to $269.009 million in fiscal 2015, bringing Vera Bradley's gross margin for the year down to 52.85% - a decline of 219 basis points versus fiscal 2014. That being said, the pace of the company's margin decline narrowed in Q4 2015, and Vera Bradley is currently forecasting gross margins to recover in fiscal 2016. Expense deleveraging due to lower store traffic and increased investment in the company's distribution and e-commerce systems helped push SG&A and corporate-level expenses up in both Q4 2015 and fiscal 2015, with further investments in store this year as the company works to restructure and restore its growth potential. Furthermore, the company has begun to gradually expand its spending on marketing, which Vera Bradley has underinvested in throughout the last several years, and management has made clear that marketing spending will rise in fiscal 2016; current projections call for an increase in the company's marketing budget of 25%, bringing it to $40 million. In total, Q4 2015 EPS fell by 12.24% to 43 cents, and EPS fell by almost a third in fiscal 2015 to $1, as Vera Bradley elected to maintain its pace of investments into its business, despite a fall in sales and gross profit. This begs the following question: Why invest at all in Vera Bradley? With double-digit declines in EBITDA and EPS, why should investors expose themselves to the shares? The answer lies in the company's cash flows, which paint a far different picture than its income statement suggest. Cash Flows: Strength Under the Surface If cash is king, then Vera Bradley's performance in fiscal 2015 was far stronger than its income statement suggests. We pose the following question: If it generated record levels of both operating and free cash flow in fiscal 2015, was the company's performance really that bad? In the tables below, we present an overview of Vera Bradley's cash generation in fiscal 2015, as well as its historical cash flows and financial performance. Total operating cash flow rose by over 18% in fiscal 2015 to reach $103.812 million, a new record for Vera Bradley, and totaling 20.4% of sales, versus an all-time high of 22.84% of sales achieved in fiscal 2010. And despite a more than 62% increase in capital expenditures, free cash flow rose by over 2% to over $66 million, also a new record. Key to the company's ability to maintain robust cash flows is inventory management. Vera Bradley ended fiscal 2015 with $98.403 million in inventory, down sharply from the $136.923 million that it held at the end of fiscal 2014. The decline in inventory is even more pronounced on a square footage basis, as shown below. Inventory per square foot fell over 46% in fiscal 2015, helping boost cash flows to record levels for the year, further strengthening Vera Bradley's balance sheet as the company moves to ramp up its investments in both product and its infrastructure this fiscal year. We remind investors that the company remains debt-free; it ended fiscal 2015 with $112.292 million in cash & equivalents, equal to $2.78 per diluted share, or 18.73% of its current market capitalization. We do not know of many companies that have both a balance sheet as strong as Vera Bradley's and a short ratio as high. While it is true that Vera Bradley's cash flows are likely to decline somewhat this year (more on this in the next section), the company will still generate meaningful amounts of operating and free cash flow, further strengthening its balance sheet. We turn now to Vera Bradley's guidance, which was the source of the company's 16% fall after reporting Q4 2015 earnings. Fiscal 2016 Guidance: Baking in the Bad News Alongside its Q4 2015 results, Vera Bradley issued guidance for both Q1 2016 and fiscal 2016 as a whole. We break down the company's guidance in the table below (Note: All guidance figures are presented at the midpoint of the company's range) Guidance for Q1 2016 came in well below consensus that called for revenues of $122 million (which we see as having overestimated the pace of the company's recovery) and EPS of 16 cents, a level we do not believe that the company had aspired to realistically, given management's commitment to increase investments in the business. Shares of Vera Bradley fell by over 16% on the back of this guidance, as investors worried about the company's turnaround. But we believe that the worst is now priced in. With over a third of its float sold short, it is clear that the sentiment is decidedly negative within the market, and investors expect a bleak fiscal 2016 for the company. While we cannot say that we expect a meaningful recovery in either sales or profits this year, we do believe that the company is on track to begin turning around its business, and that a decent collection of good news can cause a rally in shares of Vera Bradley, given that the sentiment is decidedly negative. Management has made clear that marketing is a prime investment focus for the company, with a 25% increase in marketing spending set for fiscal 2016. The company is cutting back on its direct mail advertising, while ramping up its digital and social advertising, and making additional targeted investments in select print advertising. We expect to hear more regarding its ongoing advertising efforts in June when Vera Bradley reports Q1 2016 results. In conjunction with the company's overhaul of its advertising and marketing strategy, Chief Marketing Officer Angel Ilagan left the company on April 17, with Stephanie Scheele, the current VP of marketing, serving as interim CMO until a new CMO can be found. Attracting new customers to the brand has been a core issue for the company over the past two years, and better advertising and marketing is one of the ways that Vera Bradley will seek to address the problem this year. Another way is a meaningful overhaul of the company's product line, which Sue Fuller, the company's chief merchandising officer, talked about at length on the Q4 earnings call. Much of fiscal 2016 will focus on expanding Vera Bradley's fabric offerings away from the company's traditional cotton offerings. For years, it has been a dominant force in cotton, but it is a focus that has allowed the company to compete in just 10% of the handbag market, for example. This year, the company will be working to expand its product offerings to include leather, faux-leather, and microfibers to address more of the market. Management expects that its expanded slate of fabric offerings will allow it to compete in ~90% of the total handbag market, well above its current market niche. In addition to expanding its assortment of handbags, Vera Bradley is overhauling its scarf and jewelry lineup; the company's selection of scarves has doubled in recent months, and in mid-fiscal 2016, it will be launching its new jewelry collection in stores and online. The Lighten-up product line, covering both handbags and backpacks, has proven to be popular with customers, and it will be expanded throughout the course of the year to include new products and styles. And the company's microfiber business is also continuing to expand, with navy and espresso offerings set to launch this year. In total, management notes that about 30% of its product assortment at the end of fiscal 2015 consisted of what it believes to be "new merchandise," and that customer response to this subset of the product portfolio is better than the company's "legacy" offerings. In addition, Vera Bradley is making changes to its product distribution and inventory management system. LOCATE, its new inventory tracking system, is being rolled out further throughout the company. If an item is not in stock in a particular Vera Bradley store, LOCATE allows the company's sales associates to track down the item in another store and ship it directly to the customer, without them ever needing to order the item themselves. And the company's burgeoning leather portfolio is also changing; genuine leather products will not be distributed only at Vera Bradley locations (full-line stores and online) and department stores, while the company's faux leather products will be shifted into the company's specialty retail channel. The company has also closed its Fort Wayne, Indiana manufacturing facility, which management estimates will save ~$12 million in manufacturing costs on an annualized basis, with savings beginning to accrue in Q4 2016. We would be remiss if we did not note that on April 24, Karen Peter, Vera Bradley's executive vice-president of Retail & Wholesale, will be leaving the company to take a position elsewhere (the company did not disclose where). She will be succeeded by Charles Mann, who will be appointed to the new role of executive vice-president of Strategy & Business development. Mann has spent almost a decade at Vera Bradley, and we believe that the company's overhaul of its retail operations will remain on track. The company is also making adjustments to its store base, having opened 13 full-line stores in fiscal 2015, and 14 factory outlet stores. Vera Bradley is currently testing a prototype full-line store format, and while the full concept is set to be unveiled later this year, an initial preview of the concept has opened in Vera Bradley's Scottsdale location, and we expect to hear about its reception when the company reports its Q1 2016 results. In addition, the initial test run of offering monogramming options in Michigan has proven to be successful, diving increases in both traffic and sales, and the offering will be introduced in more stores this year. And the company is also overhauling its outlet stores, transitioning them to factory outlets and launching almost 24 exclusive styles. Early reception has been positive, with gross margins in this new stores trending above the company's historical outlet gross margins. And Vera Bradley is also in the process of expanding its retail partnerships. The company now has a presence in 100 Macy's stores throughout the United States - a number that is set to rise to 250 stores by the end of May 2015. The company has also inked a partnership with Belk ( OTCQB:BLKIB ), which has more than 300 department stores in 16 southern states. Currently, the company is in 7 Belk stores, and further expansion is set for this year. Furthermore, Vera Bradley has also inked a partnership with a unit of Mitsubishi, and look to distribute Vera Bradley product in Japan, thereby transitioning the company's Japanese operations into a wholesale format. The company discontinued its own Japanese retail store operations in the 2nd half of 2014, and the first stores to open under this new agreement opened in the Fall of 2014 to what management saw as a positive response. The rollout of Vera Bradley's new Japanese operations is set to continue this year, and we look forward to seeing further progress within the country this year. Importantly, management is guiding for a recovery in gross margins this year as the company works to reduce its level of promotional activity and preserve the long-term integrity of the brand. Central to the company's efforts is the ongoing overhaul of its e-commerce platform, which is in the early stages of an 18-month overhaul due to be complete in 2016. All aspects of the platform are being redesigned, including Vera Bradley's ability to offer an omni-channel retail experience, personalized offers to its customers, and enhanced product search capabilities. Furthermore, this new system will allow the company to have a better grasp of its promotional activity to make it more effective, and will enable Vera Bradley to reduce promotional activity within its full-line stores, thereby helping stabilize gross margins. For fiscal 2016 as a whole, the midpoint of its guidance calls for a gross margin of 55.95%, with the single largest driver being the company's new made-for-factory-outlet products, which management notes proved to be highly successful in fiscal 2015. In addition, inventory growth in the 2nd half of the year (more on this a bit later) will also aid gross margins in fiscal 2016, given that distribution costs will be spread over a larger pool of inventory. In short, we believe that Vera Bradley's management team is fully committed to furthering the company's turnaround this year, if for no other reason than blatant self-interest. Given the fact that its board and management team own over 40% of the company, they are the main losers in a protracted downturn in the company's stock price and the main winners in any recovery. Insider Ownership: Fully Aligning Insiders and Outsiders It would be one thing if Vera Bradley's board and management team were busy enriching themselves at the expense of the company's shareholders. But given that they are by far the single-largest block of Vera Bradley's investors, they would do so at their own expense. In the table below, we provide a breakdown of the ownership of each of Vera Bradley's named executive officers and directors. (Note: The ownership amounts listed below cover both the direct and indirect stakes of each insider, which are controlled primarily through trust entities.) Based on its currently outstanding shares, Vera Bradley's management team and board of directors collectively own over 43% of the company. Before we continue, there are several items that we believe should be noted to clarify the ownership stakes of Vera Bradley's management team and board. The bulk of the shares of Patricia and Michael Miller are held in a joint trust, and for the sake of simplicity, we divided their aggregate stake of 7,043,248 shares in two. Chairman Robert Hall is married to co-founder Barbara Baekgaard, and for reporting purposes, their joint stake in Vera Bradley is listed as under the beneficial ownership of Chairman Hall. Even on a diluted basis, Vera Bradley's insiders own almost 43% of the company, and at this level of ownership, we believe that their interests are fully aligned with those of the company's outside investors. The company's management team and board have every incentive to turn Vera Bradley around, and while shorting the shares at above $20 may have been a prescient call, we do not believe that this is the case at well below $15, in light of not only the potential for a turnaround, a high level of insider ownership, and a level of short interest we see as extreme, but the company's meaningful undervaluation on a cash flow basis to peers. As we mentioned earlier in this write-up, Vera Bradley's income statement for fiscal 2015 does not tell the whole story of the company's performance last year. When examining the company's cash flows, it is clear that its performance was much stronger than it first appears. And when it is compared to its peers, it becomes clear that the company is able to generate meaningful amounts of cash by comparison. We provide a breakdown of Vera Bradley in comparison to its peers on a number of metrics in the table below. Our peer group consists of the following retail names: Coach (NYSE: COH ), Michael Kors (NYSE: KORS ), Fossil (NASDAQ: FOSL ), Francesca's (NASDAQ: FRAN ), ANN (NYSE: ANN ), Chico's (NYSE: CHS ), and Kate Spade (NYSE: KATE ). We note that forward estimates are based on Bloomberg consensus figures; estimates and valuation multiples (Note: All valuation multiples exclude Kate Spade) are accurate as of the close of trading on April 23, 2015, and are subject to change. Based on its April 23, 2015 closing price of $13.96, Vera Bradley trades at a free cash flow yield of almost 12%, more than double the average free cash flow yield of its peers (excluding Kate Spade, which has negative trailing-12 month free cash flow), which currently stands at 5.11%. And just as importantly, only industry leaders Coach and Michael Kors best Vera Bradley's cash flows as a percent of sales over the past 12 months. At 20.4%, the company's operating cash flows as a percent of sales are over 59% higher than its peer average of 12.8%, and almost 43% higher when Kate Spade is excluded from this calculation. We note that Vera Bradley has been able to achieve this despite posting a trailing 12-month gross margin of 52.85%, 447 basis points below its peer average. (We remind investors that Vera Bradley's guidance for fiscal 2016 calls for a more than 300-basis point recovery in gross margins.) Furthermore, with shares now hovering near their 52-week low of $13.90, Vera Bradley is now trading at multiples below those of its peers. Shares are now valued at less 6.4x consensus fiscal 2016 EBITDA - a discount of more than 24% to its peer average (excluding Kate Spade at over 23x current year EBITDA), and less than 13.5x fiscal 2016 EPS, versus a peer average of more than 17x (again excluding Kate Spade). While we certainly do not believe that shares of Vera Bradley deserve to trade at a premium to its peers, in light of the fact that EBITDA and EPS growth are only set to resume in fiscal 2017, we nevertheless believe that the current levels at which the stock is trading do not reflect the multi-pronged turnaround that is now underway, as well as the company's clear ability to generate cash, both operating and free. But can this level of cash flow be sustained into fiscal 2016? Isn't Vera Bradley set to see a drop in cash flow as it invests in inventory? The answer to this question is "Yes." But, even if we assume a more than 20% drop in operating cash flows for the year, shares of Vera Bradley will still trade at a free cash flow yield that is well above that of its peers. On the company's Q4 2015 earnings call, management noted that inventories are set to begin growing in the 2nd half of the year, but that inventories will remain in decline in the 1st half, thereby cushioning the impact of this inventory growth. Current guidance calls for inventory to be $105 million at the end of Q1 2016 (within a range of $100-110 million), representing a decline of more than 17% from Q1 2015. Although Vera Bradley has not provided full-year cash flow guidance, we can make some estimates as to what operating and free cash flow will be in fiscal 2016, and we do so now, based on the following assumptions and inputs, which we detail below: As we noted earlier in this write-up, Vera Bradley's operating cash flows amounted to 20.4% of sales in fiscal 2015 - a level we do not expect the company to achieve this year, in light of planned inventory growth in the 2nd half of the year. Excluding fiscal 2015, Vera Bradley has, on average, generated operating cash flow equal to 16.2% of sales in the years 2009-2014 (the median is 16.26%). For the sake of simplicity, we will therefore assume that the company will generate operating cash flow equal to 16% of sales in fiscal 2016. Guidance calls for sales of $517.5 million in fiscal 2016, within a range of $510-525 million Capital expenditures are forecast to be $31 million (versus $37.128 million in fiscal 2015). Vera Bradley is set to open 15 full-line stores and 10 factory outlet stores this year as it continues to transition its outlet business into a factory model. For all of fiscal 2016, management is forecasting a diluted share count of 38.9 million. With these assumptions in place, we can now derive an estimate of operating and free cash flow for fiscal 2016, as shown below. At a level of $1.30 per share of free cash flow, Vera Bradley's forward free cash flow yield would be 9.18% - still well above the trailing 12-month free cash flow yield of its peer group. With this forecast assuming a more than 20% decline in operating cash flows, we believe that it reflects both the benefits to cash flow as a result of continued inventory declines in H1 2016, as well as the ramp-up set to occur in H2 2016. We believe that the best way to value the company is on the basis of its free cash flow. The current short interest in Vera Bradley assumes that the company is now barely profitable, or that it is barely generating any positive operating or free cash flow. An examination of FINVIZ data can highlight some of the companies that have short interest as a percent of float above 30%, and on this metric, Vera Bradley has an interesting collection of peers, which include the following companies: For the most part, other companies that have such a level of short interest are either operating under a cloud of suspicion (Herbalife and Ebix), have the government working against them (Ocwen), or face fundamental questions about the sustainability of their business in the face of new threats (GameStop). It would be one thing if Vera Bradley were trading at a premium multiple, but with shares hovering close to 52-week lows and trading at under 6.4x fiscal 2016 EBITDA, that is not the case. To us, it is clear that the market is focusing on the company's (admittedly) poor fiscal 2015 income statement and 2016 P&L guidance, and electing to ignore the its continued ability to generate cash from its business. We believe that it is best to value Vera Bradley on the basis of its free cash flow. At our estimate of $1.30 in free cash flow per share in fiscal 2016, the company currently trades at a forward free cash flow yield of 9.31%, still well above the 5.11% trailing free cash flow yield of its peer group. But that peer group includes companies such as Michael Kors and ANN, which are far healthier than Vera Bradley, and there is little to support an argument that Vera Bradley should trade at the same free cash flow yield at its peers. Coach, on the other hand, is a different story. The company's woes have been thoroughly publicized, and for all the travails at Vera Bradley over the past two years, Coach's performance is actually worse on multiple metrics, with its meaningfully higher EBITDA margins acting as its saving grace. In the table below, we highlight the 3-year change in sales, EBITDA, and EPS of Vera Bradley and Coach, covering the period of fiscal 2015-2017 for Vera Bradley and fiscal 2014-2016 for Coach. Despite the fact that Coach's sales, EBITDA, EPS, and EBITDA margins are shrinking at a faster pace than those of Vera Bradley over this 3-year time period, Coach shares trade at a free cash flow yield 6.93%; while this may the second-highest in the group, it is still well below that of Vera Bradley. Given the fact that Vera Bradley's "downturn" is less severe than that of Coach, we believe that the company can be reasonably valued at a free cash flow yield of 7%, a level that is still above that of Coach. At a target free cash flow yield of 7% and estimated fiscal 2016 free cash flow of $1.30 per share, we therefore arrive at a price target of $18.57 for shares of Vera Bradley, representing upside of 33.02% versus the company's April 23, 2015 closing price of $13.96. Catalysts to Unlock Value: Internal and External Opportunities In our view, the single-most important catalyst for shares of the company is disciplined and focused execution. Expectations are low for Vera Bradley this year, as the company remains fully in the midst of restructuring and turning around the business. With over a third of the company's float sold short, any dose of meaningful good news is likely to bode well for the stock. The company must show progress this year on a number of fronts, namely increasing the effectiveness of its advertising to drive store traffic and sales, and overhauling its product portfolio, which we see as key to reviving both the brand and sales. However, other external catalysts may emerge as well, including activist investors. While management and the board may own over 40% of Vera Bradley, the company has a single class of stock, and their stake confers no special voting rights. With shares near 52-week lows, there is incentive for activist investors to become involved if the company shows progress in restructuring its business with no response in its stock price. They may push for either an accelerated pace of restructuring, or for the board to explore "strategic alternatives" for the company, which would mean a sale to a strategic or financial buyer. In the event of such a push, we believe that a sale to a financial buyer, possibly a private equity firm, is the likeliest outcome. With an enterprise value of less than $500 million, Vera Bradley is affordable to a number of strategic buyers that are looking to expand their slate of brands. But, we see this as a less likely outcome. With both co-founders of Vera Bradley, Barbara Baekgaard and Patricia Miller, still with the company after 33 years, it is clear that they have stayed this long for more than simple financial interest, and barring a meaningful premium, we doubt that management and the board would be willing to sell the company to outsiders. And the premium necessary to convince them to do so may not be one that a strategic buyer is willing to pay until they see more definitive signs that business is recovering (though it may be too late to buy at that point). Instead, we believe a management buyout would be the likely outcome of any strategic review. At present, Vera Bradley is a classic candidate for a management buyout with private equity funding. It is a retail business (a staple of such transactions) in the midst of a turnaround, with a clean balance sheet, meaningful cash flow generation, and a management team with a significant ownership stake. If the company's stock price does not begin to recover, and activists agitate for change, Vera Bradley's board and management team may come to the decision that the company's turnaround is best done in private, away from the scrutiny of the markets. In closing, we believe that at current levels, shares of Vera Bradley present a strong contrarian opportunity, as the market has chosen to ignore the company's robust cash flow generation and pristine balance sheet. While we recognize that the company's income statement is not one that may inspire confidence, it is but one element in the story at Vera Bradley. With over a third of the company's float sold short, it is clear that sentiment among investors is decidedly negative, and that many do not expect any turnaround to materialize. We, however, believe that the turnaround is well under way. Management has left no stone unturned; all areas of Vera Bradley are being restructured and overhauled, including its product portfolio, its distribution systems, its e-commerce platform, and its advertising and marketing plans. The company's slate of retail partners is expanding, and new store concepts are being rolled out and tested, showing that management is taking the initiative to reinvigorate the brand in the eyes of both its retail partners and consumers. And with management and the board owning over 40% of outstanding shares, it is clear that they have every incentive to see this turnaround succeed, given that they will be the prime beneficiaries of any and all progress. While we do not expect this turnaround to happen overnight, or for shares of Vera Bradley to return to what we see as fair value instantaneously, we believe that investors should begin initiating positions in shares of Vera Bradley at current levels, scaling in further should the stock decline further. With a pristine balance sheet, a clear turnaround plan, and a highly incentivized board and management team, we believe that in fiscal 2016, Vera Bradley will show clear signs of progress in turning itself around, and that as it does, shareholders who align themselves with the company's insiders will benefit meaningfully.
