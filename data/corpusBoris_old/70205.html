Why Educational Development Corporation Earnings Are Even Better Than You Think - Educational Development Corporation (NASDAQ:EDUC) | Seeking Alpha Fiscal Q4 showed a big year-over-year improvement and a modest profit. I'll get right to it: Educational Development Corporation (NASDAQ: EDUC )'s modest fiscal Q4 profit was fantastic because that is generally the seasonally slowest period. As implied in my previous EDUC article entitled Educational Development Corporation: Low Risk, High Yield, Big Upside Potential , I'd be ecstatic with merely break-even results and I got that and more. The press release reported fiscal annual sales up 25% to $32.5 million along with earnings up 138% to $0.21 per diluted share. For fiscal Q4 specifically, based on the 10K and deducting the nine month numbers from the previous 10Q , net revenue rose 29% to $7.6 million while diluted EPS swung from an -$0.08 loss to a +$0.02 gain. We already know the first two months of the current quarter were up about 35% year-over-year which puts it on pace to clear $10 million in revenue. If achieved this would mean a significant sequential improvement which should also translate into a big jump in EPS as well. Revenue that high would be similar to the holiday quarter. If earnings translate to that high as well, it would put the trailing four quarter earnings at $0.33 per share. At a stock price of $5 even as this this writing, that's a P/E of 15 and a high dividend yield of over 7%. One thing that appears to be helping to accelerate results is none other than the internet. Last fiscal year for the UBAM division, for instance, 67% of orders were through the internet compared to 57% the year before. The number of internet orders was up 112% with the average order itself being up 8%. Also helping overall results was the successful negotiation of "more favorable shipping rates." I see no obvious reason why the momentum in results won't continue, and I am happy to continue to collect the dividend while I will likely wait for something much higher in the stock price.
