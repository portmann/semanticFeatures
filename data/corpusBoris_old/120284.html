Matrix Service Company: Triggering A Bounce Back - Matrix Service Company (NASDAQ:MTRX) | Seeking Alpha Matrix Service Company had a challenging year in fiscal 2015 ending June 30, 2015. In more ways than one, its record-setting streaks were broken. The company announced fiscal 2016 guidance on July 13th. The outlook was refreshing. MTRX's share price is languishing based on the past-year results and creating a buying opportunity. Pending announcements could trigger a bounce. Matrix Service Company (NASDAQ: MTRX ) is an engineering, fabrication, construction and repair & maintenance services provider. The company faced quite a challenge in its fiscal year ending June 30th, 2015, compliments of a prior acquisition. In December 2013, the company purchased Kvaerner North American Construction. Little did the company know, at the time, that this acquisition would break its record-setting streaks. From fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2014, Matrix Service had tallied five years of double-digit revenue growth. But in fiscal 2015, the company incurred several impacts from an EPC (engineering, procurement, construction) joint venture project in the Electrical Infrastructure segment that was acquired with the Kvaerner acquisition. Now, this is not to imply the acquisition, as a whole, was questionable. In the company's fiscal 2014 annual report , the acquisition is described: "The acquisition significantly expands the Company's presence in the Electrical Infrastructure and Industrial Segments, and to a lesser extent, the Oil Gas and Chemical segment. The KNAC acquisition brought opportunities in additional geographical markets, the ability to execute additional and larger projects and expanded our relationship with some existing clients." In the fiscal 2015 third-quarter earnings call , Matrix Service's management assured impacts from the project would be confined to the fiscal year ending June 30th: "Right now, we anticipate that we would be totally cleaned up this fiscal year, the way our contracts are structured with our partner and our owner leaves little room for any commercial haggling at the end of the project." Less than a month later, in June 2015, MTRX alleviated investors of further concern. "We are pleased to announce that this project is substantially complete and as such Calpine is in commercial operation of the facility." When guidance was given for fiscal 2016 on July 13th, the news was, indeed, refreshing. The chart below depicts the company's expected bounce back: As shown, not only does the company expect to return to its prior EPS track, but it also expects to return to double-digit revenue growth. Fiscal-2016 revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. Earnings per share are projected in a range of $1.45 to $1.75. At the end of fiscal 2015's third quarter , the company had a backlog of $1.24 billion. In addition to its backlog, Matrix Service followed the guidance release with a conference call and offered the following support for its guidance: Electrical Infrastructure segment - "Over $350 billion worth of power generation and grid modernization projects are expected to commence construction in the next 30 months in North America." Storage Solutions segment - "Over $65 billion is expected to be spent on oil and gas storage terminals including LNG projects in this time frame." Oil & Gas and Chemical segment - "Over $80 billion in projects at chemical and petrochemical plants are planned to begin in the next 24 months." Although Matrix Service has not yet reported fourth-quarter results for fiscal 2015, the company has offered key information since its last earnings report. As mentioned earlier, the company confirmed the project sparking challenges that hampered much of fiscal 2015 was substantially complete. In the third-quarter conference call, MTRX acknowledged accelerated buybacks were "obviously an option". Management also mentioned that it had "some acquisitions in mind". Less than 30 days later, the company announced it was repurchasing up to $5 million worth of its outstanding shares. Yet, in the conference call regarding fiscal 2016 guidance, Matrix Service CEO John Hewitt stated that two things would take priority over share repurchases: acquisition opportunities and internal improvements. Before fiscal 2016 guidance was given on July 13th, the company had been trading in the $17 to $19 range. In fact, Matrix Services had not broken the $20 mark since the third-quarter report until guidance was given. When the fiscal 2015 fourth-quarter report is released, it could easily appear that a $20 stock price for a company that earned annual EPS of approximately $0.50 is outrageously high. But, at the lower end of the guidance of $1.45, a $20 share price equates to a forward P/E ratio 13.8. Furthermore, there is little doubt the company is highly likely to make an acquisition soon. Management flatly stated it is its top priority and there is activity on the subject: "We've got acquisition opportunities we're looking at..." It may be reasonable for investors to be hesitant about Matrix Service's ability to handle further acquisitions considering the financial impacts incurred in fiscal 2015. However, it may be just as reasonable to assess that the company gained valuable experience and knowledge in the previous challenge. In previous earnings calls, the company explained how the situation transpired. As mentioned previously, the EPC (engineering, procurement, construction) project was acquired with the Kvaerner acquisition. The engineering and procurement phases of the project struggled. By the time Matrix Service was involved, the company was responsible for providing construction services. But because of the struggles with the engineering and procurement phases, the impact, naturally, fell through to the construction phase. From a financial perspective, the company is well positioned to pursue more acquisitions. As of its last report, the company had over $103 million in cash and equivalents and less than $10 million in long-term debt. It also has $90 million available under its credit facility. Management also specifically stated the fiscal 2016 guidance is not reliant on an acquisition. By most measures, the signals are pointing to further impressive growth at Matrix Service. Yet, the share price is still languishing over the past year's challenges. Three future announcements could allay the market's hesitation and trigger a bounce - 1) the announcement of a significant contract for multiple crude terminals for a major midstream customer, 2) fiscal 2015 fourth-quarter results or 3) an announcement detailing the next acquisition. The contract announcement is expected to occur in the next couple of weeks. The earnings release should occur in early September. An acquisition announcement could happen any day. Investors willing to trust that Matrix Service is starting a new streak of records should take advantage of this buying opportunity.
