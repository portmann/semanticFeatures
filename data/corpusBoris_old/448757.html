Fannie Mae And Freddie Mac Plaintiffs Allege Companies Are Treated Like Government ATM Machines - Fannie Mae (OTCMKTS:FNMA) | Seeking Alpha FHFA's history of claiming that it is able to act in separate capacities simultaneously has been confirmed by two judges, Pratt and Lamberth. Judge Sweeney's orders and dialog suggest an interpretation of the law that points to more separation of powers than pooling of powers. Owning Non-Governmental GSE equity securities is a play that minority stakeholders have rights even when the government interprets the law as eliminating them in order to take everything for nothing. Fannie Mae ( OTCQB:FNMA ) and Freddie Mac ( OTCQB:FMCC ) are the only two private companies in America at present where the government takes all of their net profits leaving little for private shareholders. In 2008, they were placed into conservatorship under their regulator the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and are often referred to as the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs). During the period of time between 2008 and 2011, the government issued itself hundreds of thousands of dollars of GSE preferred stock by writing down GSE assets. The third amendment net worth sweep was put into place in 2012 and the writedowns were reversed sending all of the money to the government and leaving out the companies and non-governmental shareholders. Investment Thesis: At face value, a controlling stakeholder has injected itself into the GSE capital structure and taken all of the equity for itself. In this case, the controlling stakeholder is the government and the prevailing law is The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 ( HERA ). In 2014, Lamberth dismissed non-governmental shareholders' lawsuits saying that "FHFA and Treasury could effectively do whatever..." Subsequently, documents and depositions have been produced in Judge Sweeney's Court of Claims seemingly undermining the government's original narrative. Considering that the GSEs combined make $15B/annum and are both Fortune 50 companies even when they're forced to give all of their money to the government, share price estimates if the plaintiffs win start at $20 by Richard X. Bove and William Ackman. I primarily own preferreds and have modeled the allocation of my assets after Fairholme, with a smaller position in commons than preferreds. If the government's interpretation of the law is correct and indeed, they can do whatever they want, then the equity shares I own are worth less if not worthless. On June 30th, a Saxton Reply Brief and a Robinson Reply Brief were filed by plaintiffs in two separate courts fighting motions to dismiss. In the Saxton reply brief, the plaintiffs allege that FHFA has treated the GSEs as ATM machines: Edward J. Demarco was the Acting Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency at the time the net worth sweep was put in place in 2012 so he was the person who signed off on it: Note especially the reference to the Federal Housing Finance Agency as its conservator. In 2011, Ed Demarco issued the following statement before the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations: Further, plaintiffs also have previously alleged that there is a difference in powers between FHFA acting as conservator and receiver and this is in line with Judge Ginsburg's reading of the statute: It would seem that FHFA's interpretation of the law gives it receiver, conservator, and regulator powers simultaneously. Plaintiffs, meanwhile, believe that there are significant differences in scope regarding what the agency can do when acting independently as one at a time. That's kind of what this boils down to, whether or not FHFA has a basket of powers that they can choose to exercise bits and pieces of in aggregate across time as FHFA sees fit. If you're curious, there's a Krimminger/Calabria White Paper that discusses the historical differences between conservators and receivers. First off, the government is asserting several types of privileges. On May 20th, Judge Sweeney ordered the government to hand over all the documents in Exhibit 1 as well as affidavits with respect to the deliberative process privilege: Five days later, the government filed a motion for clarification as well as two declarations asserting privileges, asserting that the government shouldn't have to produce documents it has not yet formally asserted privilege over asking for potentially 75 more days: That same day, Judge Sweeney ordered the government to hand over the documents covered by a not yet formally asserted presidential privilege: The government subsequently filed their declaration on June 10th. Prior to all of this, Judge Sweeney released documents noting her surprise regarding the government's concern with the unsealing when taking the government at its word that it had no control: Two years ago, Judge Sweeney during a June 19th hearing suggested that FHFA was both part of the government and not part of the government, a perspective categorized as schizophrenic: Whereas Judge Sweeney points out that FHFA has claimed that they are part of the government and not part of the government for different reasons. Whereas Judge Sweeney has described the government's defense of not producing documents as schizophrenic and has subsequently produced publicly some documents, the government nevertheless claimed that it was the government and that it was not the government. In the same way in other court rooms, FHFA appears to be claiming that it has powers of receiver and conservator whereas Judge Ginsburg reads the law with the word respectively implicit. This implies he views the powers as separate. Further, FHFA has argued simultaneously for powers of regulator and conservator. Taking a look at these snippets above, it seems evident that the FHFA has a history of reading the law in such a way that allows it to combine powers that it would have acting in separate capacities whereas the judges have voiced dissent. Judges Lamberth and Pratt dismissed shareholder complaints agreeing with the government's interpretation of the law. Given that evidence has been produced by discovery since these dismissals has seen the light of day, it will be interesting to see how the appeals play out. In conjunction with that, the MDL failure has started the gears turning independently on several other lawsuits around the country several of which we will likely see rulings on their potential respective dismissals this year. In the last two years, I have personally borrowed between $200,000 and $300,000 as I have come to realize that this appears to be one of those lifetime opportunities that people talk about after the fact using phrases like "should have," "could have," and "would have." I own 4,050 shares of FMCCH, 9,340 shares of FMCCP, 4,442 shares of FMCCT, 5,000 shares of FMCKP, 27,086 shares of FNMFN, 5 shares of FNMFO, 25,092 shares of FNMA, and 500 shares of FMCKO. This represents $3,008,400 of par value preferreds. The preliminary risk from my vantage point is time, but the market as a whole respectfully disagrees. As such, these securities trade at fractions of their par value. Disclosure: I am/we are long FMCCH, FMCCP, FMCCT, FMCKP, FNMFN, FNMFO, FNMA, FMCKO.
