For those of you who are listening and viewing our webcast via the Internet, please take a look at Slide #2, Net Revenues. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, net revenues increased 11% to $227.1 million from $205.5 million in the prior year quarter. Acquisitions occurring after the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 generated a 12% increase, or $24.8 million, organic revenues increased 2%. Foreign exchange rates, primarily driven by the depreciation of the Mexican Peso and and the Australian dollar led to a 3% decrease in revenues quarter-over-quarter. In addition, year-to-date net revenues increased 7% to $870.8 million compared to $810.8 million in the prior year. Acquisitions occurring after the beginning of fiscal 2015 accounted for an 11% increase in revenues, organic revenues increased 1%. Foreign exchange rates, primarily driven by the depreciation of the Australian dollar and the Euro led to a 5% decrease in revenues year-over-year. Please turn to Slide #3, Gross Profit and Margin. Gross profit increased $3.9 million, or 9%, $48.1 million compared to the prior year quarter. Acquisitions occurring after the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 contributed $6.1 million to gross profit. Core gross profits excluding the impact of inventory purchase accounting charges increased 10%, or $4.3 million. Operating inefficiencies of $1.9 million offset organic margin improvements, resulting in a net $1.4 million reduction in gross margin. Unfavorable foreign exchange rates of $0.8 million also resulted in a reduction in gross profit in the quarter. Core gross margins were 21.4% of net revenues for the quarter, compared to 21.5% in the prior year quarter. For fiscal 2015, gross profit increased $8.4 million, or 5% compared to the prior year. Acquisitions occurring after the beginning of fiscal 2015 contributed $17.9 million to gross profit. Operating inefficiencies offset organic margin improvements, resulting in a $4 million net reduction in gross margin. Unfavorable foreign exchange rates of $5.5 million also resulted in a reduction in gross margin during the year. Core gross profit, excluding the impact of inventory purchase accounting charges increased 5%, or $8.5 – $8.9 million. Gross margins were 20.9% of net revenues in fiscal 2016 compared to 21.4% in fiscal 2015. Please turn to Slide #4, Operating Income and Margin. Operating income decreased $1.9 million to $22.7 million in the current year quarter. Excluding the impact of non-core items in the quarter, core operating income increased 2% to $26.5 million from $25.9 million in the prior year quarter. Acquisitions occurring after the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 contributed $3 million to operating income. Non-core items related to acquisition and integration expenses, facility closure expenses, and inventory purchase accounting charges. Core SG&A increased $3.7 million, or 20% compared to the prior year quarter. Acquisitions occurring after the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015 contributed $3 million decrease, partially offset by a decrease of $0.5 million due to the unfavorable sorry – just the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. The remaining increase primarily relates to professional fees in the quarter-over-quarter, including an incremental $2.2 million for compliance costs. The majority of the compliance costs relate to strengthening our internal control environment and remediating material weaknesses. We expect to incur these costs into the beginning of fiscal 2017. Core SG&A as a percentage of sales was 9.7% compared to 9% in the prior year quarter. During the quarter, facility closure expenses were $2.7 million, primarily related to the consolidation of the Greensboro, North Carolina operations into existing facilities, and the consolidation of two facilities in Dublin, Ireland into a single location. In the prior year, facility closure expenses related to the consolidation of Norway, Michigan and Watertown, Wisconsin and El Dorado Hills, California. For fiscal 2016, core operating income decreased $3.2 million, or 3% to $103.9 million, primarily due to operating inefficiency in core markets, increased the compliance costs and unfavorable foreign exchange. Acquisitions occurring after the beginning of the fiscal 2015 contributed $6.7 million to core operating income. For fiscal 2016, the core SG&A increased $12.1 million, or 18%, compared to the prior year, including $11.7 million in relation to acquisitions occurring after the beginning of fiscal 2015, partially offset by a decrease of $3.2 million due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. The remaining increase primarily relates to professional fees year-over-year, including an incremental $4.1 million for compliance costs. Core SG&A increased as a percentage of sales to 9% from 8.2% in the prior year. Please turn to Slide # 5, Net Income. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, core net income decreased 6% to $11.9 million from $12.6 million in the prior year quarter. For fiscal 2016, core net income increased 1% to $54.5 million compared to the prior year. The effective tax rate on core net income of 34% in the quarter, compared to 35% in the prior year quarter and 28% for fiscal 2016, compared to 35% in fiscal 2015, primarily due to the mix of income in foreign jurisdictions, the impact of tax rate changes in foreign jurisdictions enacted during the period and other discrete items that reduced tax expense. The projected core tax rate for fiscal 2017 is 32%. Please advance to Slide #6, Earnings Per Share. Excluding the impact of non-core items, core EPS decreased 5% to $0.70 per diluted share for the current quarter from $0.74 in the prior year quarter. Fiscal 2016 core EPS increased 1% to $3.22 per diluted share from $3.20 in the prior year. Please turn to Slide #7, Free Cash Flow. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, consisting of cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures was $22 million compared to $30.7 million in the prior year quarter. Free cash flow for fiscal 2016 was $64.5 million compared to $77.8 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher capital expenditures, facility closure expenses, and the timing of tax payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2015 included a $5.5 million benefit associated with the timing of bond interest payments. Please turn to Slide #8, Core EBITDA. This slide shows core EBITDA for the quarter. Core EBITDA is defined as core operating income plus depreciation and amortization. Core EBITDA was $37.6 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to $36.2 million in the prior year quarter. Core EBITDA for fiscal 2016 was $148 million compared to $148.5 million in the prior year. Please advance to Slide #9, Capital Expenditures. Our fourth quarter capital expenditures was $6.7 million compared to $6.5 million in the prior quarter. For fiscal 2016, our capital expenditures were $34.9 million compared to $29.2 million in the prior year. The particular amount of capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 is $50 million. Please advance to Slide #10, Depreciation and Amortization. Our total depreciation and amortization was $11.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to $10.4 million in the prior quarter. Total depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal 2016 was $44.5 million compared to $41.3 million in the prior year. Please turn to Slide #11, Debt. The company had $514.3 million in debt as at March 31, 2016, compared to $458.5 million at March 31, 2015. During the last four quarters, the company paid down $72.5 million in debt, and borrowed, including acquired debt, $128.3 million in relation to acquisitions. Our four quarters, Multi-Color has made acquisitions in Southeast Asia, France, Australia, and Ireland. Thank you, Sharon, and good morning, all, and thank you for joining us. We’ve highlighted the main impacts of non-core EPS in the quarter. So I’d just like to share some thoughts on that, and then moving to some thoughts on fiscal 2017 before taking questions. So the benefits in Q4 from our acquisition activity in the last year have generated a $0.11, but that was largely offset by the extra SG&A compliance cost of $0.09, and both of these things are here to stay. Secondly, the shortfall expectations in Q4 is due to operational efficiencies, primarily largely caused by consolidation activity. This $0.07, or approximately $2 million in Q4 is an addition to approximately $0.12, or Q – or $3 million that we called out in Q3. These consolidation impacts one-offs in the second-half of the year and completed in Q4. They were somewhat unusual given a required a predominantly new skill base and new equipment at the same time and as it turned out the equipment was late and we have high turnover in the new skill base. However, we will now see the benefits from these changes in fiscal 2017 and expect more normal earnings growth in fiscal 2017. In the last six years, our compound annual growth rate for core EPS has been 19%. This earnings growth is expected to be stronger in the second-half of the year where year-on-year comps are easier for us. In addition to that, one-off FX trends action loss of $0.07 did not help in the quarter and this was primarily due to CapEx. Also in Q4, organic growth was 2%, which was better than a 1% for the fiscal year and was 4%, excluding our beer label exit fourth quarter. Our beer labels year-on-year will continue to be a drag on growth by $5 million in Q1 and $3 million in Q2, and then will be effectively out of [Technical Difficulty] and as per fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, those sales will have very limited impact on gross margins. Also earlier in the year, we’ve had negative impact in our specialty heat transfer label business in Q1, Q2, and Q3, fiscal 2016. This was not the case in Q4, so that seems to have remedied. We do expect organic growth to return to the 3% plus range in fiscal 2017, bearing in mind that beer will still be a 2% drag thereabouts in each of the first two quarters and a 1% drag on the full-year. In terms of organic growth by region, in Q4, we had mid single-digit growth in Europe, double-digit growth in our North American Wine & Spirit business in Asia and in Latin America, North America, excluding wine and spirit growth was negative mid single-digits, led by the beer label exit. Bear in mind that double-digit growth in Asia and Latin America for us is still off a small base. So in summary, we did not expect Q4 inefficiencies or compliance cost to be as high as they were causing the $0.08 shortfall to average estimates of $3.30 core EPS and the transaction FX loss of $0.07 didn’t help either. But we see no change in the fundamentals for our business and have seen before years of virtually no growth, e.g., fiscal 2014 followed by a quick return to growth, e.g., fiscal 2015. We’re currently comfortable that fiscal 2017 will resume average earnings growth in line with our targeted circa of $0.40 per annum and that will be 12% growth on the base of 2016, $3.22. So that would put us in a $3.50 to $3.70 range from our base this year. Acquisition pipeline remains healthy and we continue to target a standard of $100 million of revenues per annum in – per year, and in fiscal 2017 we expect that to be nearly all in the second-half of the year and our leverage remains in a low 3s. Yes. What was organic volume and price movements in fiscal Q4 year-over-year unless prices were stable and without cut and stack beer of 4% or the volume growth effectively? Yes, okay. And you talked about acquisitions, can you give a sense of, I know, they are to come, but how many acquisitions might you be looking at completing this fiscal year and how much of an outlay – cash outlay might that be? Sure. We expect it to be a reasonably standard year for us. So what that looks like normally is four to six acquisitions that make up that $100 million of revenues, and we pay four to six times trailing EBITDA and if they’re making $15 million – 15%, or $15 million in total EBITDA times, say, an average of five to six times for that, then you’re getting to $75 million to $90 million in cost, and we’re generating $60 million – $15 million to $20 million a quarter, or $60 million plus in free cash year, plus the free cash flow we pick up from the $15 million in earnings. So it makes it reasonably self-funding for us to do that combination of smaller acquisitions per year. And we’d like to think that fiscal 2017 will be similar in that regard. Hey, my last question relates to guidance outlook. Firstly, did you give the 2017 – fiscal 2017 EPS guidance of $3.50 to $3.70, did I hear that right? That’s on the basis that, we’ve stated in the past that on average we seek to target $0.40 a year, so off a $3.22 base… …around that $3.60 mark, if you put a little bit of a space either side, you’re going to get that sort of range. So we’re currently comfortable with that sort of range based on continuing to assert that we can and should look for $0.40 a year. Correct. So just to help with a math perhaps on the revenue, if you look at our revenues for Q4, they had all of the [Technical Difficulty] 27 is the reasonably representative number. For our Q3 seasonally is always a bit weak. So if you took four times Q4 took off $10 million for a standard Q3 shortfall and have 3%, now you should get to somewhere in the 929, 930 range for revenues for the year, and we think that’s reasonable obviously based on FX. Any guidance on other than you gave, of course, that the beer would be a $5 million headwind and some of this other stuff is back-end loaded, any specific guidance you might give on fiscal Q1? Not, not really. I would say that April sales were soft. April earnings were okay, but April sales were soft. Good. First, can you talk a little bit about the reasoning behind the FX remeasurement that inflated the other income line? Is that something we should expect moving forward into 2017 to have any impact, or was that one-time in nature? It is very unusual if you look back historically for us to have any FX impact. We don’t typically have a lot of transaction FX. In fiscal 2016, we did have some price purchases that were in currencies that are difficult to hedge, and so that had an unusual impact on it as well as some other payments. But no, I mean, it’s not something you would expect to continue. Okay, that’s helpful. And then how do you guys look at SG&A as a percentage of sales heading into fiscal 2017? I know you said some of the compliance costs are going to stick around. But can remind us of your long-term SG&A target? Okay. And then, I guess, finishing up with, can you provide some additional details around the operational inefficiencies in the quarter? Specifically, how did those compare to your own internal expectations, and we shouldn’t expect any lingering impact heading into the first-half of fiscal 2017, correct? Correct, and they’ve performed poorly to our internal expectations. As we talked about in Q3, there were sort of three areas of concern here in the Midwest. We had Di-na-cal acquisition a couple of years ago, and as a result of that, we elected to close one of their sites and move that business to here to stay in Cincinnati, and that was the main piece of restructuring that we needed to do. And we have delays with equipment and a lot of skill base turnover here, and that’s caused us a far greater cost than we had anticipated in the last couple of quarters. That transition is now complete. Greensboro is now closed, and we’re working through all of the business being based here and we see nothing but upside now in terms of the productivity on that business. We also have some issues in Ireland, where we consolidated two sites and we did not do a good job. And at the same time, we had a new IT system go in in and we didn’t do a good job at that either. And so that caused us a lot of inefficiency and extra cost. And in Q3, we have some issues putting in new CapEx into Mexico and Poland and some inefficiencies there, which is thankfully behind us, and I think those businesses will benefit greatly from those investments in fiscal 2017. So whilst we do consolidate plans from time to time in these instances there was a much higher proportion of new skill base and new equipment that would normally be the case, and that’s certainly not gone as well as we have planned. Understood. And then switching gears for one more question, can you give any details surrounding your strategy for boosting organic growth in fiscal 2017? And then how has growth commentary from your customers trended heading into next year? It seems like there is some added importance from the CPGs and other customers on boosting growth for fiscal 2017? Yes. We’ve mentioned before that we’ve invested a lot of – most of our CapEx, a lot of CapEx in fiscal 2016 into developing markets for us, and we’re starting to see some good organic growth outcomes there, and we expect that to continue. We’re experiencing double-digit growth in those developing markets, not that that’s a big percentage of our sales today, but it’s certainly a growth driver for us. And we’re also seeing something of a rebound to some growth in Europe and our wine businesses, in particular, globally have seen stronger growth than perhaps the prior couple of years and we see that continuing. So for 2017, we would expect to get back into that 3% plus range. Bear in mind the beer exit – beer label exit will have a negative 2% impact roughly in Q1 and Q2, and a negative 1% impact for the whole year. So when we say 3%, we’re taking into account that it would be 4% if you add it back the beer impact for the year, and we think 3% is a fair number to model. Nigel, on on – you commented that April sales were soft. Can you give any more specifics than that in terms of regions, or businesses, or otherwise? Okay. Your CapEx and sales guidance for fiscal 2017, I believe implies CapEx of about 5.5% of sales. Is that, I think, you’ve said historically that you’ve targeted 5-ish. Is 5-ish still a reasonable number, or should we expect higher than that for any particular reason? Okay. Nigel, you mentioned last call you had scaled back your focus on acquisitions for fiscal 2017, given the operational difficulties that you were experiencing. Has that changed at all based on your comments that you have a healthy pipeline, you are going to be doing deals $100 million worth of sales. Can you just talk about any change in tone regarding acquisitions? I mean, our intention was to sort of push them back into the second-half of the year and really focus on organic growth and operational efficiencies in the first-half of the year and that hasn’t changed. So we’ve done that where possible whilst we expect a couple of very small acquisitions versus July, and the rest of them will be in the second-half of the year. But we still think we’ll end up with hopefully our $100 million run rate for the year, obviously it’s not over until it’s over until those deals have done. But our pipeline at this point in time suggests that we can still get there. But it’s going to be nearly all in the second-half of the year. Okay. That’s – a couple of others. One is you talked about historically $0.40 of earnings growth a year. Obviously in the last couple of years, I think you had a $1 in fiscal 2015 and then you had basically nothing in fiscal 2016. Given what should be a fairly stable business model? Can you just talk about the volatility in your earnings growth and why you think that’s been the case? Yes, it has been volatile and that’s my fault and we cut our $0.35, I think, on average last six years, so $0.40 prior to this year’s result. And I think that it’s related primarily to acquisitions that have had a lot of restructuring or some heavy lifting to do, and that was the case in 2016. That’s not the case in 2017. The acquisitions that we are looking at A, they’re going to be in the second-half half of the year, so they still have less of an impact on the full-year, and B, they’re not expected to have much restructuring in all in them. So I need to be a little more – bit more circumspect about the nature of the beast. Things that need heavy lifting can often be add a lot of extra value once they’re done. But you don’t have too many of those on your plate at one time, and perhaps at time I’ve stretched the teams too much and I’m more conscious of that now. Got it. Thanks, Nigel. Just a couple of others. The tax rate for fiscal 2016, Sharon, was 28% core tax rate. What are your expectations for this year? 32%, okay. And free cash flow to net income, free cash was about $10 million higher in 2016, expectations for 2017? Sorry, free cash flow – we’ve been pretty consistent and we think it’s going to be around $60 million mark, given that we do have a couple of years of slightly CapEx towards the higher end about 5% range. And the outlier was 2015, we sort of tried to highlight that there were some timing benefits associated with the bond interest. So 2015 is the outlier and $60 million is internally doable for us. It will jump around quarter-to-quarter, also based on the bond payments and interest payments, which are twice per year, but $60 million is what we have in our model. Thanks, Sharon. And just one last one on the adjustments. There were $0.44 of charges related to acquisition and integration as well as facility closures in fiscal 2016. And just given that acquisitions are a recurring nature of your business model. Can you just talk about why you exclude those charges on an annual basis? Thanks very much. Sure. We’ll highlight them and if you can model them aside, I wish that we highlight them. And the business we have could continue to infinity without those costs. They are one-off related to those specific acquisitions. In addition to that, they are a little bit higher this year because of the nature of two of the acquisitions that we did. So the Southeast Asian acquisition was an on-market. We bought a public company listed on the Malaysian exchange, and there’s a significantly – which has five locations, so it’s a very good transaction for us, gave us a very good footprint but certainly very complex vis-à-vis other acquisitions. And so there was a lot higher cost in due diligence and also the acquisition process that we went through. The second one was a larger acquisition or a medium-size acquisition, sorry, in Bordeaux France and again that was a very complicated process. So typically the acquisition costs are not that high, and I think that it helps investors by giving them that information, calling that out specifically. And you can model that however you like, but I think it is valuable and we’ve been asked to provide that information in the past. So that’s why we call it out and why it was so high this year. Yes, we do. The price was modestly positive net. So as Nigel said most of it is volume in the main but it really wasn’t a big delta either way. Okay. And then looking at emerging markets, what percent of sales is emerging markets currently? And do you have a longer-term target of where you might like that to be? Sure. I mean we exclude Australia from our emerging markets definition, it’s more of a mature market for us. So our developing or emerging markets really are only about 11% of our sales today, so still relatively low. But we’re keen to see significant growth in that particularly in our home and personal care label business, whereas, I think we will still be focusing on developed markets for our growth in wine and spirits and in healthcare in the short-term. And the comments on M&A targeted more for the second-half of the fiscal year. The reason for that is that you are not finding acceptable deals currently, or you just want to focus more on integrating those that you’ve already made? Partly the integration activity that’s been going on finalizing that without distraction. And then secondly, some of them have just naturally gravitated to the second-half of the year, but where possible we’ve just put them back a quarter or two to polish off our hotspots. Thanks. Good morning. Could you – I don’t know, Sharon, you went over the press release very quickly, so I might not have gotten this right. Did you state the organic growth by region this quarter? And if not, can you give that to us, North America versus Europe versus Australia? Sure. It wasn’t in the press release, but Nigel did comment on it, so I’m sure Nigel comment them again. Yes, in Q4 we had mid single-digit growth in Europe. We had double-digit growth in our North American wine and spirit business. We had double-digit growth in Asia and in Latin America. And then in our main business, our North American business excluding wine and spirits we had negative mid single-digit growth led by the beer label exit. Okay. And that’s by region. And then by just kind of end market wine versus other products, could you talk about the growth rate from that matrix kind of wine growth versus everything else? Okay. And then just going back to our prior question a couple of questions ago, it was pointed out that kind of with your acquisitions, you have, shall we say annual recurring nonrecurring charges, what I like to call it, on facilities when you make acquisitions. And so you are highlighting them. But I think you said Nigel, and let me just repeat it. So I’m clear that you don’t expect the same level of charges for this new 2017’s acquisitions. They won’t have the same level of intensity of facility charges, restructurings, et cetera is that correct? Yes, I guess there is two aspects. First of all, transactions costs to get deals done were more complicated than usual in 2016, so we have higher cost there. And secondly, the business is that we hope to buy in 2017, we don’t see a need for any significant restructuring of closing of plants and moving equipment or people around. There’s always going to be a little bit of that, but we don’t – we see a very limited amount of that in those potential acquisitions. So it should be much less risk of any disruption. I see, I see. Given that you don’t see that same level of need, all else equal shouldn’t that be positive for free cash flow in 2017 versus your bogey of $60 million? Got it, got it. And regarding CapEx, you said $50 million for the year. How much of that would you describe as maintenance of the organization that you’ve built already versus growth initiatives and where are those growth initiatives that you are spending? Yes, we said 5%, which is a bit shy of $50 million, but 5% of sales, typically it’s a bit less than half is for replacement and a bit more than half is for growth. And the growth will continue to be in developing markets predominantly. Okay. Turning to the SG&A, I realize you’ve had a lot of cost to get into compliance. We talked about this in prior quarters. Have you – as of this point, have you completed the work necessary to basically get things into compliance for internal control reasons? I realize the 9% number of sales is a good number to use going forward. But has that mission been completed in terms of getting into compliance? That’s a good question. Our auditor is probably on the line sort of cringing right now. But our account was officially signed on Tuesday, but we fully expect to have remediated material weakness in FY 2016. Tuesday, okay. Good, good. You mentioned foreign exchange weakness affecting the sales number, the 3% included the Mexican peso by my calculation was down 17%, but – 17% year-over-year in the quarter. I thought the Mexican business wasn’t that material to begin with. I guess it was $30 million upon acquisition. Am I reading that right, $30 million-ish range, times maybe 17%? Well, I guess that would be material. $30 million at 17% would be $5 million. And there’s very little of that in the quarter. Transaction risk was the one that we were talking about earlier. There was a little bit of translation risk in terms of the Mexican peso and also the Aussie dollar. But that was the translation risk in the quarter was still pretty modest of that. As you said 3% combined versus say 5% for the year, which just $0.01 in a quarter to translation risk, which is a combination of Aussie dollar and Mexican pesos. Just one quick one for me or from me, Nigel, you mentioned multiple times, the acquisition pipeline being perhaps weighted towards the back half of the upcoming fiscal year. And I know over the past few years, we’ve had a bit of a tailwind if you will from a stronger dollar perhaps making some deals be a little bit more attractive. And my question is if there’s really much risk to that pipeline, should we see the dollar weaken 5%, 10%, it would be hard-pressed to see much more than that. But can you just talk about how resilient that outlook for deal flow may be if we do get some further weakening in the dollar? I think the outlook is just as recently from the sellers point of view, because they’re getting paid in local currency, so it doesn’t effect them. In terms of the impact on us, we’re mindful of any big swings. But at this stage, we don’t anticipate FX swings to impact on our willingness to do those deals. Good morning, I had a quick question on compliance. You said the compliance cost is going to continue a little bit into 1Q even though the material weakness has been remediated. Is that true? Yes, it’s fiscal timing. I mean, the work is happening for in relation to our end of year accounts right now. So there are costs in April and May in relation to the finalizing the audit and all of those things that essentially will be booked in Q1 of FY 2017, so there will be – it will be a little bit higher basically the run rate in Q1. Sorry, I think that the quantification is that, we still feel pretty comfortable with the 9% SG&A for the year. It will be a little bit lumpy in specific quarters. Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you. And then just switching over to North America, you were saying outside of wine and spirit, it’s pretty weak, driven by the beer business. But outside of both of those, can you give a little color on North America volume? Okay. And then finally, just this FX transaction issue, it did have a big swing in the quarter. I know you said and you said earlier that you don’t expect it to recover. But could you give any more color on what it was exactly, was it hedge or yes? It’s, if you think about the numbers for the quarter, the numbers for the year being roughly the same, and so talk about the year specifically. We had a number of presses in jurisdictions that are difficult to hedge, and so it’s a little bit, yes, the majority of that primarily relates to CapEx payments. So to the extent that we from time to time do have CapEx payments equipment and purchases in jurisdictions that are difficult to hedge. There maybe some exposure. It’s unusual then to have that occur when there’s a movement in the currencies. So Mexico and Argentina are examples of that. And so we can’t predict whether we’ll have those in the future, we do our best to mitigate those, but from time to time they occur, but it is pretty unusual for us. Low 3s, okay. And then back to the volume in North America issue, how much of that do you think has to do with your label mix, if you will, in other words your exposure to cut and stack another labels rather than to pressure sensitive? Good question. Yes, I mean, if you look at growth rates from, let’s say Avery at a 4% to 5% and others at mid single-digits, and we’re not there. If you look at our – look at business overall, three quarters of our business is sort of pressure sensitive and shrink sleeve, which is healthy growth rates and the other quarter in terms of in-mold, cut and stack and heat transfer and not healthy growth rate in the last year and a different mix there for to some other businesses. So I think that’s that has an impact. I think the fact that we have a small percentage of revenues in emerging markets and only made 11% of our revenues versus other businesses that would have much higher percentages in developing markets and make the difference. And I think some of the high growth label segments like healthcare and and automotive, we’re not really in much today. So we don’t benefit from some of those high growth segments today. But it’s all upside for us in the future. And how would that I mean in other words, do you have designs on significantly boosting your pressure sensitive exposure, Nigel or exposure to the auto market? Help me understand why you might catch up to the Avery’s that the CCLs in terms of organic growth in the foreseeable future? We want to target more revenues in developing markets at higher growth rates and certainly we want to target more activity in the healthcare space. There are no further questions in queue. I’ll now turn the call over to Nigel Vinecombe for closing remarks. Okay, thank you everyone. Thank you for all those questions and interest today. Certainly fiscal 2017 organic growth should benefit from our beer label exit tailing out after Q2. Certainly Heat Transfer volumes have rebounded and our CapEx investments in developing markets in 2016 will stand us in good stead. Secondly, gross margin should also benefit from the FY 2016 consolidations being behind us and FY 2017 without any significant consolidations planned. And thirdly, we will see the full benefit of our FY 2016 acquisitions. In 2017 and as we touchdown 2017 acquisitions are not expected to require much restructuring if and when they happen. So with that, we look forward to 2017. Thank you for your interest today and we look forward to talk to you next month. Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today’s conference.
