DLH Holdings: Time To Buy Again - DLH Holdings Corp (NASDAQ:DLHC) | Seeking Alpha DLH Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ: DLHC ) provides health care delivery and logistics services to United States government agencies, primarily the Veterans Administration (VA). Here are a few basic statistics regarding DLHC stock: In our initial Seeking Alpha article (published September 8, 2014), we described its business as stable and profitable. Our investment interest in the company was the potential for new business which, if obtained, would generate incremental revenues that would likely have a leveraged accelerating impact on earnings growth. In this update article, we will review the company's subsequent progress and revisit our investment thesis. Revenues in fiscal Q4'14 , ended September 30, 2014, were $15.6 million, up 10% from the prior year. Pretax E.P.S. were $0.02, excluding a $4.6 million benefit. This benefit came from revising part of the valuation allowance the company had maintained on its deferred tax assets related to its net operating loss carryforward. For the full fiscal year 2014, revenues were $60.5 million and pretax E.P.S. were $0.08, excluding the valuation allowance revision. Investors should note that because of this revision the published E.P.S. numbers, starting with fiscal Q1'15 and going forward, will reflect a taxed effect even though no cash taxes will be paid. Revenues in fiscal Q1'15 , ending December 31, 2014, were $15.7 million, up 8% from the prior year. Fully taxed E.P.S. were $0.01. We note that the gross margin was 16.2%, the highest in the company's recent history. NEAR-TERM REVENUE GROWTH SHOULD CONTINUE While quarterly revenues have been up year over year, they have flattened on a sequential basis. The last three quarters' revenues were $15.7 million, $15.6 million and $15.7 million. We believe that both sequential and year-over-year revenue growth will resume as government budgetary issues have been quieted and specific company initiatives take hold. The federal government omnibus spending bill was finally passed in January. It included adequate spending plans for the VA. In early February, the 2016 defense budget was submitted by the White House. It called for increased VA funding with strong commitment to several specific areas where DLHC is seeking new business. In the recent fiscal Q1'15 conference call held on February 5, 2015, Zachary Parker, the company's Chief Executive Officer and President, noted that with these budgetary uncertainties resolved, "we're anticipating that some of the new work opportunities that have been held up will start to move forward in the course of the next month or two". Later in the call in a different context, while discussing "Tele-Health" opportunities (see definition in a later section of this article), Mr. Parker noted that "we had a couple below the radar wins that will help us in the near-term quarters". During the same conference call, Kathryn JohnBull, the company's Chief Financial Officer, was asked about the company's plans regarding renewal of the currently unused credit facility that is due to expire in July. Ms. JohnBull replied that "we do expect that growth through closing on new contracts will require some use of cash". PROFIT MARGINS ARE NOT ONLY SUSTAINABLE BUT SHOULD INCREASE FURTHER Management has consistently maintained that corporate profit margins should generally improve as new business is obtained. Mr. Parker reiterated that belief on the fiscal Q1'15 conference call. The underlying reason for this upward trend is because right now the bulk of what DLHC does can be characterized as production processing work. An example is the logistical task of processing the VA pharmacy orders and shipments. While there are efficiencies and management techniques to be applied to that work (and DLHC has done so, thereby consistently garnering top awards in that field), much of the work is necessarily fairly routine. The bulk of the new business being pursued and obtained is better described as business process management; that is, ordering, aligning and structuring resources in order to better accomplish the tasks at hand. This "solutions" work delivers higher added value and commands commensurately higher profit margins. Management has previously said that new business usually has 20%+ gross profit margins. As new business is obtained, the blended corporate gross margin should continue to increase During the fiscal Q3'14 conference call held on August 7, 2014, management stated that over the following nine months, the company planned to bid on over $200 million of multi-year programs. This was the first time the company had publicly quantified its potential business opportunities. During the succeeding fiscal Q4'14 conference call held December 11, 2014, management further stated that over the following 24 months, the company planned to bid on over $400 million of multi-year programs. Please note that these are multi-year programs (generally 4-5 years), so the total market opportunity is equivalent to roughly $80 million of business on an annualized basis. This looms large given that the current corporate revenue annual run rate is $60 million. During the recent fiscal Q1'15 conference call held February 5, 2015, Mr. Parker was asked if those new business opportunities were still present. Mr. Parker responded in the affirmative and added that the company had already submitted bids on some of them. One area of particular interest by the company involves "Tele-Health" activities, including "virtual pharmacies". There are various permutations of "Tele-Health" that have sprung up over the last several years, but they all center around the use of internet-based communication between patient, doctor and pharmacist. Their intent is to expedite the diagnosis and delivery of prescription drugs and reduce the cost of the process. DLHC's near-term focus is on tele-health opportunities within the Veterans Administration and Department of Defense. Longer term, this could lead to opportunities opening up in the private sector as well. Another area specifically highlighted by management is that of medical logistics. The company has already done some work with the army in this area. The written presentation accompanying the recent fiscal Q1'15 conference call highlighted the recent government "funding for Ebola vaccine and similar medical research". When asked for further clarification, Mr. Parker said that "we see that there's a pretty good potential for us in the near term to pursue work to provide medical logistics support in that (Ebola) arena and some other related infectious diseases". STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES ARE NOW BEING CONSIDERED DLHC's management has begun to consider various strategic alternatives. This is a new development or, perhaps more precisely, a new acknowledgement. The scope of these considerations was amply elaborated upon by Mr. Parker in the recent fiscal Q1'15 conference call. In response to a caller's comments, Mr. Parker agreed that it was an appropriate time to consider strategic actions. He first reviewed the progress that had been made: curtailing losses, stabilizing the company, building backlog and achieving profitability, then added "now it's a point of growth". He noted that the company had laid a "very stable path" for achieving organic growth. Importantly, he then went on to state that "we are seriously entertaining 'not too distant future' opportunities with regard to acquisitive growth… and there's also the potential of some type of merger or something of that nature… as other companies are starting to contact our Board of Directors and ourselves about some possible unions to really infuse something dramatic into our entity and the strategic direction that we're going" (emphasis added). As to the time frame involved, Mr. Parker indicated that during 2015, 2016 and probably part of 2017, "we are seriously looking to whether the disruptive changes that (sic) would benefit our shareholders and we've not taken anything off of the table". We view this enlargement of management's focus as a positive development. Corporate overhead and public company costs weigh heavily on a company the size of DLHC. Spreading those costs over a larger revenue base would be advantageous. As Mr. Parker noted, organic growth is already being assiduously pursued. As a general rule, we view being an acquisition target offering the most value to shareholders. But even making an acquisition is likely to be positive for shareholders given that it would be under the watchful eye of Wynnefield Partners, owners of 45.6% of the outstanding shares. INVESTMENT THESIS REMAINS UNCHANGED: INCREMENTAL REVENUE WILL PRODUCE ACCELERATING EARNINGS Our original four-pronged investment thesis remains unchanged: DLHC has a solid base of business upon which to grow, DLHC is pursuing substantial new business opportunities, new business will likely be more profitable, and earnings growth will accelerate as revenues increase. The arithmetic calculations were detailed in our original Seeking Alpha article and are slightly updated here. Essentially, we expect incremental revenues of $10 million to add $0.10 of fully-taxed E.P.S. This means that a 15% increase in annual revenues will translate into a 125% increase in fully-taxed E.P.S. Again, this is due to the higher margins associated with the new business and the leveraging of largely fixed cost corporate overhead over a growing revenue base. An updated version of our earnings model is shown below. Astute observers will notice that compared to our original model, expected fiscal 2015 revenues are slightly lower, gross profit slightly higher and fully taxed E.P.S. one penny lower at $0.08 (but all nicely higher compared to fiscal 2014). We are currently estimating fully taxed E.P.S. of $0.10 for fiscal 2016 (ending September 2016), assuming no major new business adds… which we actually fully expect. Please note that our FY 2014 numbers are adjusted as if they were tax-affected to compare with the fully taxed FY 2015 and FY 2016 numbers. At its recent closing price, we view DLHC's stock as fairly valued based on our 2015-2016 outlook. We apply a price/earnings multiple of 13 onto our fully taxed fiscal 2016 E.P.S. estimate of $0.10. In addition, the company has a Net Operating Loss (NOL) carryforward of about $41 million, equivalent to a net value of $1.75 per share. We assign the present value of that (NOL) as being 1/3 of the net value. As shown below, the sum of those two valuation components equals $1.88 per share. Parenthetically, we note that during the December 2014 quarter, the company repurchased a small number of shares at an average price of $1.98 per share. There were only a handful of days during that quarter where the stock traded below $2.00 per share so the company was clearly being opportunistic at a price level it deemed attractive. Our interest in the stock is based on the potential new business opportunities the company is pursuing and their impact on future earnings. As detailed in the preceding section of this article, each incremental $10 million of annual revenues will add $0.10 E.P.S., fully taxed. Applying only a 10 P/E multiple to the incremental E.P.S. would raise the stock valuation $1.00 per share to $2.88, 51% higher than the current stock price. Note that this total valuation does not take into account any added value from the pursuit of strategic alternatives. While not a certainty, given the size and breadth of the potential new business opportunities, it seems likely that DLHC will garner at least enough new revenues to bear out these projections. With the stock price now below $2.00 again, and with the new addition of strategic alternatives as part of the mix, the stock appears to be an attractive investment. DLHC is a small capitalization stock. There are 9.6 million shares outstanding, of which Wynnefield Capital owns over 45%. Consequently, the floating share supply is only 5.2 million shares and the floating market capitalization is slightly less than $10 million. This may cause the stock price to be more volatile than usual. Care should be exercised in buying and selling DLHC shares. DLHC is highly dependent on two customers. Over 95% of its revenues are derived from the Veterans Administration and the Department of Defense. Loss of either customer would materially affect the company's business and finances. Its two largest multi-year contracts are scheduled to be up for renewal in June 2017 and November 2017. While the company has performed well on these contracts, there is always the risk of losing the business when it comes up for renewal.
