Simply reducing interest rates is not enough. The ECB has blurred the lines of acceptable stimulus, according to Jens Weidmann, the president of the German Bundesbank. This concept of 'acceptable stimulus' has been pushed by the Germans first under Axel Weber and now Mr. Weidmann. The concept has not been properly defined by the Germans to the point that they have almost become caricatures of themselves as we have all grown to accept that the Germans will always oppose decisions by the ECB. No other nation within the Eurozone criticizes the ECB as much as Germany. The question is whether this is due to a genuine concern about the future of the ECB or is it simply because it is not being done the German way. These are important because it gives an insight into the current split within the ECB and also insight into future ECB actions, especially if Jens Weidmann becomes the new ECB President by succeeding Mr. Draghi. The Germans are incredibly frightened of inflation, this is due to their experiences of hyperinflation during the Weimar Republic and thus their primary central goal is controlled inflation of no more than 2%. So when the Germans speak of acceptable stimulus, they are really speaking of no stimulus and austerity, especially in a negative interest rate environment when conventional monetary policy tools are not available anymore. Their reasoning is simply because there is an outside chance that inflation may catch hold and go out of control. It is interesting to also note that while the Germans have been speaking about overstimulation, they have not actually offered concrete proposals on how they would have managed the issues better in this environment. While I do not agree with the ECB about their methods of conducting monetary policy, I understand their reasoning because without it, the Eurozone will be in far worse shape than it is today. As I have said in previous articles, the ECB is trying to push money into the system through the banks but because of various constraints, banks have not been able to lend out as they would have liked to do because of the Basel rules and their pre-existing commitments on their balance sheet. One alternative would have been to set up development banks in the member states through which funds can be transferred directly into the real economy, where it can finance business development and growth. Within Europe, the European Investment Bank (EIB) plays such a role but does not really engage directly with the financial consumer whether they are businesses or individuals, but rather they primarily work through intermediaries like banks, investment funds or alternative financial providers. The net result of the current actions of the ECB is currently an asset bubble in the European financial market, whereas business and consumer spending remain depressed. While the ECB has continually sought to meet this noble goal of 2% inflation, it is proving to be much more complicated; this is not because of high inflation but extremely low inflation. This has resulted in the ECB continuing to increase the money supply and become a buyer of debt securities in order to stimulate spending and bring the inflation rate to the 2% goal. In my opinion, it seems that the Germans are being disingenuous because the Eurozone cannot be run like Germany which is largely export-orientated with a large internal market and an ageing population. Germany's goal is to maintain the value of the euro and ensure they remain competitive on the global markets. For the rest of the Eurozone, they have to contend with very high youth unemployment and chronic underinvestment in critical areas like research and development, and infrastructure. The main objective of the euro system is to maintain price stability, safeguarding the value of the euro and contribute to the soundness of the financial system in Europe. In analysing the actions by the ECB so far, it is clear that their actions have sought to fulfil their mission. The governing council has recently called for a three-pronged approach in its annual update on the global economy. The fund recommended that governments invest in infrastructure, keep interest rates low and embark upon wide-ranging economic reforms to boost growth. This is the route that they are taking as they seek to go further and further to mitigate the failure of governments to act decisively in the European Union. Some members of the council have suggested that low inflation had become entrenched, as weak price growth might have second-round effects for increases of wages and other prices. The ECB's minutes made clear that "interest rates will remain very low for an extended period," and well beyond the end of the central bank's quantitative easing scheme. Nevertheless, the EU has become a classic case of the failure of conventional monetary policy. Simply playing within the boundaries of classical economics is not going to change anything, primarily because all interest rates do is either encourage people to borrow more or pay less on their financing costs. In our current global environment, people, companies and governments are already over-indebted and reluctant to borrow more and secondly, the economic uncertainty is forcing people to save more money and thus reducing spending, which would account for the persistently low inflation across the euro area. As this graph above shows, since 2006, private sector credit shot up significantly while household savings fell at the same time. It is very instructive to see gross household savings shooting up from 2009 to 2010. From then as money became even cheaper, savings rate fell again to a low in 2013, and it is now picking up again gradually because the public senses more global uncertainty. This second chart sheds even more light on this state of affairs because we see that loans to the private sector grew just as fast as money expansion. We have now reached a saturation point where low interest rates and abundant money have limited utility. I do not believe the answer is 'helicopter money' because that cannot be controlled but the concept of putting more spending money in people's hands is correct. One of the best ways to do this will be to reduce tax. The tax burden has increased steadily particularly in the last decade, it seems that whatever was given by the central banks was taken away by the respective finance ministries. This makes sense because whatever the finance ministries gain in higher tax, they lose from higher social security. The tax system in Europe makes very little economic sense at the moment. What we have seen since 2013 is that the unemployment rate has been falling but it is still very high; in order to create jobs there has to be investment, but as global economic conditions worsened, nations have had this tendency to cut back on much-needed investment and thus slowing the economic expansion process down. The concept of infrastructure investment has been raised many times before but it is worth repeating; for example, sound transport investments sustain aggregate demand in the short run and secure solid investment returns in the long run. Furthermore, besides physical infrastructure, in Europe investments are needed to transform the transport system towards low carbon technologies and to deploy intelligent transport system to make better use of existing infrastructure. Extensive innovation in propulsion, navigation and alternative fuels are also therefore needed. When investments are done in Europe in these innovative sectors, they will also contribute to the improvement of the global industrial competitiveness of the EU, by ameliorating investment opportunities in sectors in which Europe and business leaders operate (in innovative construction, energy providers, clean and intelligent vehicles, logistical services, engineering consultants and alike). It has been shown that long-run transport investment levels (new investments) in developed EU economies have traditionally accounted for approximately 1% of GDP, whilst new Member States (MS) have been spending more as a percentage of GDP in order to catch up and complete their basic networks. Nevertheless, the recent trend that was made worse by the financial crisis is that this level of investment has decreased. In 2011, the EU 27 average was 0.7% of GDP. The short-term impact of such underinvestment may appear easily managed but in the long term it creates a backlog of maintenance, rehabilitation and new investments which will create further bottlenecks for trade and growth in Europe. When a study was made in the context of a 2001 IMF White Paper, it was calculated that in order for the European transport infrastructures to be able to cope with the expected increase in demand, investments of â‚¬1.5 trillion were necessary for the period 2010-2030, this was below the refugee crisis when millions poured into Europe and thus accelerating the need for infrastructure spending. The most intriguing idea of the study is that, according to the evidence gathered in a sample of advanced economies, "An increase of 1 percentage point of GDP in investment spending raises the level of output by about 0.4 percent in the same year and by 1.5 percent four years after the increase." In terms of figures, the needs of existing networks are estimated at some EUR 20 billion per year, but in Europe insurance and pension companies alone hold around â‚¬12 trillion of assets, equivalent to over 90% of EU GDP. These institutional investors are a reliable source of long-term capital, as they need to match their liabilities with long-maturity assets. This makes institutional investors particularly suitable to undertake counter-cyclical, long-term investments in sectors of the real economy characterized by high productivity, and therefore able to generate stable streams of revenues. Even if their level of investment in infrastructure is still limited, a growing interest in infrastructure debt is appearing. Such debt is usually long-dated and provides more attractive yield than other fixed-income products such as government or corporate bonds. This then allows the institutional investors to match their long-dated liabilities such as pensions and insurance pay-outs. This interest is reinforced by the current relatively low yield for government bond in high-rated countries; and because the yield on government bonds are currently so low, it will also help to reduce the discount rate demanded by these investors. I am a big believer in infrastructure and even though there is no direct European fund working in that area, there are good infrastructure ETFs that could give the investor access to the upside on these investments. An example will be iShares Global Infrastructure ETF (NYSEARCA: IGF ), I really like the geographical breakdown and sectors. For investors who want strong cash returns then this will be an ideal candidate to meet these investment goals. Finally, the last area that I believe the EU needs is labour market reform. The chart below is very instructive because while we can pinpoint investments in productivity as one of the sources of economic growth, investments must be married to coherent labour relations. As this chart shows, as productivity rises labour costs in the EU did not fall but rose higher. In many parts of Europe, the cost to the employer for hiring an employee is almost half of that employer's salary. If that is reduced, then it releases employers to either hire more staff or pay higher salaries, but either way it is good for the economy as a whole. In conclusion, while we speak about monetary policy as an important tool, if we are going to see real GDP growth we must go beyond interest rates alone and see how we can put spending power in the hands of people in a sensible manner through tax cuts, more jobs and labour market reforms.
