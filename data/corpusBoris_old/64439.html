Fed’s Fischer Calls for Greater European Fiscal Integration - Real Time Economics - WSJ Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union will “very likely” survive its current crisis, but greater fiscal integration is needed for the eurozone’s future, the U.S. central bank’s No. 2 official said Thursday. “The decision to use the single currency to drive the European project forward was a risky one, and at some stage or probably in several stages, it will be necessary to put the missing fiscal framework into place,” Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said in remarks prepared for delivery at a conference hosted by the European Central Bank in Sintra, Portugal. Mr. Fischer said past setbacks and crises for the post-World War II European integration effort have “spurred policy makers to take steps that they might not otherwise have taken at that time, and the end result of those steps has been a more unified European monetary union.” Greater monetary integration in the form of the euro’s 1999 introduction “until recently seemed to be a major success,” Mr. Fischer said, and “in turn made crystal clear the need for more fiscal integration.” Mr. Fischer expressed optimism that the eurozone will endure, though he acknowledged the European Union faces “the possibilities of major difficulties associated with the current Greek crisis and, later, with a potential British exit.” The best way to prepare for future crises, he said, is to “strengthen the economic framework in which they will be confronted.” Among other things, he said, that “means the continuation of a courageous and effective monetary policy, and courageous and effective regulation and supervision of the financial system– albeit a monetary policy that could do even better if accompanied by an expansionary fiscal policy.” Mr. Fischer took office as the Fed’s vice chairman last summer. He formerly was governor of the Israeli central bank, first deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund and chief economist at the World Bank.
