Benchmark for 2016 budget will be 3 pct deficit at $40/bbl oil price - Russian finance minister | Reuters Related: Currencies, Bonds, Markets, Financials MOSCOW, April 20 The key benchmark for Russia's budget this year will be a deficit of 3 percent of gross domestic product assuming an average oil price of $40 per barrel, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Wednesday. Siluanov also said the long-term benchmark for fiscal policy would be an oil price of $40-50 per barrel, to be embodied in a new fiscal rule. Complying with the rule would require a gradual fiscal consolidation equivalent to one percentage point of GDP each year, he said.
