To this useful post, I wanted to add a comment from Clive about one of the favorite deficit scaremonger arguments, which he recently debunked in comments: I wish I had a pound for each time I heard an asset holder (it is usually someone discussing a retirement fund but you can easily find a similar response from someone exposed to residential real estate) defending some perfectly idiotic policy response on the basis that it would â€œhelp their pensionâ€?. I wish it, because if I had, Iâ€™d probably have enough to bail out the entire system. It cannot be stated often enough (please everyone, tell your friends as often as theyâ€™ll put up with it): All pensions are residual claims on future prosperity. Wrecking the present, such as: * by degrading the installed asset base in areas like transport, power or potable water supply and distribution * by tolerating unemployment, especially youth unemployment â€¦ is lowering the baseline for prosperity in the present which means a lower base to draw on in the future. These are not potential, theoretical problems which might emerge in the future; they are happening today. They represent legitimate areas where state intervention is perfectly justified. I am not a disinterested party here. I am long on both financial asset and residential real estate exposure. These are judged by the people who manage my fund the least-worst asset classes for long-term investment â€” I have limited (virtually zero) influence over their strategies for investment. I fully expect these assets to be subject to write downs with the knock-on effect to the returns I have been promised in retirement. Not exactly a prospect that thrills me, especially as I have limited options to reduce my exposure. But the alternative to the current approach â€” which is being pursued by every government and central bank out there â€” and writing down unsustainable valuations is as the piece points out The Great Depression II. While deficit terrorism precludes state action which would limit the damage, the persistence of policies which make a sudden stop (disorderly defaults and massive dislocations) far more likely is enabled. In short, it gets worse the longer it goes on for. By Thornton (Tip) Parker. Originally published at New Economic Perspectives Most MMT advocates probably took months to get comfortable with it.  But like a personal computer, one need not understand its innards to use its power.  The great power of MMT is its lesson that the federal government can create new dollars by running deficits to do things that should be done.  But the lesson is counterintuitive and will be rejected by voters unless it can be explained convincingly in a few minutes.  This paper offers five nuggets for explaining it quickly. NEP readers are asked to suggest ways to make the explanation simpler and better. Most Americans believe the federal government is like a family or business that must live within its income.  On the surface, that makes sense and the reasons why it is wrong are complex.  Here are five nuggets, or simple ways to explain why it is wrong to voters who will never be economists.  They show why federal deficits are necessary.  They can be adapted and used as appropriate. Federal deficits are necessary and the government normally runs them.  It ran them during 129 of the past 200 years or nearly two thirds of the time.  During the other third, it ran surpluses to reduce its debt during five periods of six or more years.  Each period led to a major depression. 1823-1836: Federal debt reduced 99%  â€“ depression began 1837. 1852-1857:        â€?         â€?         â€?       59%  â€“        â€?              â€?      1857. 1867-1873:        â€?         â€?         â€?       27%  â€“        â€?              â€?      1873. 1880-1893:        â€?         â€?         â€?       57%  â€“        â€?              â€?      1893. 1920-1930:        â€?         â€?         â€?       36%  â€“        â€?              â€?      1929. The economy needs a continuing influx of new dollars to grow.  The government creates new dollars when it runs deficits by spending more than it receives from taxes. When the government collects taxes it takes dollars out of the economy.  It also appears to take dollars from the economy when it sells bonds.  But unlike taxpayers who lose their purchasing power, bond buyers get bonds and keep their purchasing power.  The deficit spending adds new dollars to the economy as if they had been â€œprintedâ€?.  Note these key points: Unlike reluctant taxpayers, bond buyers want the bonds to use as savings accounts to safeguard their dollars and earn interest. The government redeems the bonds when they come due, but it can roll over or sell replacements indefinitely. The total of all dollars the federal government has created this way since 1790 is called the federal debt which never has to be repaid while the nation exists. Attempts to reduce the debt significantly never worked because they took dollars from the economy that it needs to operate and grow. Because the government can create dollars, it can never run out of them and cannot be forced into bankruptcy. The federal government is not like families or companies because only it creates new dollars that stay in the economy unless it removes them by running surpluses. Most people have heard of the private sector but they donâ€™t know what â€œsectorâ€? means.  The economy has three major parts called the private sector, the public sector, and the foreign sector.  The total dollar flows from all buying and selling within and among the sectors always cancel out or add up to zero.  A sector has a deficit if it spends more than its income.  When this happens, one or both of the other sectors must run a corresponding surplus, and vice versa. Since the 1970s, the private sector has bought more goods and services from other countries than it sold to them.  The dollars that flowed to other countries to pay for the net imports were foreign sector surpluses and private sector deficits. Those deficits drained dollars from the private sector and the economy might have slowed down or even fallen into a depression for a lack of money.  That did not happen because the federal government in the public sector ran deficits that replaced the dollars sent abroad.  The country now imports about one half a trillion dollars worth of goods and services a year more than its exports.  That flow will have to be reduced eventually or the economy will become weaker and even more unbalanced.  But until that happens, the government is trapped into running deficits to compensate for the private sectorâ€™s failure to earn its living in relation to the foreign sector.  Balanced federal budgets are formulas for economic decline. The economy is like a car.  Government spending is the accelerator.  Taxes are the brakes.  To keep going or speed up, press the accelerator.  To slow down, ease off the accelerator or press the brakes.  Driving too fast could lead to hyper-inflation, but that never happened here because the country always slowed down in time. Those who oppose federal deficits should be made to answer two basic questions: Why should the government avoid spending to meet the countryâ€™s critical needs in order to save dollars which it can create? How could the government ever run out of dollars since it can create them by running deficits?

To answer question one- all governments which control and manipulate the quantity of currency practice inflation. The stealth tax. Every American has been subject to this tax. The more deficits and the more printing- the more valueless the dollar and its buying power become. A 2 dollar steak in 1974 now costs 12 dollars. So it’s really nothing other than an additional tax which they use to steal from the citizens. Question 2. The government will eventually completely destroy the dollar as it’s buying power reaches nil. As a fiat currency, 6000 years of history has taught us that it will fail- 100% of the time. Only God knows when that will happen but it surely will. What was your net worth in1974?  What is it now?  Have you benefitted from the inflation tax over the last 42 years?  How has your standard of living changed since 1974?  Is your house nicer?  Does your car perform  better?  Do you find it easier to access information?  Music? Movies? Food?  Wine? Do you travel more? Did you actually read the post? Or did you just use it as a chance to play seer? Yes that was the conventional wisdom up to a stunning demonstration in 1945. The US abandoned the gold standard in the 70s. Mark, you understanding seems to predate both of these events. Do you also believe the Solar System is Geocentric? Would a little reading of the history of the 20th Century would prepare you to better understand the issues of the 21st Century? Begging your pardon, Synoia, but what was horrifically demonstrated in 1945 was not that matter could be destroyed, but that it could be changed into energy according to the equation –where m is the mass involved, c is the speed of light, and e is the energy released. Aside from this nit-picking qualification, I am likewise annoyed at Mark Sullivan’s ideological, no-evidence statements. I agree with the Thornton Parker post, and with Mark Sullivan’s critics. The US is the ONLY Sovereign Currency Issuer, because all others with trade deficits need dollars for trade, and their debt has to be settled in in dollars, not in their Sovereign currency. I’m not completely positive that at the BIS you can’t use Special Drawing Rights and Gold to settle accounts. I also think that both Russia and China run some bilateral trade between themselves and with other states via what amounts to barter. Not saying you are wrong, but I think it’s a little more complicated than you present. To wit: if in 1950 I only needed one dollar to buy a thermosful of gravy, and now need six dollars to buy the same product, yet at the same time I earn seven times as many dollars per hour of work, how is that a tax? More succinctly: it’s not the number of zeros on the bill that matter, it’s how much labour do I need to buy my thermos. The mere fact that the internet is spewed with folks munching their nails raw in fear of inflation despite the clear deflationary environment the US and Europe is a clear sign of the coming of President Camacho. Agreed, the focus should be on labor. That’s what is wrong with our system. Median wages diverged from productivity growth decades ago. That’s how inflation has been a stealth tax. The productive gains of the economy are being systematically looted by connected insiders. The typical worker has to work more hours than they ought to have to work in order to maintain a decent standard of living. Sorry to nitpick, because it seems we agree, but just because it is hugely misunderstood (even by many here on this site), I want to drive home the point. The problem is not inflation. Inflation is part of the way an economy works. If you are in a motorboat on a river that is going upstream slower than the current, the current is the problem you face, but what you need to do to overcome it is check your motor. Ie, the problem is not how fast you go, or how fast the current is. It’s how fast you go vs. the current. Likewise, saying “workers’ earnings are being eroded by inflation” only paints part of the picture. By shifting the focus to inflation instead of employers’ refusal to pay employees a wage adjusted to the cost of living, capital has successfully diverted the debate from something that is 100% their fault to making it an issue that can be “solved” by further harming the working class: less deficit spending, depressing aggregate demand, and tightening monetary policy. How much of the increase in the price of that steak is due to the cost of feed, the cost of the land on which the cattle are raised, the cost of transporting the cattle to slaughter and subsequently to the local Piggly Wiggly, etc. Aren’t all of those costs subject to the vagaries of “the market”? Aside from that, one of the reasons we have the current fiat currency system is because under a gold standard, the money supply is limited by the physical quantity of gold. If you have 100 billion oz of gold stored in Ft Knox, and set the exchange rate to 35 dollars to each oz, then you are physically limited to a money supply of $3.5T. The only way you get around that is to acquire more gold or devalue the currency, right? You can’t conjure more gold out of thin air. And since there is a real, physical limit to the amount of gold that exists, if you acquire more gold, you have to get it from somebody else. If I buy imported goods using a gold-backed currency, that money leaves the country. The foreign agents who have my dollars can exchange them for gold. Then the cache of gold in Ft Knox is diminished, right? So the gov would have to increase taxes to drain enough currency from circulation to keep the number of outstanding dollars “balanced” at $35 to an oz, or devalue the currency (make the exchange rate $36 to an oz, for example), right? You suggesting that the gov should impose tariffs on imports to prevent such a situation? If not, then what should they do? Do you advocate free trade? How do you reconcile that with a gold standard? Be like Einstein, conduct a thought experiment. Imagine that we were in charge of our government at the beginning of the Great Depression. Imagine that we were on the gold standard. Imagine that on our first day in office we were told that it had been discovered that the Rocky Mountains were made of pure gold. Calculations had determined that we had an unlimited amount of money. We had endless trillions and trillions of dollars worth of pure gold. What happens then? Who owns the Rocky Mountains? Most of it is federally owned land. The gov could keep most of it in the ground, extracting it only when it needs to increase the money supply. And even if you extract it from the mountains, you do not necessarily have to print currency. You could just store it. The problem is when you have a scarcity of it. When you have a virtually unlimited supply of money, the decision to spend and what to spend it on are political decisions, not monetary ones. My thought experiment includes the idea that we have an unlimited supply of money; “endless trillions and trillions of dollars worth pure gold.” I take your reply to mean that we do have a scarcity of money today. And I take your reply to mean that monetary decisions are not political decisions. In that case who is running the show? How do they prevent politics from influencing their decisions? If we do, isn’t it created by a cascade of political decisions? this is the question.  because money is worth only what you spend it on.  so that:  if a “government’ decides to deficit spend for an extreme social good/necessity it makes money worth more!!!!  really??? how does that work?  People are scrounging out an existence.  They all have dysentery.  They can’t get up off their couch.  They’ve ruined all their shoes.  So they finally decide to eradicate dysentery.  And they spend their energy (same  as their ‘money’) on a good sewage system and some herbal remedies…. and dysentery is cut by 99%.  Good investment.  So they next look at their central bank and realize the CB is screwing them by a fixation on the ‘value of money’ (which doesn’t exist – the only ‘value’ that exists is their own will to improve their lives…) so that any  crappy-assed speculation by the banksters can profit.  So they get rid of the speculators.  Good precaution.  And the economy improves even tho’ their ‘money’ has no intrinsic value.  And etc.  The road to wealth.  Is what you spend your time on fixing and creating. (1) Nonsense. Most inflation comes from the supply side. Asset bubbles. Cartelization. ALL inflation is always blamed on the demand side. Like in this explanation. That lets the rich off the hook. To keep creating asset bubbles and cartels. (2) Hyperinflation is almost always caused by a currency producer borrowing in a foreign currency (or incurring compensatory war debt, same thing) in excess of its ability to pay that debt off. Zimbabwe and post-WWI are the prime examples referred to, and each suffered this fate. In any case, the suggestion that the currency might deflate (to zero) SOMEDAY is always used as an excuse to cut back TODAY, even though no rationale beyond that someday is ever given. This is tantamount to saying let’s screw ourselves today, because we certainly will someday. Let’s starve old people today because if we don’t we’ll have to starve them SOMEDAY. Let’s let our schools rot today, because otherwise we’ll have to let them rot SOMEDAY. The list can go on and on. It just looks more ridiculous as it goes, Except it you’re rich and have everything you need, and your only concern is that things be that way for you for as long as possible. The supply side? As in…the government supplying dollars to rich people that makes basic needs like housing, healthcare, and healthy food more expensive for the majority of citizens? Some of the things you say are true others simply are not.  About the only thing you say that can’t be disputed is un-inflation adjusted steak costs more now than it did in 1974, but that would be true about almost everything.  I can think of a few items that I can buy cheaper now than I could twenty years ago or more, but I digress.   Surely you realize macro-economics isn’t so simple and absolute.  I would like to hear how you would explain the current situation of Japan with your classical Econ 101 dogma.  Japan has been the most aggressive currency diluter (quantitative easer) of any advanced country, they have aggressively deficit spent for decades, they have racked up a government debt to GDP ratio of over 250% and yet they are fighting DEFLATION not inflation as your axioms would demand.  They are also enjoying a stable and relatively prosperous society with extremely low yields on long-term government debt. You can not explain the real world reality of Japan within the your frame work of your classical ‘more money = more inflation’ theory/model.  Simple monetarist theories of macro economics are bunk because they fail to explain the real world. “When government deficit spends and creates something of more value than it spends (what corporations would call ‘profit’), we don’t see any inflation at all. If the US gov’t deficit spends $1,000,000 on enforcing environmental regulations on energy companies which lead to $10,000,000 less in health costs, lost farmland productivity, etc, then we’d see no inflation. Only when the gov’t spends money on corrupt, worthless, or low-value projects, such as wars of choice or bailing out banks, do we see inflation as the result of gov’t spending.” I don’t “oppose federal deficits”, but this article ignores many relevant issues, and dumbs down the entire scenario. Deficit government spending is one tool among many, it certainly doesn’t fix anything by itself. 1 – When government routs its spending towards con artists who claim that they are in critical need or are addressing such needs, when they aren’t, government (and everybody else) needs to grow a brain cell or 20. And use them, too. 2 – If the dollars don’t circulate throughout the economy, increasing their quantity doesn’t do much good. Also, having some concept of proportion (other than infinity) helps recognition, analysis, and possibly even (gasp!) remedies of problems occurring in the system. “Deficit” is a horrible term in the first place, and obviously a source of confusion, and when it’s prospective, it shouldn’t be called “spending” either. Maybe a term like “token initiation” would help people to focus on where the dollars are going instead of where they’re coming from. The point is that deficits are needed, not necessarily how they’re applied.  Demand leakages require the government sector to make up the difference in order for the economy to grow.  Dollars going to foreigners and into savings accounts are not in “circulation” as you put it.  Appropriation of deficits are the responsibility of our fine elected representatives. Government can spend on anything for sale in dollars, or it can tax less to add more dollars into the economy.  Which method circulates dollars more?  There’s your policy debate. Or we could ask the private sector to borrow dollars to keep the economy going.  As long as there are real assets to collateralize the borrowing, that works too.  Until it doesn’t. Okay, I’m disagreeing on specifics. Agreed, and no question: deficits are a vital part of the engine. But if we stipulate that their application doesn’t matter, we lose a way to promote their benefits and inhibit their abuse. Dollars going to foreigners and into savings accounts are not in â€œcirculationâ€? as you put it. Not until they’re spent (somehow). And if they are never spent, that is a problem. And if they accumulate to large volumes and then get “circulated” in a sudden flood, that is a problem too.  And when people say that that has nothing to do with the way they got the currency if they got it though deficit creation, I’m saying that’s irresponsibly obtuse. Which method circulates dollars more? Thereâ€™s your policy debate. No, not mine; I like ’em all in proportion to circumstances. The argument that one is inherently superior to another, or that one will solve everything, is what I’m objecting too; they’re both wrong when they assert exclusive and/or universal absolutes. “Government can spend on anything for sale in dollars, or it can tax less to add more dollars into the economy. Which method circulates dollars more? Thereâ€™s your policy debate” That’s an easy one.  Tax cuts for the poor and middle class will juice the economy more than pure government spending, IF they’re not choking on personal debt, which most Americans are. Lots of money to lots of people will infuse the economy in a much more efficient fashion than large scale government programs where the money will not be as well distributed.   Tax cuts for the wealthy is next to worthless for stimulating growth because they have so much disposable income if there is something they want they have probably purchased it already.   If the ultra rich choose to buy much anyway with their tax cuts it will tend to be less valuable to the broader domestic economy like a Swiss watch or a Tuscan villa.  Not as much domestic bang as several million dollars worth of dinners at cheap local restaurants. He also told Pat Leahy to go f*ck himself, and peppered a crony with bird shot, but I digress. The fly in the ointment — picking your universally embraced favorite winner– who gets the gravy? Deficits appear to not matter when it comes to doubling down on escalation of Moar War– presently in Syria, Afghiranipakiraqistan– we’ll see who is next on the slate later… Deficit spending on US infrastructure, subsidized low-interest student loans, US funded Basic Research- seem to be notions that get no traction in congress. Get folks to agree on where its OK to spend- or anything at all these days— tough slogging. As for me, the answer to whether my standard of living has kept pace with the inflation tax of devalued dollars, it is a resounding Hell No!  I am in the global race to the bottom, and appear to be winning while whining. Last year was the Year of the Turd. Recovery ™ ghosted past our door. Deficit spending, dollar printing, both contain an element of implied trickle down… akin to lowered tax rates on ‘the other side’.  My experience is that there is a paucity of peanuts for the rabble either way, and the bubble is gravitationally drawn and aggregates to the largest masses of money… Compare the Digital TV purchasing $600 check Bush 2 authorized post 911, versus the Hank Paulson legal tablet panic $750 billion to the few, the proud, the… There is a timeless old saw,    And the Rich get Richer… Ah, but what if growth is not a permanent feature of the system?  What if finite limits are pushing the aggregate of the world economy to a steady state?  To which all of the Keynesians reply in unison: “Because growth.” Can we conceive of an economy and a monetary system that does not require perpetual growth?  Can we?  In all seriousness, except for those who see gold occupying a key role in the system, I think the answer is no. Even with a zero growth environment you would likely need new money/dollars flowing into the system most of the time.  History shows that over time the private sector prefers to net save (financial assets) more than it invests.  That leakage of money requires and injection of new money just to keep you at zero. What history shows is that government undertaxes the rich. The reason that new currency units must flow is that the purpose of the system is to entrench inequality. we need growth as long as money is created by interest-bearing means (growth in debt can pay back previous interest without causing deflation), and as long as the population size is increasing. Right on. To me, it’s all in how one defines growth. Economics has become dominated by people obsessed with money in and of itself (as defined as currency units) rather than money as simply a mental construct for how we want to allocate human labor, i.e., our time in this universe. There is a limit to that kind of materialistic growth because it requires competent governance to administer the system which just isn’t compatible with concentration of wealth and power over long periods of time. It requires forcing people to leave what they love to ‘go to work’ rather than empowering people to do what they love better. But if we value other things – justice, equality, leisure time, family, the natural world, scientific exploration, art, etc. – then we can achieve growth defined in those areas for a very long time. A stable system, over long periods of time, requires everyone having a stake. At least we found out MMT began in 1823. Maybe over the next 300 years they’ll recover lost econ and finance truths and finally get the details worked out correctly.. One reason MMT didn’t occur to anybody in 1823, or even 1923, is that federal spending accounted for only 3 to 5% of U.S. GDP until Frank Roosevelt supersized it starting in 1933. That is, surpluses and deficits run by a barebones (some would call it “constitutional”) federal government with no income tax and no direct-to-consumer social benefit programs were simply too small — typically much less than 1% of GDP — to have the grand effects attributed to them by those who imagine that government was always as majestic and all-pervasive as the insolvent Leviathan that we all know and love today. people have a lot of imagination. I think even animals do! I’ve watched a cat twitch and shiver while asleep and I can only imagine the birds and mice parading through its mind. Clive it sounds like you have a lot more money than any of us thought. A fund and “residential real estate exposure”? Wow. When people use the word “exposure” in a financial context that usually means “lots and lots of money”. Most of us just have money in a checking account. Nowdays we learn that’s not our money, it’s the banks money. They just owe it back to us if they feel like it. But if they don’t feel like it, well, our bad luck. Sort of anyway. (I’m just ribbing you since you rib me! All in good fun, that’s how I take it, since it is funny when you rib me and I do get a good laugh when you barb my alma mater, the U. Magonia. You’ve evidently never visited our grounds and seen our buildings. They look like something from another world. I’m not kidding!). I have some deep thoughts about this whole MMT thing but I’m too lazy now to type them out. Here’s the “money quote” no pun intended. Public money is created by commitee. Private money is created by an individual. Each form of creation has consequences for the phenomenon of the money system. These consequences are not trivial and relate to many aspects of group psychology and analysis of psyche. That in turn was largely the domain of either 20th century psychoanalyts who wrote books, crowd psychology theorists (like LeBon, Freud and McKay) along with anthropologists who study non-Western cultures and draw analogies between our rituals and theirs. There’s a lot there if somebody knows it’s there, but if somebody study economics all their life and don’t know it’s there, then they don’t see the phenomenon of money in its entirey. That’s all I can type now. The cat was probably dreaming of creating a can of cat food out of thin air! Cats don’t know anything about money. Cats would never assume a can opener either, so a human serf with can opener would appear just like in “I Dream of Genie”. Look forward to your next economic theory – there’s no such thing as too many – but I’m not sure if you are really discovering new ground taking the anthropologists view. We have shamens and witch doctors now running the field. That wouldn’t come as a new revelation. But I’ll keep an open mind and be patient. (sigh) Yes, apologies, nearly 30 years taking the Queen’s Schilling working in finance has much to my chagrin not just rubbed off on me but, despite my best efforts soaked into my soul. You try to suppress it, but it seeps out, like lead in a Flint water supply, even though you wish it wouldn’t. Before you know it, you’re risk modelling whether or not it’s worth putting some more daffodil bulbs in the front border this spring and doing a cost/benefit analysis on your mother in law’s cat’s veterinary insurance policy. I’m the one who’s ended up driven crazy. I’ve got an article sitting in drafts about how joining the FIRE sector parallels something a bit like all those largely innocent but not really totally innocent kids who joined the Hitler Youth and what makes people become Stasi informers — and how those maybe a little less onerous moral slippery slopes (hmm… maybe they’re just as onerous…) apply if you try to stay on the right side of the thin ethics line all the while you work in finance. It must be putting me in a quandary because the words just don’t flow so I keep pecking at it without actually being able to get it right. A career change would be lovely but if you’re only good for the things you’ve always done, well, you’re a bit stuffed aren’t you. I sent my CV off to the University of Magonia but they wrote me back saying I was over qualified. And they couldn’t match my salary expectations. “C’est la Vie”. Jim, no one in their right mind would want to go back to the conditions of the working class and the elderly before the government assumed some responsibility for their benefit. If you think the world was better before 1913 for average Americans when those two ‘evils’–the income tax and the Federal Reserve–came into being then I defy you to show me how. Absolutely possible. But to argue that any current economy is anywhere near that ideal point– with the rampant need for infrastructure, universal health care and education– is patently daft. How does taxation act as a brake? In other words, what are the conditions that would trigger the use of taxation as a brake? Are you talking about taxation at all levels? Are any levels exempt? Who decides when, who decides which taxes, who decides whom to tax? How effective are the brakes? Do they reverse adverse conditions in days, weeks, months, years, election cycles, decades, lifetimes? Why do we need taxes at all? Do we need them to fund government spending? If so, what exactly is the linkage? How does one take the nation’s foot off the brakes? How effective is this action? How quickly does the economy respond to braking? Who decides when and how hard and how long? Why do you refer to this brake-accelerator cycle as “deficit spending?” Doesn’t this term cause people to worry about deficits? Should we worry about deficits? Should we worry about the national debt? How likely is it that Congress will follow this brake-accelerator cycle in a timely way? Has it ever worked without a great deal of pain and suffering for the masses rather than the elites? What about equity? Who feels the most pain in economic downturns? Do we care more about the DJ average or the lives of ordinary Americans? Again, if our supply of money is unlimited then why use taxes at all? Your family metaphor is weak. Living within its income implies suffering on the part of the family. And, in a family, the supply of money should be used to benefit all of its members, but not so in our government. So, I think that because we have an unlimited supply of money then the family metaphor would apply. Our national family should use the unlimited supply of money to benefit all family members. The deficit spending metaphor has always favored the wealthy classes. Isn’t the most powerful brake of all unemployment? How can that help the masses? It can’t. It only helps the wealthy, if it helps anyone at all. Why can’t we use our unlimited supply of money to plan and implement worthwhile, non-inflationary projects, such as rebuilding our infrastructure, combating the onrushing catastrophe of global warming, building armaments, educating our children, making sure their brains are nourished from conception, giving each American access to money when they need it, in the amount they need, in the way that they need it so that they can do the things that will build a strong America in which all persons can build long lives worth living. These things include, good nourishment, health care, dental care, getting an education, buying a home, starting a family, starting a business, building a safe and comfortable retirement, etc. These would not be inflationary. This money should be distributed to the individual citizen is equal monthly installments from birth to death. One-third of the installment would be used to fund the things I just listed, two-thirds would be used to pay for the basic necessities of life. I think that if we have a truly unlimited supply of money, as the MMT theorists seem to think, then the use of taxation to manage the economy shows a definite lack of imagination. With an unlimited supply of money all one needs to do is slow spending, and that can be managed in ways that do not cause hardship on ordinary citizens. The wealthy do not suffer from increased taxes, but they do feel put upon. But the rest of us do feel the pain of increasing taxes. The wealthy feel no pain because they have the money to pay for the necessities of life. The ordinary citizen does not have the same protection. They lose their homes, their jobs, their savings–their lives are wrecked. Not so with the wealthy. But our unlimited supply of money makes it possible to protect the economic lives of innocents. Years ago, over a period of about eight years, I listened to several men who were veterans of WWII and the Great Depression talk about the way the Hoover government treated their parents. They compared that treatment to the way FDR responded to the Depression. These young men remembered their own anguish at watching the suffering of their parents, some remembered dropping out of school to get a little money, some remembered getting kicked out of their homes. They did not want their own children to witness such anguish. They thought that the government should have given money directly to these suffering families. They were right. This post does not answer the headline. Yes, deficit spending can happen. No, deficit spending is not necessary. Progressive income taxation is another perfectly effective means of paying for valuable public spending. This focus on money as in the quantity of currency units is at the very heart of what is wrong with the car-obsessed, groaf-focused, materialistic paradigm of establishment economics. It is interesting that even when MMTers set out to argue for federal deficits, they don’t actually answer the real question. Namely, of course, that question is the distribution of resources. The problem is not that the private sector has insufficient resources in aggregate. Rather, the problem is the allocation of resources within the private sector, combined with a growing authoritarianism (fascism) in the public sector that deficit spending proponents routinely ignore. The author says that the federal government isn’t like a household. That’s right. The typical household doesn’t run the largest prison system on the planet domestically and the largest empire globally. Or here’s a more empirical way of looking at the irrelevance of deficit spending. Over the past quarter century, we have net deficit spent trillions of dollars. During that time period, median household net worth – according to the government’s own numbers in 2013 dollars – has held roughly steady just above $80K. The average household net worth, however, has increased by more than 50%, from $342K to $528K(!). To those who say deficit spending is the answer in a reality-based worldview, what problem exactly are you trying to solve? The actual evidence, what has happened in real life, shows that deficit spending is positively correlated with increasing inequality in the Reagan-Obama era. IMO this is correct.  Deficit spending can be, but is not necessarily, a redistribution of wealth.  It depends on what we use the money for and who gets it.  It is devilishly difficult to get the money into the ‘right’ hands when an oligarchy becomes as deeply entrenched and powerful as ours is.  Not that we shouldn’t try, somehow: redistribution is a matter of justice, and ultimately, of the survival of democracy. (I also believe the entrenchment of oligarchy is a big factor explaining why corporate profit margins have not (yet) mean-reverted.  And the Fed, as usual, has served the oligarchs.) Well said. Something that continues to intrigue me in the context of oligarchy is how deficit spending in theory is celebrated yet concrete budget proposals never accompany these types of posts. What exactly is all this money needed for if we’re not doing tax breaks for the rich and massive military spending and bank bailouts and bloat in healthcare and real estate and law and all the rest? Japan has been running deficits in excess of 7 percent of GDP ever since the financial crisis of 2008. Chart: http://www.tradingeconomics.com/japan/government-budget And they plan to keep doing it forever, depending on ZIRP to keep the debt service manageable as government debt soars to 300% of GDP and beyond. They don’t want fabulous wealth. They just want to avoid financial seppuku. Now, if the Japanese could have a good old clear out of hopelessly non performing loans (I reckon they’re scarcely two thirds they way through) and quit with the mercantilism, oh, yes, and end crony capitalism corruption then it might all be a bit easier and exhibit better results. It wouldn’t hurt to stop listening to all the rubbish that the US tells them either. And, crucially, despite what some people up the thread insist as the gospel truth, all that money printing hasn’t generated hyperinflation–in fact, the damned economy of Japan just sits there inert like the dead parrot in the Monty Python sketch. As one who gets the general outline of MMT, I think the post does not succeed in providing simple, straightforward answers to those naively concerned about deficits and public debt. Or rather, it does provide simple answers but I don’t see those answers convincing a skeptic. Here are my five choices for a simple answer as to why public deficits and debts are overrated as serious economic problems that don’t have to directly invoke MMT: 1. Even a business accounts separately for current expenses and investments in the future. It is perfectly appropriate to borrow to invest as long as the future payoff on those investments is positive. (This is directly related to Clive’s excellent comment at the top.) This is why the gov’t, like private businesses, should have separate capital and operating budgets. 2. What is much more important than total gov’t spending is what that spending is spent on. All the evidence shows that spending on education, public health (not private health insurance co profits), and direct consumption by poor people provides positive economic benefits while much defense spending and tax breaks for the wealthy do not. Also, if you want to provide jobs for the jobless and raise incomes for low-income people, the most efficient way to do that is to do it directly, not indirectly through tax breaks for corporations and providing easy money to banks. 3. When the private economy is not providing enough good jobs to keep people out of poverty, it is the obligation of government to do it. This is why gov’t deficits have to rise when the economy is poor (higher spending on UE, job creation and anti-poverty programs) and shrink when the economy is good. If you try to shrink govt spending or balance the budget when the economy is poor, that only makes things worse. 4. It’s the trade deficit that is killing good jobs, not gov’t deficits or debt. the trade deficit represents all the good jobs we have exported overseas. 5. How come the government could bail out banks without crashing the economy but helping bail out ordinary people by providing decent jobs and public benefits will be disastrous? I realize that these are basically Keynesian arguments, not MMT arguments, except #5. But I think they are simple, straightforward, and get you to the same place. Keynesian? MMT? I don’t know which is which, and I don’t care. All I know is that your arguments are all good ones. That’s the issue, isn’t it? MMT wants to offer unique insight at a policy level, but it really doesn’t. We know that public investment in some areas is good. The issue is management doesn’t want to do that. 1) Yep. MMT wants to say that government is special, that it’s different than a household or business. But of course it’s not; the same principles apply. 2) Yep. MMT wants to say that deficit spending is inherently good. But the evidence shows that it matters how the money is spent. Which everybody knows. That’s why we have debates about specific programs being good or bad. 3) This is a more controversial one. One might say government’s obligation is to provide income, not necessarily jobs. But regardless, that cyclical nature of spending is the anti-thesis of the bigger deficit spending forever perspective. 4) Here I think you’re still stuck in mainstream economics. The problem is not foreigners at all whatsoever. The problem is entirely in the domestic economy. It’s the distribution of wages and working conditions that matters. In aggregate, there is enough ‘job goodness’ to go around. The problem is that public policy creates a labor force of tens of millions of crap jobs at the bottom in order to allow the top 20% – and especially the top 10% – of workers to reap outsized gains even as they hold many of the easiest jobs. 5) Yep. If anything, this is the main political challenge for MMT out in the wild. Asking who should pay for the bank bailouts is one of the easiest ways to oppose them. Take that point away, and MMT is actually making it easier to bail out the banksters. I mean, that’s why everyone in Washington in a position of power is an MMTer. They love using the power of sovereign money to enrich themselves and their friends. 1. Only the government owns the money printing machine. You and I do not. That makes them different. 2 Wars and MIC spending tend to waste resources. Nough said. 3 When people have more income they tend to spend it and that creates jobs. A deficit means the dollars stay in the economy. 4. I am not sure what you are saying. If u are complaining of inequality, you have landed on Bernie Sanders issue. 5.MMT does not advocate wasting dollars or bailing out anyone. It is a matter of public policy. MMT provides the understanding to help create the policy. That u find corruption is an issue of politics. My argument on #4 is not even really an economic argument. It is that the jobs lost via trade deficit are disproportionately manufacturing jobs, and we need more manufacturing jobs because they can, to a much greater extent than service sector jobs, provide decent incomes AND DIGNITY to poor and less educated people. One huge problem ignored by the economists that say sectors don’t matter is that everyone wants a job that allows one dignity and every working person understands in a way economists don’t that a factory or construction job is much more dignified than a counter job. Future prosperity is a mirage and will only temporarily apply to the super-rich. Growth is over and done — the world economy is in the final stage of contraction and collapse due to over-consumption and population overshoot. Our industrial civilization is a heat engine that has upset the stability of the planet; now it is headed for total ecosystem and habitat destruction, and there’s no going back. We blew it. There’s no point in preparing for retirement, only for our premature death. What do we mean by “grow”? Are we talking about GDP increasing, which if velocity is held constant simply means more $$ in circulation, or are we talking about more stuff being done which makes people’s lives better? Why are we using a flawed concept like GDP. Can we discuss any topic with fundamentally flawed concepts or will it lead to a flawed conclusion? This seems like a really bad idea. The “must be rebalanced eventually” is a giveaway. The private banking sector of the USA is flooding the US with private debt. They can keep a gun to everyone’s head by providing unlimited credit and everyone must borrow against land to live. The govt then has to run down the value of savings via inflation by printing to avoid a slowdown. During contractionary periods, govt deficits need to be larger. OK, then during expansion, small deficits take too much money out of the private sector, and cause recession. It sounds as if govt should always run deficits. Or is this because of our trade deficit. If trade were balanced, during boom times could we run at small or no deficit? allan on 2:00PM Water Cooler 2/4/2016 Europeâ€™s forest management did not mitigate climate warming...
