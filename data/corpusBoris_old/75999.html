Guidewire: A Speculative But Potentially Lucrative Buy - Guidewire Software, Inc. (NYSE:GWRE) | Seeking Alpha Guidewire is an interesting name and is a critical company that supports insurance companies. The stock had delivered nice gains for the last few years but had recently been in a rut until the just reported fiscal Q3 earnings. Guidewire Software (NYSE: GWRE ) is an interesting name and is a critical company that supports insurance companies. Specifically it builds software products that help property and casualty insurers replace their legacy core systems and transform their business. Guidewire products enable insurers to deliver improved service, increase market share, and lower operating costs. It offers products provide support for data management, business intelligence, anytime/anywhere access, and guidance and monitoring. So far, more than 150 insurers around the world have selected Guidewire. In turn, shareholders of Guidewire have been rewarded. The stock had more than doubled from 2012 to 2014. However, had been stagnant and were falling the last three month (figure 1). That was until today when Guidewire's just announced results suggest the future may be strong for this growing company. I thought the quarter was strong. The company delivered results at the high end of their guidance range. The company beat on the top line and just missed on the bottom line. Total revenue for fiscal Q3 2015 was $85.4 million, versus $82 million in the comparable period in fiscal 2014. Total license revenue, including term and perpetual licenses, for the nine month period of fiscal 2015 was $86.0 million, an increase of 4.1% from the comparable period in fiscal 2014. License revenue was $33.3 million, a 4.2% increase from a year ago which saw $31.9 million. Maintenance revenue was $12.2 million, up 17.3% from the comparable period in fiscal 2014, while services revenue increased very slightly to $40.0 million, up from the comparable 2014 period's $39.7 million. This clearly shows the company is growing although some have been concerned with the pace of growth. I contend that there are other metrics to judge growth. One key example is that buried in the report was the fact that the company's rolling four quarter recurring term license and maintenance revenue was $208.9 million, an increase of 26.0% from the comparable period in fiscal 2014. The company, however, is still losing money on an unadjusted basis. Operating loss was $6.7 million for Q4 2014, compared to $0.1 million GAAP operating income in the comparable period in fiscal 2014. However, on an adjusted basis operating income was $6.1 million for the compared to $10.9 million in the comparable period in fiscal 2014. GAAP net loss was $3.0 million compared to $1.9 million. Of course we should really be examining income on an adjusted basis. Adjusted net income was $2.7 million to $7.5 million last year. Earnings per share rolled in at $0.04 per share, missing estimates by a penny. But they are obviously down from last year, where Q3 2014 saw adjusted net income of $0.11 per share. Normally such a decline in earnings would have me on edge. However, the direction the earnings have moved are a result of significant expenditures related to making investments in research and development to advance the company's flagship product, "InsuranceSuite." It has translated into increased insurer adoption of the product as evidenced by a large uptick in new and existing customers buying into these newer offerings, including another product "Spotlight", which provides actionable insights for underwriters by combining geo-visualization and risk scoring. The company believes these investments will deliver term license revenue growth of 20% or more in the next fiscal year. One thing I really like is that Guidewire does have a decent balance sheet. The company had $643.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments at April 30, 2015. This is up from the $588 million at this time last year. The company had $26.6 million in cash-flow from operations in the third quarter, compared to cash-flow from operations of $20.3 million in the comparable period in fiscal 2014. Commenting on the quarter, Marcus Ryu, chief executive officer, Guidewire Software stated the following: "Our third quarter results were at or above the high end of our outlook due to the continued adoption of Guidewire InsuranceSuite and momentum for our newer products, said Marcus Ryu, chief executive officer, Guidewire Software. Our results reflect our continuing efforts to leverage our system integrator partners, who are successfully scaling our implementation capacity and delivering customer success, as demonstrated by the numerous production go-lives achieved in the quarter. Our leading SI partners also continue to expand their abilities to provide insurers with a fully hosted version of InsuranceSuite." Overall, Guidewire's results were better than expected for revenue. The company is taking on new customers and broadening its relationship with existing customers. The company is advancing products to replace obsolete systems and to support new initiatives in the coming quarters. I would like to see the company start turning a larger operating profit, however, the stock has the potential to give strong returns, despite guiding Q4 less than expected. It sees $119 to $123 million, below $123.6 million consensus. However, the Street is applauding the expectations longer-term and this is why I too am excited. On top of expectations for significant growth longer-term, the company is highly focused on cutting cost of deployments and ownership for its customer base to bring in a higher volume of new customers and to retain existing partners. While the risk is high that the company won't successfully deliver, and I think it is a touch speculative, I rate it as a buy nonetheless.
