Robbing Peter To Pay Paul | Seeking Alpha International organizations urge governments to add fiscal stimulus. After running budget deficits since 2000, U.S. Treasury debt is around $19T and interest on debt is 6% of budget. Other large economies are worse: Japan's debt-to-GDP of around 230% and China's around 300%. Central banks' monetary policies - zero or negative interest rates and bond purchases - are losing their effectiveness. Earlier this year, the group-of-twenty (G20) leaders agreed that " monetary policy alone cannot lead to balanced growth " and advocated that governments add fiscal stimulus. This was followed by similar language from the IMF. Most recently, the G7 leaders agreed at the meeting in Japan at the end of May that they would use "all policy tools - monetary, fiscal and structural... to strengthen global demand... while continuing our efforts to put debt on a sustainable path." Japan had pressed to additionally note "the risk of the global economy... falling into a crisis, if we did not take appropriate policy responses," but that phrase was scrapped from the final communiqu√©. Fiscal stimulus means reducing taxes or increasing government spending. This sounds good on the surface, until we realize that governments globally already spend more than they collect in taxes. The difference, the deficit, is financed by borrowing. Specifically, the 2015 U.S. federal budget spending was $3.8 trillion, or 21% of GDP. Out of this, the federal government had to borrow $580 billion, or 16% of the amount it spent, according to the National Priorities Project. Borrowing adds to U.S. Treasury debt, which now totals around $19 trillion, over 100% of annual economic output. Annual deficits shrank during the post-crisis period of economic improvement, but have still exceeded $500 billion a year in recent years. The chart above shows only "on-budget" deficits, which are constantly overrun. The last time the U.S. government ran a surplus was at the end of the economic expansion cycle in 1999 and 2000. The G7 language that there's a need for "efforts to put debt on a sustainable path" is a serious warning. While U.S. Treasury debt is at an all-time high at $19 trillion (over 100% of annual GDP), things are even worse in other large economies including Japan (debt-to-GDP of around 230%) and China (around 300%). Interest on the Treasury debt - $230 billion in 2015, 6% of last year's budget - is now the fourth-largest budget expense category, larger than Veteran's Benefits and behind Military expenses. Interest expense will continue to grow as the debt grows, and will accelerate if interest rates rise. Sources: Office of Management and Budget, The National Priorities Project While monetary stimulus is becoming increasingly ineffective, pursuing fiscal stimulus isn't a viable option either. It's like robbing Peter to pay Paul - it would further increase already-unsustainable government debt. The G7's warning is appreciated, but I can't tell if global leaders really have a viable solution to the debt problem. In this context, Japan's urge to warn of impending global economic crisis seems appropriate.
