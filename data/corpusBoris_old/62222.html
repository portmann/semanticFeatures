India’s Central Bank Chief Wants More Central-Bank Coordination - Real Time Economics - WSJ NEW YORK–Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan said Tuesday that global financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund need to do a better job at mediating between the policies pursued by the world’s major central banks. Gov. Rajan said the lack of an effective, cooperative safety net has the potential to push the world toward a succession of crises, as countries seek to stimulate domestic demand by cutting interest rates and devaluing their currencies in turn, a move that pushes others to do the same. “The current non-system in international monetary policy is, in my view, a source of substantial risk, both to sustainable growth as well as to the financial sector,” Gov. Rajan said in the text of a speech given before the Economic Club of New York. “It is a problem of collective action.” He said in his speech that while he understands a central bank taking aggressive action to get its economy back on track, it can go too far if the policies are continued for too long. While he didn’t point a finger at any specific central bank, he nevertheless said unconventional policies like those pursued by the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan can have the practical effect of shifting demand around, rather that stimulating a fundamental improvement in domestic conditions. What is more, the policies can have strong foreign-exchange effects that would normally be frowned upon. He was speaking in reference to stimulus programs that lower the value of a country’s currency. “Once you enter into this type of competition, you find it very hard to come out,” Mr. Rajan said. Gov. Rajan already has criticized central banks in developed countries for their loose-money policy. Europe’s central bank is in the midst of an asset-purchase program to buy 60 billion euros a month in assets until Sept. 2016, or a total of one trillion euros. Japan has been using loose monetary policies to cut the value of the yen to the dollar by half in the past three years. China has cut rates three times in the past six months. Mr. Rajan said there needs to be greater coordination, brokered by international organizations, to make sure one country’s monetary policy isn’t unfairly impacting others. The world needs “much clearer rules of the game is what is allowed and what is not allowed,” he said. Federal Reserve officials have in the past responded to these arguments by reminding critics they are legally mandated to achieve U.S.–centric job growth and inflation goals. That said, global financial markets, and emerging markets in particular, have been greatly affected by investor expectations about Fed policy. New York Fed leader William Dudley has said repeatedly the Fed must take into account how its policies affect other nations. But he also has said that policies that promote a robust U.S. economy are a benefit to all nations. Mr. Rajan also said in his speech that in order to boost the effectiveness of the IMF in the prevention of the next financial crisis, the Fund could make unsolicited liquidity lines available to countries, which would prequalify with the Fund, and be told how much of a line they would qualify under their current policy. The central banker also addressed local Indian economic conditions. He praised the progress of reform efforts of the nation’s new government, while saying many might be expecting too much of leaders. Mr. Rajan noted that inflation had come down “tremendously.” Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
