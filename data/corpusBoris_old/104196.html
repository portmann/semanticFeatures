Daktronics: Patience Is Key - Daktronics, Inc. (NASDAQ:DAKT) | Seeking Alpha The company continues to grow sales at an outstanding pace. Margins continue to be an issue because of competitive pressure. In my last article about Daktronics (NASDAQ: DAKT ) I had drawn the conclusion that the company would be making the largest video display in college football for Auburn University. My assumption became true just the other day when the company finally announced it is behind the monster new board. Being a current student of the university this is where I actually originally thought to look into Daktronics. The company continues to set new records in a number of arenas as well as in its own performance. While the Auburn news is good for the company I really wanted to take a look at the company's fiscal 2015 results . Fiscal 2015 can be described as a mixed bag in my opinion. A sour third quarter dragged the company's results down greatly and earnings for the year were less than expected. However, this comes as the company was able to increase sales once again. Sales were actually up a whooping 11.6% from fiscal 2014 making it the best year ever for Daktronics in terms of sales. It also hit another milestone with its international segment achieving over $100M in sales for the first time ever. This is great to see as I believe this will be the company's major growth area for years to come. Earnings did not follow suit with sales growth for a number of reasons. A small reason would be that the company did have trouble integrating Data Display, a company in Ireland it acquired last August. It does continue to foresee issues with this in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 but should begin to become less of an issue and not an issue at all as the year progresses. On top of this, fiscal 2016 will be the first full year of the company getting the exposure that the Data Display acquisition in Europe offers. The largest reason for the decrease in earnings was that margins were squeezed. The company has blamed this on competitive pressure as well as a higher number of larger projects having smaller margins because of contracting. This is where patience will be key. The company continues to focus on long-term growth in profitability but says it may take time. The company is probably feeling some pressure about earnings growth and it has reiterated that this remains a key focus. With the business still expanding worldwide I for one can wait for the profitability growth. The company will aim to get gross margins back above 25% over the next few years and with sales pinned to continue to grow earnings should be able to follow. DAKT Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts In the meantime the company is performing basically everywhere else in the business. It generated nearly $35.5M in free cash flow for the year and had four out of its five segments increase sales nicely. It also finished the year with its largest order backlog ever. Some of this will not be recognized until late fiscal 2016 and 2017 because of the New Atlanta Stadium. Anyway you look at it though it is still a good sign for sales entering the new fiscal year. Since the market for the company's products has really only fully developed over the last two decades or so I continue to expect the company to see some of its best growth internationally. With the delivery of new boards for the Swiss rail system I expect the company to continue to increase its presence in the massive transportation market in Europe. Overall Daktronics continues to be a safe long-term bet. This is because it not only generates healthy amounts of free cash flow but also sports a beautiful balance sheet. The company has remained debt-free and maintains an ample cash position. It actually increased its cash position from the end of fiscal 2014 from $45.6M to $57.8M at fiscal year-end 2015. In total the company holds about $83M in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The largest negative for me from fiscal 2015 was that the company was not able to raise the dividend this past quarter. While this was a disappointment I maintain the view that the company is in a good position to at least continue to maintain its payout. The current yield continues to satisfy at 3.4% and I would guess that if in the coming years the company is able to deliver on earnings growth that it will raise it again in the future. In conclusion, I think that patience is key with Daktronics. Sales growth continues to be very good and I expect the company will be able to finally begin to deliver earnings growth over the next couple of years. This will be accomplished through further expansion of the business and a focus on generating higher margins. Personally I'm happy to be patient and happy to get paid while I wait for the company to translate great sales growth into earnings growth down the road. Disclosure: I am/we are long DAKT.
