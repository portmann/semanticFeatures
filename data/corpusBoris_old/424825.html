Should Apple Delay iPhone 7 Launch? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Fiscal 2016 is not salvageable, so why focus on Q4? Investors looking at important holiday period for iPhone growth. Fiscal 2016 did not turn out to be the year many had hoped for when it comes to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). In a little over three months, the company will unveil its next smartphone, with investors looking for the iPhone 7 to provide a brighter future. Given the current state of expectations, there are a few reasons why Apple might want to consider a slight delay in the launch of this new iPhone. Unless Apple launches a lot of new products/services very soon and moves up start dates for other launches, the company will show a sizable revenue and earnings per share decline in fiscal 2016, ending this September. If you want fiscal 2017 to look a lot better, the best way to do that is to lower fiscal 2016 results as much as possible. The following table shows where expectations currently stand. (Source: Yahoo! Finance analyst estimates page) Analysts are already calling for a near double digit decline in Q4 revenues, so why not lower the bar some more? Lowering the fiscal quarter's (and year's) numbers would allow some revenues and earnings to be pushed forward into fiscal 2017. As a point of reference, I'm not talking about a huge delay in the iPhone launch, a week or two probably would do the trick. Protecting the all important holiday fiscal Q1 period: When it comes to importance, does anyone really care about the final fiscal quarter of the year, or are you more interested in what happens during the holiday period? Where expectations stand now, fiscal Q1 2016's revenue figure would equal 35% of the fiscal year's revenues, and that percentage could rise if Apple plays along with what I am suggesting. In Q1 2016 , Apple was able to show a tiny increase in iPhone unit sales and overall revenues compared to the prior year period, something that won't be seen in the final three quarters of fiscal 2016. That means that the Q1 2017 quarter will be going up against the all-time record quarter for iPhone unit sales and overall revenues. While the iPhone SE will help a little with unit sales, it will hurt overall selling prices and margins a little. The lower price phone might also cannibalize sales of higher priced models a little, making it more imperative to give Q1 as much help as possible. Pushing back the iPhone launch to get as many sales into Q1 as possible would seem like a good idea. Hold share price down a bit for more buybacks: The best time for a company to buyback shares is when they are low. While that seems rather obvious, it doesn't always happen. Apple management spent a considerable amount of funds repurchasing shares over $120, and right now that looks rather foolish. Apple wants to get the most out of its dollar, so giving Q4 the kitchen sink treatment would allow shares to remain a bit depressed. I also think this is important because of what happened last Friday, as the bond market rallied on a terrible US jobs report. Chances of a Federal Reserve rate hike this month have dropped, so when rates rise is now up for debate. The result was a fall in US bond yields, with the 10-year chart seen below. Apple has taken on a lot of debt to help with the buyback, so lower interest rates help the company out. With Apple's dividend yield over 2.30% on an annual basis, the company actually realizes a cash flow savings when it buys back shares at that yield using debt that costs less than that after tax. With interest rates dropping, Apple is in a better spot to take out more debt for the buyback program, further bolstering the argument to keep share prices lower for a little while longer. Normally I wouldn't be in favor of a company playing around with launch dates in an effort to play the expectations game, but that might just be the best idea for Apple with the iPhone 7. With fiscal 2016 results going to be down big, why not just punt and set the bar lower for next year? I'm not suggesting a massive delay in the phone's launch, just a week or two to push more sales into the more important holiday Q1 2017 period. This could be better in the long run for the company by keeping shares low to help a buyback, aided by lower interest rates, and would allow investors to scoop up shares on the cheap before a potential iPhone 7 recovery.
