U.S. Senate Democrats pledge to block spending bills | Reuters WASHINGTON Senior U.S. Senate Democrats said on Thursday they would block spending bills for the fiscal year starting on Oct. 1 to press their case for scrapping mandatory spending limits that have been in place for the past two years. Congress must pass a series of fiscal 2016 appropriations bills, or a stopgap measure, by Sept. 30, to avoid a government shutdown on Oct. 1. Senate Democrats have been arguing with Republicans, who have majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives, over a plan to use special contingency funds to avoid the caps only for the Department of Defense that has been included in the annual defense authorization bill. Republicans argue that the military should be spared many of the so-called sequestration cuts to ensure national security. Democrats argue that other programs subject to the spending caps, such as medical research, education and veterans' programs, also are important.
