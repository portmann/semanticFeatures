Boehner: No decisions made on U.S. government spending bill | Reuters WASHINGTON, Sept 9 U.S. House Speaker John Boehner on Wednesday said that he has made no decisions on when the House will begin consideration of a stop-gap spending bill that would avoid a government shutdown on Oct. 1. Congress has less than three weeks to pass a temporary spending measure during a crowded September schedule that also will include consideration of a contentious measure aimed at stopping the Iran nuclear deal and a first-ever address by Pope Francis to a joint session of Congress.
