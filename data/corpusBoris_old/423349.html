Over the summer recess, political conditions will deteriorate. The ECB is betting that the positive results of its recent monetary expansion will continue through the summer. The Eurozone banking sector is facing consolidation at the national level to create the scale to operate in the ECB's new high-liquidity, negative-interest-rate environment. Despite statements to the contrary, the EU is letting indebted nations off the hook. Is It Me, Or Is It Getting Warm In The Eurozone? Image source: Cyrielle Sicard/AFP via Getty Images // Bloomberg. As Eurozone politicians look forward to a summer break, during which they can plot the next moves toward fiscal and banking integration, the restless people of the continent intend to make their voices heard. France, as always, is the flashpoint that is getting the headlines, as active resistance to Hollande's economic reforms turns violent. It appears that President Hollande is losing his grip not only on power but also on basic law and order. Nudging deeper political and fiscal integration, in the circumstances where he no longer has a political mandate at home, is out of the question. France may be getting the headlines currently, however populist discord is prevalent across the Eurozone in general; leading to the creation of a political vacuum. The gap between the governed and government has never been wider in the post-War history of the continent. In Spain the political vacuum creates threats to current fiscal austerity, as the caretaker government may soon have to go back to the nation to seek a political mandate. Podemos has already nudged debt renegotiation onto the political agenda of all the parties involved, by stating that it will seek a dialogue with creditors if it leads a new government. In seizing the initiative in this way, all the parties have been forced to come up with some kind of debt bail-in strategy to compete with Podemos for the popular vote. Faced with this growing political paralysis, the spotlight once again focuses on Mario Draghi "to do whatever it takes" to save the day. As the summer recess looms and anticipation of something strong from Draghi at the end of it rises, the ECB has defaulted to the baseline of guiding that time is needed for the benefits of the current easing phase to become evident in the data. ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio stated that it is too early to call for more ECB easing, based on the fact that recent easing in March has yet to have its full impact on the economy. Governing Council member Jan Smets became another member to default to this position, whilst leaving the window open for further action by stating that inflation indicators are still too low. He was swiftly followed by Vitas Vasiliauskas, who opined that the ECB should wait until the autumn to discuss another monetary policy expansion. The position was then emphatically underlined by Executive Board member Benoit Coeure, when he said that a further cut in the deposit rate was not envisioned at this point in time. Using the platform of the Institute of International Finance's (IIF) spring meeting in Madrid, a quartet of ECB officials started to nudge politicians to shoulder more of the responsibility for economic growth. They set out a roadmap for this transformation that will involve the kind of coordination, fiscal stimulus and economic reforms that can only be achieved through deeper political and fiscal integration. Governing Council member Peter Praet injected a sense of urgency into the project, by saying that there was no time to lose. Governing Council member Francois Villeroy de Galhau, pushed the economic stimulus ball back into politicians' hands; when he opined that the Eurozone had become too reliant upon the ECB. This has raised the level of risk to the Eurozone; which now faces the negative blowback to asset prices and growth from keeping rates too low for too long. This view was underlined by Governing Council member Klaas Knot. De Galhau's political solution follows the ECB's standard view of what fiscal integration should be. A stronger fiscally unified Eurozone, will have stronger elected officials who will deliver an economic stimulus, that is fiscally disciplined and coordinated with economic restructuring to make the whole system more globally competitive. Fourth speaker, Governing Council member and Bank of Spain Governor Luis Maria Linde's prognosis was slightly more disingenuous than his colleagues. Perhaps reflecting Spain's unique set of circumstances, he said that the region's policies should be "better exploited". The sense of urgency instilled by Praet was elaborated upon by Governing Council Valdis Dombrovskis. Careful not to trigger a panic with his words, he nevertheless underlined that whilst the Eurozone "remains on the right track," some EU economies are "losing momentum." He equivocally concluded like the infamous double-handed economist: Overall, you could sum it up as saying that, on the one hand, governments are showing a somewhat belated sense of urgency while, on the other hand, there are those harbouring a possibly false sense of security. The line adopted by all speakers, was consistent with the following ECB decision to keep interest rates on hold and allow the current easing programme to work through the economy. This line of reasoning was also articulated by Mario Draghi at his press conference following this decision; where he underlined the expectations for rising growth and inflation, whilst reiterating his commitment to do more easing if needed. He also demanded that fiscal policy be applied more vigorously with the required checks and balance of structural reforms to prevent it from being wasted. Given that the Fed has recently signalled that it will press on with its tightening, the ECB's standing pat may be strongly motivated by a wish not to exacerbate global trade tensions; by triggering a violent sell-off in the Euro with more monetary easing guidance. The position taken by Governing Council member Bostjan Jazbec follows this logic; and serves to give the Euro some real fundamental support. Pushing a little further than his colleagues, wait for the growth from the current stimulus default position, Jazbec went further to frame a positive future outcome. In his opinion the current stimulus will be a success, so that the ECB will be able to raise its growth forecast. Governing Council member Ignazio Visco then made sure that this emerging positive tone from the ECB does not mean that all bets on a further easing are off. Framing anticipation of what potentially lies ahead, he opined that the risks of deflation are still greater than the risks to pensioners' savings from negative interest rates. The door is therefore still open for more QE and negative interest rates. Of Jazbec's positive future, it would appear that the ECB is hoping to leverage off the impact on inflation of the rebound in oil prices. Irish central banker Philip Lane signalled that the rebound in oil prices will pass through to the inflation data. Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny drew a sharper correlation, when he said : "I think that what we will see is a higher inflation rate in the second half of this year due to effects in regards to oil prices." To emphasize the point being made by Visco Governing Council Member Erkki Liikanen opined that, since inflation has undershot for a considerable period of time, the ECB should tolerate an overshooting. He did not specify how long this overshooting should be allowed for unfortunately. If it is anything like the undershooting period, then it could last for several years. Since Liikanen is a neutral, within the Governing Council, his Dovish views should be taken very seriously. The ECB seems to be agonizing over how long to leave the stimulus in place for; just like the Fed. Since the Fed is now signaling that the stimulus will not be withdrawn, even during the tightening, one has to assume that the ECB's "temporary" QE is going to become a permanent increase in the Eurozone money supply. The selling pressure is therefore very much on the Euro; so the earlier ECB rhetoric in support of the currency, noted at the beginning of this article, provides additional support for the idea that ECB QE is going to become a permanent monetary expansion. Perhaps more ominous than Liikanen's, are the words of the Dove Francois Villeroy de Galhau. By trying to lower expectations for banking profitability going forward, he virtually triggered a panic across the sector for those who understood his words clearly. He opined that banking sector profitability was broadly good in 2015, as a consequence of ECB monetary policy. He then warned that returns in the sector will be lower going forward. This forward looking guidance begins from a point where the ECB went negative with interest rates. Clearly Villeroy de Galhau is warning that negative interest rates are going to significantly hit banking business models and earnings. He affirmed that the ECB will be watching bank business models in relation to margin pressures from low interest rates. He neglected to mention what will be done about the negative interest rates that are threatening said business models though. Click to enlargeImage source: Bloomberg . Eurozone bankers will be looking towards their summer vacations with some trepidation. For many the vacation will be permanent; and for those who return to work the picture is mixed . Net lending margins have contracted for the first time in four years, even before the recent lurch towards negative interest rates has taken a further chunk out of them. Click to enlargeImage source: Bloomberg . The good news is that non-performing loans are improving. The Eurozone banks are resigned to their fate. In order for non-performing loans to improve and for borrowers to stay liquid and refinance, low interest rates must pervade. The cost for improving loan portfolios is their declining margin profitability. The only solution for the banking sector is scale, so one can expect a mass of banking consolidation at the national level, to create institutions of scale that can deal with the new competitive landscape. Cryptic words from ECB speakers about banks changing their business models are therefore in fact suggestions to scale up. The "Summer of Discontent" will thus involve the banking sector exerting pressure and influence on the ECB and policy makers, not to follow through with further cuts to negative interest rates. In return the ECB will exert equal and opposite pressure for bank mergers. It seems that the banks like cheap emergency liquidity to prop up their balance sheets and fund their assets; but they do not wish to pass on this benefit to borrowers. The ECB must now deal with revolting depositors who threaten the banks' existence; in addition to revolting bankers who do not wish to participate in the monetary transmission mechanism. Selecting the winners of this conflict is a political decision as much as it is a central banking decision. The winners will be the consolidators who are then willing to deploy their scale in the ECB's process of credit creation. Click to enlargeImage source: Bloomberg . Those looking for more than just the ECB default baseline of wait and see, chose to focus on the release of Q2/2016 GDP data which would show just whether the rise in growth and inflation during Q1 was just a blip. Meaningful growth data would frame expectations not to expect more monetary easing after the summer recess and vice versa. The uninspiring PMI data lowered expectations for a strong quarter's economic performance; and raised expectations from the ECB. Rising Eurozone consumer confidence data and the stronger GDP numbers from France, calmed rising fears and took the pressure off the central bank. Click to enlargeImage source: Bloomberg . Core inflation remains in a downtrend. The recent rally in oil related prices is not seen as being strong enough to move the core inflation trend back upwards. The latest inflation data was in the negative zone for the fourth consecutive month. The ECB is therefore still expected to deliver more monetary easing to address this core inflation problem at some stage. The last report suggested that a "Summer of Discontent" sparked by the Bavarians and other German liquidity preferring groups was set to ensue. German resistance to the ECB has now strengthened from a legal basis. In addition to the legal challenge, to the ECB's bond purchases under European Stability Mechanism (ESM), at the German Constitutional Court level a new court case has been opened. In the new additional challenge , the German academic and business plaintiffs argue that the ECB has overstepped its legal mandate in buying corporate bonds. The strength of the German assault on the ECB has finally forced Jens Weidmann to signal that whilst its independence is sacrosanct that its actions may be fatally flawed. Weidmann is in danger of perjuring himself. Whilst supporting loose monetary policy, based on current weak inflation fundamentals, he was careful to explain that he empathizes with those who see the ECB as acting as a fiscal enabler of indebted nations. He is particularly concerned that national central banks are the biggest creditors of their nations' governments. One senses that he has reached the limits on his credible defence of ECB independence; if this independence has been politically hijacked by the Eurozone nations. Underlining Weidmann's criticism is the evidence that the ECB may have reached the practical limits of what it can do for the weaker Eurozone nations in terms of sovereign bond buying. It was recently reported that the ECB has stopped its buying of Irish and Portuguese bonds because it is hitting its limits under the terms of its last buying programme. There is little more the ECB can do for these nations, so they are now at risk. Applying deficit cutting measures may backfire by hitting economic growth. Should the ECB wish to buy more of their bonds, it risks blowback from Germany. A crisis in the Eurozone is therefore the only effective cover for the ECB to expand its bond buying in these two nations. As soon as the ECB bid backed off, Portugal immediately blinked. In a previous report entitled "Zombie Death Of A Eurozone Hard Currency Salesman" it was suggested that Italy's flawed "Atlante" alleged private sector bad bank bailout model would be used as a template across the Eurozone. It was also suggested that since this model is lacking in private sector capital, that it will be bailed out ultimately by national taxpayers. The real objective was said to be the spreading of the debt burden across Eurozone taxpayers in general through a fiscal union. Portugal's potential to apply the "Atlante" model was deeply undermined by the fact that the largest ostensible private sector bank paying into the bailout fund was itself a bailout casualty of the state. Despite the obvious failings of the model, the Portuguese central bank Governor Carlos Costa opined that the "Atlante" model should be applied. To overcome the hurdle presented by the private sector bank subsisting on a state bailout participating, he stated that the EU should waive its rules on state aid so that the government could provide an implicit state guarantee on the Portuguese "Atlante" process. Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem is beginning to get a little uneasy with Portuguese situation; and its wider implications for weakening fiscal stability guidelines throughout the Eurozone. As a sign of his displeasure and also to signal that the EU will not play along with Portugal's kicking of the debt can down the road, he stated that the country may get a penalty for its fiscal transgression. Fining a nation that is struggling to pay its bills would seem churlish to some, therefore the EU may have to find better ways to enforce fiscal discipline on the Portuguese. Fining a nation may also drive a populist backlash that threatens the Eurozone's existence. Political expediency mitigates in favor of the debt transgressors. The EU now faces the prospect of setting the dangerous precedent of allowing state aid to the banking sector. Under these circumstances, it's no surprise that the ECB has stopped buying Portuguese bonds. It could find itself financing the deficit of Portugal, that is financing the bailout of its national banks. The moral hazard nexus and furor that this would create in Northern Europe can be clearly seen. Given what is also going on in Spain, the contagion is rapidly spreading through Southern Europe. European Union (NYSEARCA: EU ) politicians probably wish that the summer recess would come soon, so that they do not have to address the "Summer of Discontent" warming up in Spain. Spain has officially breached its deficit targets, so that the EU must now deliberate on how to first acknowledge this and then to deal with it. As Spain currently has a caretaker government and faces new elections this summer, the EU needs to avoid provoking the populist resentment any more than it already has. A fine or a return of EU budget inspectors therefore looks out of the question, even though both options are mandatory. The precedent already being set by Matteo Renzi's game of cat and mouse, with the EU over Italian fiscal limits, also frames the issues for Spain and Portugal. On the eve of the release of the EU's official findings on the fiscal conditions in the three countries, the Italians leaked a private letter from the European Commission (NYSE: EC ). This letter effectively stripped out 0.85% of Italy's fiscal spending on the condition that the country broadly agrees to address the issue in 2017. Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco then tried to allege that the deteriorating banking sector non-performing loan story is improving, thanks to economic growth. The 0.85% fiscal stimulus that has been erased from the records, thus shows up as real economic growth that Renzi can evince as supporting his case for breaking deficit limits. Italy is being given wiggle room, that it is then widening even further. Visco then undermined all the work he had done talking up the Italian economy, as he pressed the case for a Eurozone wide taxpayer funded bailout for the banking sector. In his circuitous logic , the current post-crisis legislation insulates taxpayers from any future baking sector bailout. Apparently this is triggering uncertainty in the sector, so that investors are unwilling to lend to banks and banks are unwilling to lend to customers. Taxpayer funded bailout legislation would therefore in his theory support the credit creation process. The takeaway from his discourse, is that credit is constrained in Italy and a banking crisis is just around the corner; if it is not already happening. The point that credit will remain constrained within the Eurozone, unless its taxpayers are on the hook to bail out the banks, also signals the total loss of the fundamental principles involved in the creation of credit that the Eurozone has degenerated into. If the lenders want taxpayer guarantees, then they are in no position to demand wider lending margins also. The credit rationing and creation process now resembles that in a command economy, rather than a dynamic private capital market. The road to the solution of scale merged banking entities, who drive the ECB QE to the real economy, is wide open. Having let Italy off the hook, it would be difficult for the EU to stick the boot into Spain and Portugal. The typical default Plan B of doing nothing in the hope that the ECB will save the day looms large, especially as the summer recess beckons. The problem with this solution is that ECB liquidity without punishment, reinforces the governments' incentive to do nothing; and therefore to miss their deficit targets next year. Doing nothing is therefore not a solution, even though the EU politicians think that it is. Scaling up the banks is doing something. This something also supports the general drive to greater financial integration across the Eurozone. The precedent being set by Italy, is nothing compared to that being set by France; which is freely admitted by European Commissioner Jean-Claude Juncker. Juncker made it clear that French fiscal transgressions go unpunished simply because it is "France". For someone who wishes Britain to remain in the EU, this was an inflammatory revelation. However for someone who is more concerned to expand Eurozone fiscal and political union, such a comment finds its real context. What's good for France is good for the rest. Seeing what is coming next and desperate not to allow the ECB to be viewed as enabling moral hazard, whilst pretending to be independent, Jens Weidmann spoke in anticipation of the EU's decision. Acknowledging the EU's difficult balancing act of adhering to deficit target rules, whilst maintaining political cohesion, he stated that political expediency is taking dangerous control of decision making. To stop the political agenda from undermining fiscal discipline, he advocated that the EU should set up an independent body to monitor and govern the Eurozone's fiscal system. It is easy to ask for such a body, but nearly impossible to set one up in practice that is truly independent. It would be equally as difficult to have a fiscal union, which is really what Weidmann is asking for. Weidmann's protest should therefore be viewed as an attempt at self-exoneration rather than a practical suggestion. In response to the fiscal wiggle room being given to Southern Europe, Weidmann saw the inevitable push for fiscal stimulus that this will enable. With the imminent G7 meeting as a platform for the promotion of growth policies and fiscal stimulus ideas, it was clear to him that the political pressure to let fiscal discipline slide is going to get stronger. Anticipating this attempted fiscal slide, he opined that many nations do not have the fiscal room for a stimulus. In the typical Eurozone half-hearted halfway house approach to fiscal issues, the EU then officially opined that it would revisit the issue in Spain and Portugal in July and Italy in November of this year. Having already been compromised by the Italian leak of the EC letter, the respective cans are on their way to being nudged rather than kicked down the road. In the meantime the "Atlante" model will be applied and will fail for lack of capital funding. At this point Mario Draghi will be on his way back from the beach or wherever he goes to; and will have the banking crisis that is also a sovereign debt crisis to deal with. The EU will also have the crisis that will act as the catalyst for the widening of fiscal union to be pushed through. Faced with a "Summer of Discontent" and upcoming Presidential elections, French policy makers are keen to differentiate themselves from the pervasive wave of fiscal indiscipline emanating from Southern Europe. French ECB Governing Council member Francois Villeroy de Galhau resolutely defended the case for continuing with economic reform. This is an interesting gambit, especially in the face of the waves of industrial action and marches that are springing up in resistance to labour reforms. Evidently the leadership believes that Le Pen's anti-European populism does not fully resonate with French voters. Both President Hollande and his alleged challenger Emmanuel Macron have embraced reform, the latter more than the former. As Hollande earlier backtracked on reform pledges there was increasing pressure on Macron to officially challenge him as a Presidential candidate. With his government and provision of the rule of law under threat, Hollande has been forced to adopt a stronger reformist position. France is being pulled apart by the growing split between Core Europe and the periphery. The French move towards austerity and reform is mirrored in the Netherlands. Finance Minister Dijsselbloem was pleased to report that the deficit had fallen for the first time since 2006. Core Europe is determined to apply economic reform rather than to adopt an additional fiscal stimulus, in addition to the ECB's monetary stimulus. The Core European recovery is therefore going to be slow and painful. Southern Europe has already shown that it can't take this pain; therefore there will have to be a frictional exchange of views some time in the near future between both halves of the Eurozone after a period of market stress that highlights the problem. The ECB's position on fiscal policy is going to come under much deeper scrutiny, as a consequence in the divergence between Core and Southern Europe over budget deficit limits. The ECB's current default position can be found in the minutes of its last Governing Council meeting. The ECB broadly accepts the IMF's proscription of economic reform, low interest rates and fiscal stimulus for stimulating growth. The council also wishes to see the benefits of its current easing coming over time, before considering a new stimulus. Currently, Southern Europe is only focused on fiscal stimulus and low interest rates. Southern Europe and the ECB are conflicted. After the "Summer of Discontent" it will be interesting to see who blinks. French Governing Council member Francois Villeroy de Galhau reflected how conflicted his own country has become, with his own rather equivocal take on the fiscal issue. Rather than recommend fiscal austerity by deficit target breaching nations, he adopted the strategy of a unified European fiscal authority to "coordinate" national fiscal policies. This suggests that the French solution is to promote deeper fiscal integration, in order to allow Southern Europe to avoid fiscal austerity or punishment for fiscal transgression. This solution also allows for a fiscal stimulus at the expense of Core Eurozone taxpayers through fiscal unification. This solution seems unlikely to enthuse the Germans without the application of some enforceable rules on the limits of fiscal transgression. As the "Summer of Discontent" heated up in the Eurozone; neighbouring Switzerland threw a little accelerant onto the flames. Switzerland and its currency have struggled with all the QE going on globally, which has pushed the Swiss Franc up to levels at which the peg to the Euro had to be noisily abandoned. The Swiss have now responded with what seems to be the first genuine pilot scheme for Helicopter Money globally. This comes in the form of an unconditional basic income that will replace existing welfare payments. Since the Swiss are not noted for their poverty, this new fiscal stimulus can only be viewed as Helicopter Money in its purest form. Coming on the heels of the G7's recent directive that unilateral attempts to weaken a currency are out, this Swiss initiative is ingenious and will be copied if G7 fails to come down hard against it. The Swiss are not the only first movers, when it comes to change that you may wish to believe in. The IMF is currently undergoing a phase of deep introspection. Apparently the dawning realization that things still aren't so great for Main Street, whilst Wall Street has benefited greatly from the combination of fiscal austerity and the various forms of global QE, has prompted this introspection. Allegedly the pillars that support Neoliberalism itself are being probed for signs of inherent weakness. In particular the twin pillars of fiscal austerity and open capital accounts, now are viewed as creating instability through the rational process of capital flight in the face of weakening economic activity. The IMF understands that capital flies away from economic train-wrecks and does not return unless the institution can force defaulting governments to mortgage their countries and their political careers to IMF administrators. The rise of populism in the indebted developed nations of Europe has put some meaningful limits on what the IMF can do for the interests of private capital. The IMF now fully embraces debt forgiveness and mitigation for the Greeks; which should by default be extended to rest of the Eurozone's indebted nations. The global clampdown on tax dodging by multi-nationals and multi-millionaires is also on the agenda of G7; so private capital is now on the back foot. The softer gentler IMF approach to economic development issues and the serious debate over Helicopter Money, suggests that the next phase of the fallout from the Credit Crunch is unfolding. Global markets have been managed back from the brink, so that now it is the turn of Main Street to participate in the great liquidity creation. Historical observation shows that when populist economic policies are extended from Wall Street to Main Street, the former overheats and brings down the latter. Only structural reform stands in the way of the next systemic crisis; but the rise of populism and the change at the heart of the IMF suggests that the reformers are going soft. The fiscally integrated European Project is therefore globally underpinned by the shifting intellectual foundation of the IMF and the threat of populism from within.
