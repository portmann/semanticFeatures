How To Invest In The Indian Stock Market - Part 5 | Seeking Alpha India's infrastructure will require $1 trillion in investment in the coming 5 years. The new government has announced reforms to restart Indiaâ€™s stalled infrastructure sector. The Indian economy is undergoing major structural reforms with the advent of development oriented Modi government. While I have already explained my rationale for the rise of the long term India bull market in an earlier series , this series concentrates on how to actually make money from this long term bull market. I have already covered the technology, pharmaceutical, energy, automobile and defense sectors in earlier articles. This article will focus on the infrastructure sector. The infrastructure is a very broad one since it includes power, roads, railways, construction and ports sector. I am going to touch on the macro level themes with some key companies, before going into a deep dive into each of the sub-sectors in latter articles. India's per capita income is quite low at $1500, which is way behind that of Brazil, China and Russia. One of the major reasons for the extremely low per capita income is the lack of basic infrastructure. A large section of Indians do not have access to roads and power, despite almost 60 years of independence. This forces many of them to lead a subsistence lifestyle. The last government made a mess of things with confused policy and endemic corruption. The new government is trying to put things back on track with massive investments planned in all major sectors. Current Situation of the infrastructure sector India's current situation is quite bad, with most large infrastructure companies groaning under the load of massive debt. A lot of the issues are due to bad government policy and execution. The companies also contributed to this situation, through aggressive and non-realistic bids in power and construction tenders. Widespread corruption also played a big role for the current woeful situation. The problems in the infrastructure sector has also affected the financial sector, with most government owned banks being forced to deal with large NPAs of the infrastructure sector. This has reduced credit growth to the economy. What has been changed by the new government The new government has tried to kick start the infrastructure sector through a number of steps: Creation of an infrastructure fund - In the last budge announcement, India's finance minister announced the creation of a new Rs 20,000 crores (~$3 billion) infrastructure fund. This fund will leverage its equity to raise debt and invest in infra projects. Tax free bonds were also allowed to be raised for investing in road, railways and irrigation projects. Increased investment in Railways - The government is allowing the private sector to invest in railway projects. Indian Railways have been used as a populist tool by politicians, with ministers announcing new trains to their constituencies. The Indian Railways also runs schools and hospitals which makes no sense. This time the Railways Minister announced no populist decisions, but ways to increase the investment capacity by hiking freight fares and allowing private sector to invest through PPP (Public Private Partnerships). Smart Cities Plan - The government wants to improve the conditions of India's unplanned and congested cities. It plans to develop 100 Smart Cities in India . The smart cities would have integrated and efficient transport, utilities and communications networks. These cities would also be fueled by clean energy and recycle most of their waste. Existing cities would be retrofitted and redeveloped. Reforms in coal mining - The government has recently executed a reverse auction of coal mines for coal consumers. The monopoly of "Coal India' has been broken by the government, by taking advantage of a Supreme Court order canceling all coal mine allocations to private sector players. The government has managed to allocate mines in an extremely short time frame. It has also pushed Coal India to increase production and the state owned monolith has increased its production by more than 10% in April. Subsidies for idle gas powered plants - A large number of power plants based on gas were built in the last 5 years. These plants were built due to a huge gas discovery in India's eastern offshore basin. However, the supplies did not materialize leading to many of these gas plants lying idle. The government has proposed a new policy in which it will subsidize imported LNG to run these plants. The government has also taken a number of other steps to promote infrastructure investment. The "Make in India" policy is one such broader initiative that will help the infra companies. Infrastructure companies are in a bad shape - Most of India's infrastructure companies have failed to recover, despite a strong Indian stock market rally. A large number of these companies (GMR, JP Associates, Punj Lloyd, Reliance Power, Tata Power etc.) are so highly indebted that the market sees little prospects for them to recover. It will take time for these companies to become healthy again through deleveraging. A new set of companies will need to take up the mantle, as the government does not have the resources or the capability to develop India's infrastructure. Slow reforms - The government has a large role to play in the infrastructure sector, which makes these stocks risky. The government has been trying very hard to pass a land acquisition bill, which would make it easier to acquire land for public infrastructure projects. However, the opposition has labeled this reform as an "anti-farmer". The last government has passed a land bill, which made acquiring land almost impossible even for legitimate uses. The new government is trying hard to correct the mistakes of the old one, but it is taking time. There are hardly any Indian infrastructure company listed on the USA stock market, however there is a dedicated Indian infrastructure ETF (NYSEARCA: INXX ). The value of this ETF has almost halved over the last 5 years and is now a good value buy. Investors can also look to directly invest in the Indian stock market by taking positions in fundamentally strong infra companies such as L&T and Thermax. Some of the ETFs that you could look to invest to take advantage are: EGShares India Small Cap ETF (NYSEARCA: SCIN ) There are also many small construction, power and port stocks but investing in them is fraught with risks due to corporate governance and debt issues. India has a huge need for infrastructure in almost every field such as roads, railways, ports, power, etc. It will require almost a trillion dollars of investment , to allow India to grow its GDP in the high single digits. India's project management and execution has been quite bad compared to China. Most large infrastructure projects see large cost and time overruns, due to regulatory clearances and problems in land acquisition. The government knows that infrastructure creation is essential for development and is solving the main issues. I think that good infrastructure companies will see a lot of growth in the coming years, as investment picks up. The competition for these companies would also be lower as weaker companies do not have the capability to invest in new projects.
