U.S. Growth Will Come From The 65+ Age Group: Healthcare Is How To Play It | Seeking Alpha Sep.  1, 2015  6:29 PM ET  |  Includes: CURE , FHLC , FXH , HQH , IYH , RXD , RXL , RYH , THQ , VHT , XLV by: Jason Tillberg One of the most significant changes taking place in the American economic landscape are the rising number of people aged 65+. Spending patterns change dramatically for this age group as they retire. Healthcare spending will continue to be the biggest beneficiary of this age groups growth. Over the next 5 years, it is estimated that the total number of Americans that will be 65 and over will rise from 46,790,727 to 54,631,891 for an increase of 16.76%. That's an additional 7.841 million Americans that will be in the age group of 65+ in 5 years time. Per the Bureau of Labor Statistics consumer spending survey , which can show household spending by the age of the head of the household, we can get an idea of the spending cycle of a person by their age: The mean annual household spending per year per the source from the BLS above is $51,933. Households where the head is of the age 65+, the mean spending is $42,557. That is an 18.02% decrease from the mean. By far, the biggest deviation in spending to the plus side is in the area of healthcare spending. Mean healthcare spending per household is $3,919. The 65+ households spends $5,439 or 38.79% more than the mean. In the aggregate U.S. economy, personal consumption expenditures on healthcare have reached $2.044 trillion annualized as of the second quarter of 2015. Healthcare spending as a percent of personal consumption expenditure is now about 16.74%. (Personal consumption spending makes up 68.2% of GDP.) What is particular about healthcare spending as a percent of total personal consumption expenditure is that during every recession shown in this chart, healthcare spending holds and actually bumps up as a percent of overall consumer spending. I would then predict that as we enter the next recession, healthcare spending will continue to hold up, especially in light of the age demographics, and rise again. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , they forecast that during the period 2014-2024: For 2014-24, health spending is projected to grow at an average rate of 5.8 percent per year (4.9 percent on a per capita basis). Health spending is projected to grow 1.1 percent faster than Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per year over this period; as a result, the health share of GDP is expected to rise from 17.4 percent in 2013 to 19.6 percent by 2024. I think the best way to play this sector and these trends is to do two things: Dollar cost average. Buy a set amount of money worth each month of a healthcare stock or stocks that you like. Also, healthcare sector ETFs would work too. With a recession sure to come in the coming quarters or years, at some point, stock market volatility should, as it usually does, become violent. Rather than be discouraged by the down swings in share prices, by dollar cost averaging, you can rejoice at the opportunities to buy more shares for the same amount of money you decide to invest each month. Reinvest the dividends. Many healthcare stocks pay dividends, so long term investors should take advantage of those dividends and reinvest in more shares too. By sticking with the large healthcare stocks with proven franchise value, your risks should be reduced by both dollar cost averaging and reinvesting your dividends. The Health Care Select Spider SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA: XLV ) has over $16 billion in net assets. It's top 10 holdings include: Favorable demographics should be a wind at the back of the healthcare sector over the next 5-10 years. With market valuations a concern right now, the strategy of dollar cost averaging for investors with a 10 year+ time horizon allows the investor to continually pick up shares at lower prices if and when the markets sell off in the years ahead.
