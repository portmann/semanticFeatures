WSI Industries Remains An Undervalued Microcap Opportunity - WSI Industries Inc. (NASDAQ:WSCI) | Seeking Alpha Most recent quarterly earnings best since Q4 2012. Company continues to generate significant cash flow well above reported net income. Opportunity for significant price appreciation given company's growth prospects, low P/E, and favorable valuation relative to net book value and working capital. WSI Industries (NASDAQ: WSCI ) is a contract manufacturing company based in Monticello, Minnesota and provides precision contract machining for various markets including recreational vehicles, energy, aerospace and defense, and automotive. I have written previous articles on the company and believe that despite disappointing stock price performance over the past year, the company's recent quarterly performance combined with its cheap valuation provide investors with an outstanding opportunity in the microcap space. Below I will more fully describe the multiple factors that investors should consider when analyzing WSCI as a potential investment. Recent Quarterly Results: The company recently reported its fiscal 2015 second quarter results. Revenues of $11.7M for the quarter reached a record for the company, up 12% vs. the fiscal 2014 second quarter, while earnings were $0.15/diluted share, up 76% vs. $0.09/diluted shared in the same quarter last year. The company's major growth driver continues to be its recreational vehicles market (also referred to as "powersports"), which saw a sales increase of 16%. Powersports Customer: Polaris Industries (NYSE: PII ) is the company's only customer in this segment as WSCI continues to capitalize on Polaris' success in the all-terrain vehicles and motorcycles markets. In February, WSCI announced that it had secured another new program for Polaris that required the purchase of three new machining centers in March. In addition, the Indian motorcycle re-introduction by Polaris continues to be a driving factor for WSCI's growth given that they manufacture a key component for that line of motorcycles. Largely due to Polaris' business success combined with WSCI's ability to capture new programs from its top customer, sales to Polaris represented 84% of revenues for the most recent fiscal quarter. Energy Customers: It's been no secret that with recent declines in oil prices, demand for capital equipment is also taking a turn downward. Sales for the quarter in the energy segment were down 21% vs. the fiscal 2014 second quarter and now comprise only 8% of WSCI's revenues. The company's two key customers in this segment, FMC Technologies (NYSE: FTI ) and National Oilwell Varco (NYSE: NOV ), are large players in the oil services industry, and there have been past quarters when WSCI's energy sales have been more than triple the levels of revenues generated in the fiscal 2015 second quarter ($0.9M). The near-term outlook for WSCI's energy businesses is soft, but the company has done an excellent job in generating record overall sales in its most recent quarter even despite the significant decline in the energy segment over the last few years. If and when oil prices begin to strengthen, look for this segment to regain some traction. Until then, this part of WSCI's business is likely to remain less than 10% of its overall revenue stream. Aerospace/Defense and Automotive Customers: Revenue in this segment grew 20% in the most recent quarter when compared against the fiscal 2014 second quarter and remains a key growth opportunity for WSCI. As previously disclosed, the company achieved AS9100 certification less than 2 years ago in order to better attract potential customers in search of certified suppliers in this area. In addition, the company made some meaningful sales in its new automotive market per comments made in its 10-Q filed on April 3. While revenue in this overall segment was only $0.9M and comprised just 8% of the WSCI's sales for the quarter, these markets are key growth opportunities for the company. Gross Margins: The largest percentage of WSCI's costs are classified in its Cost of Products Sold line on its income statement, as this includes all of its input costs, machine operations and maintenance expenses, and salaries of most of its personnel directly involved in its manufacturing operations. On top of its 12% sales growth, earnings were significantly helped in the most recent quarter by quarter-over-quarter gross margin improvement to 14.3% vs. 11.9% in its fiscal 2014 second quarter. The company has seen declines in gross margins ever since undertaking its $3.8M plant expansion that doubled its manufacturing space, and the recent 10-Q filing indicates that margins in the most recent quarter were helped by a lower level of fixed manufacturing costs as a percentage of sales. Thus, as sales continue to increase, gross margins should also be positively impacted going forward. At current revenue levels, every 1% of gross margin increase would help quarterly net income improve by about $0.025/share per quarter, or $0.10/share annually. Even with a P/E ratio of 10, this alone could result in a $1/share increase in the price of the stock per 1% of gross margin increase. Strong Balance Sheet: Even with significant spend on machines and the plant expansion over the last several years, the company's balance sheet remains strong. As of the end of the company's fiscal 2015 second quarter, its net book value was $4.68/share, and WSCI's current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) was a very healthy 2.73. Net working capital is now $3.01/share, which represents nearly 50% of the stock's current valuation. After peaking at $10.2M following the completion of its plant expansion during fiscal 2013, long-term debt is down to $8.1M as of the end of the fiscal 2015 second quarter. Even with this level of debt, the company is well positioned to make its debt payments timely given its current level of business and cash reserves (as further discussed in the Cash Flow Generation section below). Dividend Yield: WSCI has paid a $0.04/share quarterly dividend since 2010, and this provides a steady payout for value-oriented investors seeking income. At a recent stock price of about $6/share, the dividend yield is 2.7% annually. Given the company's ability to generate cash, the current dividend level is quite safe and could potentially be increased if the company can consistently post strong earnings in future quarters. Attractive Valuation: The company sports a price/earnings ratio about 14 based upon its trailing 12-month earnings per share of $0.42 at a recent $6/share stock price. Given that year-to-date earnings through the first half of fiscal 2015 were $0.21/share in conjunction with the $0.15/share reported in the most recent quarter, full year fiscal 2015 earnings could approach or even exceed $0.50/share if the company can continue to report strong earnings for the second half of the fiscal year at similar levels to its most recent quarter. WSCI sports a market cap of around $17M and only has 2.9M shares outstanding. Given its low float, even small increases in volume can generate meaningful moves in the company's stock price. As the company continues to grow and post increased sales and earnings, this low float could certainly work to an investor's favor. Cash Flow Generation: Perhaps the most meaningful indication of WSCI's current financial health is through the analysis of its cash flow. The company has invested heavily in its facility and equipment over the past 4 years (to the tune of about $12M). Minimal capital expenditures have been needed for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 year-to-date, and the result has been a substantial generation of cash at its current business level. Ignoring changes in working capital for receivables, payables, and inventories (which can fluctuate quarter to quarter but aren't a meaningful part of this cash flow analysis), WSCI has generated $2.15/share in cash from operations ($6.3M) for the last 6 quarters on a cumulative basis, including $0.38/share for the fiscal 2015 second quarter. Over this same 18-month time period, working capital is up $2.8M even while debt has declined $2.1M. The company did purchase a machine during the most recent quarter for $274K and reported a future third quarter 2015 expenditure of $1.1M for 3 machining centers as previously mentioned, all of which were financed by debt with low interest rates. Over the next 2 fiscal years, the company's debt obligations average $0.47/share per year, which is about 1/3 of the cash flow from operations that WSCI is capable of generating at current business levels. More specifically, the company is liable for $3.5M of debt payments through fiscal 2017, and $5.8M payments are required in 2018 and thereafter. Given these debt service requirements, WSCI has sufficient free cash flow to further invest in its business or pursue shareholder initiatives such as a stock buyback or an increased dividend payout. Additional business capture will likely result in further capital equipment purchases, which will either draw from cash or require incurring additional debt. However, investors should be mindful that the completed manufacturing space expansion significantly facilitates the company's ability to grow even well beyond its current level of sales. Continuing Growth: After reporting fiscal 2015 first quarter results with flat sales and lower earnings relative to its fiscal 2014 first quarter, WSCI's CEO Ben Rashleger stated that sales would increase in coming quarters based upon customer forecasts and backlogs. WSCI delivered on this outlook with a strong fiscal 2015 second quarter as previously discussed. In its most recent earnings release, Mr. Rashleger stated the following: "As oil prices continue to hover at historically low levels, it has impacted the demand our customers receive for their products, and their demand to WSI for the parts we supply to them. We anticipate that our energy business will continue to be soft in the coming months, and that it will remain so until the energy market has stabilized and investment returns. However, we also anticipate that our powersports business will continue to be strong, and that this strength will outweigh any decline in our energy business in the short term. We continue to expand our efforts on diversifying our business. While it is our goal to add new business in other industries to offset the dominance of our powersports business, we are pleased that powersports continues its growth and that we have also been able to increase the number of programs that we supply." This statement implies that investors should continue to anticipate growth in the coming quarters given strength and business expansion with its key customer Polaris, even despite weakness in the energy segment. As disclosed in its February 20 press release regarding a new long-term agreement with Polaris, the new program recently awarded will also support additional growth going forward. Conclusion: The company has grown its sales from $18.8M in fiscal 2009 to $42.7M in fiscal 2014. However, earnings growth has not been as consistent for the company given periods of significant investment for plant expansion and new programs. Strong results for the fiscal 2014 second quarter in conjunction with positive comments from the CEO should give investors optimism that the company can continue to report solid earnings in the coming quarters. The company is also generating substantial cash, has proven its ability to capitalize on business opportunities, and has significant capacity to further grow following its plant expansion in 2013. Even despite these positive factors, the stock continues to trade near its 52-week low, giving investors what I believe is a golden opportunity to achieve significant capital appreciation while earning a consistent dividend with further room to grow. WSCI's biggest business risk continues to be that its largest customer represents 80%+ of its revenue stream, but continued strength in Polaris' business combined with WSCI's ability to capture additional new programs in its other markets would help mitigate this risk. The recurring dividend, combined with the growth prospects described, continue to make WSI Industries an attractive investment opportunity for value-oriented investors seeking growth and income.
