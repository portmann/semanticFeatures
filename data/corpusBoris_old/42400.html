Obama: We’re All for the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank - Real Time Economics - WSJ President Barack Obama, at a joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said the U.S. did not oppose a new infrastructure bank led by China. (Getty Images) The U.S. never opposed a new China-led infrastructure bank, President Barack Obama said Tuesday, challenging a common narrative that Beijing out-maneuvered Washington by persuading key U.S. allies to sign up as founding members. â€œWe’re all for itâ€? if the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank incorporates strong financial, social and environmental safeguards, Mr. Obama said. The administration was dealt an embarrassing political blow when the U.K., Germany, France and a host of other Western nations snubbed requests by Washington officials to sit out membership in the AIIB amid questions over the new institutionâ€™s standards. The diplomatic bruising renewed questions about whether the U.S. is losing its economic clout in the world. â€œLet me be very clear and dispel this notion that we were opposed or are opposed to other countries participating in the Asia infrastructure bank,â€? he said at a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. â€œThat is simply not true.â€? He suggested Washingtonâ€™s position is more nuanced. â€œOur simple point to everybody in these conversations around the Asian infrastructure bank is, let’s just make sure that we’re running it based on best practices,â€? Mr. Obama said. In fact, the administration has said it wants to cooperate with the AIIB to ensure the new institution develops strong standards, a message it has promulgated for months. The White House and Treasury Department officials say the new bank could help address a dearth of infrastructure financing needed in the coming years, especially in Asia. More roads, bridges, ports, railroads and airports are widely seen as key to spurring growth in the worldâ€™s most populous region. â€œThey can grow more rapidly and thatâ€™s good for everybody,â€? Mr. Obama said. â€œWe want more markets to be able to get our goods in and sell our services that are some of the best in the world.â€? But, as the World Bank has learned , strong financing and social safeguards can help prevent government corruption and abuse . If the Asian infrastructure bank is being set up with healthy safeguards, â€œin a way that ultimately is actually gonna lead to good infrastructure and benefit the borrowing countries, then we’re all for it,â€? Mr. Obama said. â€œBut if it’s not run well, then it could be a negative thing,â€? he added. â€œAnd what we don’t want to do is just be participating in something and providing cover for an institution that does not end up doing right by its people.â€?
