U.S. Manufacturing Sector Strengthens In June | Seeking Alpha The US manufacturing sector expanded in June with ISM manufacturing index showing a reading of 53.5, the highest in five months. Last month reading was 52.8; Current month print is more than what market was expecting. Higher reading was driven by better Employment Index, which increased to 55.5 in June. Non-farm sector might have seen job addition of 250,000 in June; Unemployment could be 5.4-5.5%. Latest weekly jobless claims data could print 265-275k. Data released by the Institute for Supply Management showed that the US manufacturing sector had a good run in June 2015 - with ISM manufacturing index showing a reading of 53.5, the highest in five months. Last month reading was 52.8, and the current month print is more than what market was expecting. The higher reading compared to the previous month was driven by better Employment Index, which increased from 51.7 in May, to 55.5 in June. May 2015 saw employers adding 280,000 jobs in the non-farm sector. The current ISM reading points to continued improvement in the employment data. We are forecasting a non-farm payroll addition of 250,000 for the month of June, while unemployment could be 5.4%-5.5%, with more people starting to re-join the labour force, as employment situations improve. Four of the five broad indices in ISM manufacturing index showed expansion. But the only disappointment was weakness in supplier deliveries - showing contraction with a reading of 48.8 - lowest in 3 years, and the first instance of contraction since October 2012. Drilling further down into the supplier deliveries data, we see that the contraction was caused by fall in the order backlog with the index dropping to 47 - the lowest in five months. This might be pointing to some weakness for the US factories going forward. New export orders continued to be on the border line, as the global economy - especially China - continuing to face headwinds in economic growth. This shows that the improvement in June was helped primarily by domestic demand. We have seen consumers in the US continuing to increase spending. Source: St.Louis Fed , U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis Data released by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on last Thursday showed that nominal consumer spending rose 0.9% month-on-month in May 2015 - the highest monthly change since August 2009. The higher reading was led by increased spending for goods - both durable and non-durable - rising by 2% MoM. Services spending continued to print stable set of numbers at 0.3% MoM. Real spending also grew 0.6% MoM - the highest in 9 months. Real spending was driven mainly by higher spending in durable goods, that rose 2.3% MoM, while core spending increased 0.5% MoM. We expect continuation of increase in spending in June as well. Jobs data to be released on Thursday and international trade data on July 7th will give a clearer picture of the strength of the US economy. We are expecting the jobs data to show that 250,000 non-farm payrolls were added during June, while unemployment remained mostly the same. Weekly jobless claims data is also due on Thursday - we expect the weekly numbers to be in the range of 265-275k, and continuing jobless claims to remain around 2.2 million. Hence these data releases could further strengthen the case for a US Fed lift-off by September, if we also see sustained wage increases - especially as the US job market starts approaching full employment levels.
