Why Consumers Continue To Spend In High Tax Inflation Environment | Seeking Alpha State and local taxes have almost doubled real wage growth over last 15 years. Low commodities prices have hidden the impact of tax inflation. Real wages (adjusted for inflation) have been about the same for over 40 years. Some of my colleagues were recently talking about the impact rising state and local taxes will have on consumers, as tax inflation at those levels have about doubled the pace of wage and salary growth since 2000. Not having looked at the figures in a long time, I decided to confirm their assertions, and found they were in fact true. State and local taxes have jumped 75 percent since 2000, while wages and salaries have only grown at a 38 percent pace during the same period of time. So over the last 15 years wages have struggled to keep up with inflation while taxes have soared, leading to the question of why consumers have tended to continue spending over the last several years under those less than optimal conditions, and how long that will continue as disposable income shrinks. State and local governments under pressure One of the reasons governments are under pressure is from the pension promises which simply can't be fulfilled. So far the majority of governments haven't been willing to take the steps to cut back on government expenditures, so at the state and local level taxes are going to continue to rise until they no longer are allowed to. At the same time, data show wages remain stagnant in the U.S., and that combination means there will be less money for consumers to spend in the years ahead. It will hit hardest when the economy reverses direction. The major takeaway here is governments and their representatives haven't felt the pain enough yet to make the hard decisions they'll inevitably have to. That means higher taxes for now. It also means less spending money for consumers. Shrinking household income means less cash to spend. That's been the past and it will be the future. Since that's true, why hasn't consumer spending dried up? Why consumers haven't felt the pain of higher taxes lately has been because of the deflationary commodity market, which has lowered prices on a lot of goods, with the most visible and obvious being the price of gasoline. Lower natural gas prices have also played a major part in that. Just with those two commodities consumers get the sense of having more money to spend, even though higher taxes has been eroding their buying power. That's because they can see and feel it immediately, as they are right there in the open to see when pumping gas or paying a monthly bill. The higher U.S. dollar also plays a part there, helping lower the cost of imports. Exports are another matter in regard to the dollar, but that isn't as important to consumers in the U.S. What's happening is similar to how retailers market to consumers. There are a few items that are consistently acquired by consumers they know the price on. They make sure on those items are very competitive, otherwise they go to a competitor. Commodities are similar. What is more visible than oil and gas prices? Consumers understand these and how they relate to their economic lives. When the prices on these are down, it gives them the sense of having more money to spend, and recently they have been. When gas and oil prices rise again, it will be one of the catalysts that puts downward pressure on consumer spending, as low prices have masked the impact of rising tax inflation for years. As almost everyone knows, U.S. wages and salaries have been stagnant for some time. Real household income has fallen 8.5 percent since 2000, while state and local taxes have soared. You don't need a calculator to tell you this isn't an economic environment that lends itself to robust consumer spending. In 2015 it has been tepid at best, with some attributing it to bad weather and others to consumers paying down debt. Very few are tying it into tax inflation yet, but that association will eventually be made. Again, that will happen when commodities rise in price. Another important point is real wages, meaning after adjusted for inflation, peaked over 40 years ago, according to Pew Research . That means a larger paycheck may give the semblance of wage growth, but when measured against inflation, it hasn't improved for over 40 years. Inflation is always the hidden catalyst consumers don't take into account, and why they don't understand why their wages may be increasing but their buying power isn't. There are several elements investors must consider when analyzing the impact they'll have on consumer spending, which determines the health of the U.S. economy. Declining consumer spending will bring about a recession. It's as simple as that. State and local taxes is the major metric to watch on the inflation side, as they're scrambling to find ways to maintain their government programs while facing enormous pension liabilities. Eventually they'll have to cut expenses, but that time hasn't arrived yet. That means more tax inflation in the near future. On the economic side, commodities and general inflation have helped mask the wage stagnation, as even when wages are increased, buying power lessens. The key there will be the jump in commodities, with the major two being gas and oil price increases. Once that happens consumers will cut back on spending, and pay more attention to why they are getting pinched. That's when tax increases will be scrutinized more. Once supply adjustments are made by the gas and oil industry, prices will start to rise again, consumers will have less disposable income, and they will start to tighten their spending. For now consumers will continue to spend, but I don't think austerity is that far away.
