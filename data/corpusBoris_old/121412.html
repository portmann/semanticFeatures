Chefs' Warehouse: The Little Engine That Couldn't - A Story Of Unsustainable Growth - Chefs' Warehouse (NASDAQ:CHEF) | Seeking Alpha The Chefs’ Warehouse has primarily grown through acquisitions fueled by a substantial amount of debt. Management is essentially gambling leverage on its ability to make these business profitable, but has only managed to achieve around a 6% EBITDA increase since fiscal year 2009. The Chefs’ Warehouse is overvalued at a 37.5 P/E TTM ratio. Given management’s inability to grow organically and its substantial indebtedness, I would expect the share price to hit the high single digits to low teens at the very minimum. Leverage is like wind. You have a fire. You want the fire to burn brighter, so you apply a little wind. The fire grows brighter. You get excited, so you blow a little harder. The fire grows a little brighter. And then poof, it goes out. Your fire just went out because of too much wind. Or, in The Chefs' Warehouse's (NASDAQ: CHEF ) case, because of too much leverage. A food company groaning under the weight of its enormous amount of indebtedness, The Chef's Warehouse's stock has a substantial amount of potential downside. The little engine that could is about to find out the hard way when it can't. Serving the needs of chefs, The Chefs' Warehouse is a distributor of specialty food products in the US and Canada. The company boasts an enormous portfolio of 31,800 SKUs across many different food platforms (e.g. cooking oils, butter, eggs, milk, flour, center-of-the-plate proteins, staple broadline food products, chocolate, etc.) that it obtains from quite a few suppliers, including a number of international ones. To give you an idea of just how expansive its portfolio is, The Chefs' Warehouse states that it offers 160 different varieties of olive oil. It claims that its diverse portfolio of food products is one of its key competitive advantages, and it strives to be a "one-stop shop" for its customers. All of these acquisitions served as bolt-on additions to its product portfolio. For instance, Euro Gourmet operated in the Italian food and seafood product market. Allen Brothers distributes premium meats. Qzina specializes in gourmet chocolates and pastries. Queensgate served to bolster the Michael's acquisition, which distributes center-of-the-plate proteins. To fund these acquisitions, the company dove deep into the bankers' pockets. The charts below detail the amount and type of funding for each acquisition. As you can see, a substantial amount of funding came from debt, mostly its revolving credit facility. As of its latest 10-Q, the company's debt to equity ratio was 1.51, more than 1.5 times the industry average of 0.9 (taken from Morningstar.com). In total, the amount of debt outstanding is $144.3M. Even worse, this substantial indebtedness only includes $2.6M from the company's revolving credit facility, from which it can borrow up to $140M. This means that its debt could increase by another $132.6M, according to its most recent 10-Q. Given the company's focus on expanding its portfolio of products and its past history of borrowing from its revolving credit facility, investors can expect its debt levels to continue to increase. And as we know, as debt levels go up, restrictions on capital allocation begin to crop up, encroaching on management's freedom to take on potentially profitable projects. You may be asking, so what? If the company is profitable, then does leveraging up matter? While it certainly is true that leverage can enhance returns, the opposite can certainly happen as well with leverage driving companies into the ground. While attractive revenue growth rates have been posted by the company, upon closer expansion, it appears that most of its growth has come from its acquisitions. In reality, organic growth accounts for very little of its total growth, as detailed in the chart below. As you can see, while total net sales increased dramatically over the past several years, reaching as much as 40% in fiscal year 2013, organic growth only breached 10.0% once in fiscal year 2011. Since fiscal year 2010, as least part of the company's growth has come from acquisitions. It is essentially betting millions of dollars on its ability to grow its operations large enough to sustain the amount of debt it has taken on. However, in doing so, the company created a catch-22 for itself. In order to attain profitability to pay back its creditors, the company will need freedom and flexibility to take on profitable projects, but its creditors will not allow it to do so. Just a cursory glance at the company's latest 10-K will present several pages of financial, affirmative, and negative covenants that it is chained to. The numbers don't lie, either. ROIC has steadily declined since fiscal year 2012, peaking at 14.5% and shrinking to 6.9% in fiscal year 2014. ROE has also dropped like a rock, plummeting from 46.2% in fiscal year 2012 to 10.2% in fiscal year 2014. Gross and operating margins have also suffered, declining from 26.3% and 4.92% in fiscal year 2012 to 24.63% and 3.95% in fiscal year 2014, respectively. The company's interest coverage ratio is a measly 4.0 in comparison to the industry average's whopping 282.0, clear evidence of its substantial indebtedness. It is obvious that management has not done a spectacular job with the money it has borrowed. Furthermore, many of the company's acquisitions had problems. In both the Qzina and Michael's acquisitions, it had disputes with the sellers in regards to working capital and inventory. Many of the business that were bought did not achieve the performance metrics that the company expected. As this company is still in its early stages, I projected a DCF model for ten years to value The Chefs' Warehouse. Base case sales growth was projected to grow from 6.5%, which is in-line with the company's historical EBITDA growth, to 8.3% in fiscal year 2020, whereupon it would gradually decline throughout fiscal year 2025. Management case and worst case assumptions were variations of the above theme. Gross margins were expected to improve gradually until fiscal year 2020, upon which they would begin to deteriorate slowly until fiscal year 2025. As the company includes all of its operating expenses in the "Other Expenses" category, there were no SG&A or R&D categories. Other expenses as a percentage of net sales were expected to worsen throughout fiscal year 2020, upon which they would improve throughout fiscal year 2025. This is due to the method of growth the company has chosen, namely growth through acquisitions, which I predict it will continue to use in the long-term. D&A, taxes, and capex were held constant at 1.0%, 42.0%, and 3.0%, which are all in-line with historical values. Working capital was expected to change at a linear rate. To calculate the WACC, a relatively high after-tax cost of debt of 4.6% was used due to the highly leveraged nature of the company's capital structure. Combined with a cost of equity of 9.9% (including a small-cap size premium), this calculation yielded a WACC of 8.7%. Running a sensitivity analysis by varying the exit multiple and WACC by 1.0x and 1.0% in both directions respectively yielded a base case implied share price range of $3.00 - $8.00. This results in a potential downside of around 75% from the market share price. Even in the management case, in which sales growth was projected higher than the base case and margins were expected to improve faster, the sensitivity analysis yielded an implied share price range of $3.25 - $8.50, a downside of around 75%. While most of the evidence points screams that the stock is a short candidate, management does seem to be taking some steps to improving the business. Since fiscal year 2009, the percentage of products making up the center-of-the-plate category in the company's sales mix has grown from 21.4% to 37.2% in fiscal year 2014 as a result of its acquisitions. Management claims that center-of-the-plate products generate as much as 3x the revenue of other products, so there is the potential for sales to increase faster than expected. The company has also mentioned that is has invested heavily into technology to decrease operating expenses, so margins could also improve more than expected. The Chefs' Warehouse is the little engine that couldn't. Burdened with debt and lackluster acquisitions, I believe it is highly doubtful that management has the capability to drive higher organic growth. With a P/E TTM ratio of 37.5 in comparison to the industry average of 27.6 (taken from Morningstar.com), the stock is overvalued as well. Given the unproven ability of management to make this company profitable and its substantial indebtedness, my view is that management is essentially gambling on the business it has acquired. I would expect the share price to hit the high single digits to low teens at the very minimum in the long term.
