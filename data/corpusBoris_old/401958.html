Federal Intervention: The Source Of Systemic Risk Or The Solution? The Banks | Seeking Alpha The second installment of a discussion of Dodd Frankâ€™s likely perverse effect on the banking system. The intent of Dodd Frank is to end Federal bail-outs of financial institutions. Slip sliding away. Slip sliding away. The Dodd Frank Act presumes the proper role of government in management of financial crises is prevention of bank failure. Government should not be in the business of bailing out banks, says the Act. Historical evidence suggests the contrary. This is a second of a series of articles refuting these two pillars of Dodd Frank. Government restrictions have been the primary source of systemic risk and crises in banking since 1970. Only Government can resolve the inevitable crises resulting from systemic risk. And systemic risk cannot be predicted in advance. It is often the unintended effect of government regulation of banks. This second article focuses on post-Depression banking regulation. We consider how bank regulation contributed to creation of financial crises and how it was essential in resolving them. Government may be in the process of creating the next financial crisis right now. And government will necessarily bail out the banks once more. The Dodd Frank regulations are slowly choking the large banks [Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ), Citigroup (NYSE: C ), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ), and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC )] a slowly to death, and doing no favors for the major regionals as well. While the evidence is quite strong that government interference in the market for housing finance is the fundamental source of housing-based crises as we argue here , the evidence that government regulation of banking is the fundamental source of financial crises within the banking sector is weaker. In particular, it is unreasonable to lay the Crisis of 2007-2008 at the feet of federal regulation. The trading banks certainly have substantial culpability in magnifying what began as a housing finance policy-generated crisis. The role of the government in the genesis of crises in the banking system is both less prominent and subtler than the government role in housing finance. The reasons for government's lower profile in creating crisis through its direct involvement in the banking system are these: The government is less involved in the banking system than in the housing market. The mistakes of government in bank regulation have been restrictions on banks, not subsidies. It is useful to separate the banking crises since 1970 into two types. Crises that were the result of rapid credit expansion. Crises that were the result of an unexpected collapse in asset values due to a change in energy prices. Crises that were the result of rapid credit expansion were associated with housing once again. But there is plenty of blame to go around in the two housing crises for financial institutions regulators. The Housing Agencies don't take all the blame. The Savings and Loan Crisis began in 1986 and came to its bitter end around 1995. In part, at its outset, the bank regulations contributing to this crisis were federal restrictions on deposit rates and on restrictions upon the ability of the S&Ls to diversify out of housing. In other words, the weaknesses of the S&Ls were a result of their mandate to stimulate housing investment only. Later, the crisis deepened as the government panicked. Aware that most S&Ls were insolvent, the government opened the floodgates on both sides of S&L balance sheets, de-regulating deposit rates and permitting expansion of S&Ls' borrower base beyond residential finance, without the credit discipline applied to ordinary commercial banks by the FDIC. The result was massive collapse. There is an important lesson of this crisis that the framers of Dodd Frank didn't learn. This crisis had nothing whatever to do with the size of banks. It had everything to do with the similarity of banks. The Savings and Loans were not Too Big to Fail. They were Too Similar to Fail. They were many and small. And they were similar because they were creatures of government. S&L Crisis Resolution: There is no question that the government had an inevitable role in the bail-out of the S&L crisis. There were no stockholders to speak of, since the S&Ls were, for the most part, mutually held. Thus the private sector could not have shouldered the burden of the financial collapse. As the S&L crisis entered its desperate second phase, the wrong kind of investors were invited in, usually appearing without sufficient assets to avoid bail-outs. As a result, there was no alternative to a government bailout. In a footnote, the government's protection of financial derivatives first reared its ugly head during the S&L crisis. Knowing that the investment banks had no capital to absorb the multitude of interest rate derivatives that they had irresponsibly entered with weak S&Ls, and that these investment banks could not have withstood failed derivatives payment, and also learning the important and unfortunate lesson that, absent government coercion, a derivatives position cannot be transferred, the regulators became the world's largest derivatives dealer until the S&L's old derivatives expired. The 2007-2008 Crisis. This brings us to the last and most significant of the crises - the Crisis of 2007-2008. But except for the contribution of government housing policy to this crisis, there is no real sense in which the government can be held accountable, unless you hang the proliferation of financial derivatives on the government. Even if you blame government for the abuses that occurred in derivatives markets that added fuel to the fires that burned during the crisis, it was not government restrictions, but government permissiveness that was at fault. At bottom the excesses that led to the Crisis of 2007-2008 do support the actions of Dodd Frank. Crises Resulting for unexpected collapse in asset values due to falling energy prices. The Texas Banking Crisis and Continental. This is the second of the three major financial crises since the Depression in the United States. It was driven by the collapsing price of oil. But the government's role in the crisis was again government restriction on the ability of banks to diversify. Both Texas and Illinois were unit banking states (each bank could have only one branch). Unit banking did not prevent banks from growing, but it severely limited their retail deposit bases, making them dependent on "hot" CDs and brokered deposits. Loans to the oil patch were concentrated in the hands of the Texas unit banks and Continental, although other banks (for example Seafirst) were damaged without the unit banking excuse when oil prices collapsed. The combined effects of limits on interstate branching and unit branching put the banks in a weak position to withstand credit problems, contributing greatly to their collapse. Texas banks and Continental are bailed out. Again there was no alternative to a federal bail-out. The government owned Continental for a time. The deal that resolved the Texas banks was particularly interesting. The then-named NCNB began its long acquisition spree with a particularly ugly deal with the government. NCNB got all the Texas deposits and took possession of the weak bank assets as well, with the understanding that NCNB could "put" any failing loans to the Feds. This deal fueled the newly christened NationsBank with enough purchasing power to buy Bank of America and Continental, taking the most appealing of the three names - Bank of America. Once again it was not the size of the banks that was the key, although the Continental bail-out gave birth to the notion that size was a factor in the government's intervention. In reality the size of the crisis far exceeded that of Continental. The oil-patch collapses were driven by government unit branching regulations that, once again, made these banks Too Similar to Fail. Conclusion. The most common single source of financial crises is government policies that have resulted in banks exposed to similar risks, not banks that are simply big. A system characterized by many similar banks is inevitably a system where a problem for one is a problem for many. Is the Federal government, by requiring the banks to meet so many restrictions in implementation of Dodd Frank, creating a system of clones, and thus increasing systemic risk? We will consider that likelihood in the next article. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
