Papa Murphy's: Going The Wrong Direction, Bull Thesis Breaking - Papa Murphy's Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:FRSH) | Seeking Alpha FRSH's pitch is that it is a fast growing, asset-light franchiser. The truth is FRSH's real growth, as measured by SSS, has been poor, while it is becoming increasingly an "asset-heavy" and low margin business. Papa Murphy's (NASDAQ: FRSH ) is the largest franchiser and operator of "take and bake" pizzas, selling pizzas which customers cook at home. The company IPO'ed in May 2014. The company's pitch is that it is a fast growing, asset-light franchiser so it deserves a large multiple like those enjoyed by Dunkin' Brands (NASDAQ: DNKN ) and Domino's (NYSE: DPZ ). The problem, as we shall see, is that FRSH is neither fast growing nor asset-light. In the past, FRSH was a popular short due to the brewing discontent among some of its franchisees. For those who are not in the know, here is a good Forbes article on the topic. As a result, the stock languished and the shorts piled on. Then FRSH posted way-above-expectation 8.4% SSS numbers in Q4, and coupled with positive mentions by Cramer , shorts got squeezed big time. Shorting FRSH at the beginning of this year would have resulted in over 100% loss by June. It must have been a scary moment for the bears. While the bulls continued to stamped, FRSH's private equity backer sold 36% of its stock in mid June. Beneath the monster Q4 SSS number were signs that the FRSH model is breaking: the company's unit growth is increasingly being driven the company buying out franchisees, and franchise growth remained weak. Q2 2015 really hammered the stock as the bear thesis seems to be playing out. Here is a summary of the key numbers I think caused the stock to fall from $21 in June to $14 currently: The 2 year franchise SSS grew only 5.7% vs. 10.6% for company owned stores. 6 out of 16 news stores owned in Q2 were opened by the company. Franchise royalties increased only 4.7% vs. 33.3% total revenue growth. Franchise base decreased to 1,333 from 1,343 in Q2 2014, reflecting 77 new franchise store openings, 44 franchise store closures, and 43 acquisitions by the company (bears say FRSH is acquiring underperforming, disgruntled franchisees). Capex is expected to increase to $25 million from $23 million, no doubt a reflection of the company becoming increasingly less "asset-light". Putting the above together, fundamental growth as measured by total SSS is only 4% or so while the company's franchise base is eroding. As the company is required to buy out (perhaps disgruntled) franchisees, capex requirement will increase, which will strain the company's already stretched balance sheet. So much for the asset-light, high margin story! FRSH is currently trading at $14.50 per share, a market value of $245 million, and an enterprise value of $355 million. With net debt of $110 million, FRSH is 3.6 times levered to its trailing 12 month EBITDA of $27million. That's a lot of leverage! FRSH's revenue grew by a CAGR of 23.3% over the past 3 completed fiscal years. Analysts' consensus is forecasting revenues to grow 25.7% this fiscal year and 18.2% the next. Over the past three completed fiscal years, FRSH's EBIT margin decreased by 846 basis points from 19.3% to 10.9%. Analysts' consensus is forecasting EBIT margin to expand by 430 basis points this fiscal year to 15.2%, and contract by 80 basis points the following fiscal year to 14.4%. EPS is expected to increase to $0.50 this fiscal year and to increase to $0.60 the following fiscal year. Using consensus estimates for next fiscal year's results (FY2), FRSH is currently trading at an EV/Sales multiple of 2.5, an EV/EBIT multiple of 17.1, a P/E multiple of 24.0, and a FCF multiple of 24.5. Relative to the S&P 500, FRSH is trading at EV/Sales premium of 50.2%, an EV/EBIT premium of 29.9%, P/E premium of 59.4%, and FCF premium of 38.7%. FRSH's PEG ratio is currently 1.9 compared to the S&P 500's PEG ratio of 1.4 - this is a premium of 37.5%. I believe FRSH's multiples are too high given the fundamental issues discussed above. Applying such a premium to the various valuation metrics discussed above implies a price target of $9.18 or a 37% downside risk from the current price.
