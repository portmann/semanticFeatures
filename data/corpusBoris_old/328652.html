UPDATE 1-South Africa unveils austere budget to trim deficit, avoid downgrade | Reuters * Drought, low global growth weigh on domestic output * Government to cut spending and narrow budget deficits By Stella Mapenzauswa and Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo CAPE TOWN, Feb 24 South Africa unveiled relatively austere budget proposals aimed at avoiding credit rating downgrades on Wednesday, vowing to focus spending to priority areas after weak economic growth slashed revenue. The measures might appease ratings agencies that warned South Africa could fall into sub-investment grade after President Jacob Zuma changed finance ministers twice in less than a week in December, casting doubt on Pretoria's commitment to prudent fiscal policy. But government spending cuts, a civil service job freeze and moderate tax increases taxes on property sales, fuel, alcohol and capital gains, might not go down well with voters ahead of municipal elections this year, in which the ruling African National Congress faces a stiff challenge from the opposition. "We cannot spend money we do not have. We cannot borrow beyond our ability to repay. Until we can ignite growth and generate more revenue, we have to be tough on ourselves," Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan told parliament. "South Africa faces exceptionally difficult global and domestic economic conditions over the next several years," Gordhan said in his closely-watched budget speech, adding that "it is necessary to make tough decisions." Gordhan said he would increase taxes on property sales, fuel, alcohol and capital gains to help raise an additional 18.1 billion rand in revenue in 2016/17. He said the economy could grow by just 0.9 percent in 2016,   down from a previous forecast of 1.7 percent and compared with an estimated growth estimate of 1.3 percent in 2015. This would be the lowest rate of expansion since South Africa emerged from a 2009 recession, reflecting the impact of a severe drought and the depressed global economy. Growth had now fallen behind the rate of population increase, resulting in declining per capita incomes, the National Treasury said in a budget statement outlining spending plans for the next three years. "In other words, the average South African is becoming poorer," it said. The rand extended losses over the lower growth forecast, and was last trading more than 2 percent weaker against the dollar on the day. Despite weaker growth, the government would still aim to reduce its budget deficit to 3.2 percent of GDP in the next fiscal year from 3.9 percent in the current 2015/16 period by tightening spending. Fitch and Standard and Poor's have South Africa on BBB-, just a step into investment grade. Any further cut would label them as junk status. The third main ratings agency, Moody's, rates South Africa at Baa2, two notches above junk. Moody's said last week the drought risked tipping an already weak economy into recession as rising agricultural imports feed into rising inflation. The Treasury said a credit downgrade to sub-investment grade, or "junk" status, could trigger a sharp reversal of capital flows and precipitate recession. "In such an event, aggressive austerity measures would likely be required to restore public finances to a sustainable position," it said. To sustain the social wage and avoid sharp reversals in public spending, the government would adjust the tax policy to boost revenue and re-allocate nearly 32 billion rand to higher priority areas such as higher education. The Treasury said it had cut government departments' budgets for non-essential services, would borrow $4.5 billion from global markets over the next three years, and seek a minority equity partner after merging two of its state-owned airlines.
