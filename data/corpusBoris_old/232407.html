Why Things Do Not Look Good For The Japanese Yen | Seeking Alpha The Japanese Yen has failed to make significant gains against the U.S. dollar in the past few months. In addition to low inflation and sluggish consumer spending, a decline in exports now threatens broader economic growth in Japan. I am significantly bearish on the Japanese Yen. It's been quite a few months since I last wrote on the Japanese Yen, or indeed looked into the currency in much detail. While change is usually the only constant in the world of financial markets, things don't seem to have changed at all for the yen. We can see that while the U.S. dollar lost significant ground to the yen between August and September, the yen has since weakened to 123 JPY to the dollar. While we may have some peaks and valleys between the 120 and 125 mark, I frankly am not optimistic on the long-term outlook for the yen. I say this primarily because the macroeconomic factors in Japan have not fundamentally changed to allow for confidence in the country's economy. I had previously been critical of the fact that while exports in Japan have been rising, domestic consumer spending remains weak. I still maintain that view, and indeed the rate of consumer spending has not picked up in the last few months with core consumer prices having fallen by 0.1 percent in the year to September. While lower oil prices have placed pressure on inflation, lower fuel costs have also failed to bolster consumer spending, with household spending falling by 0.4 percent from the previous year. It is speculated that the Bank of Japan will raise its asset purchases from a current 80 billion yen to 110 billion to meet an inflation target of 2 percent by 2016 and boost consumption. However, I do not see it likely that this would provide any significant boost to consumption or indeed the yen, as prior efforts have not succeeded in this regard. Moreover, in spite of wages in Japan rising for seven months running, this has been insufficient to raise overall consumption. Additionally, exports (which in the absence of consumer spending has been the lifeblood of the Japanese economy) has been slowing in spite of a weaker yen. While economists had been forecasting a 3.4 percent rise in exports for the year to September, the actual figure came in at just 0.6 percent. While the value of exports had increased thanks to a weaker yen, volume had fallen by 3.9 percent. I see the lagging in exports as particularly concerning, as exports serve as one of the few pillars of stability of the Japanese economy given low domestic growth and consumer spending. Ultimately, I remain quite bearish on the Japanese yen. The Bank of Japan is struggling to meet inflation targets, consumer spending remains low, and the decline in exports threatens to place Japan in recession. Given these factors, I do not foresee a positive outlook for the yen going forward. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
