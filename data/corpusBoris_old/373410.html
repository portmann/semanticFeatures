Apple Vs. FBI: The Government Setup - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha The government's response in the San Bernardino terrorism case presents strong legal arguments for enforcement of the court order to unlock the shooter's iPhone. It also contains allegations that damage Apple's public image. The Federal Government has filed its response to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in the case of the unlocking of the iPhone of one of the shooters in the San Bernardino terrorism case. The response makes clear the government's strategy in the case: set Apple up to lose in Federal court, to lose in the court of public opinion, and to lose the battle for mobile device security as a result of future legislative banning of strong encryption. I've read through AAPL's motion to vacate the order compelling Apple to unlock the iPhone in question, as well as the government's response , filed yesterday. I wish Apple could win this one, but I have a nasty, unpleasant feeling the government has the stronger case legally. When Federal Judge Sheri Pym rules (probably on March 22) on Apple's motion, it will probably go against the company, which of course AAPL will appeal. The appeals process could very well go all the way to the Supreme Court. Although I've made my personal sympathies clear that the case has much broader implications for personal privacy in the U.S., the government's argument is basically that the judge has all the authority she needs under current law to compel Apple's assistance in unlocking the iPhone. The judge, who issued the order in the first place, will probably agree. The government continues to argue, I think disingenuously, that the case isn't about creating a universal back door for circumventing iOS 9 encryption and security, but merely requests the unlocking of one specific iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who was killed in the shooting incident last year. The government argues that Judge Pym need only decide the issues of this specific case rather than the broader implications. From a legal standpoint, the government is probably right. But the government knows that once the version of iOS that it seeks is created, Apple will not be able to throw it away. The government argues that this new version of iOS will remain at Apple's facility, and that the company is fully capable of protecting it from misuse. In effect, the government acknowledges that Apple will have to maintain the software indefinitely for future requests from the government. The reasons for this have to do with the compensation that the government would provide Apple, for the current effort as well as future efforts. Apple is entitled to compensation, and the government is happy to provide it. However, in the future, government compensation would be predicated on Apple having the current source code for the modified iOS at its disposal. Apple can't afford to destroy the modified iOS after using because it won't be compensated for recreating it in the future, for all the unlocking requests to follow. The government claims the modified iOS can only be used to unlock a single iPhone, because it must be matched to the phone's unique identification number (UID). Strictly speaking, this is true, but Apple can with little effort modify the source code to work with any UID, and would be expected to do so in the future. Other modifications might be necessary to work with future iPhones and iOS versions, but the modified iOS source code would serve as a basis for any future work. The government claims it isn't asking for a universal encryption backdoor, but in effect, it is asking Apple to develop a capability to unlock any iPhone the government requests. About the only consolation for privacy advocates is that the capability would be maintained by Apple under Apple's control. It would not be available for the kind of universal surveillance of telecommunications that privacy advocates fear the government wants. Most importantly, it would only be available by court order (a warrant), so law enforcement would be under some degree of adult supervision. Besides arguing that the judge already has all the legal authority she needs for the warrant Apple is resisting, the government brings up issues that seem to anticipate future actions that Apple might take. The government calls the security provisions of iOS 9: Apple's deliberate marketing decision to engineer its products so that the government cannot search them, even with a warrant. The government's labeling of the security features of iOS 9 as "warrant-proof" provisions seems intended to head off further efforts by AAPL in the future to make it even more difficult for Apple or anyone else to break into an iPhone. In my previous article, I had suggested that Apple should assure in future iOS versions that it is impossible to "brute force" unlock an iPhone by simply submitting all possible combinations of unlocking codes. I had suggested that Apple eliminate the simple four numerical digit passcode as an unlocking option. Under current law, Apple is free to implement whatever security provisions it sees fit despite the labeling of the government. Here we see the fundamental concern of the government. The idea that there should be any aspect of individual's life that is beyond the reach of government warrant, the government finds fundamentally threatening. It's very likely that current or future Federal administrations will seek relief from this situation by outlawing security features that cannot be breached under authority of a warrant. I doubt that there's any legal or constitutional obstacle to such legislative prohibition. But it would be a prohibition like the prohibition of alcohol, and equally ineffective. In addition to trying to pave the way for the prohibition of strong encryption, the government played the Chinese card in its rebuttal: ... according to Apple's own data, China demanded information from Apple regarding over 4,000 iPhones in the first half of 2015, and Apple produced data 74% of the time... Apple appears to have made special accommodations in China as well: for example, moving Chinese user data to Chinese government servers, and installing a different WiFi protocol for Chinese iPhones. In effect, the government is implying that Apple is already facilitating Chinese government spying, why won't it facilitate U.S. government spying? The implications are very serious and clearly intended to hurt Apple in the public eye. Apple's General Counsel Bruce Sewell has responded directly to the allegations : For the first time we see an allegation that Apple has deliberately made changes to block law enforcement requests for access. This should be deeply offensive to everyone that reads it. An unsupported, unsubstantiated effort to vilify Apple rather than confront the issues in the case. Or the ridiculous section on China where an AUSA, an officer of the court, uses unidentified Internet sources to raise the spectre that Apple has a different and sinister relationship with China. Of course that is not true, and the speculation is based on no substance at all. The government's response shows that it's prepared to win ugly, as well as reveals future directions. As noble as I consider the fight to be, this really has the potential to harm Apple in a way that investors should be concerned about. And I really don't know what Apple should do. If it gives in to the request without a fight, there'll be no end to future requests, both from the Federal government and from overseas. If it continues the fight, it runs the risk of antagonizing a significant fraction of the American public, as well as draconian legislative reaction. The only consolation, if it can be called that, is that a negative outcome for Apple will equally affect the entire mobile device and personal computing industries, as well as newly emerging fields such as the Internet of Things. For that reason, I don't see this as a negative for Apple just yet. I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
