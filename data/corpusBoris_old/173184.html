This was an exceptionally strong quarter for Versar, building on the momentum we had developed earlier in the year. In the fourth quarter we posted our second consecutive quarter of record revenue growth with growth of 126%, while also delivering improved margin and solid profitability. Before we discuss highlights from the quarter and the fiscal year I’d like to comment on an important development that occurred subsequent to the quarter. Last week we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Johnson Controls Security Systems or JCSS, which is a leading security systems integrator serving federal and other clients with design, installation and support of complex physical security, network security and facilities management systems. The acquisition was, which is expected to be immediately accretive is priced at $20 million, which will be paid with a combination of cash and contingent consideration. Transaction is expected to close on or before September 30, 2015. JCSS is a great strategic fit that will allow us to further expand our portfolio of services, allowing us to generate more work with existing clients and to more effectively compete for new customers. We believe JCSS is an important and exciting acquisition for Versar. Now getting back to the quarter, as expected our Dover Air Force Base project was a key driver to our growth in the fourth quarter, at $98.3 million this a huge contract for us and while we anticipate a strong revenue contribution from the project in the fourth quarter, we are encouraged that this contract will also contribute more meaningful revenue in fiscal 2016 than we had initially expected. We've mentioned previously that the margins in the Dover contract are lower than some of our other projects because Dover’s construction and as the prime contractor we subcontracted much of the work. Nonetheless, we delivered significantly improved overall gross margin of 8% in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to 4% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and our overall gross margin for fiscal 2015 improved to 9% from 8% in the previous fiscal year. These margin improvements occurred despite the continuing wind down of our Title 2 work in Afghanistan, and to clarify while we expect our Title 2 work for the U.S. Air Force in Afghanistan to be completed during our fiscal year 2016, we continue to win and perform new work under our personal services contract for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the region. Our focus on expense management gained traction during the fourth quarter. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased significantly in the fourth quarter to 5% as compared to 12% from the fourth quarter of '14. For fiscal year 2015 SG&A as a percentage of sales declined to 7% from 9% in fiscal '14. Our cost containment efforts are moving in the right direction and we expect to realize additional efficiencies going forward. During the year we fully integrated our Waller and GMI acquisitions, allowing us to expand and enhance our portfolio of capabilities and product offerings. This strengthened our ability to deliver customizable solutions and resulted in more contracts won, a growing pipeline of opportunities in both the government and private sectors and significant backlog growth. As of June 26, 2015 our backlog was $179 million, a 57% increase compared to funded backlog of $114 million at the end of fiscal year 2014. During the fourth quarter we announced a number of new awards including a $2.8 million general services administration contract award to our subsidiary J.M. Waller to provide engineering program management and support for civil engineering activities at the International Guard Readiness Center at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. And additionally, our subsidiary Geo-Marine was one of five unrestricted firms awarded a prime contract with a maximum value of $290 million from the United States Army Corps of Engineers to provide repair renewal services for government facilities throughout the U.S., U.S. territories, Japan and Korea. This contract has a maximum 24 month base period and three to 12 month optional order periods for a total of five years. With working capital of $23 million our balance sheet remains strong and is a significant asset to our Company, going forward we will continue to prudently manage the balance sheet and assess our debt and financing structure in order to satisfy our ongoing liquidity needs. I will now turn it over to our Executive Vice President and CFO, Cynthia Downes to review our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015. Thank you, Tony. Gross revenue for fiscal 2015 grew 45% to 159.9 million as compared to 110.3 million in fiscal 2014. The revenue increase was related to our Dover Air Force project, as well as revenue contributions from Waller. Gross margin for the fiscal year 2015 improved to 9% as compared to 8% in fiscal 2014. The Company saw improved margins in its ESG operations due to reduced overhead expenses related to the internal realignment of that business segment. Net income for 2015 was 1.4 million or $0.14 per share as compared to a net loss in fiscal 2014 of 334,000 or a loss of $0.03 per share. Fiscal 2014’s net loss included income of $0.02 from discontinued operations and a loss of 5% from continued operations. Now turning to the fourth quarter. As Tony mentioned, Versar recorded 126% increase in gross revenue a 56.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, compared to 24.9 million last year. The increase in revenue is related to our Dover project, as well as revenue contributions from Waller. Gross margin improved to 8% as compared to 4% in the same quarter last year largely due to Waller, which partially offsets decline of our Title 2 work in Afghanistan and Iraq that impacted the ECM segment. Additionally, margins in the PSG segment returned to previous levels and further helped offset the declines we experienced in ECM related to the decline in our international work. Purchase, services and materials for the fourth quarter increased significantly to 39 million as a result of higher subcontractor cost. We continue to subcontract ECM services in order to provide a broader range of services to customers in this segment. Also within ECM, we've seen an increased proportion of revenue from single award past quarters where Versar acts as a general contractor and utilizes subcontractors to perform a portion of the contract. However, in the ESG segment as we continue to grow our internal capabilities, we're seeing a decreased need to subcontractor services. Direct costs of services and overhead increased to approximately 11% or $1.3 million primarily related to additional costs associated with Versar Waller acquisition partially offset by our realignment within ESG. SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 decreased to 2.6 million or 5% of sales compared to 2.9 million or 12% of sales in the fourth quarter of last year. The Company recorded operating income of 1.7 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to an operating loss of 1.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Net income for the quarter was 954,000 or $0.09 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to a net income of 965,000 or a loss of $0.10 per share on a fully diluted basis for the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. Fourth quarter 2014’s net loss included a loss of $0.01 from discontinued operations and a loss of $0.09 from continued operations. Now focusing on the operating results of the business segments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Engineering and construction management, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 gross revenue was 38.8 million, an increase of 259% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This increase primarily resulted from 28 million in revenue from the Dover project and 2 million from all contracts. Again, while we expect our Title 2 work for the U.S. Air force to be completed in fiscal 2016, we continue to win and perform work on our personal services contracts within the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Afghanistan. Fourth quarter gross margin of the segment was 6% compared to 3% last year. The environmental services group, fourth quarter revenue was 12.6 million, an increase of 7% compared to fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 largely due to the revenue from Waller. Gross profit for the segment was 1.9 million an increase of more than 200% compared to gross profit of 600,000 in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year with Waller contributing approximately 600,000 of this improved gross profit. Gross margin in the segment was 50% compared to 6% last year. As we grow and continue to develop our internal capabilities both organically and through acquisitions, we are pursuing larger contracts and expect to continue reducing the use of subcontractors and shift to direct labor. Professional services, gross revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was 4.9 million an increase of 160% over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. This increase was largely driven by the contributions from Waller. Gross margin for the group in the fourth quarter was 2% compared to 3% last year. As we continue eliminate excess overhead costs, we anticipate improved PSG gross margins. Thank you, Cynthia. Fiscal 2015 was a tremendous year for our Company, completely integrating our strategic acquisitions that strengthened our market position by broadening our ability to meet the needs of our existing customers. We’ve improved our visibility in the marketplace and enhanced our exposure in new contract opportunities. Our recently announced intended acquisition of JCSS will bring additional service offerings further strengthening our ability to provide a broad range customized solutions in virtually any location or environment. Our 2015 results provide a solid foundation to continue to grow our customer base, further improve revenue and margin performance and achieve sustained profitability. Thank you all for your continuing support and I’ll now turn it over to Dave to begin the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you. At this time, we’ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jennifer Walters from Comstock Partners. So I understand that you generally don’t give formal guidance, but would you be able to provide anymore specific color on how we should think about 2016? Sure, and you are right we don’t provide guidance and so I’m going to be a little careful on this. Well we are very optimistic about ’16, we think we have a very strong backlog. We look at our pipeline, we feel very good about the pipeline in general. And so overall for ’16 we’re very-very optimistic both in terms of top-line and bottom-line as well as margin. The first quarter we’re about two-thirds or at least a little more and two-thirds away for the first quarter. First quarter for Versar has historically been a tougher quarter and I think it’s going to be consistent with that this year. It’s always been a tougher quarter because this is also the last quarter of the government year and so it’s a huge bid and proposal effort timeframe for us and that’s not changing. In fact I suspect this year is proving to be a larger effort than in past years because so much of the government’s awards have been backed, kind of shifted back into this last quarter. Second of all, we have seen and not just Versar but I think all the other contractors seeing a slower amount of awards coming out during this quarter typically we see awards coming out you’ll notice from the fact that we haven’t making announcements that we’re seeing a build-up of our pipeline and that certainly has affected the first quarter in terms of work that we thought we’d be getting during the quarter that would start to come being performing. And third we had a fair amount of cost associated with the due diligence and the subsequent integration on the upcoming acquisition that’s going to happen right at the end of the quarter, so all those costs are going to get front-loaded into this quarter, but we’re not going to realize any of the revenue or margin benefits from the acquisition until the second quarter. So I think the sum of it is I think the first quarter is going to be a challenging quarter for us, but overall for the year we’re quite optimistic and believe we’ll see improvements across the line. A question relative to the balance sheet, obviously cash receivable is a huge number there at the end of the year at 57.2 million, payables could be 35.8 so on a net basis you have about 21 million invested in those two lines. Do you see given when do you expect to see that the cash flow from the accounts receivable and is this a high watermark for you, do you expect to generate cash in the first quarter out of the balance sheet? Well, what you’re seeing here on both sides, on the receivable side and the payable side is really Dover. Dover is a significant portion of the revenue. As we’ve discussed, Dover is generating a large part of those receivables and obviously since we’re the prime and we subcontract per amount of it a lot of that is employing down into the payables. However, it’s not as dramatic as it sounds from a cash flow point of view because our terms that ourselves are paid when paid. So, while we obviously you have to book the combination of receivables or a combination of billed and unbilled receivables and we have to book on the balance sheet the payables, those payables really aren’t obligated to be paid until we get paid. So, it's not as if it's been a dramatic hit on our line or anything to that extent, it's just a high watermark. I think we're seeing Dover now kind of running at a consistent level in terms of billings for the next couple of months I would think and similar to what we had over last couple of months. But we're also seeing an improved -- we've got that system smoothed down with the government in terms of how things are being paid. So, I don't expect it to see it dramatically increase and I would intuitively feel it will probably come down some and payables will come down on kind of a pro rata basis as well. So, it looks a little more dramatic than it actually is. JCSS, could you give any color with regards to say the trailing 12 month revenues of that operation, and what kind of EBITDA margins they have historically generated? I really can't at this time, this is something that you can understand until it closes, we're still kind of committed to being pretty tight lipped with that so what I could talk to it in general terms. The margins are historically higher than Versar's one of the reasons we like it, we're very appealed, we talked on a number of occasions quite openly about areas that we're looking at that are a rational extension of what we do would provide us opportunities to grow with new clients and to grow into higher margin businesses and we see kind of what we call classified or secured construction which we see this as, is right up there for us, so we're very comfortable in terms of how we buy in the past, I don't think this is any different, we have typically looked at -- we have talked openly about how we value companies in terms of the multiples that we pay, how we structure the transactions, the sort of backlog we like to see, all these are consistent with past practices and in the margins as I said are historically better than what we as a Company have. Final question for me if I may, you talked about a robust pipeline, could you tell us what is the level of bids that you have submitted at this point in time? And what is the value of the bids which you plan to submit through the balance of fiscal '16? So we have never in the past talked specific numbers of the pipeline, only the backlog and so let me talk directionally. We've talked about a year or so ago after the acquisition of GMI but before the acquisition of Waller that we were starting to see a pretty significant increase in our pipeline more than doubling and that was due to both organic efforts as well as through the acquisitions bringing in their pipelines. And we were also seeing better qualified projects within that pipeline, that has actually continued, I think the pipeline has grown probably another 25% to 30% over in terms of gross dollars and the expected value is easily kind of doubled of what we’d -- more than two or three times what we've kind of being doing on an annual basis. So, we're comfortable that we have a pipeline that is more than robust enough to drive business growth, revenue growth over the next couple of years, as well as to continue to drive our backlog at the same time. We also believed that our expected value or the likelihood of winning out of that pipeline is up substantially, because it's a much more targeted pipeline. Part of that growth in pipeline as I said earlier and of the first question is what everyone is seeing, to be honest the fourth quarter was probably one of the slowest quarters we've had for awards in a number of years, and just nothing was coming out, not just us. We're hearing from other competitors, we're hearing from companies and unrelated industries, the government contractors that it was one of the slower quarters they've ever seen as well. And so there's a huge kind of down wave that we think is building up that has to come out in the next couple of weeks and so our expectation is that over the next couple of weeks into the early part of Q2 we'll be announcing a significant number of wins that will then be converted into backlog. Let me ask you on the $20 million we're spending for JCSS, how much of that are we going to have to borrow? So as we have announced and again see I can't give specifics yet, obviously when we close a transaction we can be a little more open about the structure of the deal as well. But it's a combination of cash and contingent payment. You and I have talked and you heard me also talk on terms of the -- on these calls that we still believe we are undervalued by the street and the market. And so we are not comfortable yet using equity. And so effectively at 20 million we will be depending on when the contingent payments are due with all the debt. We feel that we have shown over the last five years of managing this company in terms of we've done an acquisition a year, every one of those deals has incurred debt for the Company and earn-out that we have actually proven to be able to manage the balance sheet very prudently and effectively. In fact, if you look at the balance sheet today, the only debt left on that balance sheet is associated with the Waller acquisition, we have fully paid off the Charron acquisition which occurred in '13, we fully paid off the GMI acquisition which occurred in fiscal year -- I am sorry Charron was in fiscal year '12, GMI was in fiscal year '13 and then obviously Waller was in the beginning of our fiscal year '15 but actually in calendar year '14. So I think and what I committed to a couple of calls ago was that we use our free cash flow is in between acquisitions as to pay down debt, and that's consistent with what we have done. So we are not concerned about the leverage. We are very comfortable with the cash flow that we are going to be able to generate from a free cash flow point of view to manage this. And our projections are that within two or three years this company will be pretty much fully de-levered again. Okay. That's good. I would like to -- and moving to operational risk, the financial risk is always troubling, so let’s hope it plays out that way. Secondly, you mentioned that Dover will contribute even more in 2016 and margins will continue to improve also from your operational leveraging will see margins improve. So we have a rough first quarter coming up because of the expenses loaded in it. But at the same time, when describing Q4 that we just reported, you described it as an exceptional quarter or exceptionally strong. By exceptionally strong you just mean it is a strong quarter, not that this is an exception because it would seem to me that going forward jumping past Q1 it should almost be a baseline quarter based on our top-line in our margins improvement. Is that -- did I go too much too fast there or? So let's talk a little bit about Dover. So Dover as we said, we had talked all along that we thought it was going to be a 50%-50%, 45% to 55%, in fact it probably shifted a little more into '16 because of weather and just when you are doing these big construction projects things pop up and then you have to work with the client to figure out how you are going to address them. So some revenue was shifted. That's part of what's happening and why we think first quarter is going to be a tougher quarter. We are going to see probably a larger amount from Dover than we had expected and so the lower margin. That said, what happened of course was that we had little less of Dover in Q4 and we had a little more of revenue from other areas including ESG which where Cynthia mentioned we are starting to see margin improvements. And so yes we think what we saw in Q4 is more indicative of the longer run and we have consistently said that we believe longer term we should be up in that low-teens, low double-digit margin and we are still comfortable with that approach, that kind of, that trend. And lastly, we do an acquisition it seems as you noted basically once a year, JCSS sounds like a good fit, obviously time will tell. Are you going to take a pause and swallow and digest all of these and integrate them or do you see something coming up in the next six months or so, nine months that you really want to grab and want to -- what does it look like to you? I think there was a really bad James Bond movie which is Never Say Never or something like that but this is a bigger buy for us than in the past both from a financial point of view and integration wise we actually think it's probably a little easier than Waller it's not as big from an organizational point of view. We are not bringing on as much G&A as we had to deal with in Waller’s case. So we think that side of it is going to make this a little easier but it's an important one for us. We are very excited about it. We see lots of ways to leverage it and so the strategic plan right now is to kind of take a pause, integrate this, really leverage what this has brought in. That said, if something comes along that's really interesting that brings something and it's small, I think we'd look at it. We're not anticipating anything of size for certainly in the next 12 months or beyond. We do want to get our hands around this to your point I'm very much agreeing with you that financial risk is always a little nerve racking and so I'm very comfortable with the team we have to manage both the integration and the operations. We're bringing over some great people and I'm also very comfortable with Cynthia and her team and how to manage the balance sheet and I think we've shown that so, this next 12 months is going to be 12 months of integrating this, leveraging what we have brought on, benefiting from the improved margins and paying down the debt. Well listen, good luck we’ll wait for Q1 and looking forward to Q2 and going forward from there, thanks very much. I just wanted to ask, could you tell me your thoughts about the working capital I know with Dover that's been ramping up and then there's the acquisition, kind of how you think about the working capital requirements going forward? Sure, as I mentioned earlier the Dover project brings big receivables and payables but of course it's a paid one paid and so those payables really aren't quite as scary as they might appear. We're actually overall bringing our days outstanding down. Cynthia and her team have been our project accountants and our group controllers have put a lot of effort over the last six months to managing payables and continue to focus on that, in fact we gave all of our GMs this year objectives in terms of managing DSO so we actually are improving our overall DSO notwithstanding what's going on with Dover. Additionally, the structure of the debt we're putting in place we are very comfortable, gives us more than enough of flexibility to manage both the cash portion and the contingent portion while also not in any way stressing us from a working capital point of view. So a lot of effort and thought has gone into structuring this in a way to make sure we don't all of a sudden hit a bump somewhere out there and find ourselves behind an eight ball. And then last question from me, I know you said like Q4 has been a bit slow but you feel like that it is just a held up. Regarding the Company's Geo-Marine’s subsidiary with the large $290 million max value contract award between you and other companies how do you think is that something that you think as far as the total award winds up close to the $300 million range or based on what you're seeing with less money coming out with the government spending, do you think that it’s may be close to like 250 million, what is your view? That's a hard question let me give you a, let me go on a slightly different perspective just to give you a sense of how pleased we are with that award and how we think it is a big player for us. One of the reasons we actually acquired Geo-Marine was this vehicle this was, internally we call it the FRR contract vehicle out of Huntsville. We've always saw Huntsville as a major area that we needed to get into with the corps. In fact if you recall a couple of years ago we bought the assets of Lime Energy this was the sixth, the predecessor, Lime Energy’s contract was the predecessor to this FRR contract and we bought it for two reasons. It's a contract vehicle that we've always felt we could effectively compete in and two it started giving us a presence at Huntsville to help facilitate we hope them getting comfortable with us as a potential winner of the FRR. So it played out as we hoped. We developed some real credibility, we were a winner, we intuitively have always assumed that you split it down the line, each company in that winner is eventually going to win maybe a fifth of it, but we obviously hope we’d get even more of that. We are starting to see a lot of opportunities on that vehicle as we expected and so we're very-very excited about the type of opportunities we are seeing, the size of those opportunities we're seeing and the fact that we feel, it's a small enough competitive pool that we'll be able to be very effective on. So we think it was a great win and there was some comment on how long things are taking with the government that this was pending when we bought GMI and we bought them literally two years ago and it just got awarded this past quarter. Then last question I had I don't think it was brought up real quick, gross margins ex-Dover if you're looking at for this quarter ballpark? Yes, that's a good question. I mean Dover was 50% of our revenue this quarter. Dover was about 50% of our more give or take 50% of our revenue and Dover certainly is easily the margins that are easily 50% lower than anything else we do. So, it had a pretty significant impact on the overall margins. Thank you. At this time, we have no further questions. I would turn the call back over to David Gray for closing comments. Thank you, everybody. We'll be posting this broadcast to our Web site in the next couple of hours for anyone that would like to access it. We'll be releasing our Q1 2016 results as well as hosting our Annual Shareholders Meeting in November 2015. And of course, as always we'll continue to announce our wins and awards as they occur. Lastly, thank you for your continued support of Versar and we look forward to talking with you again soon. Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.
