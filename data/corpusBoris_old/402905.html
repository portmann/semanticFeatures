Tyson: Jump In At A 52 Week High And Counting? - Tyson Foods Inc. (NYSE:TSN) | Seeking Alpha I have been neutral on Tyson for several months. Q2 earnings are out and I discuss the key metrics and what I think you should do with the name. Last year I wrote about Tyson Foods (NYSE: TSN ) citing that it was one of the largest food companies in the United States, and has been in business for 70 years. I specifically wrote about knowing your meats, and predicted weakness in pork, and possibly chicken, but cited that company was a buy thanks to its global presence and attractive share prices. Recall the company is involved in chicken, pork, beef and prepared foods. Tyson also owns Hillshire Farms, Jimmy Dean, Sara Lee, Ball Park and State Fair. After looking into the company, I had essentially given the stock a hold, but did bless buying on some dips. Well, today the stock is once again at a 52 week high. I now rate the stock a hold because it has been on fire and is ahead of itself in my opinion. I feel it is a little ahead of itself given its valuation relative to performance. What do I mean? Well we should look at sales and recent performance. We can imagine with the stock popping that the company's fiscal Q2 must have had some surprises, but were there weaknesses that deserve attention? I have to be honest I was surprised at the strength. To understand what is happening we need to break down Tyson Foods' performance by product to get an understanding of where we think the company, and subsequently the stock, is heading after today's pop. Year-over-year, the company saw sales were down 8% to $9.17 billion in fiscal Q2 2016. This revenues were down year-over-year but beat estimates by $130 million. Of course some of this weakness on an absolute basis stems from the currency issues associated with a stronger dollar that are plaguing domestic companies, but also there were issues with volumes this quarter. That said, despite the decline in revenues, the company delivered a record for Q2 operating income. In fact, operating income spiked 28% to a record $704 million. The company also saw its adjusted earnings per share come in at $1.07 per share, up a massive 43% over last year's $0.75. So where exactly did these earnings come from? Well we need a segment by segment breakdown to understand the most recent quarter in more detail. As always, let's start with the flagship product in chicken. Tyson saw sales volume and average sales prices that were up 1.7% and down 4.9% respectively, year-over-year. In Q2 2016, the company saw sales of $2.737 billion versus $2.829 billion last year. Despite a sales decline, operating income increased in Q2 2016 to $347 million versus $332 million in Q2 2015. Sales volume decreased as a result of optimizing mix and the buy versus grow strategy, partially offset by an increase in rendered product sales. Average sales price decreased as feed ingredient costs declined, partially offset by mix changes. There was higher demand as well. Operating income increased due to improved operational execution and lower feed ingredient costs. Feed costs decreased $80 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Record operating margin in the segment was seen and came in at 12.7%. While these results were strong, the company needs of course more than just the chicken segment to perform well. The price of beef for consumers continues to be out of control, though it starting to come down. Still, it has gotten cost prohibitive to feed a family of 5 a steak dinner consisting of high quality cuts. There was some reprieve for consumers as the average sales price was down nicely year-over-year (down 14.2%). Sales were down to $3.639 billion from $4.13 billion. Lower prices more than offset the increase in sales volumes. Volumes were up 2.8% year-over-year. Average sales price decreased due to higher domestic availability of fed cattle supplies, which drove down livestock costs. Operating income increased due to more favorable market conditions associated with an increase in supply which drove down fed cattle costs. In fact, operating income turned positive versus last year. It came in at $46 million versus a loss of $20 million last year. The pork segment was also very positive in terms of operating income despite a sales decline. Revenues were down slightly to $1.190 billion from $1.204 billion last year. This is because sales prices were down more than offsetting gains in volumes. Sales volume was up 3.1% while sales prices were down 4.1%. While I thought this would be a losing combination, thanks to better plant utilization and favorable live hog markets, operating income jumped to $140 million from $199 million in last year's quarter. Turning to prepared foods, the company saw declines slightly. Average sales price and volumes decreased due to declines in key meat prices. Revenues were $1.804 billion versus $1.871 billion. Like other segments operating income improved to $197 million from $160 million last year. This was due to an improved mix, despite the decline in sales volume. This was a strong quarter, no doubt about it. Much of the sales declines were also due to the divestitures the company had in 2015, so that should be considered. But why is the name spiking? Well the company upped its guidance. Looking ahead to the rest of fiscal 2016, the company expects domestic protein production to increase approximately 2-3% from fiscal 2015 levels. Current USDA data shows an increase in chicken production around 2% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Further, feed costs are expected to decline of about $200 million. The company expects industry fed cattle supplies to be 1% higher in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The company now sees the beef segment coming in at the higher end of the operating margin guidance of 1.5% to 3.0%. Pork had been tough in 2015. It expects hog supplies to increase around 2% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016, the Pork segment's operating margin will be above its normalized range of 6-8%, coming in around 10%. Prepared foods should continue to perform well as well. I expected to see lower raw material costs given the decline in costs of product ingredients and the company reiterated this seeing costs lower to approximately $300 million in fiscal 2016. Because the company is investing in new product launches, operating margin may come in at the low-end of its normalized range of 10-12% in fiscal 2016. The company also sees annual earnings coming in at $4.20 to $4.30. At the end of the day this is really strong guidance and the quarter was fantastic. That said, I felt shares were fairly valued last fall, and now, despite my respect for the company, its management and its operations, the stock is still very steep here. I would take some profits here, but recommend a more medium-term hold on the stock. Note from the author: Christopher F. Davis has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.
