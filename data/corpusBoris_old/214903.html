NVE Corporation: Discreet And Mysterious? - NVE Corporation (NASDAQ:NVEC) | Seeking Alpha NVE Corporation reported fiscal 2016 second quarter earnings on October1st. The company beat analysts' average estimate on revenue by 9% and EPS by 17%. But the reality is both measures were down compared to the same quarter a year ago, albeit just as NVE management guided. Management's discussion for the second half of fiscal 2016 seemed less transparent as if discretion and mystery were in order. There's often a fine line between offering transparency to shareholders and maintaining a level of discretion for competitive advantage. The fiscal 2016 second quarter conference call for NVE Corporation (NASDAQ: NVEC ) toed that line. NVE Corporation, a spintronics technology leader, reported its latest results on October 21st. The quarter offered a few unexpected surprises while management may have offered a discreet peak at a few mysteries. In fiscal 2015 (ending 3/31/15), NVE Corporation produced the highest product sales in the company's history at $29.89 million. However, the fiscal 2016 first quarter results were an unanticipated disappointment. Product sales, at $7.74 million, were down 7.9% year-over-year. But, even more disappointing was the announcement that the decrease would continue: "....we currently expect product sales for future quarters including the remaining quarters in fiscal 2016 to be significantly less than product sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. We are currently forecasting an impact of $1 million to $2 million per quarter starting this quarter." Total revenue in the first quarter actually only declined 1.6%. The difference was offset by NVE Corporation's second source of revenue - contract or customer-sponsored R&D. This category delivered $585,000. The company guided the category would likely deliver the same range in the second quarter. Analysts had estimated the company would earn $6.68 million in revenue. Based on the company's guidance for fiscal 2016's second quarter, product sales could drop to as low as $5.74 million and contract R&D would add $585,000. The two categories, minimally, would total $6.33 million. In the fiscal 2015 second quarter, NVE delivered $8.11 million in product sales and $153.6,000 in contract R&D. Product sales in the second quarter declined by $1.7 million (21%) compared to the prior year and $1.3 million compared to the prior quarter. Contract R&D in the quarter increased to $843,000. Thus, the first surprise in the quarter was a revenue beat of $600,000. In the first six months of fiscal 2016, NVE's contract R&D has now doubled ($1.43 million) the amount earned in all of fiscal 2015 ($690,000). In fiscal 2015, NVE's internally-funded R&D expense in the first half totaled $1.59 million. Because some of the company's resources are focused on contract R&D, this expense has dropped in the first six months of fiscal 2016 to $1.3 million. This decrease combined with a decrease in SG&A expenses resulted in an over $500,000 total expense decrease. For the quarter, the unexpected revenue and the expense savings resulted in a difference in net income of approximately $486,000. Analysts had estimated EPS at $0.58 for the fiscal 2016 second quarter. So, the second surprise was an EPS beat of $0.10 per share. The decline in EPS year-to-date is not as drastic as expected. The disconnect on EPS, though pleasant, is probably a result of expecting net income to decrease at a greater rate than revenue. Revenue declined in the first half of fiscal 2016 by 7% year-over-year and EPS declined by over 11%. There are two contributors to this outcome. First, margins on contract R&D are not as healthy as margins on product sales. For fiscal 2015, the gross margin was 81% while the gross margin for fiscal 2016 was just 76.68%. Secondly, because NVE committed to returning much of its cash horde to shareholders, its income earned from interest is purposely less in fiscal 2016's first half as compared to fiscal 2015. The second quarter estimates were conservative but rightly so. They were based on information and data provided transparently. For the fiscal 2016 third quarter, the transparency was a little clouded. Management did not backtrack on the deficit in product sales: "...we are expecting product sales will be lower in the third and fourth quarter than they were in the first quarter." However, regarding whether contract R&D would deliver steadily, CEO, Mr. Dan Baker, replied elusively: "Well, contract revenue can bounce around based on a number of factors, but we do have a strong pipeline of possible contracts, so we expect to continue to show a significant year-over-year increase in contract R&D revenue." Cue a first rolling cloud. That's hardly a clear or fair answer considering the company, as mentioned above, has already doubled the full amount from fiscal 2015 in the first six months of fiscal 2016. On the expense side, NVE projected an increase specifically related to internally-funded R&D: "We currently expect research and development expense to increase in the third and fourth quarters from the second quarter due to planned additional product development, primarily related to Internet of Things and node sensors." "We've added people and programs and the impact on R&D expense could be in the range of 20% to 25% compared to the second quarter." "We're expecting that amount in the first half to increase by 20% to 25%, which would be in the range of $750,000 to, say, $790,000 per quarter." Despite analysts' curiosity about both forms of R&D, NVE's management maintained clouds of discretion. Mr. Baker did confirm the contract R&D programs are "primarily new" and are "concentrated in anti-tamper and biosensors." When questioned about the reasons for the ramp in internally-funded R&D, well, cue more clouds. Mr. Baker stated there were several drivers. He mentioned "a combination of products that are in the near term and longer term," new people in our engineering departments, development departments," and "programs to provide node sensors for the Internet of Things." In fairness, there was discussion about product developments and potential business. But there were no details implying the value or timing of sales. Some may argue such discussion/discretion is simply smoke and mirrors. They may declare there's no reason for optimism. However, NVE Corporation has stated it does not spend frivolously on R&D: "...when we justify an R&D project, whether it's internally funded, whether we have the resources or don't have the resources, we have to demonstrate a payback or we're not going to do it.....if we invest our shareholders' money in R&D, we need to be able to demonstrate a return." And, although the company did not explicitly share enough details with which to build a financial model, management did share this observation regarding contract R&D: "So they do result in product sales and that's part of the reason why we believe these contracts are helpful. They help fund R&D. They help advance things like our MRAM technology. And, they can result in product sales. So they're more than just a revenue source for us. They build intellectual property and potential business in the future." For the sake of argument, if the above were true, if contract R&D led to advances in technology, potential products, IP and future business, just what would one expect to transpire next? If a contract program expired but the program had carved inroads toward future technology and business, what would a conscientious and prudent business do to further research and development? It's possible the company would foot the bill itself and bring the R&D in-house. If that were the case, alert investors would likely notice a ramp in internally-funded R&D. But, how would a company with a purported full pipeline of contract R&D programs handle the additional workload? Alert investors would watch for the company to mention adding personnel and talent.
