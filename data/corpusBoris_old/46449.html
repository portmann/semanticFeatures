Fed’s Williams: Monetary Policy Rules Don’t Work Well in Real World - Real Time Economics - WSJ Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams said Friday that efforts to conduct monetary policy based strictly on a rules-based regime would likely not work very well in real-world conditions. “There is no question that monetary policy rules provide an invaluable tool for research and practical policy considerations at central banks,” he said, adding that Fed officials currently consult these rules of thumb when deliberating on interest rate policy. But the problem is these rules generally rely, as part of their formulation, on impossible-to-measure factors, such as the economy’s potential growth rate and natural level of interest rates, Mr. Williams said. “If the mandated policy rule uses outdated or inappropriate measures of natural rates, economic performance will suffer,” Mr. Williams said. On the other hand, “allowing the central bank to freely choose natural rate measures would significantly loosen the constraint on policymaking” and thwart what rule proponents generally like, which is to make monetary policy less subject to judgment, the official said. Policy rules also wouldn’t have done much for the Fed in recent years with interest rates pegged at near-zero levels, Mr. Williams said in the text of a speech prepared for delivery before an audience at Chapman University in Orange, Calif. These rules would have called for something not easily done, and that would have been for the Fed to have pushed short-term rates deeply into negative territory, he said. Mr. Williams said the problem when policy rules meet zero interest rates is probably not over. The use of unconventional policy stimulus like bond buying and other tools “are very likely to occur again in the future,” and rule-based policy making will have nothing to contribute in such a scenario, he said. In his remarks, Mr. Williams was pushing back at moves in Congress to legally require the Fed to make policy based on a rules-based regime. As it now stands, the Fed is mandated to keep prices stable and promote job growth, and is granted discretion in how best to attain those goals. In his speech, Mr. Williams did not comment on the economic or monetary policy outlook. He spoke in the wake of this week’s gathering of the monetary policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Officials maintained short-term interest rates at near-zero levels and gave little guidance on when they might change that policy. That said, officials acknowledged the unexpected weakness seen at the start of the year. A number of Fed officials have signaled the current state of the economy has made it harder to say when rates will rise, although most still expect to boost short-term borrowing costs before 2015 ends. Mr. Williams is a voting member of the FOMC. In recent comments, he’s said the mid-June policy meeting might open the door to discussing a rate rise, but he’s made no firm predictions about when he would like to act. Like most Fed officials, he’s argued the Fed will move rates up when incoming economic data supports that change.
