This metrics continue to hover around 30% and we are working diligently to increase gross margin through higher sales, better fab utilization and cost reductions. R&D spending for the quarter was $7.9 million or 9.8% of net sales as compared to $7.7 million or 9.4% of net sales in the prior year quarter. SG&A expenses were $10 million or 12.4% of net sales as compared with $10.6 million or 13% of net sales in the prior year quarter. On a year-over-year comparison, the decrease in SG&A expenses – we decreased the SG&A expenses and we continue to focus on reducing these costs. CapEx was approximately $4 million for the June 30, 2016 quarter, the vast majority of capital expenditure for our internal manufacturing facilities. Turning to the balance sheet. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 7.6. The Company exited the June 30, 2016 quarter with cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $151.4 million. IXYS generated about $7.5 million in cash from operations during the quarter. It is important to note, that IXYS retired approximately $7 million of debt in connection with our revolving line of credits. The Company declared a $0.04 per share dividend highlighting the 15th consecutive quarter of dividends. We appreciate our long standing shareholders and actively seek to engage in investor friendly initiatives like dividend and stock buyback. Adjusted EBITDA which excludes stock-based compensation expense was $9.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Net accounts receivables at June 30, 2016 were about $41 million and DSO was approximately 46 days. As of June 30, 2016, net inventory was $85.7 million and inventory returns were 2.6 times during the quarter. We are optimistic about the growth prospect as IXYS financial metrics referenced by Nathan look promising. However, we must consider ongoing volatile macroeconomic conditions and the cyclical slowdown in the summer months. Despite these adverse factors, we expect revenue in the September 2016 quarter to increase slightly from the June 2016 quarter. Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Christopher Longiaru with Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead. How are you doing? So my first question has - just to do with how gross margins kind of shake out from here and also just looking in June, how much of – it was a little bit down from March, right. So how much of that is mix? How much of that is maybe utilization caused by moving away to some more outsourced products. Can you give us an idea of all the little pieces that delve into the gross margin? Chris, I’ll take that. So pretty much the story was the gross margin is an issue of mix, as you know 50% of our products we manufacture in-house and the other 50% we outsource. During the quarter, we manufacture more in the outsourcing facilities and less in our internal house that bounce back to your utilization question and utilization was between 60% to 65% overall. Therefore, we had a little reduction in margins, but we believe that will come back and work towards as I mentioned increases our gross margins. We believe that this is a matter of timing issue. How does it look as you guide to September I know that we're only maybe a month in, but is your visibility there that it shifts back to more north of 65% in terms of utilization? I believe in terms of utilization for the September quarter it's kind of hard to gauge, but I can you that I’m very optimistic about the upcoming months and that is because of the fact that. If you think about it quarter-over-quarter, our bookings increased by $8.2 million or 11%. Our book-to-bill ratio was increased from 0.93 to 1.02, during the quarter our backlog increased. So overall I'm very optimistic about where we are going and the direction we're taking. Thank you. If there are no more question and in closing the conference call, we need to remind you that our discussions contain forward-looking statements and there are number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements including, among others, risks detail from time-to-time in our SEC reports, including our reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Thank you all for your time.
