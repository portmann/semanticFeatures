ETF Hub Dec 14 2015, 16:47 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Digital Turbine ( APPS -7.4%) now expects fiscal 2016 revenue to fall between $90M and $100M, the company said in an update to its guidance for next year. The firm points to changes to timing in device launches; many recently added distribution partners will now launch in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 rather than in fiscal 2016 (ending in March), while other partners will be on board later in Q4 than expected. As for the current quarter (fiscal Q3), the ad business should drive second-half revenue growth of up to 200% sequentially from a $7.3M first-half total. The company says yield per device is trending over its target of $2.
