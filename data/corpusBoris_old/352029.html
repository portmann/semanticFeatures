Morgan shows spending grew most strongly at small businesses, accounting for 1.7 percentage points of the 2.35% gain. Photo: BETH J. HARPAZ/ASSOCIATED PRESS Consumer-spending growth allowed the U.S. economy to dodge contraction territory late last year, and the source of strength was not the wealthy, but rather low-income consumers and millennials. Younger consumers and those with lower incomes punched above their weight class in the final months of 2015Â  fueling a 2.35% increase in year-over-year spending in December Â in 15 U.S. metro areas, according to data released today by the J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Institute. Those same groups were leading contributors to consumption gains in October and November. Separate government data showed consumer spending more than accounted for all economic output gains in the fourth quarter, counteracting drags from weak business investment and a slowdown in international trade. Those under 25 accounted for nearly 1 percentage point of overall spending growth, J.P. Morgan data said. Those under 35 accounted for nearly the entire gain, 1.9 percentage points. Americans ages 55 and older, conversely, slowed their spending in December compared with a year earlier, according to the data constructed from more than 14 billion anonymized debit and credit card transactions. Sliced another way, the data shows Americans on the bottom end of the income distributionâ€”many of whom are youngerâ€”were a leading source of gains. The bottom 20% of income earners accounted for 1.25 percentage points of total consumption growth. The upper 20% were a 0.43 point drag. â€œConsumers in lowest quintile made strong contributions and they tend to not carry their full weight of spending,â€? meaning they typically account for less than 20% of overall purchases, said institute chief executive Diana Farrell. In December, the bottom quintile accounted for 13.8% of total spending, but the groupâ€™s spending grew almost 10% from a year earlier. Similarly, those under 25 accounted for 6.9% of spending (theyâ€™re 9.4% of the population) but their spending grew 16% from a year earlier. Thatâ€™s likely a mix of two factors, Ms. Farrell said. Outside of gasoline, prices for many essentials, including medical care and car repair, are rising. With little room for discretion, low-income consumers were forced to increase their spending. But at the same time, job growth continues to be steady and wages are modestly increasing. That should give consumers who live paycheck to paycheck a boost . And the J.P. Morgan data bears that out. Spending at restaurants, typically an easy splurge, rose consistently last year. Spending on other services was also strong. That category includes doctorsâ€™ visits, but also entertainment, gaming and personal care such as trips to the barber or nail salon. Spending on fuel declined throughout the year, but December drag on total outlays, -0.6 percentage point, was the smallest of the year. That suggests that the downward pressure fuel prices put on spending is dissipating.
