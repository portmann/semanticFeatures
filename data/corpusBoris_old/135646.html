Emerson Radio's Annual Filing Reveals Value And Emerging Catalysts - Emerson Radio Corp (NYSEMKT:MSN) | Seeking Alpha Emerson Radio's 10-K reveals huge development with IRS, eliminating 50% of the risk to the market cap (a $15 million contingency). Emerson Radio's (NYSEMKT: MSN ) latest 10-K release has gone largely unnoticed. It's a sad ending for a company with a long history going back to the world wars, which you can read about further on Wikipedia here . The lack of attention, however, is good for readers of this article, as you have an opportunity that is rare in the market - to buy something that is quantifiably and reliably worth more than you have to pay, significantly more. This article will explain why. First, I will discuss why the latest release is so important. Then, I will discuss the underlying business to illustrate this important source of value. Finally, I will provide readers with some reasons for caution. The tax issues that plagued the company were referred to as "Nopa 1 and 2" in the prior filings. The company had noted that in total, if the IRS won, would have resulted in a maximum of $15 million of shareholders' cash going to the IRS. This would have been equivalent to a 40% wipeout of the company's value, which explains why it, prior to the news release, traded at around $37 million despite a book value of around $50 million and cash of around $40 million. This discount is huge for a company that operationally is essentially break-even. The release on July 14 reveals that the company has resolved $15 million of the tax contingency weighing on the stock for just $3 million in total, resulting in a small loss booked for the portion that was not already accrued. That sounds like a small number. It is actually dramatically huge, due to the size of the contingency relative to the market value of the company. Because the market capitalization was only around $30 million, this resolution represents a 40% increase in value. If investors had penalized the company for the contingency, they should also credit the market value now that the contingency is resolved. The relevant section of the filing reads as follows: "…In June 2015, following a formal IRS Appeal, the Company and the IRS agreed to settle on the following terms: (1) that the IRS would not pursue the aforementioned NOPA 1 and NOPA 2 income assessments pertaining to fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011 provided that the Company agreed to treat 30% of the Macao CFC's income as taxable Subpart F income in the U.S. for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011, and (2) that the IRS would impose no penalties for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011 (collectively, the "Settlement Agreement"). Based on discussions between the Company, its advisors and the IRS, the Company believes that the IRS intends to apply the Settlement Agreement's calculation reached for the Company's fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011 periods to the Company's fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013 periods." "Based on the foregoing, the Company estimates that it is subject to additional federal and state income taxes for fiscal 2010 though fiscal 2013 of approximately $3.0 million. Of this amount, approximately $1.6 million was recorded as income tax expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, $0.5 million was recorded as income tax expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and $0.9 million was recorded as income tax expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013." Accordingly, the actual write-down was $1.6 million to resolve the whole $15 million contingency, which is now fully reflected in book value. MSN has really just two very simple businesses: Products (microwaves and small refrigerators it buys from Chinese suppliers and sells to Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) mainly) and Licensing. Both businesses ultimately sell mainly to Wal-Mart and Target (NYSE: TGT ). The income statement breaks down as follows for the last 12 months: Obviously, the licensing business, whereby the firm collects cash from Chinese firms to sell products under the Emerson brand name to Wal-Mart, is quite lucrative. 85% of the Licensing business comes from a Chinese manufacturer called Funai ( OTCPK:FUAIY ), which makes the Emerson televisions you can see when perusing the flat-screens at Wal-Mart this weekend if you want. Of importance is that the company has a royalty agreement with Funai specifying that Funai must pay MSN a minimum of $3.5 million annually through March 2018, plus upside for meeting sales thresholds. It basically generates $7 million from this business per year, with a $3.5 million floor. The Products business I assume absorbs almost all of the 20 or so Chinese employee cost and the cost of the 20 or so US employees, and should be shut down. In fact, a possible catalyst emerged, also hidden in the 10-K filing, that MSN expects a 15% loss of Products revenue in 2016. That's a $900k loss to the pretax earnings at current margins. The deterioration may force change. If this business were shut down, it would save shareholders about $3-4 million in 2016, thus allowing the full drop-through of the lucrative licensing business. It appears management has no choice if it wants to avoid a fight with shareholders already agitating for change (see Item 4. The investor, Larry Miller III whom I admire, is a small-cap version of Carl Icahn). Update, today on further buying by Mr. Miller and more "active" activism, the stock price began showing signs of life. The chart below shows a waterfall depicting a conservative market valuation of the company, assuming a full inventory write-down, as well as a write-off of deferred tax assets and leaseholds in PP&E: With $43.4 million of this $58 million value being cash, and the company trading at $30 million, an investment in MSN is nearly riskless with a great margin of safety. The company's tiny $30 million market capitalization, penchant for missing filing deadlines (7/10 of the past annual filings were late) and lack of float and liquidity are likely reasons for both the inattention and the valuation at less than book value and cash. Furthermore, there is the possibility that the company will continue exposing itself to tax issues or litigation, destroying capital on the Products business, whether incentivized or forced by Grande Holdings, the controlling shareholder with whom MSN has many opaque related-party transactions. Also, consider how the company processed the release of this latest filing. I called and spoke with the company Treasurer and Investor Relations officer on June 16, who said that unless they delay filing, they would release "in the next two weeks." He was professional and cautious to share no information that would be non-public, so I couldn't tell if the company planned to delay. I thought it odd that this would be mentioned though. So, looking at the history of the company's filings, I saw that 7 out of the past 10 annual report filings had been delayed, so I was content expecting this to happen again. Apparently, the efficient all-knowing market was caught off-guard. On June 29, the company released this . A notification that it would delay filing an annual report due to evaluating the very same tax issue discussed above. A more cynical observer might conclude that a few savvy speculators were able to get in on the selling action early with non-public information, as the price began dropping prior to the company release, and no other news about the company was available. Overall, due to concern over Emerson Radio's tax positions, shares lost 20% of their value, measuring the value from just prior to the possible information leak to when the company released the news of a delay. Companies are typically expensive in today's market, and investors depend on impossible growth and lucky and brilliant managements to execute flawlessly to deliver free cash flow (maybe... some day) to support today's price. Luckily for MSN shareholders, unlocking value in this case is quite simple. All management needs to do is to close the Hackensack, NJ office, liquidate the assets, and sell the trademarks. In summary, uncertainty worth as much as 40% of the market value has been removed. The company has demonstrated brand value and monetizes it as a $3.5 million minimum annuity embedded in the licensing business. Two catalysts exist: 1) The company will have to make a big change to avoid losses in the products business which loses money today, which could result in a large increase to earnings by exiting the unprofitable business, and 2) An activist investor is pushing for change. Given these facts, it is reasonable to expect eventual value realization of $1.90 to $2.20 per share versus current trading range of $1.15 to $1.20 per share, and a nice 75% total return.
