TransDigm Group Inc. (NYSE: TDG ) is a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today. Management has grown the company by making and successfully integrating nearly 60 acquisitions since 1993. Some 90% of sales are generated by proprietary products and 80% from products for which TDG is the sole source provider. Some 54% of revenue is generated from higher margin aftermarket sales. TDG estimates that its products are installed on approximately 95,000 commercial transport, regional transport, military and general aviation fixed wing turbine and rotary wing aircraft. TDG's L + 300bp Term Loan C is attractive, trading at 97.5 with a yield to worst of 4.44%. It is a large, liquid issue and matures in February 2020. We also recommend TDG's 7.5% Senior Subordinated Notes due 7/15/2021 trading at 101.25 to yield 7.08%, 567 over Treasuries. TDG is highly profitable, typically producing EBITDA margins that bracket 45% and generating high levels of free cash flow. Leverage at first blush appears high but is supported by significant cash generation, ample liquidity and an equity-market capitalization of $11.1 billion. We like the shorter end of the capital structure because TDG is likely to come back to the high-yield market sooner rather than later to finance an acquisition or pay a special dividend. Being in one of the three tranches of secured bank debt or one of the bond issues that matures inside May 2022, the farthest maturity of the term loans, reduces the risk of short-term volatility from a new issue. On February 9, 2016, TDG reported results for its fiscal first quarter ended January 2, 2016. First-quarter results were slightly below expectations but TDG as usual produced significant free cash flow. For the quarter net sales were $701.7 million, up 19.6% from $586.9 million for the corresponding year earlier period. Acquisitions completed during fiscal 2015 accounted for all of the sales increase with organic sales down 1.1%. TDG experienced some weakness in the commercial transport aftermarket because of industry inventory management and deferred airline spending. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $319.4 million compared to $269.7 million. EBITDA margins were 45.5% down from 46.0% reflecting some dilution from the fiscal 2015 acquisitions. EBITDA coverage of interest expense was 2.85X and the company generated $155 million of operating free cash flow. On January 2, 2016, TransDigm had $805.3 million of cash, up from $714.0 million at fiscal year-end September 30, 2015. On TDG's February 9, 2016, earnings conference call, management provided full fiscal year 2016 guidance. The company expects revenue for fiscal 2016 to amount to between $3.1 billion and $3.2 billion. It expects commercial OEM revenue to be up a mid-single-digit percentage, commercial aftermarket to be up a high-single-digit percentage and defense to be down slightly. Management expects adjusted EBITDA for the full fiscal year to be just over $1.4 billion with EBITDA margins 45.3%. Thus, EBITDA coverage of $450 million of interest expense should amount to 3.1X. Based on management's guidance TDG will have driven net leverage to 4.9X by fiscal year-end 2016. At January 2, 2016, the company's backlog amounted to $1.44 billion compared with $1.43 billion at fiscal year-end 2015 and $1.20 billion at fiscal year-end 2014. The above outlook assumes no acquisitions, share buybacks or special dividends for the remainder of fiscal 2016. On the call management said that it has the capacity to make $1.5 billion of acquisitions without issuing equity. In fact, TransDigm's board authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $450 million in late January. Capitalization, Leverage and Liquidity Total debt currently amounts to $8.4 billion, or $7.6 billion net of $805 million cash. Atop the capital structure sits $4.6 billion of senior secured bank debt. Net leverage through the senior secured debt was 3.0X. Below the senior secured debt are five tranches of senior subordinated debt totaling $3.9 billion. Net leverage through the senior subordinated debt was 6.0X. But leverage viewed from an enterprise value perspective appears less aggressive. As of the market close on February 19, 2016, TDG had an enterprise value of $18.8 billion. Net senior secured debt to enterprise value is a modest 20.2% and net senior subordinated debt to enterprise value is just 41.0%. TDG is highly liquid and has long generated significant amounts of free cash flow. TDG forecasts that cash balances will grow to $1.2 billion by fiscal year end. Contributing to the company's strong liquidity profile is a light debt maturity schedule. From fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2019 debt maturities are just $43.8 million annually.
