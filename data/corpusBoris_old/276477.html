During today's call, I will start with some brief opening remarks about our financial and operational performance during the year and then will be turning the call over to my partner Mark Goldwasser, who will give you a review of our business segments. After Goldie's remarks, we will then hear from our Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Operating Officer, Glen Worman, who will discuss our financial a much greater detail. When Glen is finished, I will wrap up and then we will open the call to your questions, but what we are not going to be able to discuss today on today's call are the unsolicited offers made by B Riley and CP Pharma to purchase the company. As these [ph] are matters that are under consideration by our board and our financial advisors, I hope you understand that it would not be appropriate for us to either comment on them or [ph] feel questions about them during today's call. Now turning to fiscal 2015, it was a challenging year for us. We have met some strong headwinds overshadowing a number of positive business segment developments latter [ph] demonstrating the benefits of our diversified business model in meeting headwinds. These factors included market volatility, weak commodity prices uncertainty about the Fed's actions and they all contributed to a weaker market environment for trade execution and lower volumes for us. That also produced the lasting negative impact on our commission business throughout the year as well as on transfer fees and clearing services that are very highly correlated with trade execution volumes. These factors also contributed significant difficulties for us regarding gains on net inventory, dealer net inventory rather. On the positive side, however, we generated the record investment bank results and moderate growth for our investment advisory and tax preparation accounting businesses and we successfully recruited our alternative products platform. We also continued to add registered representatives and advisors at a continued steady pace throughout the year. Although the incremental revenue uplift in profit contribution from these additions has a lag time, it is not immediately material to the results for this year. It is because typically the time that it takes for these registered reps to complete their account transfer and get up to speed and ramp up their business to normalized production levels takes some time, sometimes as long as nine months. We do believe however that we will be able to begin to realize the full benefit of these additions of the new advisor and reps at both, the top-line and the bottom-line during the course of 2016 fiscal year. In the face of continued market weakness, we maintained net income and EBITDA profitability for the third and fourth consecutive fiscal years and continued expense control and cost reductions. Additionally, we recorded some non-recurring expenses during the fiscal year, which depressed our bottom-line. These one-time expenses were related to compensation, legal fees, consulting fees and a number of other provisions and they got that somewhat over $2 million or $2.1 million was the number. If you are adjusting for all these one-time items, pretax income could have been approximately $2.6 million, adjusted EBITDA would have been $4.8 million, so well above the figures that we reported. Obviously a better commission environment would have brought more to the bottom-line. While dynamic remained somewhat rooted to factors beyond our control, we are encouraged by the fact that we believe we have the right business model to best weather weak markets and then expect to greatly benefit when stronger commission markets reassert themselves. At the end of this fiscal first-quarter, we are happy to say see those trends are evidence themselves now. Thanks, Robert, and good morning everyone. Let me start by giving you my perspective on the year. All-in-all, I have to say, I find it frustrating that we are successfully executing in what we believe is a very challenged strategy while not bringing more income to the bottom-line because of a very weak market environment. We too [ph] that our true earnings potential is well above our reported numbers, - Robert that we have a solid business model in place to drive profitability once the market environment improves and revenue from commissions begin to grow again. I will now run you through our business segments. Our core retail brokerage operations and extensive network of registered employees and independent brokers and advisors offer board range of financial products and services to retail institutional clients. In fiscal 2015, revenues from commissions and transfer fees and clearing services totaled $$104.2 million versus $123 million in previous year. Of the $18.8 million decline, commissions accounted for roughly $18.1 million. The drop related to lower transaction volume, a volatile market environment and show off the lower [ph] sales of alternative investment products. On the positive side, our alternative investment products continued improving sales as the second half of the year's progress as a result of the salary assessment we took in our second fiscal quarter 2015, which yielded a more diverse platform with the reintroduction certain product and introduction of a number of new ones. We have seen further signs of improvements in our first quarter of fiscal 2016. Our strategy [ph] to enlarge our distribution network by recruiting registered reps and advisors, while individual small and groups is working well as our industry both, independent the small broker-dealer continues to consolidate. In fiscal 2015, we enjoyed a record recruiting season and our forward pipeline remains as robust as we have seen. Deal environments for us, we are proud to become known as the destination of choice for so many high-caliber brokers looking for new home, particularly in the tri-state area. Of the year, we added 59 producing registered reps and advisors with $21.5 million trailing 12, production. We have expanded our assets under management by $1.17 billion. As a reminder, these figures represent only strategic additions we made at the corporate level. Our local branching's recruiting was robust. As a result the steps we have been taking to strengthen our retail brokerage operations, we began fiscal 2016, with an expanded and more productive distribution network through which to offer our outset of device product and a distribution network that is valuable to many other banks who want to place with syndicated deal to our retail base. In our investment banking operations, a business that addresses the underserved capital needs of emerging growth companies, we pulled the strong steel pipeline throughout the year that produced solid offerings and execution. Revenues for fiscal '15 increase 10% to $21 million, a record year versus $19 million in the prior year. We - in a full year total of 43 transactions, comprised of mix of private the leading co-managed deals, of course healthcare, financial, technology, real estate and energy. Highlights [ph] included a acting as a sole book runner in the successful $37.5 million IPO for Aqua Metals and the follow-on on lead offering for VolitionRx and Harvard Apparatus technology. Also in the first quarter of fiscal '16, we were the sole placement agent. In the recently announced private placement for Checkpoint Therapeutic, our largest private placement ever completed. Moving onto trading, our net dealer inventory revenues in fiscal '15 continue to contract declining 36% to $10.5 million, the prior year at $16.5 million. As has been the case throughout the year, trading volumes coupled with low interest rates and low market volatility it well contributed to weaker trading environment particularly for equities, municipal and corporate debts and treasury bonds we are trading is highly concentrated. In our asset management business, investment advisory fees increased 6% to $15 million versus $14.2 million the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the addition of new advisors and assets. Lastly, our tax preparation accounting business increased revenue by 6% to $8.2 million versus the prior years, in part as a result of a tax preparation accounting offer that require February 2015. The bottom-line is that we have a sound strategy in place as we will continue to execute against this in fiscal '16. We will continue to expand our retail broker and advisor network as well as offering a diverse products and services we distribute throughout that network. It will also drive improved profitability by implementing further cost controls as we scale [ph]. I will now turn the call over to Glen Worman, who will provide some overview comments on operations and financials. Glen? Thanks, Goldie. Good morning, everyone. Before I take you through the financial highlights of our earnings which were filed yesterday on Form 10-Q, I think it is important to address what we have been doing to improve our operating and as a results future earnings potential. Over the last few months, we have reduced the size of our corporate staff as well as compensation levels where appropriate. We are using some of these savings to actively recruit professionals to produce deeper analytical capabilities and support efficiency and enhance revenue production. We have also named a new head of our National sales organization and National Securities to improve the focus registered reps and offerings for them. We are rationalizing our technology and real estate platforms and we will continue in early 2016 to review every individual in our corporate organization. Within our business segments, we are focused on reviewing our cost of revenue generation to improve our gross margins. As business levels improve, we are committed to keeping a tight control on spending. For our fiscal year 2015, ending September 30, we reported total revenues for $163 million, which represented declined of 12% versus revenue of $184.3 million in the prior year. Principal components of revenue in the year was filed as commissions and related fees $96.2 million, investment banking $21 million, investment advisory $15 million, principal transactions also known as net dealer inventory gains of $10.5 million, tax, prep and accounting $8.2 million and interest, dividends and other totaling $4.1 million. On the expense side, cost declined for the fiscal year by 8% versus the prior year with the most meaningful declining coming in commissions compensation of these category, which was down less in revenues at 8% to $139.5 million. We were also able to realize double-digit declines in our costs related to clearing fees and other administrative expenses. Somewhat offsetting these declines were 5% from professional fees to $4.3 million and a 6% increase in our licensing and registration expenses to $1.7 million. As Robert stated, $2.1 million of our expenses are non-recurring. Despite the 12% decline in year-over-year revenue and inclusion of the one-time expenses I noted, we still reported operating income of roughly $0.5 million dollars for fiscal 2015. While we are well short of the $7.8 million reported in the prior fiscal year good expense management help maintain profitability. Net income was $0.3 million or $0.02 per basic and diluted share for the year compared to net income of $18.6 million or $1.51 and $1.50 per share basic and diluted, respectively, for the year ended September 30, 2014. Net income in fiscal 2014 benefited from the recognition of significant tax credits, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $10.8 million and adjusted EBITDA, which is obviously a non-GAAP measure was $2.7 for this year versus $10.4 million in the prior year. As it relates to our balance sheet as of September 30, we had cash and cash equivalents, which included receivables from our clearing firm and marketable securities of approximately $28.8 million, roughly 45% of our total assets as compared to $30.5 million and 47% of our assets in the prior fiscal year. The company's stockholders' equity was $45.3 million, represented the 2% increase compared to $44.5 million as of September 30, 2014. We continue to have a debt free balance sheet. Thanks, Glen. In closing our prepared remarks, the point I would like to make sure everyone understands is that we are not satisfied with our fiscal 2015 simply because we are able to maintain profitability in what was a challenging environment. Disappointed with the numbers, our industry has struggle this year and many of our competitors had similarly worse results, but we do not measure our performance are relative terms, but an absolute ones. The headwinds that we faced in 2015 million may have been daunting, but they only deter us from feeling good about the fact that our market position and prospects going forward are strong. We have taken many steps thus far to improve our competitive position and position ourselves for growth and we will take many more as we strive to return to a more normalized acceptable level of profitability for this company. As we enter fiscal 2016, we have cautious optimism. Recent market indications in our business segments have shown positive trends. Our underlying profitability is exhibiting signs of a more robust environment and we have shown in our reported numbers for 2015 and we continue to believe that we are pointed in the right direction. We are committed to capitalizing on opportunities that will add scale to our business. We really do want to grow opportunities to continue to arise when firms combine and we find talented individuals being dislocated are in search of a new venue and these may present themselves as individuals, small groups or firms. As we have said before, but I feel pleasure repeating, we are known in the market for giving brokers and advisors a growing and stable platform both, as individuals and groups and they are continuing to show that they are attracted to that and attracted to National Holdings. Good morning. I jumped on a few minutes late, so I probably I might have missed this, but I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the inquiries you have gotten namely from my B. Riley, and then I think there was a spec. Both of those I think are former CEOs of the company are involved with each of those, so I am kind of curious I do not know if you said something earlier discussed in detail. I apologize, but I just want to get more color on that and what you have thought of the offers and the relative attractiveness of each and so forth.. …to jump on, like - one thing I started to preamble is that something we are just not going to be able to discuss on the, because of the tendency and currency of this advice of both, councilor and our advisors. They felt, we just can't, going into the conference call at this point. Sorry. Yes. The deal has impacted most of the independent broker dealer businesses. I want to further committee [ph] and they say despite the fact that administration is rushing to get it done before the Nation it still hasn't been done - in fact the SEC [ph]. What is interesting is, I think the relative impact on our business is going to be a lot less than on the traditional independent, because we have a smaller percentage of our business that is linked to IRAs and flow line pay and retirement accounts and I will check that out with our clearing firm. They say relative to similar BDs of size, we have the lowest percentage of business dependent on IRAs and retirement accounts. Anything, I think it just affords us more volatility and more pressure and therefore more opportunities. I think that is the general line. Now, are you guys seeing anything in terms of growing your business from the stuff that is going on at Arcap, and are you getting inquiries into you proactively at this point or I can't imagine if I held my shingle there then I want to stay. You know, one, we are talking to a lot of people involved in Arcap. There has been more noise than actual no panic exits, but you know we have been recruiting from a variety of our Arcap's broker-dealers nothing that material yet to report, but we stand ready when the dam breaks, if it breaks. We find independent. They like stability, and obviously there is a lack of stability at the moment, but because most of these independent offices are independent contractors, they have picked their spots and we will see. I mean, we are there within ready to catch and as Goldie said, we have selective opportunities, but we think they are going to increase over time. A lot of people in the industry, especially small firms like yours, complaining about the regulations. They say it is very difficult. Some of them think that the government wants to put them out of business. When we think about independent contractors and you may call them independent contractors, but they may say the employees get involved with the government was very pro-employee and place anti-business, why do we have to grow as a private company when it may be better to merge with a bigger company if that is possible. Relatively small - our stock is getting smaller and smaller even though somebody is coming here and try to hold the CEO try to take over and made an offer above what the market is and why aren't we moving in that direction? …say that - you are not making your comment it is the end of the year. You are not even making a comment about this gentlemen, the stock is a sitting here, well below the price that is offered and the that we understand that everybody likes to keep their job and protect themselves, but we are living in a very uncertain world especially with securities and brokers. Everybody is looking to us said we are losing money in a lot of people were - they are not too… I am just asking you, in this uncertain world, do you guys have this idea about growing and doing well in the future? Our idea is going to be what it always has been, to do the best for our shareholders and receive offers. We obviously do the right thing - conserve them and when it is time for them to be discussed publicly they will be. Whatever the opportunity is, our goal is to be able to present to shareholders the best opportunity for the stock to go up. While we talk about growth, when you are operating a company, you can't assume that an offer is going to close. You have to assume that you have to continue to operate the company while you evaluate the prospect of anything that is put forward to you, which I can assure you, we are doing. To that end, at appropriate time, we will be able to discuss these things. It is just the timing of this call does not happen to be the time that we can do that, okay, but we take role very seriously and when there is particularly a premium offered to the current market price as fiduciaries those offers get considered, they get thoroughly, thoroughly embedded, and when the appropriate time is to comment on what is going on you can rest assure that you will be able to hear that from us directly. …the three months. Is it going to be a month from now? You know, or does it get varied for three months? All right, I just hope we hear something soon. I am not saying this offering is any good. In my opinion it is still low, way too slow for this company. You guys have a lot of stock and I think it is in your interest and long [ph] to maximize the value of that stocking. Then again we were supposed to be borrowing back stock. I do not know if we did it or we are in a position to be able to do it now with this offer on the table. We did repurchase stock throughout the quarter. We have withdrawn for the market during the pendency of these offers. I am the largest shareholder, so your interest regardless of shareholding and mine are absolutely aligned. I have only one wish and that is for us to get the opportunities and to be presented with the opportunities to be able have the highest value for our shares and you can be certain of that. I work for very small salary. My only real economic interest here is having the stock go up. All right, thank you gentlemen. Happy New Year. Appreciate your word. You got a great name and it is not an easy environment. I think you did relatively well compared to what is going on in this world. Thank you. Okay. If there are no further questions in the queue, then I would thank everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in National Holdings. We look forward to speaking with you again at the conclusion of our next quarter and we hope that a lot of questions that you may have that we weren't able to address today, will become apparent to by the timing we have our next call, we will have a whole different bunch of things to talk about. This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.
