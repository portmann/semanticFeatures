Is QE4 On The Cards? | Seeking Alpha Marc Faber is of the opinion that there will be no rate hike and policymakers will announce QE4 instead. While I agree on potential delay in rate hike due to a strong dollar, I don't see a fresh round of QE in the foreseeable future. Another round of QE would also depend on the policy steps by ECB and Japan in the coming quarters. While economists globally are debating on the timing of an interest rate hike, there seems to be an exception in view. Dr. Marc Faber is of the opinion that US is likely to see QE4 instead of an interest rate hike. This article discusses the rationale for this view and my opinion on the likelihood of further QE in the United States. According to Faber, one of the key problems with the US economy is lack of affordability with inflation much higher than suggested by headline government numbers. Faber also opines that people are spending, but the frequency of discretionary spending has dropped and this will keep the real economy weak. I am in complete agreement with Faber on both these points. I discussed the factors for weak discretionary consumption spending yesterday and the views in that article are in sync with Faber's view. I had also earlier discussed that real inflation in the United States is meaningfully higher. Therefore, from a discretionary consumer spending perspective, I am bearish and if discretionary consumer spending was the only economic driver, I would have clearly opined that US would need continued QE. Faber is also of the following view - "All the central banks are so deep in the mud that, in my view, they will continue to essentially buy assets." I agree with this view as well and I believe that most governments are in an inescapable debt trap. Just as an example, the CBO expects US budget deficits to be $7 trillion over the next 10 years. This implies higher government debt and it also implies huge debt servicing cost once interest rates trend higher. From this perspective, I agree with Faber that the government is likely to continue buying Treasuries to keep yields suppressed. I am however not sure about the success of this action over the long-term in keeping interest rates artificially low. The point where I disagree with Faber is the timeline of any financial crisis. I don't see another big financial crisis unfolding in the foreseeable future. The financial system has a liquidity glut and this will keep the financial system afloat even when it does little to boost the real economy. I therefore don't see the financial system imploding anytime soon even when that is imminent over the next decade. I also believe that the Fed is unlikely to unleash a new QE, even when the Fed can potentially delay the rate hike into 2016 or well into 2016. The primary reason for believing that the Fed can push an interest rate hike to a later date is the dollar. In several of my earlier articles, I have provided FOMC minute discussions that point to the Fed being seriously concerned about a strong dollar and its impact on GDP growth. I can say with conviction that no interest rate hike is coming until the dollar weakens significantly. However, extension of the current QE (in the form of low interest rates) is likely than a new QE package. The reason for believing that another QE is not on the cards is the point that the US economy has shown resilience even without any QE. Even when discretionary consumer spending is low, non-discretionary consumer spending coupled with government spending is likely to keep the economy afloat. While the economy remains weak, there are no immediate term triggers of recession. In my view, only a meaningful threat of recession can trigger another QE. I also believe that another round of QE might depend on what the Euro zone and Japan policymakers do in the coming quarters. If the QE in these two regions is extended, dollar strength might sustain and force US policymakers to resort to easing to weaken the dollar. Considering the point that the Fed wants a weak dollar, inflation is likely to trend higher in the coming years and I expect the sell-off in Treasuries to continue. However, a weak dollar will be positive for asset classes such as equities (NYSEARCA: SPY ), Gold (NYSEARCA: GLD ) and commodities. I therefore remain positive on these asset classes from a medium to long-term investment horizon. In conclusion, I don't expect policymakers to unleash a new round of QE, but I do expect the current QE (in the form of low interest rates) to be extended into 2016. Further, I don't expect recession in the US, but I do expect growth to remain volatile and relatively sluggish. In my view, low consumption spending coupled with an ever growing government sector are the biggest hindrance to robust economic growth.
