The Harsh Winter Actually Boosted The US Economy In Q1, As Did Obamacare  | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! The airline has been working with its banks and the relevant authorities and understands that the funds â€“ less than $5 million â€“ have now been frozen. Although the sum stolen was relatively...

Even as the rest of the US economy was a major disaster with the clear exception of inventory accumulation, which at some point will have to be sold unleashing the next deflationary wave and forcing the Fed's helicopter to finally take off, another question is what happened to the US consumer: after all, in the US one can use Amazon in the comfort of one's snowed in home, and while the crash in oil turned out to be unambiguously bad (just as we warned) for CapEx, some 70% of the US economy was and is in the hands of the relentless spending habits of Joe Sixpack. Which is why a quick look at what said Joe spent in the harsh winter reveals something stunning: no, not that the most consumed "service" was again healthcare - mandatory spending on Obamacare will be with us for a long, long time, "boosting" the US economy by this mandatory spending item. No, what surprised even us is that far from subtracting from GDP growth, the harsh winter actually boosted consumption, in the form of Utility (i.e., heating) spending, which made up the second largest increase in personal consumption in the first quarter. Because, to every economist's cries of horror, freezing weather while perhaps reducing discretionary spending actually boosts spending on such mundane, if very expensive, tasks as utilities which, to the same economists, also translates into growth.

I pretty sure demand for healthcare services is down as deductables and premiums have risen. I see lots of layoffs at hospitals and clinics.

That's exactly right.  It's also why the government is forcing madatory spending on us with things like Obamacare.  That way they can mandate more spending any time they want. See?  And you didn't think central planning was a good thing.  We should all thank our betters for saving us from ourselves.  A .308 caliber "thank you" would be about right.

Ironic it is called healthcare as it isn't like ur allowed to go to the doctor one needs to even get the attention one needs! Fundamentally, no differences between the two.

I figure I'm 7600 to the good. Using surplus fiat to buy gold and silver instead of air. No freaking kidding.  My BCBS health insurance policy premium will be going up 12.45% starting July 1, 2015.  I have seen (on average) a double-digit percentage increase in the premium each of the last 3 years, and I have no known conditions and I haven't filed a single damn claim since I purchased the policy 5+ years ago.
