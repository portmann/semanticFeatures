Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! As the next Presidential election nears, optimism regarding candidates and political parties ebbs and flows. Voters like to believe their candidate sees the problems and will fix them. This fundamental belief drives voting. But what if it isn’t true? What if government ain’t fixable? Or can’t be changed? What then? Government Ain’t Fixable and People Are Sensing It The public increasingly recognizes that the opportunity to choose between two candidates is not working very well. The election process allows for a peaceful transfer of power but if the only change is in the the names and placeholders that media refer to as “leaders” But government continues to grow, become more expensive, more intrusive, less responsive and more burdensome. That is the way of government in this country for the half century I have been paying attention. The quadrennial event that is the Presidential election cycle is akin to Charlie Brown, Lucy and the football. Voters play the role of the hapless Charlie Brown. Lucy represents the political class and the football plays the role of campaign promises. The football is never kicked, altered or used. Yet hapless Charlie falls for the promise again and again. This election seems different. The public is beginning to understand the game. Some are rebelling. How else does one explain the popularity of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders? H. L. Mencken’s wisdom regarding democracy, politics  and politicians is gaining followers. Mencken’s litany of disgust is too prolific to deal with other than to suggest that the public may be realizing that: Every election is a sort of advance auction sale of stolen goods. Increasing numbers understand this observation and that they are the victims in the game. Government is too large and entrenched to be changed by elections. The political establishment considers themselves to be privileged and pretends to like and tolerate citizens. The truth is that the citizenry are nothing more than a commodity to the rulers. Their votes and pocketbooks are mined so that political lifestyles can be continued. This reality is becoming apparent to more and more citizens who recognize the government as Lucy and themselves as Charlie Brown. The football is always promised but never delivered. The story of this election is the number of people dissatisfied with Lucy and her behavior. In a sense this election is beginning to look like a protest similar to the Boston Harbor tea party. It is likely a precedent that will not directly change anything,  although the retrospective of history may recognize it as the first shot fired in the coming rebellion against oppressive government. No one can fix government. Even if Donald Trump or Hillary/Bern were the best managers in the world, they could only have a marginal impact even if they were inclined. Government is too far gone and too deeply entrenched. It is a gigantic blob immune to common sense, cost control or the will of the citizens it pretends to serve. People are expected to serve it, a complete contradiction of the stated goal of the Founders. It grows and enriches itself (and its members) simply because it can.  It is no different from an unaccountable criminal enterprise, exempting itself from laws it imposes on others. In point of fact, it is less efficient than organized crime which must generate a profit under less than ideal circumstances. Most Mafia-run businesses provide a service or value to their customers in excess of what it costs. Government has no need to do so and is especially ineffective and inefficient. Government is Leviathan. It looks out for itself and no one person or small group can alter that condition. Government will correct, but not willingly. Today it is at the point where the plant from Little Shop of Horrors was in this clip: The conflicted Seymour represents the citizens of this country, subject to increasing demands and monetary contributions. Both the plant and the government demand contributions while provide little service or benefits in return. Government is as addicted to more every bit as much as the demanding plant. It knows no other way other than to spend to continue its scam. Government ain’t fixable but it will correct because there are limits to what people and economies will bear. Government is out of money and hopelessly indebted. Yet it continues to spend as if it had the money. It has seriously wounded the host on which it parasitically survives. The golden goose no longer can shake off the effects of the government burden. The economy is stagnant. Confiscatory taxation and regulatory burdens prevent private capital formation. Without capital, standard of living and employment stagnate. The economy will continue to deteriorate and people will continue to become poorer until the system collapses of its own weight or the people revolt. Either represents a cataclysmic event! For a time monetary printing can disguise the deterioration. States and municipalities are unable to print money. Their unnecessary and wasteful schemes are surfacing. Puerto Rico demands a bailout. So will Illinois and dozens of other governmental entities.  California is driving its productive class away . That is also happening at the Federal level where both people and companies are voting with their feet. The renouncement of US citizenship is exploding as is the relocation of corporate headquarters out of this country. Government as we know it is doomed. It will not recognize this reality until markets and/or citizens force it. This time is likely close and the process will not be painless. The more government ignores what is inevitable the greater the pain will be. One hopes that civilization does not enter an economic and anarchical Dark Ages. To the extent that government refuses to respond to the fantasy world they have created, the more likely that is to be the outcome. Everyone has heard more than their share of stories about government inefficiency and stupidity. It is difficult to point to any government agency run effectively or achieving the ends for which it was created. The War on Poverty has increased poverty. The Department of Education was formed at the peak of educational effectiveness and everything has gone downhill since. What does the Department of Energy do besides make it more difficult to achieve more energy? The Internal Revenue Service has become a political tool to hammer opponents who do not hold the presidency. Hasn’t the Veteran’s Administration done a wonderful job for the medical care of our veterans? ObamaCare has driven health-care costs through the roof and put a damper on the creation of jobs like nothing else. And now this inefficiency seems to be reaching new heights in the TSA, the agency that fails miserably on routine tests to find contraband and other items prohibited. Now we are told that this agency is going to impose the loss of millions of hours of wait time because it cannot do its job properly. The following video shows what is coming: All the money being spent on preventing terrorism has not stopped one terrorist act at an airport. If you are a traveler, you are more likely to become a terrorist as a result of treatment by your own government than to be protected from terrorism. Sat, 05/21/2016 - 21:17 | 7589754 LetThemEatRand Yeah, tell that to the few hundred families that control the majority of the world's wealth.   Taxes and regulations are currently designed to concentrate wealth among a few private individuals.  Our elected government has become a means to that end, but it was also that way a long time before America or other "free" societies existed.  I suppose the Kings used to call taxes "tribute."  The problem is the sociopaths.  So long as we allow them to exist and rule us, we shall be slaves.  But let's debate candidates and isms instead.  Sat, 05/21/2016 - 21:30 | 7589790 malek Didn't you forget to mention that the only way to not be a sociopath is to accept one has to follow the social contract - which you somehow signed before being born? Sat, 05/21/2016 - 21:47 | 7589825 LetThemEatRand If you live in the woods by yourself and you don't affect your nearest neighbor, you are free.  Otherwise, there is the fact that what you do affects others, and vice-versa.  That is all the social contract means. Sat, 05/21/2016 - 22:06 | 7589876 philipat The article, pehaps somewhat arrogantly. equates the US with civilization. Using USG and civilization in the same sentence is oxymoronic. You believe the "social contract" means "my freedom ends where it cuts into your freedom" and nothing more?   And you are/would be willing to argue against any more sweeping interpretation? Sat, 05/21/2016 - 21:33 | 7589795 flaminratzazz The _paths have always ruled. That is the way. To be a ruler one has to be evil wicked mean and nasty or they are replaced by someone with these attributes. The real problem lies at the fatal flaw in humanity itself. we as a specie, that should know better destroys everything around us and call it good. We strip mine the planet, destroy the oceans, ground, air and waters, all for digits in a computer bank. THAT my friend is madness. Sat, 05/21/2016 - 23:16 | 7590014 LetThemEatRand Mankind is flawed to be sure, but the root problem is not that we destroy.  We also create, just as the earth itself does both.  The earth can create a fire, and then regrow.   We can plant trees and crops after a fire we set to increase productivity of the land. The root problem is that we tend to follow those who destroy more than those who create.  A few times throughout history we as a species have found a balance.  Can you believe it!  Just to get on a dirty stinky tube crammed like sardines.

We had hoped to be number 5 to adopt COS but now we have to fight battles to get our state reps to recognize that it is time for the adults to step into the room and decide whether we even need a federal government, and if so, how should it be modified to represent the states as it was originally created to do.

It's the "Deep State" that's in control. That doesn't change with elections.  Sat, 05/21/2016 - 22:16 | 7589896 gregga777 Revolution is the only solution.  But, I'm extremely pessimistic that pussified Americans, who volunteer to be terrorized by TSA burger-flipping rejects have the balls to stand up for themselves. Sat, 05/21/2016 - 22:31 | 7589935 The Merovingian There will be no revolution, there will simply be a reset.  Presuming, of course, that the solar flare is big enough to kill the grid, kill the TeeVee, kill the GPS, kill the gadgets, shut off the EBT, etc.   And then just sit back and wait for everyone to eat each other. Tear it down and replace it with what? Sat, 05/21/2016 - 22:32 | 7589937 DaBard51 Give the voters some credit... they created the state of perpetual gridlock between Executive and Legislative branches of Federal government to keep the feds from screwing things up any worse than they are already. But voters seemed to underestimate the cleverness of motivated, determined fools. Sat, 05/21/2016 - 23:07 | 7590001 Paul Kersey The Government Class folks have succeeded wildly in perpetuating themselves, growing their numbers, enriching themselves and in increasing their power through taxation, regulation and though revolving door, high power/high pay private contracting jobs. It is no surprise that "six of the top-ten richest counties in America are in Virginia and Maryland, and 13 of the top-30 richest counties form a continuous circle around the nation's capital".  The Government Class folks ain't living in Flint, MI or Camden, NJ.

Sat, 05/21/2016 - 23:50 | 7590085 NoWayJose We just need to go back to being 50 states that are united, rather than being one country ruling and controlling 50 states.  The country is so divided that there can never be any peaceful resolution of the differences.  Do rather than trying to enforce them on all 50 states, we need to let each state have more power over themselves and be able to pass their own laws for bathroom usage.
