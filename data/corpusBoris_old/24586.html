Is The Spanish Economy Really Outperforming Its European Peers? | Seeking Alpha While GDP growth in Spain has been higher than the EU average, other economic fundamentals are quite similar to the rest of the euro area. Spain still shows similar deflationary trends, and consumer spending is not higher than the euro area as a whole. I suspect Spanish economic growth will eventually converge in line with the rest of the euro area. When looking at Spain's GDP growth from a hard numbers perspective, the economy is growing at a significantly faster pace than the EU average. We can see that from mid-2014, growth in the euro area ranged from 0.1-0.3%, while that of Spain ranged from 0.5-0.8%. Clearly, Spain has been on the mend and has been performing well. However, does this growth truly represent outperformance compared to other EU countries, or is Spain simply making up for lost time in this regard? For instance, when we look at some of Spain's economic fundamentals, they do not seem all that different from the general euro area. With the euro area teetering on the brink of deflation, we can see that Spain in fact has a slightly lower inflation rate: Additionally, it is hard to make the case that GDP growth can be attributed to government stimulus or increased consumer spending for that matter. From the below charts, we see that while overall government spending in the euro area rose by 1.3% since 2013, Spain's rate of government spending actually fell by -4% during this period. Moreover, when we compare consumer spending in Spain to that of France (which also is at risk of deflation and has shown lower GDP growth than average), we see that consumer spending in Spain rose by 7% since the beginning of 2013, France's rate of consumer spending rose by 8.3%. We can see that while Spain has a higher GDP growth rate on paper, its economic fundamentals are not all that different from the rest of the eurozone. In my opinion, the increased rate of growth that we are witnessing in Spain may in fact be similar to that of the Irish Celtic Tiger in the 1990s. Many economists had credited Ireland with a significantly faster rate of growth than its European peers. However, this does not take into account that Ireland's growth lagged far behind other European countries before this period. In this sense, Ireland was simply making up for lost time. I suspect that the case of Spain may be a similar one. Ultimately, economic fundamentals in Spain do not stand out compared to the eurozone as a whole. While GDP Growth may be above the EU average, I expect that Spanish growth will eventually converge in line with the rest of Europe given similar consumer spending rates and inflation trends.
