Should Investors Focus On Government Policy To Make Money? | Seeking Alpha Currently, the Federal Reserve seems to have created a situation in which hedge funds believe that they can make a lot of money. This kind of investment in not new, but is a type that has grown in importance over the past fifty or sixty years. I think I was trying to be a little too ironic yesterday in my post " Can Hedge Funds Be Wrong? ". My argument was that the Federal Reserve has created a situation where investors believe that there is an 80 percent probability that the Fed will raise its short-term policy rate at the meeting of the FOMC on December 16 and 17. It seems as if hedge funds are so sure that the rate will be increased that by December 1, they had "net wagers" of almost $27 billion that the Fed would act in this way. This, I argued, was about as close to a sure thing as one could get in financial markets. Then I added "This, of course, is just what the Federal Reserve wants… to give the very wealthy a 'gimme putt' at year's end so that 2015 doesn't look so bad for them." Then I referred to my post, ""Bernanke Is Underwriting the Wealthy," posted on February 24, 2013, the most popular post I have ever written, and stated that "this is nothing new. The modern Federal Reserve has worked hard to perfect its ability to serve the wealthy ." No, I don't think that the Federal Reserve, or, any central bank, or any government "intentionally" creates a policy that is specifically designed to make the wealthy, wealthier. I do believe that the Federal Reserve, and other central banks, and government create situations where the wealthy can make lots and lots of money. The current situation is one in which officials of the Federal Reserve have tried to help out investors by providing them with "forward guidance" but have ended up creating a situation where sophisticated investors can take advantage of the efforts the central bank is making. One of the most famous recent examples of this is the case where George Soros made $1.0 billion by engaging in a "sure thing" in shorting the British pound. "In Britain, Black Wednesday (September 16, 1992) is known as the day that speculators broke the pound. They didn't actually break it, but they forced the British government to pull it from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). Joining the ERM was part of Britain's effort to help along the unification of the European economies. However, in the imperialistic style of old, she had tried to stack the deck." And, there are many, many other examples of situations like this. In fact, there has even been a book written titled "Profiting from Monetary Policy," by Thomas Aubrey, that examines the possibility of making money off of central bank actions. And, this is what macro hedge funds do for a living. But, this has been a growing problem over the past fifty-five years or so. Governments and central banks in the United States and elsewhere have created an environment in which "speculation" has become a normal part of the investing world. This environment has arisen as governments have focused upon, and even put into legislation, goals and objectives that create "speculative" investment opportunities by sophisticated investors. In the United States, the Full Employment Act of 1946, which stated that the US government was responsible for the stability of employment in the country. The government was encouraged to "promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power." This charge was translated in the early 1960s into a effort on the part of the Kennedy administration to "get the economy going again." By the late 1960s, the Republicans picked up the mantle and President Richard Nixon declared that "we are all Keynesians" is promoting economic policies to achieve high levels of employment. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, the expectation of the credit inflation created by the federal government became so great that President Nixon had to impose wage and price controls along with his policies of economic stimulation in order to try and control the forces that had been set loose. When a government declares that it is going to inflate the economy so as to achieve high levels of employment and will do this on a continuous basis regardless of which party has control of the White House or Congress, sophisticated investors are going to prepare themselves to take advantage of these efforts. John Maynard Keynes, the go-to source for many of the government programs aimed at creating high levels of employment, would have understood this effort, for Mr. Keynes was, himself, a "sophisticated investor". A reference here is John Wasik's book "Keynes's Way to Wealth." During his lifetime, Keynes made a lot of money "betting" against government policies. He also lost a lot from time-to-time, although "net" he came out well ahead. Keynes would have been one of the first to take advantage of the credit inflation created by government programs. By the early 1970s, however, investors began turning more and more toward assets, like homes, and gold, and paintings. Because of the price increases in coming decades, ownership of a home became the "piggy bank" of the middle class. But, as the credit inflation continued over time, we see that the investment became more sophisticated, the investors became more innovative creating many financial instruments to support their work, and money flowed more and more toward assets rather than capital investments. In the 1990s, investment in new companies, the dot.com boom, and government programs to extend support homeownership for many who did not have the financial means kept the credit inflation going. And, the 2000s experienced its own credit bubbles. The point is that the past fifty-plus years have resulted in a large class of investors that have learned to take advantage of whatever it is that the government is doing. The government's intention is "good" in the sense that it is "well intentioned." Ben Bernanke did not set out to create policies that lined the pockets of the wealthy. He set out to create a wealth effect that would spur on consumption spending that would stimulate the economy, stimulate capital investment, and put workers back to work. It just was the case that such actions produced a situation in which sophisticated investors could also benefit from the policy. But, a fundamental problem has arisen from this environment. Now, investors respond to government policies by directing funds into assets and not into productive capital investments. Thus, the stock market booms without real investment taking place. Commodity prices rise without economic growth. Investors use low interest rates to borrow and finance foreclosed properties to flip. And, so on and so forth. It is very telling when books on investment stress taking advantage monetary policy or macroeconomic movements rather than on investment value. How ironic?
