Japan's Delayed Tax Hike Implies More Stimulus Is On The Way - CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:FXY) | Seeking Alpha Shinzo Abe decided to delay next year's sales tax hike until 2019. He also announced a new fiscal stimulus package. Continued reliance on fiscal and monetary policy proves that Abenomics has failed. On Tuesday, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe decided to postpone next year's anticipated sales tax increase (from 8% to 10%) by more than two years until 2019. Mr. Abe also said that he would announce a new stimulus package later in the year, something we predicted in a previous article . Abe's announcement was inevitable given the country's deteriorating economic fundamentals and the unwillingness of policymakers to act in Japan's long-term best interests. Japan's continued dependence on expansionary fiscal and monetary policy underscores the failure of Abe's "Abenomics" growth model. And, while his policies have failed to drive Japan out of its rut, that is not stopping him from recommending more of the same measures that will harm the economy in the long-run. We see this latest announcement as a sign that Japan will continue to rely on stimulus, and that the BOJ is likely to execute another round of easing in 2016. This presents a trading opportunity, as the Nikkei (^N225) will likely go higher as new money finds its way into stocks. However, we do not recommend Japanese equities for long-term investment. Japan is stuck in a malaise of slow growth and low inflation. GDP has contracted in two of the last three quarters, and growth is expected to stagnate for the remainder of 2016. The country's top-heavy demographic presents a big challenge (people over the age of 65 account for a quarter of the population, and it is on track to reach 40%), and the economy is structurally imbalanced: According to Forbes, Japan's gross debt to GDP ratio was 245% last year. Productivity growth has slowed, a result of population ageing and a weak demand outlook that sees companies hoarding cash instead of investing it in capital equipment. According to the Economist, cash holdings amount to 50% of GDP, capital investment is below 2008 levels, and the gap between cash flow and investment is at record levels. This has occurred despite the introduction of negative interest rates that effectively compensate borrowers to spend in the present. Japan requires deep structural reforms if it is to stand any chance of correcting its structural imbalances and easing the debt burden. Abe's massive stimulus policies, which are largely responsible for the country's oversized debt levels, have done little to boost growth (Figure 2). This is because, as anyone with a true understanding of economics will tell you, the reliance on monetary and fiscal policy is not a recipe for sustainable real GDP growth (especially if the funds aren't being invested in a way that enhances a nation's productive capacity). But that is not stopping Abe from recommending the same "medicine" that put Japan into this mess in the first place, and the government's aim for a primary budget surplus by 2020 is looking less and less likely. The Prime Minister is using the slowdown in emerging markets to justify his stance, and while slowing growth in China has added to Japan's problems as of late, Abe's policies should be inwardly driven. Japan will not generate the economic growth necessary to meet its obligations without borrowing, but a reliance on debt is not sustainable, particularly when debt levels are already this high. The best thing for Japan would be to cut spending and raise taxes, and allow the automatic stabilizers from the ensuing recession to cushion any slowdown. There is no short-term solution for Japan. A recession today is much healthier than an economic collapse tomorrow, a fact that politicians and policymakers cast aside for their own benefit. Given Abe's willingness to introduce new fiscal stimulus measures, we see no reason to back away from our assumption that the BOJ will do the same later in the year, which will likely drive the Nikkei higher in 2016. Based on economic fundamentals we do not recommend Japanese equities for long-term investment. However there is a trading opportunity here. Investors can get exposure through the MAXIS Nikkei 225 ETF (NYSEARCA: NKY ), which tracks a broad market of Japan's largest stocks. The fund currently trades in the middle of its 52 week range, and we believe the market is underestimating the extent to which slow growth, deflation, and currency pressures (Japan is a net exporter and the strong yen is hurting export industries and reducing the earnings of profits earned in other currencies) will force the BOJ's hand.
