Cogentix Medical's (CGNT) CEO Rob Kill on Q2 2016 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha Good day ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Cogentix Medicalâ€™s Second Quarter Fiscal 2016 Financial Results Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, todayâ€™s conference call is being recorded. At this time, I would now like to introduce your host for todayâ€™s conference, Mr. Doug Sherk of EVC Group. Please go ahead sir. Thank you, Chrystel and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us for Cogentix Medicalâ€™s conference call to review financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 which ended on September 30, 2015. The news release announcing the results crossed the wire shortly after the market closed and is currently available on the Cogentix Medical website. We have arranged for a taped replay of this call, which can be accessed by phone. This call is also being streamed live on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.cogentixmedical.com and will be archived there. Before we get started, we would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, management will make projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events, including, but not limited to, statements about the benefits of the merger, expected revenue growth rates, the anticipated timing of cash flow break-even from operations and cash flow positive from operations and plans objectives, expectations and attentions with respect to future operations, products and services. These projections of forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. These risks and uncertainties, as well as others, are more fully discussed in the Companyâ€™s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 15, 2015, as well as subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other information filed by the company with the SEC. Additionally, the statements made on this conference call are made only as of today, November 3, 2015 and we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect future events or actual outcome and do not intend to do so. Finally, the reported basis for the financial presentation of the Companyâ€™s quarter fiscal year 2015 or â€œa year agoâ€? financial statements of operations includes only the former Uroplasty Inc. operations consistent with Uroplasty being deemed the accounting acquirer under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Management will make statements today regarding historical pro forma financial results which are non-GAAP but which we believe are helpful in more fully understanding our fiscal second quarter year-to-date and future performance. You reminded that the Companyâ€™s earnings release contains the reconciliation of such non-GAAP pro forma financial measures to GAAP. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Rob Kill, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cogentix Medical. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us today. With me on the call is Brett Reynolds, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as Darin Hammers, our Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing. Iâ€™ll begin with a brief review of our performance during the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 before I turn it back over to Brett for a deeper dive into our financials. The results we reported today build upon our strong momentum in the first quarter as our team continues to execute on the key performance metrics we outlined for you at beginning of this fiscal year. At the time of the merger we said that we will grow revenue at a faster rate than either Uroplasty or Vision Sciences would have grown on their own has seen in public companies and that this growth in combination with expensed energies would allow Cogentix become cash flow positive in fiscal year 2017. Also it was important to understand that the addition of the EndoSheath technology to our sales teams product portfolio would help us become an even more meaningful partner to our physician customers, as we would now offer additional innovative technologies to help these physicians build the practices. Iâ€™m pleased to report today that we continue to exceed our targets on the top-line and in management of costs, as we delivered meaningful double-digit revenue growth and an improving profitability profile, while simultaneously increasing the use of our innovative proprietary products by our physician customers. These factors that let us to provide updated guidance today that reflects our improved operating efficiencies and reduce cash burn, which we will talk about in more detail shortly, taking a look at the financial highlights of the quarter, revenue was $11.8 million representing growth of 12% over the pro forma combined results of the same period last year. Our 11% growth rate in the first half of this fiscal year puts Cogentix firmly on track to achieve our full year fiscal 2016 revenue guidance of approximately $49 million to $51 million. The 12% pro forma revenue growth in the quarter was driven by 24% growth in Urgent PC in the U.S., and 32% growth massively for EndoSheath technology products. As most of you know Urgent PC is our proprietary non-drug, non-surgical treatment option that addresses the very large market of the more than 40 million Americans who suffer from OAB and its symptoms. In this market approximately 10 million Americans are oftenly prescribed medications as a second line therapy, but nearly 90% of those patients have stopped taking those drugs after one year primarily due to their inherent side effects. After these drugs the next minor therapy includes Urgent PC, BOTOX and InterStim. Urgent PC is the least in basis of the three with a significantly lower risk profile for potential adverse events, as well has been a lower cost treatment option. The growing recognition by physicians of the value provided by the Urgent PC therapy for the OAB patients is validated by an approximate 25% revenue growth in the U.S. for Urgent PC in each of our fiscal first and second quarters. Our EndoSheath technology platform also provides an innovative technology that meets the needs of our urology customers for always stereo always ready flexible endoscopic solutions, the EndoSheath technology reduces the risk of cross contamination associated with the reuse or reprocessing of difficult between conventional endoscopes and also reduces the typical 45 minutes reprocessing time to less than 10 minutes. Allowing for greater patient throughput increased physician productivity and ultimately economic benefit for our customers. Our EndoSheath technology has been used in over 5 million procedures with zero reports of cross contamination. Our sales team has just entered the front end of the typical six to nine-month capital sales cycle for our EndoSheath technology and weâ€™re beginning to see early signs of success. One example is a large practice in Florida comprised of 25 urologists who were frustrated by frequent and costly endoscope repairs with their former vendor. The amount of scopes out for repair created a shortage of scopes in the practice and affected patient care, especially as it related to patient throughput. This practice evaluated the EndoSheath system in one of their busy offices and weâ€™re impressed by the improved efficiency and ease of use for their physicians and at the same time, the positive impact on patient scheduling and therefore patient satisfaction. As a result they made the decision to convert their entire practice to EndoSheath videoscopes. And as our sales team becomes more proficient with this technology overtime. We expect more success for this one. While weâ€™re pleased with our revenue growth, weâ€™ve also significantly minimized our cash operating losses through operational discipline. During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, our cash operating loss excluding merger related costs was approximately $400,000 down meaningfully from the $1.7 million loss in our fiscal first quarter. With our progress so far this year in executing on our growth targets and our high level of focus on identifying and implementing cost synergies for the merger weâ€™re today reaffirming our revenue guidance for fiscal year 2016 and updating our cash flow guidance based on improved operating efficiencies, which Brett will discuss in more detail. Thank you Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder the merger of Uroplasty and Vision-Sciences to from Cogentix Medical occurred on March 31, 2015. Many of my comparisons to prior period numbers will be based on the pro forma combined finance results that reflect the historic results of Uroplasty and Vision-Sciences prior to the merger occurring. The GAAP and pro forma information to be discussed in my remarks can be found in our earnings release. Further our earnings release contains a rationale behind why we believe investors may find this pro forma information useful and how we use such information as well as a reconciliation of such pro forma information to the directly comparable GAAP financial information. Please consider such information when listening to my remarks. As Rob mentioned, we carried our momentum from the first quarter into the second quarter. Total Q2 revenue increased 12% over pro forma combined revenue over year ago. And excluding the impact of changes and currency exchange rates, our growth was 14%. The driver of this growth was revenue from products sold in the U.S., which totaled $8.8 million in the current quarter, up 21% on a pro forma basis from the year ago period. The continued effectiveness of our direct sales force in the U.S., which consists of 42 reps selling our urology products and six reps selling our Airway Management product was a primary reason for the domestic revenue growth in the second quarter. Revenue from our international business totaled $3 million in the second quarter, down 9% from a year ago. Slightly over two-thirds of the decrease in international revenue in the second quarter is due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Looking at revenue contribution by product in the quarter, Urgent PC achieved year-over-year growth of 19% globally and represented $5.1 million of total company revenue in the second quarter. U.S. Urgent PC revenue was $4.4 million up approximately $830,000 or 24% from the year-ago period. We sold 5,568 lead set boxes of Urgent PC in the U.S. compared to 4,494 boxes in the prior year period. This growth was due to an increase in the number of active customers, as well as slightly higher utilization per customer. We had 1,041 active customers during the second quarter for Urgent PC compared to 855 active customers one year ago. The average utilization of all of our accounts in the second quarter was 5.35 boxes up from 5.26 boxes a year ago. Revenue from EndoSheath medical technology products totaled $3.6 million, up approximately $400,000 or 12% from the year-ago period on a pro forma basis. Our EndoSheath products serve two primary markets urology and airway management. And revenue from urology applications was very strong in the quarter. Revenue from these urology applications totaled $2.9 million, which was an increase of 31% over the year ago period. The growth in urology EndoSheath revenue was due to growth in the U.S. with the domestic urology business reporting revenue of $1.7 million an increase of 64% over the prior year. Macroplastique our Injectable Bulking Agent had revenue of $1.9 million in the second quarter, representing a decrease of 2% compared to a year ago quarter. U.S. Macroplastique revenue was up 3%, while international revenue was down 14%, with this decrease all due to changes in exchange rates. As we have mentioned in prior calls, our best in class bulking agent serves a small market relative to our Urgent PC and EndoSheath product platforms. And is not a primary focus of our sales team. Now, turning to gross margin. The Companyâ€™s gross margin for the second quarter was 66.6%, up 70 basis points from the 65.9% pro forma gross margin in the year ago period. The second quarter gross margin is in line with our expectation for the full year fiscal 2016 gross margins. Operating expenses for the second quarter totaled $9.9 million as reported, excluding amortization of identifiable intangibles of $634,000 and merger related costs of $437,000, operating expenses totaled $8.8 million in the second quarter. This represents a decrease of approximately $640,000 or 7% from the pro forma combined operating expenses in the year ago period. As well as a sequential decrease of approximately 790,000 from our Q1 operating expenses. We have continued to review our operating expenses post merger, looking for cost efficiencies as we operate as one combined company. We had interest expense in the quarter of approximately $353,000 compared to zero in the year ago period. The increase is primarily due to interest on the related party debt that Vision-Sciences had outstanding at the time of the merger. We accrue interest at the 1.07% stated rates on the debt with the interest not payable until the maturity of the debt which is March of 2020. That interest totaled 76,000 in the quarter further as part of the purchased priced accounting related to the merger we added discount to debt to fair value and then each quarter we amortized a portion of the debt discount. In the second quarter this non-cash amortization of the debt discount totaled $269,000. Our cash operating loss excluding merger-related cost was approximately $400,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, compared to $1.7 million cash operating loss in the first quarter of this fiscal year and $1.7 million loss in the year ago period on a pro forma basis. Turning now to our guidance, which we originally provided in May, and reaffirmed on our last earnings call in August. We continue to expect that for fiscal 2016 revenue would be in the range of $49 million to $51 million, which would represents overall revenue growth of 9% to 13% on a pro forma basis. We also continue to expect that our fiscal 2016 gross margin will approximate the pro forma combined gross margins in fiscal 2015 of 66.5%. We are today updating our outlook for two of our other guidance metrics to reflect improved operating efficiencies. First, we now expect approximately $4 million in cost savings for fiscal 2016, when compared to pro forma 2015 up from our previous commitment to deliver at least $3 million in cost synergies. This will result in total pro forma combined operating costs excluding intangible amortization in merger related costs of approximately $37.4 million in fiscal 2016, as compared to $41.4 million last year. Our operating expenses through six months, excluding intangible amortization and merger related costs totaled $18.4 million and thatâ€™s our expected operating cost for the second half of fiscal 2016 is approximately $19 million. We are also updating our guidance from the expected fiscal 2016 cash operating loss excluding merger related costs to be in the range of $1 million to $2 million an improvement from the previous range of $2 million to $3 million. To put in perspective, the value the merger has created, the proforma combined cash operating loss in fiscal 2015 was $6.8 million, clearly much higher, than our expected fiscal 2016 cash operating loss of $1 million to $2 million. Turning now to the balance sheet, at September 30, 2015 we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 million, the decrease in cash and equivalents from June 30 is primarily attributable to our payment of various accrued merger related costs in the second quarter as well as the build out of our new lease facility in Massachusetts, where we [indiscernible] manufacture our sheets. We entered into a $7 million of Line of Credit with Venture Bank in late September to provide additional balance sheet flexibility, and as a source of non-dilutive capital for growth. The line of credit is for 18 months with borrowings based upon a working capital formula calculated for percentage of our receivables plus eligible inventory balances. Interest rate for the line of credit is Wall Street Journal [indiscernible] was plus 2.25%, which currently result in a 5.5% interest rate. As of September 30, we had no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit. Thank you, Brett. So as you can see, our team continues to deliver on our commitments and we remain on track to achieve or exceed our initial guidance for fiscal 2016. Cogentix Medical is today a company that is a much more meaningful partner to our physician customers and this should lead to continued sales momentum for both Urgent PC and our EndoSheath technology platform. Continued sales execution will be the primary driver of topline growth in the second half of this fiscal year and we will also continue to investigate opportunities to add other new innovative technologies to our sales teamâ€™s product portfolio. These business development activities take time to mature and must only be done on financially attractive terms for our shareholders. So while we pursue these business development activities, we continue to remain focused on our goal to grow revenue while maintaining operating discipline, which is what resulted in the really positive performance that you saw on the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2016 that we reported today. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brooks ONeil from Dougherty and Company. Your line is now open. So maybe just you can just talk a little bit about any of the figure surprises that you found as you seek to combine these two companies and think about the opportunities in the future. So Brooks, this is Rob. I donâ€™t know if there has been any significant surprises. I mean if you reflect back on what we said at the start of the fiscal year, which is when the two companies merged, we outlined our guidance. And weâ€™re tracking along to that guidance, obviously weâ€™ve executed well on the synergy side, right. So a good operating discipline, but we also expect that. And that allowed us to update some guidance as related to cash burn and operating losses this year. But as weâ€™ve said we think that our sales team is becoming more meaningful partners to their customers as they bring them new and innovative technologies. And quite honestly Darin and his team continue to execute. And I canâ€™t say thatâ€™s a surprise thatâ€™s what we expect. Yes, so thatâ€™s great. So are you still thinking that the goal is going to be try to double the size of the company again and get to $100 million over the next year or two or some period like that? Yes. Weâ€™ve been very clear that weâ€™re continuing to pursue BD activities that would add other new and innovative technologies to our reps portfolio, and so thatâ€™s clearly a key focus to this business and we intend to make the business much more relevant meaningful to our customers, but also in doing so created a much large organization than we have today. Thatâ€™s great, and I know Brett just talked about the line of credit and the availability you have there, but are you thinking that you have sufficient resources to continue to pursue your growth strategy? Hi, Brooks, this is Brett. The line of credit certainly helps, it provides $7 million, and if you look at our guidances we looked going forward cash flow break even and then moving to cash flow positive, so it gives us enough dry powder, we still have to be creative in ways that we would look at financing, but there is opportunities out there with what we have. I wanted to start just around the integration, itâ€™s been about seven months now, Robby talked about the six to nine months sales cycle for EndoSheath, so he said you kind of seen in the front end of that horizon. How do you the feel the sales reps productivity levels are trending relative to your expectations as we enter into that kind of tipping point of the nine months sale cycle for EndoSheath? Yes, so we anticipated that urology team was going to be starting from scratch, as it relates to building up the funnel and weâ€™ve been really pleased with the progress that weâ€™ve had over the last seven months, and Iâ€™d say if anything were, weâ€™re ahead of schedule as far as building up the pipeline but we expect it with capital sales it was going to be six to nine months before we really started seeing that impact, and so all things considered Iâ€™d say weâ€™re pretty close to being right on track. And for the Florida instance you talked about, I donâ€™t know if you, youâ€™d like to quantify just what that equates to in potential sales, and secondly are there other similar type kind of blanket opportunities here, similar to what you saw in that instance going forward? Sure, I wouldnâ€™t quantify or it may just depends on the number of [indiscernible] tasks that they performed in a a year, but itâ€™s not insignificant and quite frankly thatâ€™s right in our target zone for practices we look for the larger urology practices, weâ€™ve spent a lot of money on capital equipment for endoscopes and they just struggle with keeping these scopes in rotation because of â€“ either it is being reprocessed or damaged and out for repair. So our value proposition fits really nice into practices like these and we have a great number of those coming to the funnel each and every week. Nice. And then turning to Urgent PC U.S. continues to be strong, I think second or third quarter hereof 25% year-over-year. So, can you just talk about whatâ€™s continuing to drive the growth there, I think, it was a strong quarter of new customers. So, how should we think about the Urgent PC growth rate here in the U.S. and whatâ€™s kind of the key drivers between adding new customers versus potential for increased utilization of the existing customer base. Itâ€™s Darin here Chris. I think one of the things thatâ€™s really helped drive that is the number of new customers that we bringing on has continued to increase. But the real key is the team is doing a great job of targeting the right accounts our attrition rate is coming down as the number of new customers go up. And then you â€“ couple that with increased utilization, it just supports that growth. So what youâ€™re seeing is the results of a lot of hard work and effort that took place six months to nine months ago that are now starting to manifest in the results. Good deal and on the airway management and industrial division under Vision â€“ that continues to be down here over the first couple of quarters of post integration, I guess, you can call it. Can you just talk us through the sales cycle and sales strategy within those two segments? Do you need to add, I think you said, you have six reps there, do you need to add more reps or what are you going to do to turn that growth into positive trends going forward. Sure. Itâ€™s the value proposition with the urologist is pretty strong because you have a large number of cystoscopy that take place. And so it really helps from an efficiency standpoint. Airway management ENT is the biggest segment, but itâ€™s also the most competitive. Thereâ€™s no sheath that the team is selling so it becomes a relationship and it takes longer to really create the value at the account level. Weâ€™re having a lot of successful on the Bronchoscopy side in the last couple of quarters. And we look to take advantage of that. I wouldnâ€™t say, weâ€™re in a position to add new reps right now, obviously the team that we have â€“ will be the team that we move forward with. We just have to be better and more efficient with those six. Okay. And then Brett, whatâ€™s the â€“ what are the expecting merger cost for the second half of fiscal 2016. Chris, today is the merger cost have been severance retention professional fees, as we look going forward. There is should be a minimal amount of those going forward. So we should be done as of 09/30 with merger related cost. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And Iâ€™m showing no further questions from our phone line. I would now like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Rob Kill for any closing remarks. Well, thank you. Thanks everyone for participating today. We appreciate your continued interest and we look forward to updating you on our progress, on our Q3 call. Have a good evening.
