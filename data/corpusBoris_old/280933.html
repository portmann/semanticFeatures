Johnson Controls Offers A Potential 39% Return In 2016 - Johnson Controls, Inc. (NYSE:JCI) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in JCI over the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. 2016 is predicted to be a record-breaking year for Johnson Controls. We expect a 39% return in 2016 on the back of earnings per share increasing to $3.85. The company has increased segment margins year-over-year since 2012. Its been about two years since a new management team came in at Johnson Controls (NYSE: JCI ) and all signs are pointing to a highly successful transition. Revenues are expected to increase in fiscal 2016 despite FX headwinds, and we expect the company to deliver record profitability. We therefore believe Johnson Controls would be a fantastic addition to your portfolio in 2016. Johnson Controls Inc creates products, services and solutions to optimize energy and operational efficiencies of buildings; lead-acid automotive batteries and batteries for hybrid and electric vehicles; and interior systems for automobiles. We were impressed with the strong forecasts management gave for fiscal 2016. Management has put the company on the right path with strategic and operating plans that we expect will deliver better performance during the fiscal year. So much so we expect the company to achieve the higher end of the earnings per share guidance offered by management that ranged from $3.70 to $3.90 for fiscal 2016. This is a nice jump from the $3.58 per share earned in fiscal 2015. Revenues, which have declined year-over-year, are expected to rise 4% to $38.6 billion in fiscal 2016 from the $37.2 billion the company pulled in during fiscal 2015. As well as the mergers and acquisitions completed by the company, we also see revenue increasing on the back of higher automotive production. As shown in the chart below from Statista the outlook on worldwide light vehicle sales is expected to trend upwards at least until 2020. We feel investors should find this to be very encouraging. We feel this supports managements view: "In fiscal 2016, the company assumes global automotive production increases of approximately 11 percent in China and 2 percent in North America versus a slight decrease in Europe." The Building Efficiency and Power Solutions segments should also bolster revenue. Management believes we will see a 10% increase in these segments through organic sales in fiscal 2016. In Q4 of fiscal 2015 we were very impressed with the increased profitability shown by these segments. Despite revenue being level and down 6%, respectively, the company managed to squeeze an income increase of 5% from both segments. See below for a comparison. The Automotive Experience segment was down year-over-year in Q4 but we believe the increased efficiencies will lead the segment to profitability in fiscal 2016 despite sales being lowers. The increase in segment margin has really impressed us, and gives us great confidence for the future. It has increased by 250 bps since fiscal 2012, and we anticipate further growth in fiscal 2016. We feel it's a real sign of the company becoming more and more efficient each year. Johnson Controls has increased its dividend by 15% on average over the last 5 years. Currently yielding an attractive 2.74%, this puts it ahead of the S&P 500 average dividend yield of 2.11%. We feel the company can easily sustain this level of dividend growth. Currently it has an average payout ratio of 43.74% which we feel is a good level to be running at, allowing the company to reinvest appropriately in its growth. An appealing aspect of the company is its levels of free cash flow as shown below. We, like most investors, see positive levels of free cash flow as an attractive feature of an investment. After the $1.13 billion capital expenditures JCI still has $465 million of free cash flow. Although the company has a reasonably low Quick Ratio (0.605) compared to its industry peers, it is close to its 10-year average and has made a vast improvement year-over-year from a below average level. We wouldn't worry too much about this, as it seems to be an operational quirk of the company, rather than an indicator of poor liquidity. The Current Ratio is a comforting 1.06. The company is down 14.64% over the last 52-weeks leaving it trading at a below average price to earnings ratio. On average in the last 5 years the company has traded at 21.18 times earnings, whereas today we find it at just 16.54 times earnings and just 81 cents off its 52-week low. We believe, however, that the stock is trading at a reasonable price to earnings ratio considering its growth prospects. The Auto Parts industry is currently trading at an average price to earnings ratio of 14.05. In time we expect the company to trade in line with its peers, so when doing our one-year price target have factored in a gradual move to a lower price to earnings ratio. So, based on our forecast earnings per share for fiscal 2016 of $3.85, and trading at the industry average of 14.05 times earnings, we have placed a one-year price target of $54.09 on Johnson Controls. This represents a 39% increase from the last price of $39.08. Things are starting to look very promising and fiscal 2016 is expected to be a record-beating year for the company. We feel that at this price, it represents a reasonably low risk investment with a high margin of safety. Even at the low end of the earnings guidance management has given ($3.70) we would see a potential return of 33% if trading at the industry average of 14.05 times earnings. Add in the dividend and I think we have a really positive investment here for all portfolios. Tagged: Investing Ideas , Consumer Goods
