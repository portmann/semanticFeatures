U.S. Construction Spending Hits New Postrecession High   - Real Time Economics - WSJ A roofer works on a home in the Briar Chapel community in Chapel Hill, N.C. Construction spending hit a new high in May. U.S. construction spending hit a new postrecession peak in May, a likely boost for the economy in the second quarter of the year. U.S. construction spending advanced 0.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.036 trillion in May, the highest level since October 2008, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. The measure has been climbing steadily since December and in March broke $1 trillion for the first time since 2008. In May, spending on private nonresidential building led the way, climbing 1.5% to $393 billion, the highest figure since December 2008. Manufacturing spending has been especially robust over the past year. Overall, spending on all private construction–residential and nonresidential–was the highest since July 2008. “Construction spending looks set to add significantly to second-quarter [gross domestic product] growth, while upward revisions to the first quarter could add as much as a half-percentage point to real GDP growth,”Â John Ryding andÂ Conrad DeQuadros, economists at RDQ Economics, said in a note to clients. GDP contracted at a 0.2% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said last week. RDQ said growth in the second quarter is tracking at 3.5%. Morgan Stanley bumped its estimate to 2.8% from 2.7% after the construction spending release. Barclays, citing a downward revision for state and local construction spending, knocked one-tenth of a point off its estimate, which now stands at 3%. While demand for homes is strong , residential construction spending hasn’t registered the gains many economists expect. In May, spending was up 8.2% for the year. While not adjusted for inflation, the latest figures suggest stepped up activity from builders will help boost the labor market and the overall economy. One area that isn’t looking too robust: the power segment, which includes buildings and structures used in the oil and gas industries. From a year earlier, spending is down 23.5%. The plunge corresponds with a big tumble in crude oil prices since mid-2014, though they’ve rebounded off of recent lows .
