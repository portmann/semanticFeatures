UPDATE 1-Turkey needs more orthodox monetary policy, new economy chief says | Reuters ISTANBUL Dec 7 Turkey should present a "more orthodox" monetary policy, newly appointed economy czar Mehmet Simsek said on Monday, adding that he planned to announce a roadmap for reforms this week. In some of his first public comments since being appointed deputy prime minister in charge of the economy late last month, Simsek sought to reassure investors about his commitment to fiscal discipline and central bank independence. He also said a worst-case scenario of "zero relations" with Russia would cost Turkey about $9 billion, and the current tension with Moscow since Turkey shot down a Russian jet last month over Syria will probably shave 0.4 percent off annual output. Investors have been worried about the ruling AK Party's appetite for structural reform and about potential interference in monetary policy, concerns that have helped drive the lira currency to a series of record lows. Just days after his appointment, Simsek took to Twitter to quell worries the government would look to influence the central bank. Speaking to broadcaster NTV on Monday, Simsek said that predictability in monetary and fiscal policy should increase. "We should present a more orthodox monetary policy," he said. While he did not give details about the expected roadmap of reforms, he said he did not foresee changes in the "main parameters" of the budget, although new developments and election promises would be taken into consideration. Overall, economic growth was seen at 3.0-3.5 percent this year and there was a high probability that it would be at 4 percent or a little higher in 2016, he said.
