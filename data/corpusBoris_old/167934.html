G-III Apparel's Latest Earnings - Take More Than A Passing Glance - G-III Apparel Group, LTD. (NASDAQ:GIII) | Seeking Alpha G-III Apparel reported fiscal 2016 second quarter results on September 2. The company also offered improved guidance for the full-year for the second time since its original guidance was offered. Year-over-year comparisons regarding the third quarter could be misleading at first glance. Astute investors will note the true expected improvement. Further, the anticipation for the upcoming launch of Karl Lagerfeld North America product lines could mean glancing investors missed the announcement of two additional business areas launching in 2015. G-III Apparel (NASDAQ: GIII ), a leading manufacturer and distributor of apparel, reported fiscal 2016 second quarter results on September 2, 2015. The company's performance was being measured against full-year expectations of $2.4 billion for revenue, $123 million to $128 million for net income and $2.66 to $2.76 for EPS. In the second quarter, the company generated revenue of $473.88 million, net income of $12.5 million and EPS of $0.27. For the first half of fiscal 2016, revenue totaled $906.85 million, net income totaled $19.2 million and EPS totaled $0.42. By these marks, the company has achieved 37.8% of its target revenue, 15.3% of its target net income (based on the guidance midpoint) and 15.5% of its target EPS (also based on the guidance midpoint). With little more than a passing glance, the company's progress for the year could seem lacking to those not familiar with the story. Yet, with the earnings release, G-III Apparel also revised full-year guidance a second time since the original guidance for 2016 was offered. At a high level, the increased projection seems premature as the totals in the first half of the year do not seem to warrant change. However, it must be remembered that, historically, the company generates the majority (approximately 38%) of its revenue in its third quarter. The company did not update revenue for fiscal 2016 and still expects to reach $2.4 billion. But, it does expect to deliver on its previous expectation that the integration of recent acquisitions will delivered improved margins. Net income is now expected to fall within a range of $129 million and $134 million which means EPS would equate to a range of $2.78 to $2.88. In fiscal 2015, G-III Apparel tallied revenue of $812.3 million and EPS of $1.76 in its third quarter (adjusted for G-III's 2 for 1 stock split in May, 2015). For fiscal 2016, the company is projecting revenue of $920 million and EPS in a range of $1.78 to $1.83 in the same quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the growth rate for revenue in the quarter is 13.26%. Again at a passing glance, this may seem inconsistent with the year-over-year growth rate of 14.76% in revenue achieved to date in fiscal 2016. But, G-III Apparel has purposely been building a portfolio that would provide revenue opportunities in all four seasons of the year. The revenue growth rate in the first half of the year confirms the company's progress toward this goal. Management also confirmed the revenue increase is wholly a result of organic growth. If history repeats, $920 million as 38% of the annual total does equate to full-year revenue of $2.4 billion. Further validating the revenue projection, Mr. Goldfarb, G-III's CEO, explained the company's status to date in the second quarter earnings call : "We have got an order book that's booked out for about 90% of the year. So, we do still have some work to do in terms of our wholesale business and, obviously, we have a lot of retail assumptions built into the back half of the year". Turning to the actual results for net income in the first half of fiscal 2016, even though the company has achieved less than 20% of its full-year guidance, year-over-year G-III Apparel more than doubled its bottom line. Regarding the updated guidance for the full year, the progress G-III Apparel is making is being masked when compared to fiscal 2015 by previous one-time events. The profit margin in the fiscal 2015 third quarter equated to 9.9%. However, the quarter included $11.95 million in non-recurring income attributable to three factors: payments received due to the sale of the rights to operate Calvin Klein Performance stores in Asia (including the sale of the company's interest in the joint venture that operated Calvin Klein Performance stores in China), a reduction of the payable (estimated contingent consideration) associated with the acquisition of Vilebrequin, and the early extinguishment of debt inclusive of the portion of the consideration for the acquisition of Vilebrequin for an amount less than the principal amount. Excluding these three items, the profit margin would have equated to 8.45%. Should G-III reach the midpoint of its guidance on EPS, the fiscal 2016 third quarter profit margin will equate to 9.1% - an impressive improvement that would be missed with just a passing glance. Profit margin improvement is a result of improving both gross margin and operating margin. For the first six months of fiscal 2016, G-III Apparel improved its gross margin to 35.59% from 35.25% in the same period of fiscal 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, decreased from 32.15% in fiscal 2015 to 30.71% for the first half of fiscal 2016. As already mentioned, the integration of the G.H. Bass acquisition (November 2013) was expected to provide margin improvement as calendar year 2015 progressed. The company also cited product mix and fewer markdowns as contributors to better margins. The updated guidance for EPS in the fiscal 2016 third quarter, at the midpoint, equates to a growth rate year-over-year of 16.83% when excluding the one-time income in the fiscal 2015 third quarter. The rate reflects both the top-line projected improvement of 13.26% and the benefit of improving margins. Management explained a key differentiator for G-III Apparel that ultimately protects its bottom line: "In difficult times, retailers cull down their risky pieces of business and marry to a safe, profitable proposition. And, we have proved out to be that safe, profitable proposition. Resources that are second tier are generally eliminated in difficult times and space is given to success stories." This success differentiator results in a commitment to G-III's key requirement - retail floor space. As G-III Apparel nears the launch dates for its Karl Lagerfield joint venture, a commitment of floor space is not taken lightly. The company expects this iconic brand will hold not only great potential but will offer longevity in a vast array of opportunities. And yet, further evidence of the dangers of granting the company little more than a passing glance surfaced in the earnings call: "We will launch two additional areas of business before the end of the year that have not been announced yet. They are in development. There is a good deal of money spent. So that's not factored in. You are assuming that it's all Karl Lagerfeld, it's not." The statement not to be missed in a passing glance - the two areas are not factored in. In fact, there are several factors aligning for G-III Apparel that should ultimately deliver long-term value for its shareholders: Sales are improving because retailers trust the manufacturer/distributor and grant it valuable floor space. Margins are improving because the integration and improvements of recent acquisitions are being realized. The brands G-III Apparel licenses and owns still have ample room for growth and development. The launch of Karl Lagerfeld's iconic brand in North America opens many doors of opportunity for G-III Apparel as both distributor and licensor. The company is managing its business and growth without the burden of long-term debt obligations. G-III Apparel, even through the recent market adjustments, has been trading at a healthy, even robust, multiple. While it may be disconcerting to grant companies a higher multiple when the market appears to want to shake off such multiples, G-III Apparel should be in the minority of companies that actually warrant the assignment. Recent volatility has offered G-III shares below $65 and alert investors should not glance over such opportunities.
