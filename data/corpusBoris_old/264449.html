During the fiscal year 2015 CBC entered into two securitizations totaling $38.4 million with fixed long term interest rates. Proceeds were used to pay down its warehouse credit facility and free up capacity for the expansion of the structured settlement business. During the fourth quarter we made a federal tax payment of approximately $13 million and finalized the IRS audit covering the years 2009 through 2013. As we recently announced the Congressional Joint Committee on taxation has finalized their review with no exceptions to the original settlement. As part of the settlement the company has agreed to change its accounting method for tax purposes from the method used since inception of the company accounting under practice bulletin six amortization of discounts on certain acquired loans to a closed over estimated collections method or CEC method. The difference in methods, centers on a gross profit methodology utilizing gross collections as compared to net collections. The result is a temporary difference as to when the revenues on the portfolios are recognized. This is strictly a timing of revenue recognition of profits earned. There were no other adjustments to taxable income for the audit period. This change in tax accounting affects only the consumer receivable business segment, also this change in accounting method affects tax reporting only. There is no change in generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our financial statements. There were no impairments reported during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 compared to $19,591,000 reported during fiscal year 2014. The Companyâ€™s book value per share as of September 30, 2015 was $14.10 as compared to $13.96 at September 30, 2014. Hi, there. Yes my first question is about this asset on your balance sheet prepaid and income taxes receivable, it looks like $6.7 million. Iâ€™m just wondering over what time period are you going to recognize the benefit of that asset. Well, thatâ€™s as a â€“ the result of the â€“ partially the result of the IRS audit in which part of the $13 million was classified in terms of our prepaid taxes and another part is in the deferred tax asset category. I mean we will be recognizing it as, as the results from due, we do not give out forward looking information in terms of projections, but weâ€¦ And but you have two tax assets, right? You have deferred taxes and then you have this prepaid and income taxes receivable and I have a hard time understanding how an account entitled prepaid in income taxes receivable could contain amounts relating to past years. Well, we had to â€“ we are in the process of amending tax returns from the prior years in certain payments paid from those time periods play into the classification of that. Okay, also wondering of the general and administrative expense for the year, how much of that related to the SEC review? [Operator Instructions] And we have a follow-up question from Robert Balboa [ph] of Balboa Investment Management. Your line is now open. Okay. Hello again. I wanted to ask you about your investments in the international sector, consumer receivables. Is this a fairly new area for the company or do you have much history investing internationally? At this point for competitive reasons, we are not disclosing that, but it is several countries that weâ€™re looking at many, many different countries. Weâ€™ve started, resided at several countries as they were very interested in doing business with as of now that could change over time. Okay. I wanted to ask you also about the stock repurchase plan, wondering if thatâ€™s still in effect or has it been terminated? Yes itâ€™s been â€“ it will be in effect until the end of this month and the board has not decided yet whether to continue with it or not, but we will be meeting shortly regarding that. And my last question just has to do with the statement made in the letter today, maybe this is just mincing words, but Gary Sternâ€™s statement is, during the fourth quarter, we finalized the audit by the Internal Revenue Service with no disallowances and of course you paid $13 million, are you drawing a distinction between change of income recognition versus disallowance? Well, Iâ€™ll take that for Gary, this is Bob. It was pure timing in terms of the recognition of the revenue. The C message accelerated revenue recognition to earlier years and again it is pure timing, but as regards to any expenses related to the consumer receivables or any other there were no disallowances there. So itâ€™s pure timing of the taxes being paid. Okay. It kind of threw me for a loop because in the third quarter notes to the financial statements, I guess you were a bit more cautious, you said apart from the change in accounting method for income tax purposes, there were no other material disallowances. So I guess at that time you thought maybe it could be considered a disallowance, but now youâ€™re saying itâ€™s not? Well, we just wanted to make sure as we mentioned in the letter that we got clearance from the tax congressional committee to finalize it and weâ€™re just moving forward. Hi good afternoon. Just a quick follow-up on the international receivables business, I know itâ€™s small right now, but I was just curious how does that work from an infrastructure standpoint? I mean the customers are based in different countries, are you calling them from the call centers here in the U.S. or you are employing attorneys the way you do in the U.S. I guess my question is how does that business differ from the domestic business? We're partnering with collection companies in those countries and they do all of the calling and all of the collections. Yes, I mean weâ€™re partnering, we basically have arrangements where they invest money with us and they do the collections. So yes, they are doing all the work. We of course work with them and look at what theyâ€™re doing and analyze the portfolios with them, but their expertise is what really drives the process. Okay. So say for example the $4 million that you have on the books right now, you collect the $4 million and then you pay them a fee for their collection efforts, percentage of the collection? Yes, yes, so we invested for â€“ this is simply our investment, they would invest some additional money as collections come in, they â€“ agree the fund fee and then the split is made and now we are on course of recovery and all of these international. So until we for instance and this is example, until we receive work, Asta asset collection expense is nothing drops to the bottom line. Okay, so they have made â€“ they may have invested say $4 million as well along side your four, Iâ€™m not saying its four, but they may have purchase receivables in partnership with you. Yes, we form new subsidiary â€“ no they didnâ€™t invest, they didnâ€™t invest for full 50:50. So w wanted them to have skin in the game. Not at this point but I not at this point we â€“ we are looking at various portfolios and there is a lot of paper out there. We were being very, very careful and cautious on what we've beenâ€¦ Again weâ€™re just in the beginning stages at a year or so, but we are not going to be disclosing at this point, but it will be disclosed once it becomes more significant. And this does conclude question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Gary Stern for any further remarks. Thank you. Thank you for participating in our fiscal year fourth quarter 2015 conference call. As always should you have any additional questions, please feel free to call Bob and myself. Have a pleasant day.
