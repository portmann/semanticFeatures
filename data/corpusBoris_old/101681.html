Japanese Consumers And The Yen | Seeking Alpha The private sector, however, is weighing on economic activity. With the myriad of issues Japan faces, consumer spending is unlikely to offset economic contraction in the second quarter, weighing on the yen. Consumer spending is one of the lone bright spots in Japan's economy, alongside improving wages, but neither may be able to offset further stimulus measures, weighing on the yen. The Japanese currency is represented by CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust (NYSEARCA: FXY ). In May, the retail sales figure came in at an annual pace of -1.50% contraction, above the previous month's reading of -2.61%. Although consumer spending remains at suppressed levels, it is recovering from a recent sales tax hike that "clobbered" spending. "But after a consumption tax hike to 8 percent from 5 percent in April of 2014, the economy got clobbered when consumers stopped spending, forcing the government to postpone a second sales tax initially due this October," according to CNBC. Moreover, low consumer prices have aided in the spending recovery. In May, the inflation figure came in at an annual pace of 0.5%, below the previous month's reading of 0.6%, while in line with estimates for 0.5%. Effects of the recent sales tax have finally been removed from the measure, causing the drastic fall in inflation in recent months, seen below. At current levels, inflation is well below the central bank's 2.0% annual growth target. Additionally, wages in Japan have finally begun to expand. In May, the wage figure came in at an annual pace of 0.6%, below the previous month's revised reading of 0.7%, while also missing estimates for 0.65%. After falling to -2.0% annual contraction in 2013, however, wages have steadily risen to current levels, seen below. Wages are one of the few areas of the economy, currently, which are trending towards policymakers' targets. "The increase in wages could be a bright spot for Japan's recovery amid a slew of lackluster production and export data. Several private sector economists are forecasting Japan's economy contracted in the second quarter. "A virtuous cycle from income to spending has been operating steadily in both the corporate and household sectors," according to MarketWatch. Japanese consumers are improving, aiding investor sentiment, but the overall economy remains plagued with issues. Consumer spending is increasing, alongside rising wages. Policymakers, however, are fearful of deflation, as well as slowing factory activity and trade revenue. With the myriad of factors weighing on economic activity, aside from consumer spending, policymakers may choose to loosen monetary conditions in coming months, weighing on the yen.
