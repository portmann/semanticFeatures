Economic Growth And The Euro - CurrencyShares Euro Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:FXE) | Seeking Alpha Economic growth in the euro area is moderately improving. Moreover, consumer spending is rising as trade data weigh on the growth measure. With more room for improvement in the euro area, stimulus measures should remain in place, weighing on the strength of its currency. Economic growth slightly picked up in the euro area as household spending and investment rose, while falling trade made a negative contribution, leading to mixed sentiment surrounding its currency. The euro currency is represented by CurrencyShares Euro Trust (NYSEARCA: FXE ). In the first quarter, the economic growth figure came in at an annual pace of 1.0%, above the previous quarter's reading of 0.9%, while in line with estimates for 1.0%. While growth is expanding, it remains below the close to 4% levels experienced prior to the financial crisis, seen below. Household spending contributed the most to growth, while international trade acted as the largest weight. "Household consumption, long the more sluggish component of euro zone growth, now contributed the most, 0.3 percentage points to the overall quarterly result. Investment added a further 0.2 percentage point and growing inventories and government spending another 0.1 point each. But the contribution from external trade was negative as imports grew twice as fast as exports on a quarterly basis, capping overall quarterly GDP growth," according to Reuters. Additionally, as was stated above, consumer spending has considerably strengthened in recent months. In April, the retail sales figure came in at an annual pace of 2.2%, above the previous month's revised reading of 1.7%, while also exceeding estimates for 2.0%. Since bottoming at close to -4.0% annual contraction in 2012, consumer spending has risen to current levels, seen below. Elevated consumer sentiment contributed to the increased purchases. "Although consumer confidence has waned slightly in the bloc in May, it remains at high levels and the data suggest that consumption could post another strong quarter in Q2," according to Reuters. Finally, as was also stated earlier, trade data is weakening in the euro area. A proxy for trade in the currency bloc is its largest member, Germany. In April, the German export figure came in at an annual pace of -3.10% contraction, down from the previous month's reading of -1.22%. Exports in Germany have significantly declined from its pre-financial crisis pace over 20%, seen below. While deflation has weighed on the prices of many exports, lowering reported revenue, the decline is nonetheless troubling. The euro area economy is recovering, albeit slightly. Economic growth is expanding due to higher rates of consumer spending and investment. Weakening trade data, however, are suppressing economic activity. With stimulus measures still needed in the currency bloc, gains in the euro should be limited.
