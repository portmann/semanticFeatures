The European Capital Markets Union Will Affect Bonds, Insurers, And EM Small Caps | Seeking Alpha European Capital Markets Union (CMU) is all ready to be established. The project could suck in capital from emerging markets' small caps. CMU will encourage insurers to invest in infrastructure. European Commissioner for Financial Stability announced an action plan Wednesday, September 30, on how to transform the European Capital Markets Union's (CMU) vision into reality. The vision was announced in mid-July 2014 by Jean-Claude Juncker in his maiden policy speech at the European Parliament as President-elect of the European Commission. What is Capital Markets Union? Eurocrats want to build a single market for capital - a capital markets union for all 28 EU member states. CMU will be built through a series of administrative and legal changes. A very good source about the political side of establishing CMU can be found here . First of all, Eurocrats want to provide more funding choices for Europe's non-listed businesses and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Compared to the US, European SMEs receive five times less funding from capital markets. Bank financing is very expensive in Europe due to negative interest rates, and the stock exchange is - of course - usually not available for small businesses. A. The number of entities, which will soak up the capital, would increase significantly. This means that the capital could migrate from the emerging market small- and medium-sized companies to the European SMEs. B. The European capital market - as a whole - will draw investors' attention. It is very likely that the start of CMU will also give a boost to small and medium-sized companies already listed on European floors. Secondly, Eurocrats want to ensure an appropriate regulatory environment for long-term, sustainable investment and financing of Europe's infrastructure. The last crisis and the nature of the recovery have left a large infrastructure investment gap in the EU economy. The European Investment Bank (EIB) estimates that the total cumulative infrastructure investment needs in the EU could reach up to EUR 2 trillion for the period up to 2020. In this context, institutional and other private investors can be an important source of funding for the infrastructure investments in EU. The European Commission wants to activate insurance companies, pension funds and newly formed debt funds as infrastructure sponsors. "Insurance companies, pension funds and newly formed debt funds can benefit from the stable revenue streams from infrastructure debt that match longer-dated liabilities," according to the European Commission. Maybe. Or maybe not - it depends on multiple factors. The truth is that in recent years insurers and pension funds have been retrenching from investment in long-term projects and companies. The share ownership of insurers and pension funds dropped from more than 25% of the EU stock market capitalisation in 1992 to 8% at the end of 2012. At present, insurers and pension funds typically hold a large share of their portfolio in a relatively narrow range of assets (government bonds, bank deposits, etc.). A. Insurance companies would withdraw capital consistently and gradually from the European government bonds. So we have another argument (in addition to the gigantic public debts) that it will be harder to be bullish on European bonds in the future. B. Insurance companies' infrastructure investments not necessarily have to be the shot in the bull's eye (please remember about Spanish bankrupt motorways ). The insurers' financial results may become very volatile after the CMU implementation. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
