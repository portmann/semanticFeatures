There Is Still Not Much Meat On The Story At hhgregg - hhgregg, Inc. (NYSE:HGG) | Seeking Alpha Specialty retailer hhgregg has had little luck at finding profit growth in the current fiscal year, an unsurprising result given sales declines across its major product categories. The company's poor financial performance has led to a sell off for its stock price over the past year. With hhgregg positioned to post negative earnings per share for the current fiscal year, there is not much of a story to cling to and investors should move on. Shareholders in specialty retailer hhgregg (NASDAQ: HGG ) are probably not too happy with the company's stock price trajectory over the past year, down more than 20%. The company has been negatively impacted by weak sales momentum in the current fiscal year , evidenced by a 9.1% drop in comparable store sales, which has applied downward pressure to its operating leverage, culminating in a roughly 260 basis point decline in adjusted operating profitability. On the upside, though, management has been actively trying to revive hhgregg's fortunes through an evolution of its product mix that has witnessed an exit from the underperforming fitness equipment and mobile phone product categories, a move that could propel improved profitability in the future. So, at its discounted price, is the company a good bet for investors? hhgregg is a niche player in the specialty retail space, operating a network of approximately 200 stores that sell a concentrated mix of products, mostly focused on appliances and consumer electronics. Unfortunately, that strategic focus has been a difficult place to find profit growth lately, anecdotally due to an elevated level of competition, especially in the consumer electronics area where manufacturers have become part of the retail landscape. The net result for hhgregg has been greater amounts of promotional spending and lower merchandise margins over the past five fiscal years, a toxic combination that has been a blow to its operating margin. In its latest fiscal year , it was a poor financial performance for hhgregg, highlighted by a 5.5% top-line decline that was a function of lower comparable store sales, off 7.3%. During the period, the company was hurt by lower sales volumes in its consumer electronics and computer product categories, which was only partially offset by volume gains for its appliance product category. Combined with relatively higher overhead costs that were boosted by rising delivery expenses for its growing online segment, it added up to a reduced level of operating profitability for hhgregg, culminating in a 92.6% drop in adjusted operating income. The question for investors is whether hhgregg can find its way to profit growth in the foreseeable future, thereby providing a foundation for a higher market valuation. On that score, things don't appear too promising at the present time, judging by the company's posting of a slight adjusted operating loss in the current fiscal year, a negative deviation from its performance in the prior-year period. hhgregg has been impacted by unfavorable sales momentum, as less productive stores on average helped to produce an 8.7% decline in total revenues. Not surprisingly, the lower sales volumes forced management to continue utilizing marketing incentives in a bid to incentivize customer transactions, resulting in the aforementioned dip in operating margin. More worrisome, even hhgregg's previously growing appliance sales have registered a decline in the current fiscal year, a trend that doesn't bode well for the company's ability to turn things around anytime soon. Given the growth struggles at hhgregg, investors looking for gains among the appliance sellers should probably stick with a player delivering better overall financial metrics, like Home Depot (NYSE: HD ). The company came through with a solid financial performance in FY2014 , reporting a 5.5% increase in total revenues that was a function of both higher customer traffic volumes and improved average product prices. More importantly, Home Depot enjoyed better per-store sales productivity, a likely halo effect of the Customer First initiatives that remain a focus of its store employee teams, which enabled it to generate a roughly 90 basis point increase in operating profitability. The net result for Home Depot was a 14.2% jump in operating income during the period, a performance that has provided support for stock price appreciation over the past year. hhgregg is certainly cheaper than it was a year ago, after a double-digit stock price decline over the following time period. That being said, there seems to be a reasonable basis for that price action, given the company's drop in adjusted operating income that has positioned hhgregg for a negative earnings per share tally for the current fiscal year. Until hhgregg can find an antidote to its customer traffic issues, seemingly the prime source of its problems, a profit rebound would seem to be a remote possibility, making the company a bet that is best left unmade.
