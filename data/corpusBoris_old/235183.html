Eros: Is The Game Finally Over? We Think So - Eros International Plc (NYSE:EROS) | Seeking Alpha Management avoided releasing a movie list until the stock dropped 30%. They provided a list of distributed films that had fewer films on it than they have previously publicly disclosed. 34 films, or 26% of the films in management’s list, were theatrically released prior to the fiscal year indicated. One additional film has yet to be released. Based on public data sources, Eros appears to have overstated theatrical revenues by at least 116% and 49% during the fiscal years 2015 and 2014. We now believe there is irrefutable evidence that the company’s theatrical revenues are substantially below what it has reported. Eros released a statement and a film list yesterday in response to repeated investor questions. We believe that the film list definitively proves that Eros has been misleading investors. We believe, now more so than ever, that the company is a scam and that the equity is worthless. On October 30th and November 10th , we published articles on Eros International PLC (NYSE: EROS ) ("Eros"). In our most recent article, we attempted to verify the 134 films the Company claims to have released in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 in its 20-F filed with the SEC ( Source , see page 34). Unfortunately, despite our detailed work, we were unable to verify the company's claims that it had distributed 134 films. Indeed, our work suggested that the company had grossly overstated its film count. Subsequently, we challenged the company in our last article to publish the list of all 134 movies it claims to have released in its two most recent fiscal years. We also challenged the company to release revenues by film. At the Wells Fargo 2015 Technology, Media & Telecom Conference on November 11th, an attendee was actually thrown out of the Eros presentation after asking the company to release its movies. Yesterday, November 12th, following repeated inquiries from investors, Eros released "an exhaustive list of films released in the [fiscal] year [2015 and 2014]. It includes global films, overseas only films, films with all rights as well as films with specific rights across the various languages. All films may not have been released theatrically." ( Source , see latest releases tab). In addition, we used the WaybackMachine to archive this data should it ever be taken down ( Source ). Should the need arise, we also have screenshots of the movies named by Eros. Obviously, at this point, we believe that everything released by the company needs to be verified. As a first step to verifying the company's claim that it had released a list of its movies, we counted the movies now disclosed on the company's website. Eros only published 64 and 68 movies for fiscal years ending 2015 and 2014, respectively. This is one less for each fiscal year than the numbers reported in its 20-F financials. This discrepancy should be immediately concerning to investors. Furthermore, we checked each individual movie to verify the actual release date. For the list of sixty-four movies that Eros claims it distributed in fiscal year 2015, twenty of them were actually not released during fiscal year 2015, according to independent, public sources. In other words, the company has misled investors by putting old movies onto its list of films it released. To understand what's going on, we will analyze a few of the above "fiscal year 2015" films in further depth. According to Box Office India, Four Two Ka One was released on May 10, 2013 ( Source ), which is during fiscal year 2014, not fiscal year 2015. Amazingly, ErosNow also identifies Four Two Ka One as a 2013 film ( Source ). Nonetheless, Eros includes this film in its list of movies released during fiscal year 2015. According to IMDb, It's Rocking: Dard-E-Disco was released on November 9, 2012 ( Source ) and was, therefore, a fiscal year 2013 film, not a fiscal year 2015 film as claimed by Eros: Similar to the previous two films, Listen Amaya was not released during fiscal year 2015 as Eros claims. The release date according to IMDb is February 1, 2013, which is part of fiscal year 2013 ( Source ). If investors would like to verify our work, we fully encourage them to search the internet for any or all of the other twenty films that we have identified as falling outside of fiscal year 2015, but which the company has claimed were distributed during fiscal year 2015. Further, there are many instances where Eros does not appear to be the distributor. For example, JAI Viatra Entertainment appears to be the distributor for Bazaar e Husn, Munna Mange Memsaab, Riyasat, and Tum Ho Yaara. However, we give Eros the benefit of the doubt that it was the distributor for these movies or had a role in the distribution of these movies and allocated the distributor revenues to Eros when calculating its theatrical revenue (as discussed later in this article). We repeated this same exercise with Eros' fiscal year 2014. Eros published a list of 68 films as compared to the reported 69 films stated in its 20-F. Of these 68 films, 15 were not released during fiscal year 2014 according to third party sources. Similar to fiscal year 2015, we have provided a few examples of the discrepancies below. We encourage investors to research the release dates of the films we did not call out below if they would like to verify our work. Eros claims Ab Hoga Dharna Unlimited was released during fiscal year 2014. This is not the case. According to IMDb, the release date is April 13, 2012, which is part of fiscal year 2013 ( Source ). Interestingly, we found a review by Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India for The Bong Connection dated as of July 7, 2007 ( Source ). Thus, the movie could not have been released during fiscal year 2014. Finally, ErosNow also had The Bong Connection on its website ( Source ). Interestingly, it listed 2007 as its release date. Whether the film was released in 2006 or 2007 is a moot point to us, as it is clear the film was not released anywhere close to fiscal year 2013. Jeet Lengey Jahaan is another movie Eros claims was released during fiscal year 2014. However, according to Bollywood Hungama, the movie was released November 23, 2012, which is part of fiscal year 2013 ( Source ). Here is a zoomed-in screenshot from ErosNow for the movie Jeet Lengey Jahaan: While management backed away from our second challenge and did not publish revenue by film, we updated our revenue analysis based on the forty-four films that were in theaters during fiscal year 2015. Based on public data sources, Eros appears to have overstated its fiscal 2015 theatrical revenues by approximately 116%. Eros claims that it generated $123 million of theatrical revenue during fiscal 2015, but based upon publicly available sources we calculate that the actual theatrical revenue was only $57 million. Our updated 2015 revenue estimate is actually slightly lower than our last estimate. Nonetheless, we feel like we are still being generous with our assumptions. According to Eros' 20-F, it has global distribution rights for only six of its Tamil/Telugu films. We weren't able to identify all of the Tamil/Telugu films with international distribution rights only, so we gave them full, worldwide credit for nine Tamil/Telugu films. These nine include Eros' three largest Tamil films released during fiscal year 2015. Again, we gave Eros full credit for Kochadaiiyaan, as we could not find a source that precisely divides the film's revenues between its Hindi and Tamil versions. This movie was a Tamil blockbuster, but Eros only participated in the less lucrative Hindi release. Additionally, our Tamil/Telugu revenue estimate is actually 85% higher than our Hindi revenue figure. This is notable for a few reasons. First, there are 23 Hindi movies compared to 19 Tamil/Telugu movies, so the difference is larger on a per film basis. Second, we would expect Hindi movies to be more profitable as they have a larger potential audience. Lastly, revenue from Tamil films is not tracked well and our research has indicated that there is frequently revenue exaggeration for Tamil films ( Source ). Thus, one could reasonably haircut this figure. We did not. Our updated 2014 revenue estimate of $72 million shows that Eros's reported revenue of $108 million is overstated by 49%. While we increased our prior estimate, the overstatement by the company is still enormous. In addition, $6.5 million, or 50%, of the increase in our estimate comes from a generous assumption that Eros was the sole distributor for many of the films even though competitors are listed as the distributor and/or there are no sources that independently validate that any of these films have ever been released theatrically. We are also attributing $3 million in revenue to Eros for twelve films that Eros claimed to "release" during fiscal 2014. However, we were unable to find any verifiable data. Box Office India tracked data on Golmaal in White House, a film that only had 6,400 total viewers. Eros earned a whopping $1,657. With no mention of these twelve films anywhere on the Internet, we doubt that the films earned anywhere close to $3 million for Eros. For the nineteen films that we hadn't included in our original analysis, but for which box office data was available, two were distributed by Eros and six were distributed by Ayngaran. The other eleven additional films often have distributor data available, but Eros or its subsidiaries are unsurprisingly not listed. We generously assumed Eros had worldwide distribution rights for four of those films where no distributor is mentioned, and the international distribution rights for seven where competitors are listed as distributors. This added $3.5 million to our revenue estimate. If anything, we think that our estimates are generous to the company. We believe incontrovertible proof now exists that Eros has significantly overstated its revenues. In total, we believe that theatrical revenues for fiscal year 2015 revenues were overstated by at least 116% and theatrical revenues for fiscal year 2014 revenues were overstated by at least 49%. Every aspect of Eros we have investigated has revealed serious red flags. A brief review of these red flags includes: Movie Count - The company provided a list of 64 and 68 movies for fiscal 2015 and 2014 respectively, 1 less than its regulatory filings for each year. 26% of these films were theatrically released prior to the fiscal year indicated. Revenue - Fiscal 2015 revenue is overstated by 116%. Fiscal 2014 revenue is overstated by 49%. Revenue - Television Syndication and Digital Ancillary Revenue implies a ~40% market share compared to a 15-19% market share based on theatrical revenues and single-digit market share based on theatrical revenues from third-party sources. Aggressive Accounting - The company changed its amortization period from 5 years to 10 which inflated operating profit by 172% during fiscal 2015. DSOs have steadily increased from 139 days in fiscal 2012 to 192 days in fiscal 2014. Since then, DSOs have rocketed to 280 as of June 30, 2015. Capital spending - There has been no credible explanation for the $100 million increase in capital spending during fiscal 2015. The additional information provided by the company today, namely that 26% of the films that they purchased were purchased post-theatrical release, makes the $276 million in investment during fiscal 2015 even more incredulous. CFO resignations - CFO of Eros PLC resigned May 2015 and CFO of Eros International Media resigned November 2014. Subsidiaries -The foreign subsidiaries are fueling the revenue growth, but the reported revenues are not being collected, resulting in massive growth in receivables. At one subsidiary, this receivable increase surpasses revenues for the period, an accounting impossibility. More than 100% of revenue growth is being earned in the UAE. Auditor - The company hides behind Grand Thornton as the auditor. However, small auditors audit the questionable foreign subsidiaries. Anil Jagetiy & Co. resigned as auditor of Eros Digital Private Ltd. and also audited many of the most important foreign subsidiaries. This firm uses a gmail address, has no website, and appears to have only one or two employees. ErosNow - Eros' claims to have a 3,000+ library. This is in stark contrast to the 1,162 films actually available on ErosNow. ErosNow - Management now claims that they hope to get a few million paid subscribers over the next 3-5 years and that it will contribute meaningfully over the long term. This is a big pullback from its $1.2 billion three-year goal discussed at the FBR Digital Media Conference on October 8, 2015. Related party transactions - The company has engaged in numerous related party transactions of dubious value. One particularly galling example is Next Gen receiving 9%, 14% and 13% of Eros's capital spending during fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Next Gen is 99% owned by an executive's mother and has no employees. We believe that Eros has provided us the definitive proof that the company's financial statements are not what they claim to be. The company produced a list of films that does not match in number what it claimed to have distributed. And when we audited the list film by film, we discovered that 26% of the films listed had been released in years preceding the fiscal year indicated by the company claims. Eros even included one film that has not yet even been released to theaters and therefore would count to fiscal year 2016 results. We then researched the company's theatrical revenues for the films it claims to have distributed in each fiscal year, omitting from the estimate though those films that we determined were released in other fiscal years. This analysis leads us to believe that the company has overstated its revenues in fiscal year 2015 by 116% and in fiscal year 2014 by 49%. This is the third installment of our investigations into Eros. The red flags that we originally identified continue to exist, but since we started peeling this onion each layer reveals more and more troubling red flags. Investors should be very concerned. As a next step, we will be writing to the company's auditors and the enforcement division of the SEC. Recall that the last time we did this, on UniPixel (NASDAQ: UNXL ), the company ultimately received an enforcement action and its stock has declined 96% since our first article. We expect Eros' stock will decline by as much or more. We believe the stock is worthless. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
