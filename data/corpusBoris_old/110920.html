Alaska’s Got a Great Balance Sheetâ€”and a Shrinking Economy - Real Time Economics - WSJ Alaska ranked as the state with the best balance sheet in fiscal year 2013, which includes parts of 2013 and 2014, according to a newly released study by George Mason Universityâ€™s Mercatus Center. Alaska ranked as the state with the best balance sheet in fiscal year 2013 , which includes parts of 2013 and 2014, according to a newly released study by George Mason Universityâ€™s Mercatus Center. And the state ranked dead last in economic growth in 2014, with its economy contracting for the second straight year, according to the Commerce Department. State finances and economic performance are only partially tied. A struggling economy can lower tax revenue and weaken balance sheets, but a weak balance sheet may take a long time to translate to diminished growth. Refinancing debt, putting off pension obligations and cutting services can allow a state to avoid a major setback for years, if not decades. One yearâ€™s balance sheet doesnâ€™t set the tone for the economy, said Eileen Norcross, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center. Alaskaâ€™s high ranking reflects strong tax revenue tied to oil production and a solid base of natural resources. â€œAlaska is an outlier,â€? Ms. Norcross said. â€œTheyâ€™re very dependent on revenue from oil to support state services, and thatâ€™s a big risk for them.â€? And, in fact, a major contributor to the Alaskan economyâ€™s 1.3% contraction last year was declining oil and mining production. The Last Frontier suffered as expanding energy output in the lower 48 states pushed down oil prices. States with the best long-term fiscal position were a little further down Mercatus Centerâ€™s latest rankings, Ms. Norcross said. She pointed to Florida, No. 5, and Indiana, No. 16, as states that have addressed future pension obligations and have low debt levels. â€œIn the long-term picture, those policies should support economic health,â€? she said. â€œTheyâ€™re paying the bills as they come due and shouldnâ€™t have to raise taxes in the future to make up the difference.â€? The Mercatus Center is a right-leaning think tank that receives funding from conservative donors. Florida ranked 11th in economic growth last year. Indiana ranked 44th. Illinois and New Jersey ranked last in fiscal conditions and had below-average economic growth last year. Illinoisâ€™s economy advanced 1.2% last year. New Jerseyâ€™s output advanced just 0.4%. Those states have struggled with budget shortfalls and have had to take on additional debt to meet pension obligations, Ms. Norcross said. North Dakota, the state benefiting most from the recent energy boom , ranked first in 2014 economic growth and second for its fiscal condition. Ms. Norcross said North Dakota should use its windfall to pay down future obligations rather than ramp up services, especially since those energy gains are already showing signs of easing.
