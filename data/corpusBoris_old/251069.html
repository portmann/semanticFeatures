Research: In-depth coverage of more than 5200 stocks, many of which have little or no coverage         elsewhere. I am projecting Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corp. will report a modest (at or greater than 2%, but less than 5%) decrease in NAV and generate an economic loss during the quarter ending 9/30/2015. Consistent with most BDC peers, I anticipate the company will record an elevated level of net depreciation within its investment portfolio during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. Fifth Street also recorded various prior period adjustments during the quarter, which affected its balance sheet and income statement. This article discusses the impacts to the company's prior/current/future financial statements. It continues to fund the FSFR Glick JV, which allows the company to expand its investment portfolio. Management continues to expect a low-teens return on this specific investment vehicle. In addition to my BUY, SELL, or HOLD recommendation, this article provides some positive and negative factors to consider when choosing Fifth Street as a possible equity investment. Author's Note: This article provides a detailed analysis with supporting documentation on Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corp.'s (NASDAQ: FSFR ) projected net asset value ("NAV") per share as of 9/30/2015. I perform this detailed analysis for readers who anticipate/want such an analysis performed each quarter. For readers who just want the summarized conclusions/results of the NAV projection analysis, I would suggest scrolling down to the "Conclusions Drawn" section near the bottom of the article. The focus of this article is to provide a detailed projection of FSFR's NAV per share as of 9/30/2015. Prior to the results being provided to the public after the markets close on 12/7/2015 (via the company's quarterly press release), I would like to analyze its NAV as of 9/30/2015 and provide readers a general direction on how I believe this recent quarter has panned out. I will also include my quarterly "net investment income" ("NII") and "net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations" (also known as "earnings per share" ("EPS")) projections in this article. I will also discuss the impacts from FSFR's recorded adjustments as it relates to the company's prior/current/future financial statements. Before we begin the company's NAV projection analysis, I wanted to provide readers my current thoughts in regards to FSFR as a possible equity investment. This should help some readers better understand what is currently occurring within the company regarding several key metrics and also assist when reading the NAV projection analysis. My current BUY, SELL, or HOLD recommendation for FSFR will be at the bottom of this section of the article. Currently, I believe there are seven reasons why this could be considered an attractive equity investment for investors. However, to remain prudent, I also believe there are several "cautionary/negative" factors which would likely "steer" some investors away from currently owning FSFR as a possible equity investment. Let us first discuss the positive factors. First, FSFR trades at a material discount to my projected NAV as of 9/30/2015 (per share figure provided near the end of the article). As of 11/27/2015, the stock price was $8.74 per share. This calculates to a discount of ($3.19) per share for a price-to-NAV ratio of 0.7324 (a 26.76% discount). I believe some investors would see this material discount to NAV as an attractive opportunity to own FSFR. As such, even though it had an annual forward yield to its NAV as of 6/30/2015 of 7.36%., the company had an annual forward yield to its stock price as of 11/27/2015 of 10.30%. I believe this current yield, which is currently in excess of 10.00%, is one positive factor of owning FSFR. Second, even though the company materially reduced its monthly dividend per share rate beginning in September 2015 (which was a negative trend when it occurred), the new, more cautious, dividend per share rate has a higher probability of being maintained over a long period of time. I believe investors will eventually "come to terms" with the new, more cautious, dividend and ultimately have more comfort knowing that another decrease in the future is a fairly low probability. Third, FSFR announced several quarters ago it had formed a joint venture ("JV") partnership with members of the Glick Family (GF Funding) to expand the company's investment portfolio. This newly created JV partnership is called "FSFR Glick Family JV LLC" (FSFR Glick JV), and was formed during the fiscal first quarter of 2015. FSFR has continued to state the company expects to generate an annual return in the low-teens in regard to this recently formed JV partnership. When fully funded, FSFR Glick JV is expected to generate annual returns approximately 500 basis points ("bps") above FSFR's average return on investment ("ROI"). This is due to the fact that management fees are based on the net assets of FSFR Glick JV (not gross assets), which is one strategic advantage. In addition, by utilizing JV partnerships, FSFR can "circumvent" the business development company ("BDC") debt-to-equity leverage ratio threshold of 1.0x, while still maintaining its Regulated Investment Company ("RIC") status per the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC"). By the end of June 2015, FSFR Glick JV had $147.6 million in assets consisting of senior secured loans. This funding has been provided through equity by both partners and through the JV's $200 million revolving credit facility with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands (Credit Suisse). Management anticipates FSFR Glick JV will have an investment capacity of approximately $300 million. As such, the JV was not fully "ramped up" during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. As it continues to grow, the benefits of this type of investment structure should begin to have a more material impact towards the end of 2015 and into the calendar year 2016. Management has also stated FSFR will likely have future discussions with other interested third parties to create additional JV partnerships over the next several years. I believe the strategic advantages of these types of JV partnerships should be seen as a positive factor. Fourth, FSFR has recently continued to expand the company's available borrowings. In June 2015, management announced the refinancing of the company's previously amended $200 million Natixis/Fifth Third Bank Revolving Credit Facility/Term Loans by closing a $309 million "debt securitization". In conjunction with this event, FSFR issued $223 million of long-term notes, which are secured by the company's underlying portfolio investments. These long-term notes are termed the "2015 Notes" and have five different "classes". The weighted average interest rate associated with the five classes of 2015 Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 2.01%, which is a slight improvement when compared to the weighted average of the existing $200 million Natixis/Fifth Third Bank Revolving Credit Facility/Term Loans. The debt securitization has a four-year reinvestment period, a two-year non-call period, and a ten-year maturity. As such, FSFR has extended the maturity of a material portion of the company's borrowings at attractive debt financing rates. Even though an increase in LIBOR will cause an increase to FSFR's cost of funds rate, the company has nearly 100% of its investment portfolio in senior secured, floating-rate debt investments. As such, any increase in interest expense will be "trumped" by an increase in interest income once FSFR's weighted average cash floor is surpassed. Furthermore, in all likelihood, net interest spreads will increase as the "base rate" on all new lower middle market ("LMM") and middle-market ("MM") loans will be at a higher stated rate in a rising interest rate environment. Fifth, in relation to the point above, during the fiscal third quarter of 2015, FSFR wrote off the unamortized portion of deferred costs in relation to the company's existing $200 million Natixis/Fifth Third Bank Revolving Credit Facility/Term Loans. This "one-time" expense caused the company's NII to net decrease by ($0.03) per share during the fiscal third quarter of 2015. This was due to the fact FSFR reported a material increase in quarterly interest expense partially offset by lower quarterly incentive fees. I am anticipating no such event occurred during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, which would be considered a positive factor. Sixth, management has continued to reiterate FSFR does not anticipate issuing shares of common stock below CURRENT NAV for the foreseeable future. Even though I have stated I was against the August 2014 equity offering (due to the fact that it was materially dilutive to existing shareholders; at the time, I did not own this stock), I am comforted management will not perform any further dilutive actions for the foreseeable future. I believe this notion has been solidified by the recent expansion of the company's available debt financing, which was discussed earlier. As such, I believe FSFR not performing any dilutive equity offerings for the foreseeable future continues to be another positive factor. Finally, the material decrease in the price of oil during FSFR's fiscal first and fourth quarters of 2015 has caused "distress"/speculation to surround most of the oil & gas sector (including parts of the energy sector) regarding falling margins and potential struggling/bankrupt entities. While I would agree the markets should have some sort of generalized "cause for concern" within the high-yield debt market, I also believe one needs to "drill down" to each BDC's debt and equity investments to see which portfolio companies could be affected by this event. As of 12/31/2014, only 0.78% of FSFR's portfolio had debt and equity investments within the oil & gas sector (including certain investments in the energy sector which had "oil & gas" characteristics). As of 6/30/2015, this percentage remained relatively unchanged at 0.71%. When compared to the ten other BDC peers I currently cover, this was one of the lowest percentages at potential risk for investment depreciation due to falling crude oil/natural gas prices. As of 6/30/2015, I calculated Apollo Investment Corp. (NASDAQ: AINV ), Main Street Capital Corp. (NYSE: MAIN ), Medley Capital Corp. (NYSE: MCC ), and Prospect Capital Corp. (NASDAQ: PSEC ) had a 16.92%, 5.29%, 6.10%, and 4.34% exposure to the oil & gas sector, respectively (again, including certain investments in the energy sector which had "oil & gas" characteristics). I believe FSFR's continued extremely low exposure to the oil & gas sector (percentage-wise) should be seen as a positive factor. Now, let us discuss three cautionary/negative factors. The first cautionary/negative factor is in relation to FSFR's external manager, Fifth Street Asset Management Inc. (NASDAQ: FSAM ), and the company's affiliate, Fifth Street Finance Corp. (NASDAQ: FSC ). Currently, FSAM, FSC, and certain members of each entity's prior/current executive management team/officers are defendants in several class action lawsuits where plaintiffs have alleged the defendants knowingly/fraudulently inflated asset valuations of several of FSC's portfolio companies prior to FSAM's "initial public offering" ("IPO"). While the lawsuit DOES NOT state there was any "wrongdoing" on the part of FSFR, it should be noted the company's executive management team/officers are stated as defendants in these lawsuits, as certain individuals also manage FSC's investment portfolio. As such, these current lawsuits may indirectly impact FSFR's business operations regarding management's time devoted to the case (for instance, meeting with legal counsel, appearances in court to testify, etc.) and the potential for an eventual change in the executive management team/officers. At this point in time, I believe it is only prudent to consider the impacts this event may have regarding FSFR. Second, it was recently disclosed that FSAM erroneously calculated FSC's and FSFR's portion of incentive fees (account description at the BDC level) over a period of several years. These erroneous calculations occurred because FSC and FSFR revised each company's accounting treatment of certain fees when loans were originated. Over the several years I covered FSC and FSFR, management continued to "front-load" certain advisory, servicing, and/or structuring fees in relation to loan originations. In prior articles, I have noted this was more of an "aggressive stance" regarding revenue recognition under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). I also stated the more cautious/consistent treatment of such fees were to recognize revenue over the estimated life of the applicable loan. It is somewhat discouraging that Fifth Street's external auditors over this time period did not "catch" this error sooner, since an unqualified opinion continued to be provided for all affected companies. An unqualified opinion simply means the external auditors did not see any "material misstatements" within FSAM's, FSC's, and/or FSFR's financial statements (and all disclosures) during each company's annual audit. So, in other words, due to each company's change in accounting treatment, FSC and FSFR overstated certain portions of revenue, while overpaying each company's respective share of incentive fees for several years. With that being said, since FSC and FSFR made prior period adjustments to the recognition of certain revenue, partially offset by a reduction in incentive fees paid to FSAM, both company's prior period financial statements were negatively impacted for most quarters (a net "reverse effect" occurred during the fiscal third quarter of 2015). Since this is a revenue recognition "timing" issue, in future quarters both FSC and FSFR should actually record additional revenue from these specific loans, since revenue is being recognized over the estimated life of the loan versus recognizing the entire amount of applicable fees at origination. A projection of FSFR's prior period adjustments and the impact on the company's prior period NAV (which will be recorded during the current quarter) will be provided later in the article. Third, consistent with most BDC peers during the quarter ending 9/30/2015, I anticipate FSFR will record a notable amount of net depreciation within the company's investment portfolio during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. This is due to market volatility and the negative pricing of loans in the LMM, MM, and especially, the syndicated loan market. As such, I believe this is a short-term negative factor when the company reports quarterly results. My BUY, SELL, or HOLD Recommendation: From the analysis that was provided above, and including the analysis that will be provided below, I currently rate FSFR as a SELL when the company's stock price is trading at less than a (20%) discount to NAV as of 9/30/2015, a HOLD when trading at or greater than a (20%) but less than a (30%) discount to NAV as of 9/30/2015, and a BUY when trading at or greater than a (30%) discount to NAV as of 9/30/2015. As such, I currently rate FSFR as a HOLD. My current price target is $9.60 per share. While I believe the stock is fairly attractive at current valuations, I also believe the three cautionary/negative factors listed above will likely cause some short-term pricing pressure on the stock. As such, I believe a better entry point for FSFR will likely occur after FSC's/FSFR's earnings are released. In addition, I anticipate continued volatility in markets due to speculation surrounding the timing of the Federal Open Market Committee's ("FOMC") initial increase to the Fed Funds Rate and recent global macroeconomic events. Each investor's BUY, SELL, or HOLD decision is based on one's risk tolerance, time horizon, and dividend income goals. My personal recommendation will not fit each investor's current investing strategy. Overview of FSFR's Projected NAV as of 9/30/2015: Due to the fact that several figures needed to project/calculate FSFR's NAV as of 9/30/2015 come directly from the company's consolidated statement of operations, I have provide Table 1 below. Table 1 shows FSFR's consolidated statement of operations from a twelve-months ended time frame. Using Table 1 below as a reference, one must add certain account figures from the fiscal first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015 for purposes of projecting a suitable NAV as of 9/30/2015. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, including all calculated figures and projected valuations) Having provided Table 1 above (in particular, FSFR's "Fiscal Twelve-Months Ended (ESTIMATE)" column), we can now begin to calculate the company's projected NAV as of 9/30/2015. This projection will be calculated using Table 2 below. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, including all calculated figures and projected valuations; some referenced figures may not "foot" due to rounding) Using Table 2 above as a reference, let us take a look at the calculation for FSFR's projected NAV as of 9/30/2015. Unless otherwise noted, all figures below are for the "twelve-months ended" time frame. Let us look at the following figures (in corresponding order to the "Ref." column shown in Table 2 next to the September 30, 2015 column): Side Note: Predicting certain accounting figures within the BDC sector is usually more difficult when compared to other sectors due to the fair market value ("FMV") adjustments that occur within a company's investment portfolio each quarter. Specifically, the following two FSFR accounts are typically more difficult to project in any given quarter: 1) unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments; and 2) realized gain (loss) on investments. As such, there are several assumptions used when performing such an analysis. FSFR's actual reported values may differ materially from my projected values within this article due to unforeseen circumstances. This could occur because management deviates from a company's prior business strategy and pursues a new strategy that was not previously disclosed or anticipated. This could also occur when the company has a "one-time" extraordinary event which was previously unforeseen or disclosed. Readers should be aware as such. All projections within this article are my personal estimates and should not solely be used for any investor's buying or selling decisions. All actual reported figures that are above the mean of my account projections will be deemed an "outperformance" in my judgment. All actual reported figures that are below the mean of my account projections will be deemed an "underperformance" in my judgment. All prior period adjustments will solely be referenced within the classification "Prior Period Adjustments - Recorded by FSFR" (see red reference "F" in Table 2 above). This includes all prior period adjustments that occurred in reference to the company's fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015. For purposes of calculating a suitable adjusted NAV, only the impact to "net equity" is relevant. Even though I have gone back and projected an adjustment for all applicable income statement accounts in prior periods, such detail is unwarranted for purposes of this article. - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High - See Red Reference "A" in Table 2 Above Next to the September 30, 2015 Column This "net increase (decrease) in net assets from operations" figure consists of the following three amounts that come directly from FSFR's consolidated statement of operations: 1) net investment income (see blue reference "A" in Tables 1 and 2 above); 2) net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments (see blue reference "B" in Tables 1 and 2 above); and 3) net realized gain (loss) on investments (see blue reference "C" in Tables 1 and 2 above). Since I have refrained from writing a quarterly consolidated statement of operations projection article for FSFR (due to time constraints), I will summarize what I believe will occur within these three amounts during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. Let us first discuss the company's NII account. - See Blue Reference "A" in Tables 1 and 2 Above Next to the September 30, 2015 Column FSFR reported NII of $10.4, $6.7, and $6.3 million for the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015, respectively. I am projecting the company will report NII of $7.2 million for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. Using Tables 1 and 2 above as a reference, when combined this is a projected NII of $30.6 million for the twelve months ended 9/30/2015. Since the company began to fund FSFR Glick JV in April 2015, I am making the assumption some existing senior secured, floating-rate loans were transferred to this entity during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. This transfer would slightly lower the monetary amount of FSFR's investment portfolio due to the fact the company has a 87.5% ownership stake in the JV partnership (as opposed to 100%). In addition, LMM and MM lending, as a whole, have witnessed subdued levels of loan originations over the past several quarters. As such, I am projecting FSFR had an "average" level of quarterly loan originations funded at close and add-on investments during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. Therefore, I am projecting FSFR had quarterly loan originations funded at close and add-on investments of approximately $210 million during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 (includes new/add-on investments that were ultimately transferred to FSFR Glick JV during the quarter). As a result of its current strategy of rotating out of certain assets and taking advantage of deals when appropriate, I am projecting the company had portfolio sales/repayments/syndications of approximately ($225) million during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. When combining the company's quarterly loan originations funded at close and add-on investments less portfolio sales/repayments/syndications, I am projecting FSFR's total investment portfolio decreased by approximately ($15) million for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 (prior to all quarterly FMV fluctuations and scheduled principle payments). The projected increase in quarterly NII ($7.2 million for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, versus $6.3 million for the fiscal third quarter of 2015) is mainly attributed to FSFR increasing the company's interest income partially offset by an increase in incentive fees. In addition, there is a very high probability the company will record a notable decrease in its interest expense for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. As stated earlier, during the fiscal third quarter of 2015, FSFR had a one-time write-off of the remaining unamortized portion of deferred costs in relation to its existing $200 million Natixis/Fifth Third Bank Revolving Credit Facility/Term Loans. As such, I believe these trends should lead to an increase in FSFR's NII "quarter over quarter". Now let us discuss FSFR's net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments account. 2) Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments: - See Blue Reference "B" in Tables 1 and 2 Above Next to the September 30, 2015 Column FSFR reported net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments of ($4.4), $0.8, and ($2.5) million for the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015, respectively. I am projecting the company will report net unrealized depreciation on investments of ($4.0) million for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. Using Tables 1 and 2 above as a reference, when combined, this is a projected net unrealized depreciation on investments of ($10.0) million (rounded) for the twelve months ended 9/30/2015. In the prior quarter, the following notable valuation changes occurred within this account: 1) unrealized depreciation of ($0.6) million on FSFR Glick JV; 2) unrealized depreciation of ($1.1) million on Smile Brands Group, Inc.; 3) unrealized depreciation of ($2.1) million on Answers Corp.; 4) unrealized depreciation of ($0.4) million on B&H Education, Inc.; and 5) unrealized appreciation of $0.4 million on BeyondTrust Software, Inc. The remaining net change to this account consisted of numerous minor unrealized FMV fluctuations within the rest of FSFR's investment portfolio. Regarding the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, I am partially basing my projection of this account on the fact that the company only had a minimal amount of its capital allocated to more risky debt investments (unsecured notes, mezzanine loans) and equity investments. However, with that being said, interest rates fell across many facets of the U.S. and global bond markets during FSFR's fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. This trend, along with negative sentiment regarding most "fixed-income"/debt investment vehicles during the quarter caused a notable increase/widening in volatility/spreads. This caused varying levels of underperformance within residential/commercial mortgages, corporate bonds, and the high yield debt market. Spreads within most LMM, MM, and syndicated loans modestly-to-materially widened during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. Based on this notion (and several other analytical factors), I am projecting the net change to this account consisted of numerous minor-to-material (proportionately speaking) unrealized FMV fluctuations on the company's investment portfolio. This account's projection is formed from a detailed investment portfolio model that will be omitted from this article due to the sheer size of the data. Now, let us discuss FSFR's net realized gain (loss) on investments account. 3) Net Realized Gain (Loss) on Investments: - See Blue Reference "C" in Tables 1 and 2 Above Next to the September 30, 2015 Column FSFR reported a net realized loss on investments of ($0.6), ($1.0), and ($1.7) million for the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015, respectively. I am projecting the company will report a net realized loss on investments of ($2.8) million for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. Using Tables 1 and 2 above as a reference, when combined, this is a projected net realized loss on investments of ($6.0) million (rounded) for the twelve months ended 9/30/2015. This projection assumes a portion of the portfolio exits during the quarter were debt investments sold in the open market which slightly-to-modestly depreciated in value. As such, I'm anticipating various minor-to-modest net realized losses associated with these types of sales to market participants. Let us now combine the three amounts described above to come up with a proper net increase (decrease) in net assets from operations figure for the twelve months ended 9/30/2015. When combining NII of $30.6 million, a net unrealized depreciation on investments of ($10.0) million, and a net realized loss on investments of ($6.0) million, I am projecting FSFR had an increase in net assets from operations of $14.6 million for the twelve months ended 9/30/2015 (see red reference "A" in Table 2 above). - See Red Reference "B" and Blue Reference "D" in Table 2 Above Next to the September 30, 2015 Column - See Blue Reference "D" in Table 3 Below Side Note: As shown in Table 2 above, FSFR's "net increase (decrease) in net assets from stockholder transactions" figure is the equivalent of the company's "distributions to stockholders from net investment ICTI" figure. Since this is the only amount within this specific classification, both figures will be the same. This is a fairly simple calculation. This is FSFR's dividend distributions for the fiscal first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using FSFR data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database ) Using Table 3 above as a reference, the number of outstanding shares of common stock as of 7/30/2015, 9/2/2015, and 10/2/2015 (ex-dividend dates) is projected to be 29.5 million. This figure is unchanged from FSFR's outstanding shares of common stock as of 6/30/2015. I am also projecting no shares of common stock were issued as part of the company's dividend reinvestment plan for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 (discussed later in the article). Since the common stock dividend declared for July 2015, August 2015, and September 2015 was $0.10, $0.075, and $0.075 per share, respectively, I am projecting FSFR's dividend distributions totaled ($7.4) million for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. When this dividend distributions figure is combined with the nine-months ended dividend distributions of ($26.5) million, I am projecting FSFR had a decrease in net assets from stockholder transactions of ($33.9) million for the twelve months ended 9/30/2015 (see red reference "B" in Table 2 above and blue reference "D" in Tables 2 and 3 above). - See Red Reference "C" in Table 2 Above Next to the September 30, 2015 Column This "net increase (decrease) in net assets from capital share transactions" figure consists of the following three amounts: 1) issuance of common stock, net (see blue reference "E" in Table 2 above and Table 4 below); 2) issuance of common stock under dividend reinvestment plan, net (see blue reference "F" in Table 2 above and Table 5 below); and 3) repurchases of common stock. - See Blue Reference "E" in Table 2 Above Next to the September 30, 2015 Column - See Blue Reference "E" in Table 4 Below This is FSFR's issuance of common stock, net of underwriting fees and offering costs for the fiscal first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015. Since the company did not have any equity offerings (which would result in the issuance of common stock) during the fiscal first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015, this figure should remain at $0 for the twelve months ended 9/30/2015 (see blue reference "E" in Table 2 above and Table 4 below). (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using FSFR data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database [link provided below Table 1]) 2) Issuance of Common Stock Under Dividend Reinvestment Plan: - See Blue Reference "F" in Table 2 Above Next to the September 30, 2015 Column - See Blue Reference "F" in Table 5 Below This is FSFR's issuance of common stock under the company's dividend reinvestment plan for the fiscal first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using FSFR data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database [link provided below Table 1]) Using Table 5 above as a reference, I am assuming management will repurchase outstanding shares of common stock in the open market for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. This is due to the fact that the stock price, at the time of dividend distributions for the quarter, was materially below the company's NAV of $12.23 per share as of 6/30/2015. FSFR repurchases outstanding shares of common stock in the open market to distribute as part of the company's dividend reinvestment plan (net effect of 0 additional outstanding shares of common stock issued). This strategy is implemented when FSFR's stock, at the time of dividend distributions, is priced at a discount to NAV. As such, I am not projecting any additional capital proceeds from the issuance of new shares of common stock under the company's dividend reinvestment plan for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. Therefore, I am projecting the company will report an issuance of common stock under its dividend reinvestment plan figure of $0 for the twelve months ended 9/30/2015 (see blue reference "F" in Tables 2 and 5 above). - See Table 2 Above Next to the September 30, 2015 Column for Reference Management may intend to repurchase outstanding shares of common stock when FSFR's stock price is at a material discount to the company's NAV. Even though throughout the entire quarter the stock continued to trade well below the company's NAV of $12.23 per share as of 6/30/2015, I am assuming management did not initiate any share buybacks during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. In my opinion, it would not make too much sense to repurchase outstanding shares of common stock when, in August 2014, FSFR issued new shares of common stock at a material discount to NAV as of 6/30/2014. Do not get me wrong, issuing shares at a net issuance price of $12.19 per share and then repurchasing a portion of these outstanding shares at a weighted average price of approximately $9.25 per share for the quarter would be net accretive to FSFR's NAV. However, I do not believe it would pursue such a strategy, due to the fact that management wanted to use the net proceeds from the August 2014 equity offering to expand the company's investment portfolio. FSFR also needs to consider certain RIC leverage ratio thresholds to remain in compliance with the IRC. Therefore, I am projecting FSFR will report a repurchases of common stock figure of $0 for the twelve months ended 9/30/2015 (see Table 2 above). If FSFR repurchases outstanding shares of common stock in future quarters at this type of discount level, I believe that would be a positive factor for the company, as it would be accretive to NAV. When combining net equity proceeds in common stock issuances of $0, net equity proceeds in relation to the company's dividend reinvestment plan of $0, and equity in relation to repurchases of common stock of $0, I am projecting FSFR had no change in net assets from capital share transactions for the twelve months ended 9/30/2015 (see red reference "C" in Table 2 above). FSFR's Prior Period Adjustments and the Net Impact on NAV: As stated earlier in the article, during FSFR's fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, its external manager erroneously calculated the company's portion of incentive fees over a period of several years. These erroneous calculations occurred because the company revised its accounting treatment of certain fees when loans were originated. Over the course of several years, management continued to "front-load" certain advisory, servicing, and/or structuring fees in relation to loan originations. Due to its change in accounting treatment, FSFR overstated certain portions of revenue while overpaying its incentive fees for several years. However, since this is a timing issue, in future quarters the company should actually record additional revenue from these specific loans, since revenue is being recognized over the estimated life of the loan versus recognizing the entire amount of applicable fees at origination. I strongly believe FSFR's prior period adjustments will have a direct impact on its NAV as of 9/30/2015. Through extensive research and reconciliations, I have gone back several years and projected an adjustment of FSFR's NAV for each applicable quarter where adjustments occurred. However, as stated earlier, for purposes of this article I solely adjusted the company's NAV as of 9/30/2015, since NAV is a "cumulative" balance that incorporates all prior- and current-quarter activity. When calculating FSFR's NAV as of 9/30/2015 when solely including all of the company's prior period adjustments, I am projecting NAV to net decrease by ($1.8) million, or ($0.06) per share. To sum up all the information discussed above, I am projecting FSFR will report the following NAV per share as of 9/30/2015: FSFR's Projected NAV as of 9/30/2015 = $11.93 Per Share FSFR's Projected NAV Range as of 9/30/2015 = $11.73-12.13 Per Share This projection is a decrease of ($0.30) per share from FSFR's NAV as of 6/30/2015 (including all prior period adjustments). This modest (at or greater than 2%, but less than 5%) decrease in NAV can be attributed to the following quarterly per share changes: (Source: Table created entirely by myself, including all calculated figures and projected valuations) Using Table 6 above as a reference, I am projecting FSFR's net increase in net assets resulting from operations (also known as EPS) was $0.01 per share for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 (rounded to the nearest cent). In comparison, I am projecting the company had dividend distributions of ($0.25) per share for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 (also rounded to the nearest cent). I am also projecting the net cumulative effect of FSFR's prior period adjustments was an NAV decrease of ($0.06) per share. After adding these three amounts together, a decrease of ($0.30) per share for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 is obtained. The main reason for the projected modest (at or greater than 2%, but less than 5%) decrease in NAV is in relation to an elevated level of investment depreciation within various portfolio companies during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. As such, I am also projecting FSFR generated a minor economic loss of (0.37%) for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015.
