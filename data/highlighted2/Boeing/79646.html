Very recently it was revealed that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA had entered into a billion deal with Shenzhen Airlines where the Beijingbased passenger carrier will purchase models This could potentially be a game changer for the American Airline manufacturer especially given how its European rival Airbus Groups OTCPKEADSF stock has offered investors better returns Where Airbus stock has seen a rise of more than since the beginning of the year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>stock has only experienced an appreciation This new contract with the Chinese airline is bound to be lucrative for both companies Boeings price list shows that its Family models range from million to million however it is important to note that bulk orders in the airline industry are often complemented with discounts Either way this offers a wonderful boost to the Chicagobased airplane manufacturer Up until the second half of last year Boeings earnings were backed by a record backlog of more than units which needed to be delivered to its clients all across the world Around that time if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>continued production at that very rate then it would have taken them years to clear the massive backlog However when you compare that to Airbus order book at the end of the first quarter you can see a much different picture Boeings European rivals order book was worth billion which was higher since the start of the year However the total takes into account a positive revaluation of the US Dollars recent strength and is given at list prices which mean that at the current exchange rate the number stands at just above trillion On the other hand Boeings backlog in the same period consists of just over planes and according to its financial report the companys backlog stood at billion down by since the start of the year By the end of April of this year Airbus reportedly had a backlog of aircrafts which the company believes more than ensures a steady stream of production from the upcoming decade Now just maintaining a backlog is not what drives growth and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>seems to realize that The airplane manufacturing giant began to assemble the wings of its upgraded s using automation designed to boost factory output far beyond the current record pace The start of this factorys operation to produce the wings of Max marks the meeting of a schedule which the company set years ago as well as increasing much needed efficiency in the production process In fact the new automated process reduces manufacturing time by while at the same time taking up less than half the floor space of the system it replaced and all of this without any downsizing in sight till fiscal Now the Max was launched as a response to the Airbus Aneo In other words this factory upgrade is going to streamline the expenses in the financials and will most likely have a direct impact on Boeings bottom line There are about orders for the new Max as compared to the nearly orders for the Aneo models The upgraded factory in Seattle Washington is expected to churn out the first Max wing by this summer and should help the company maintain its schedule to begin test flights by early with the first aircraft to be delivered to Southwest Airlines Co in the third quarter of fiscal The upgrades at the plant are going to continue to the point where the company expects to increase aircraft production to per month by the end of fiscal Not to be left behind Airbus plans to increase production of its Aneo to aircrafts a month by the end of fiscal and are mulling over options to further increase the production capacity When we take a look at Airbus financials we realize that the top line actually shrunk by million to billion in the first quarter of fiscal as compared to the same period last year however profit for the period rose by more than to its current position of million leaving EPS per share A large part of this gain in earnings was driven by the sale of of Airbus stake in Dassault Aviation the French fighter jet maker The sale raised around billion which ultimately had positive effect of about million on its earnings before interest and taxes EBIT for the first quarter of the fiscal year of grew by to its current position of billion and repeating such a feat might not be feasible for the European aircraft manufacturer might not be so simple in the coming quarters In the same period <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>saw its EBIT grow by to billion while its EPS grew by to per share The Chicagobased aircraft manufacturer saw its operating margins improve by point to and it is likely that this number will continue to improve given its recent improvements in its plant in Seattle Not surprisingly Airbus operating margin stood at showing how much more efficient <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is at managing its costs in comparison to the Blagnac France based company With commercial aircraft sales making up more than of both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus total revenues it only makes sense to pursue the segment Right now more than of Boeings total revenue is generated within the US and with the US economy expected to make a recovery which will be signaled by a rise in interest rates by the Federal Reserve we can be optimistic about Boeings chances of maintaining growth However a report published in October last year by the International Air Transport Association IATA forecasts that in the next years the fastest increasing markets in terms of additional passengers per year will be lead by China and followed by the US India Indonesia and Brazil in that order This is where Airbus has the upper hand as it generated nearly of its revenue last year from the Asia Pacific region with only being generated in North America As of this very moment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>stock trades at per share and has a week return of with a healthy EPS of In the latest quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>paid cash dividends of per share as compared to per share it paid in the same quarter last year The company expects its full year revenues to hover between billion to billion as it expects to deliver between and aircrafts during the year a rise from the units it delivered last year What we can expect this year is that Airbus will most likely experience strong top line growth but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will manage to improve its bottom line growth in its EPS owing to its exemplary cost managing efforts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will most likely continue to be a reliable long term holding stock Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities
