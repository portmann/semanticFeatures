the site Now allow me to writeexactlythe same thing using what Slope patron saint George Carlin lovingly described as simple direct honest language Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site It must have been scary for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>for those few months in which the all important ExIm bank was taken offline The result moments ago BA announced Q earnings which while beating expectations which were sharply lowered in recent months of were still a drop compared to Q of last year driven by a drop in the top line leading to a substantial decline in gross profit from billion to just billion and a whopping plunge in operating cash flow to just billion and biliion in FCF The sharp decline took place even as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>benefited generously from Americas numerous wars around the globe leading to a increase in military aircraft revenue in the fourth quarter however it was not enough to offset a drop in commercial aircraft deliveries which at in Q were lower from the a year ago But the biggest hit to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was its slashed guidance which came in far below consensus estimates Boeings Core EPS guidance of between and was far below the expected Boeings Revenue of billion was also well below the billion expected However the cherry on top was a reported that came not in the earnings report but a few hours earlier when the Seattle Times announced that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is likely to announce Wednesday morning another production rate cut this time for the program according to a senior executive with a customer whom <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>consulted as it prepared its plan Just last week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>announced that due to slow sales it would cut the rate on the jumbo jet program starting in September to one plane every two months The company said it would book an million pretax writeoff as a result of that rate cut Another multimilliondollar charge would need to be added if the is cut A second source also indicated that the announcement could come Wednesday when the company reports its quarterly earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>currently doesnt have enough sales to fill all the delivery slots between now and when production of the new X kicks into high gear after the turn of the decade Most Wall Street analysts have been predicting a rate cut from the current jets per year but after the cut theyve assumed a announcement wouldnt come until later in the year Which explains our confusion when one month ago we reported that a Used <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Sells For Off List Price In short it is clear that the manufacturing recession is now hitting such Dow Jones stalwarts as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and speaking of hit BA was down almost at last check and since it accounts for of the Dow Jones the aircraft maker will weigh on the entire market for the rest of todays session But the biggest surprise is that BA did not announce some massive debtfunded buyback program is management or its bankers getting worried that levering up massively to repurchase stock is no longer

<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>with new wings and engines and is due in a few years Many of Boeings customers have decided to wait for the new one rather than buy the older less
