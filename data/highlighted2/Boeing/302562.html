We also generated significant cash flow to fuel investments in innovation and our people, and provide compelling returns to our shareholders.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With clear strategies and strong positions in our markets , a large and diverse order backlog worth <b>nearly</b> $ 500 billion , and multiple additional production rate increases planned yet this decade , we are well positioned for profitable growth and <i>higher</i> cash flow as we move into our second century in business .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Our priorities for 2016 and beyond are to build on our existing strengths to deliver on current plans and commitments , and to stretch beyond them by accelerating progress on key enterprise growth and productivity initiatives , investing in our team , and creating <i>more</i> value and opportunity for our customers , shareholders and employees . ''  (Surprise) </span>I thought the performance this quarter so-so, despite the 747 program charge and revenue declines in some segments.Revenue although down was strong and earnings delivered a beat.So why are shares being punished?Well the 2016 outlook was light.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And that caught me by <b>surprise</b> .  (Surprise) </span>Revenue guidance is between $93 and $95 billion, including commercial deliveries of between 740 and 745.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Operating cash flow is expected to be <b>approximately</b> $ 10 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Core earnings per share guidance for 2016 was for between $ 8.15 and $ 8.35 , which is <i>higher</i> than 2015 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As you can see , the revenue guidance is <i>lower</i> than what was brought in during 2015 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I will point out that <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> <b>revises</b> guidance throughout the year and this is subject to change . (Boeing: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A 10 % haircut on this name <b>seems</b> overdone , but remember this is a long-term game .  (Uncertainty) </span>We care about the long-term.And the long term is where I am focused.With that, I feel like the market is discounting the fact core earnings per share guidance and operating cash flow guidance were increased relative to 2015.Further, the company is very shareholder friendly.During the quarter, the company repurchased 5 million shares for $800 million, leaving $5.2 billion remaining under the current repurchase authorization.In 2015, the company repurchased 46 million shares for $6.8 billion.That is incredible.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Further , <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> also paid $ 0.6 billion in dividends in the quarter , reflecting an <b>approximately</b> 25 % increase in dividends per share compared to the same period of the prior year . (Boeing: Uncertainty) </span>The stock yields 3.4% at its current price of $115.25.Wait for the dust to settle, and there will be a chance to scoop shares at a nice price for the long-term.Note from the author: Christopher F.
