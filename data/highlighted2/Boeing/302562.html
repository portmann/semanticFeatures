are long BA MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article I waited and waited to get into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>stock and now that I am in there is a large selloff both market and company performance driven Q earnings are out and there are some clear positives and some obvious weakness The stocks performance has less to do with Q and more to do with the light expectations The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSE BA used to be a stock that I found myself constantly reflecting on and saying why didnt I buy it THIS time On every meaningful pullback I considered a position but never got in The stock has provided capital appreciation and dividend growth and that is why I got in back in December This was as the company raised its dividend and expanded its buyback Both very positive for shareholders But now was we enter we need to consider where the stock is going There have been some good pieces of news First right before the Christmas holiday we learned that the company booked orders for commercial jets in the week before the holiday everyone for the companys suite of jets That is strong <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>at that point had booked deals for jets net through December nd Then a week later on New Years Eve we learned that FedEx NYSE FDX committed to purchasing another <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s We also learned that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>recently picked up another million contract with the Pentagon This contract involves upgrades and logistic support for the TC supersonic trainer aircraft and this work will be completed in about a decade This was key as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>beat out a competitor for this contract Just last week United Airlines NYSE UAL committed to purchase of the companys s while cutting back production on s I was pleased with the recent developments minus the charge related to the s but the stock has been getting punished with the market Now of course I am thinking I should have known better Why do I say that Maybe it is buyers remorse but after waiting and waiting to get in now the stock is getting hit I do plan to add to the position on continued weakness as this is a longterm buy but still its disappointing But is this temporary weakness or is there more to be concerned with To answer the question we need to review the companys performance but also discuss where the company is heading First off the just reported fourth quarter was decent The numbers beat estimates The company reported revenue was billion in the quarter and a record billion on strong commercial deliveries Quarterly revenues beat estimates by million Core earnings per share for the quarter were down yearoveryear to versus last year Core earnings per share totaled for the full year reflecting the KC Tanker Q and program Q write off charges of per share but these charges were of course offset in part by strong core operating performance across the company Lets take a look at some of the sector highlights to get a feel for the performance The Commercial Airplanes segment saw fourthquarter revenue dip slightly to billion on lower delivery volume while operating margins was This is down from Qs strong margins of The reason is that in Q there was the million pretax charge on the program In total the program has won nearly firm orders for the MAX since launch It is important to note that the companys X program is on schedule for first delivery in Commercial Airplanes booked net orders during the quarter Backlog remains strong with nearly airplanes valued at billion In the companys Defense Space Security segment revenue was a strong billion with an operating margin of But why Well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Military Aircraft performed exceptionally with fourthquarter revenue increasing to billion primarily as a result of higher volumes The company saw some strong contracts in the quarter as well The Network Space Systems division saw revenue of billion and its operating margin was One of the key developments was that NASA awarded <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>its second commercial contract for a human spaceflight mission as part of the existing Commercial Crew contract The Global Services Support Division saw revenue increase to billion due to timing of airborne control deliveries and its operating margin increased to on strong performance Like with the Commercial Airplanes segment there is a significant backlog Backlog in this segment was billion of which represents orders from international customers Commenting on the quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>President and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg stated Building on our foundation of solid core operating performance and customer focus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>extended its leadership of the aerospace industry in with record deliveries and revenues in commercial airplanes and solid sales and healthy margins in our defense and space business We also generated significant cash flow to fuel investments in innovation and our people and provide compelling returns to our shareholders With clear strategies and strong positions in our markets a large and diverse order backlog worth nearly billion and multiple additional production rate increases planned yet this decade we are well positioned for profitable growth and higher cash flow as we move into our second century in business Our priorities for and beyond are to build on our existing strengths to deliver on current plans and commitments and to stretch beyond them by accelerating progress on key enterprise growth and productivity initiatives investing in our team and creating more value and opportunity for our customers shareholders and employees I thought the performance this quarter soso despite the program charge and revenue declines in some segments Revenue although down was strong and earnings delivered a beat So why are shares being punished Well the outlook was light And that caught me by surprise Revenue guidance is between and billion including commercial deliveries of between and Operating cash flow is expected to be approximately billion Core earnings per share guidance for was for between and which is higher than As you can see the revenue guidance is lower than what was brought in during I will point out that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>revises guidance throughout the year and this is subject to change A haircut on this name seems overdone but remember this is a longterm game We care about the longterm And the long term is where I am focused With that I feel like the market is discounting the fact core earnings per share guidance and operating cash flow guidance were increased relative to Further the company is very shareholder friendly During the quarter the company repurchased million shares for million leaving billion remaining under the current repurchase authorization In the company repurchased million shares for billion That is incredible Further <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>also paid billion in dividends in the quarter reflecting an approximately increase in dividends per share compared to the same period of the prior year The stock yields at its current price of Wait for the dust to settle and there will be a chance to scoop shares at a nice price for the longterm Note from the author Christopher F Davis has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early If you like his material and want to see
