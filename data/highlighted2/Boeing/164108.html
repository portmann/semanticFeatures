Look At Boeings Commercial Orders And Deliveries In August The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Dreamliner deliveries are exceeding expectations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA has updated its orders and deliveries overview up to and including August In this article I will have a look at how the order inflow and deliveries affect Boeings target and performance Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>orders up until August Source AeroAnalysisnet During August <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>received a total of orders for its widebody <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX and for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>A The catalogue value of the orders is bn but the estimated market value is probably around bn Up until August the jet maker has received orders The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>order inflow is boosted by the FedEx NYSE FDX order The orders for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>show a healthy demand for Boeings current including the freighter model and the upcoming X The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>orders are looking good as well considering that Russian Aeroflot canceled the Dreamliners it had on order <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had to scratch orders from its order book resulting in net orders for the year The number of orders grew by Growth was not as robust as in the previous months but it has to be noted that in June a lot of orders were finalized during the Paris Air Show and in July orders that were previously announced during the show were finalized as well In the same period last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>booked orders So currently order inflow is much lower than last year but are meeting expectations In its overview until the st of September <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>already included a deal for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>that was announced on the rd of September <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>probably included this deal in the overview because it breaks some psychological barriers While the number of orders tells something about the attractiveness of the product a manufacturer offers and the longterm prospect for the manufacturer for shortterm investors deliveries are more interesting to look at Since most of the money comes in after delivering an airframe it is important to meet the targeted number of deliveries in order to achieve the cash flow communicated to investors Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>deliveries up until August Source AeroAnalysis Boeings deliveries were in line with expectations Deliveries were a healthy mix of narrowbody aircraft and widebody aircraft The estimated market value of the deliveries is bn Orders for the were slightly lower than the expected deliveries The lower deliveries were partly offset by the higher Dreamliner deliveries Boeings target for the year is deliveries but months into the jet maker already delivered Dreamliners The deliveries also exceed the production rate of aircraft per month By yearend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could deliver as much as Dreamliners Increasing deliveriesproduction is one of the requirements to reach cash positive on the Dreamliner production so the higher deliveries do bode well for reaching cash positive on the Dreamliner production <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>delivered airframes The remains a program with more downs than ups the jet maker saw ANA canceling an order for Freighters while Korean Air became the first airline to operate the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>deliveries were in line with expectations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has set a delivery target of which means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is on track to meet its delivery target Key to meeting the target are high delivery volumes on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in the coming months One of the targets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has set for itself is a booktobill ratio of for the full year This means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aims to receive order for each <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>it delivers to customers In August Boeings booktobill ratio was which is in line with Boeings orders and deliveries up until August To reach the desired booktobill ratio of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>needs more than orders Looking at the order inflow yeartodate I think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will end the year with a book to bill ratio of Order inflow in August was in line with Boeings booktobill ratio Lower deliveries were offset by higher Dreamliner deliveries <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>probably will exceed its delivery target for the Dreamliner For the full year I dont see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>hitting its desired booktobill ratio Disclosure I amwe are long BA MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am
