But it sells aircraft.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When an airline buys an aircraft and finds it works well , they will buy <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Buying in <b>may</b> hurt , but it hurts once .  (Uncertainty) </span>As other airlines realize the advantages, they step up too.For example, once SWISS (owned by Lufthansa ( OTCQX:DLAKF ), ( OTCQX:DLAKY )) demonstrates it can fly its CS100 all over Europe at any hour of the night and not exceed any noise requirements, the competition will immediately be at a disadvantage.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As SWISS demonstrates the ability to serve the London city with a <i>better</i> cabin product , competitors have to notice .  (Surprise) </span>All the little advantages add up.Having SWISS as a customer puts the CSeries in the hands of an airline that is customer focused and has a premium brand image.The successful deployment of the CSeries is going to make other EU airlines that compete with SWISS have to figure out how to respond.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Many <b>may</b> end up buying CSeries too .  (Uncertainty) </span>The road from launch in 2008 to delivery in 2016 has been long and painful for Bombardier and its stockholders.The company burned through lots of capital and good people.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The lifeline from Québec helps <i>lower</i> the program <b>risk</b> considerably .

(Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the big US market , Delta will use the CSeries to drive traffic by offering a <i>better</i> service .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Once again , we see the potential for <i>more</i> CSeries sales as competitors realize they must match product offerings .  (Surprise) </span>Another example is apropos.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The CSeries has <i>better</i> cabin experience - <i>wider</i> seats and best-in-class overhead storage .  (Surprise) </span>People will select this aircraft once they have flown it when they make their next booking.Airbus has seen this with its A380.Travelers tend to be smart consumers because the sticker price on every purchase is relatively expensive, but also entails significant personal discomfort for extended time periods.Our report concludes the CSeries remains ahead of its competition.Its new management is up to the task of getting the program back on track and selling into key airlines.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Québec 's investment provides this management with the capital to do deals that will repay the investment by creating <i>more</i> high-skilled jobs as well as repaying the initial investment .
