Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will be cutting rates which will help bridge the gap somewhat BA will likely close the gap until As I discussed in my previous article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA finally admitted that the rate of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will come down as the jet maker inserts blanks that will be used for the production of X parts The production will be cut in Assuming that no <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X airframes will be delivered until the start of the rate cut will result in a bn lower revenue per year or bn until the first delivery of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X Six months ago I showed the above image I calculated that at least orders were required to fill all the delivery slots until the start of while maintaining a production rate of aircraft per year An extra orders might be required since X airframes will not be rolling out of the factories at high production rates from the start So in a best case scenario <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>needed an additional orders Now months later it is worth looking at how the gap and production rate have developed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>already announced that the production rate for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will be cut in meaning that less order inflow is required to bridge the gap It is however interesting to look whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was even close to filling the gap without cutting rates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>remained confident that it would be able to maintain current production rates This means that the company was confident on receiving between about orders per year for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>United Airlines NYSE UAL ordered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ERs Remaining orders were from unidentified customers So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>did quite a good job securing orders the combination of performance upgrades and discounts is helping the jet maker securing orders Currently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has unfilled orders Figure Production gap <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Source DhierinPerkash Bechai Figure shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would need about orders to fill all the delivery slots until So the company did make some progress but it needs to get a lot more orders to fill the gap <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>also recognized this and from and onwards it will be reducing the production rate from to per month Figure Production gap <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>after rate cut Source DhierinPerkash Bechai The rate cut will result in a gap of airframes So although the rate cut does help somewhat the impact is marginal This is caused by the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>delayed a rate cut as much as it can and has the possibility for final rate cut in if required This means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is assuming it will receive enough orders in the years to come To close the gap <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>needs to receive about orders per year to be exact In my previous article I was somewhat skeptical about the companys ability to receive orders to fill the gap but the addition of the performance improvement package and the discount convinced me a bit more that it can actually close the gap So Boeings plan more or less looks as follows Figure Visualization of rate cuts and order inflow requirement Source DhierinPerkash Bechai Figure shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can close the gap when it gets an additional orders this year and in the years to come while cutting the rate by unit per month in BA already acquired orders this year and probably will try to secure some more during this years Paris Air Show Emirates the largest operator of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER still holds purchase rights for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER and might acquire up to more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>LRs If Emirates places the order and firms up its purchase rights BA will add another s to its order book which is a huge step forward So far I only looked how to close the gap until when the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X enters service The company however wants to keep the production line for the current <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>alive until This basically means that at a production rate of airframes per year the company will need an additional orders on top of the orders to fill the gap So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>needs to sell over airframes To close the gap all the way until BA will need over orders per year Closing the gap until is doable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will need about orders per year to do so but to close the gap all the way until the company will need about orders per year I dont think the company will be able to do so I expect that BA will secure about orders per year and will cut rates after while simultaneously ramping up production for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X This should not hurt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as long as it ramps up X production while decreasing the production So although the rate cut reduces the needed order inflow a bit it remains challenging for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to secure enough orders The longterm outlook increased which bodes well for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X and the company So all in all I remain positive about investing in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The Cut Is Coming But The Gap Is Not Closed Yet Disclosure The author has no positions in
