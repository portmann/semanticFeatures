Rather than using trendy trading strategies and listening to headlines it is better to invest with numbers Simple research on the fundamentals reveal value Boeings strong business is a perfect example for research Note Unless otherwise noted data used are obtained from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaqcom With todays constant barrage of news headlines it is getting harder and harder to be objective about stocks Admittedly when you turn on CNBC and see GM sales plummet it scares the heck out of you Last year when for one week you read Marijuana stocks skyrocket everyone had a real urge to run out and buy up the next milliondollar idea Confession I am guilty of this one Had I actually done my homework and looked at the numbers I would have seen the marijuana play as merely speculation As an investor the only thing that matters is if theyre profitable You need a system for analyzing stocks Ironically enough people dont talk a lot about specific ways to grade equities They just throw analysts comments and ratings at you Not to say that analysts arent a very smart and and important part of the equation but everyone should know how to do their own homework When buying a company we need to look at the whole picture <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA recently announced earnings numbers Implementing pieces of a simple straightforward analysis strategy lets use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as an example Start with revenues If theyre not bringing in money thats a pretty big red flag up front I like at least quarters to get a good picture The June quarterly data have Boeings total revenue listed at Sigh so much money Looking at the last quarters you can see that revenue despite making gains through September and December has increased going into April but only slightly at about If you check out the year over year revenue growth above youll see that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has progressively improved revenue streams by over the last full years With positive revenues all around <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>passes Who doesnt love dividends <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a forward annual dividend of at a yield Its not the best but its not the worst Due to the lack of a full year for this EPS is off of the current March earnings Year over year we have a increase in earnings per share That is a starkly better figure than what happened from to Though return on equity increased over the last year showcasing an improvement in managements efficiency it is preferable to have at least demonstrable years of gains out of analysts including Barclays Capital Stifel Nicolaus Edward Jones and Wells Fargo rate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as a strong buy listed it as a hold Only rated it as a sell To add perspective to these analysts the company does seem to consistently beat their earnings estimates as can be seen in the following table Though no one is a psychic these overall increasing forecast estimates imply good feelings towards Boeings future performance Considering their huge involvement with the military this shouldnt come as a surprise Furthermore the year earnings growth forecast of anything over is fair game implies that analysts have a fairly good belief that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is going to deliver over the coming years The PEG ratio is like the PriceEarnings ratio but on steroids because it incorporates growth rates You find it by dividing your PE by the month growth rate of the stock The important thing to know is that if its less than youre golden Your stocks priceearnings is less than your growth rate You can cheat like I do and look it up here With a PEG ratio of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>hits a red flag I like this one quite a bit The chart below shows the number of shares traded by insiders in the company As you can see there has been quite a bit of selling Whats fun about analyzing insider trades is there could be a number of reasons for the selloff In certain situations it could mean things are going poorly and the employees know it or it could mean nothing It could be just a random event In this particular case I think its the fact that the stock is up over in the past months and people are taking profits Always err on the side of caution on this one If insiders are selling its not a good sign Last but not least is the share price appreciating How can we forget The only point in owning stock is to increase wealth right Ergo Our number concern is always is the stock going up or down In this case over the year period <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is up over Thats a pretty clear indicator of good times for shareholders Gross profit is up over the past years while net income is up Combine these kinds of numbers with the recent earnings beatthe stock has a very realistic chance of hitting the year target of To play devils advocate against myself I would like to see better cash flows from the company but with their earnings per share beats I can forgive it When making long term investments look at stocks by the numbers Day traders may get away with investing based on headlines but they also endure lots of risk Have criteria by which you gauge your stocks In Boeings case the increases in earnings per share are indicative of good things to me Furthermore the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>keeps beating its estimates says that many are underestimating this stock The company also has higher demand for its planes than it can provide for That is basically the greatest problem for any firm selling a product to have For these reasons <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is a great longterm buy Source The Smart Way To Analyze
