(NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Jun 29 2016, 15:38 ET | By: Stephen Alpher , SA News Editor Beginning this week, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) quietly began offering for sale whole-bean and ground coffee under its new Happy Belly label - putting it in competition with the likes of Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ).The WSJ one month ago reported Amazon as planning four brands of private-label foods, diapers, and cleaning supplies to be sold exclusively to Amazon Prime members.For the moment, Amazon is not necessarily positioning these items as the low-cost offering.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Bags of Happy Belly cost $ 9.99 each - about $ 2 <i>more</i> than Starbucks ' breakfast blend , but $ 3 <i>less</i> than Starbucks ' French roast .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In-house brands like these potentially carry <i>higher</i> profit margins , partly thanks to savings on brand development and marketing .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Amazon <b>may</b> also be able to design the packaging to reduce shipping costs .  (Uncertainty) </span>I wish this annoyance would give some clarity...Like start paying a dividend or something.I don't know whether to invest or not.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Right now it just looks like a gelatinous ponzi scheme financed on expensive shares and <b>hopium</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>And rockets.To be kind, the Washington Post is engaging, the service fairly easy to use.Prime video is sucking in regard to selection.Amazon won't be paying a dividend any time soon and the very happy shareholders like it that way.If you are looking for dividends, go elsewhere.That said, look at a long-term chart of Amazon.You would be happy with your investment from just about any time in the past.Of course, who knows what the future holds.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Amazon has been doing <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> of their own shipping .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They even leased 20 <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> 767s <i>earlier</i> this year with an option to buy part of the leasing company . (Boeing: Surprise) </span>Not saying that UPS isn't safe, but Amazon will squeeze costs anywhere it can, including from UPS and other shippers.Neat!I'm a big fan of private-label foodstuffs - my favorite grocery store was F&E (RIP :(), now my favorite grocery store is TJ's, both heavily invested in their own quality private-label foodstuffs.Also a big fan of Costco and their Kirkland brand stuff.So I'm looking forward to seeing what Amazon does with this.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sadly , I do n't care at all about coffee , though , nor do I have babies ( thank goodness ) , so <b>hopefully</b> they 'll come out with something I 'll actually want to buy soon .
