Look At Boeings Commercial Orders And Deliveries In September The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Despite the Chinese order for aircraft <span

#A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA has updated its orders and deliveries overview up to and including September In this article I will have a look at how the order inflow and deliveries affect Boeings target and performance Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>orders up until September Source AeroAnalysisnet In August <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>booked orders with orders for its singleaisle product and order for a widebody aircraft In September <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>booked just orders Given the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>announced a mega order of units from China it becomes evident that it takes time for an already announced order to end up in the order book For the Chinese order I expect that the orders will end up in the order book by the year end During September <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>booked orders for narrowbody aircraft and widebody aircraft valued at bn AeroAnalysis expects the market value to be closer to bn Jet finalized an order for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Next Generation aircraft with a catalogue value of bn An unidentified customer ordered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>airframes with a catalogue value of mln Despite Boeings order inflow being quite low in the last months I do expect the order inflow to increase in the coming months due to the orders placed by Chinese companies and carriers being finalized While the number of orders tells something about the attractiveness of the product a manufacturer offers and the longterm prospects for the manufacturer for shortterm investors deliveries are more interesting to look at Since most of the cash comes in after delivering an airframe it is important to meet the targeted number of deliveries in order to achieve the forecasted cash flow Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>deliveries up until September Source AeroAnalysis Boeings delivery of airframes exceeded expectations Deliveries were a mix of narrowbody aircraft and widebody aircraft The estimated market

family was slightly below expectation in the previous month the jet maker now exceeded the total number of expected deliveries in the last months This resulted in a strong delivery number that should show in Boeings cash flow During September <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>booked orders and delivered units resulting in a booktobill ratio of For the full year this ratio is excluding order cancellations Boeings fullyear target is to receive order for each delivery So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>still has to add some orders to the order book to achieve its desired booktobill ratio Order inflow in September was at the lowest point since January With deliveries in September the number of deliveries exceeded expectations <span
