Boeings main problem on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will be the availability of delivery slots Cancellations and deferrals so far have brought <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>orders which shows the popularity of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA received orders which set a new record for the plane maker Despite the record breaking order inflow the company also had to cope with some painful cancellations deferrals and production gaps One of the things that seemingly hurt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>the most is the deferral of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ERs which were to be delivered starting in The deferral yet has to be announced by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>but so far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>refuses to comment on a possible deferral Although it remains uncertain whether Air FranceKLM OTCPK OTCPKAFLYY OTC OTCAFRAF will defer the delivery of the airframes it puts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in an uncomfortable position as the aircraft manufacturer still needs orders to fill its production gap for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>line which has orders worth over two years of production whereas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aims to keep producing the classic <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>at least until A deferral of airframes means a gap of months On the other hand United Airlines NYSE UAL is looking for a capacity expansion and replacement for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The airline has the A and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>on order both of which could replace the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Delivery slots however are not available until If the delivery slots of Air FranceKLM go to United Airlines <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could already deliver the replacement in and If not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could deliver the airframe to United in United Airlines is seriously considering the purchase of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ERs which should completely offset the possible deferral of deliveries by Air FranceKLM For United Airlines the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER is a bargain since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is discounting the model and implementing performance upgrades as well The drawback of the purchase of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER is that United Airlines probably will cancel some of its orders for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Due to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>being a popular aircraft <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has no delivery slots available until This also can be seen in the order inflow during the last few years Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>annual orders Source DhierinPerkash Bechai The figure shows the accumulated orders orange bars on the secondary axis and the annual order inflow blue line on the primary axis It can be seen that during the last years order inflow has been marginal with the only exception being the year This is caused by the absence of early delivery slots In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>booked orders Air Berlin OTC AIBEF canceled the order for airframes amidst the challenging market and financial problems the airline is experiencing With the cancellation of the airframes Air Berlin now has completely eliminated its initial order for Dreamliners Transaero canceled four orders for the Dreamliner as the airline focuses on bigger aircraft but it is no secret that the Russian airline market is currently in a crisis while the Rouble has lost value This reduces the need for new aircraft and makes it hard for Russian carriers to finance new aircraft Lion Air was one of the carriers that was scheduled to take delivery of overweight airframes known as the Terrible Teens but eventually canceled the order Some of these airframes will now be delivered to Air Austral In March Air FranceKLM deferred the delivery of its first two <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>airframes It is unclear how long these deliveries have been pushed back but I do not expect the deferral to have a major impact on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>In a total of Dreamliner orders were canceled But with orders from Air Austral a yet unidentified customer and Air Tahit Nui these cancellation are almost completely offset So although there are cancellations there are always airlines in the row to take the delivery spots that are freed up With the deferral of Air FranceKLMs order for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER a similar thing might happen The unoccupied delivery slots might go to United Airlines which subsequently will cancel or defer some orders for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is already negotiating with Hainan Airlines which is planning to order <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s The changed occupation of delivery slots has been shown in Table So the table quite clearly shows that even the deferral of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ERs is not a bad one since United Airlines might occupy those delivery slots which will free up delivery slots for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Those delivery slots will be occupied by Hainan Airlines which will order a total of airframes So in the end <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is gaining orders because it can offer early delivery slots for some of the airframes All airlines involved seem to be benefiting from this Additional conclusions that can be drawn There are airlines lining up to take the delivery slots for every cancellation or deferral Most deferrals dont have anything to do with the airframe itself but with the exceptionally bad financial conditions some airlines are operating in Order inflow for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been lower due to an absence of early delivery slots Further hikes in production rate excluding the ones already announced should aid <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>gaining more orders Editors
