agency seeks to end rift on new aircraft emission rules Reuters Related Environment United Nations Aerospace Defense Global Energy News MONTREALWASHINGTON By Allison Lampert and Valerie Volcovici People are silhouetted past a logo of the Airbus Group during the Airbus annual news conference in Colomiers near Toulouse January MONTREALWASHINGTON Europe and the United States tried to bridge differences over emissions standards for aircraft on Sunday as global aviation leaders prepared to adopt new rules that could affect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co and Airbus Groups production of the largest jetliners and freighters Proposals being debated in Montreal by the International Civil Aviation Organization ICAO the United Nations aviation agency would force makers of the worlds largest passenger jets to upgrade or stop producing certain models as early as according to sources close to the negotiations and documents seen by Reuters US and European negotiators are trying to come up with the worlds first carbon dioxide emissions standards for aircraft as part of the industrys contribution to efforts to combat climate change Aviation was not included in the global climate deal agreed by a UN conference in Paris in December but ICAO is trying to nail down the first of its twopart strategy as soon as Monday after six years of talks It is due to finalize a marketbased mechanism for all airlines later this year Differences remain on where to place the bar on efficiency with the United States and Canada pushing for more stringent targets than the European Union while environmental groups have accused Europe of dragging its feet The CO standard will push industry to be as fuelefficient as possible in all market conditions to reduce GHG greenhouse gas emissions and the impact of aviation on climate change stated the Canadian paper presented at ICAO last week The proposals could revive pressure on European planemaker Airbus to upgrade the worlds largest passenger jet the A superjumbo with new engines Airbus recently examined that proposal to boost sales but it has dropped down its list of priorities It could also spell the end for Boeings struggling passenger jet and freighter and force the US planemaker to upgrade at least one of its two smaller freighters Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>declined to comment on negotiations The Montreal talks which run until Feb are designed to set ambitious rules for new types of aircraft in the future A less stringent standard would apply to aircraft already in production but this has led to the fiercest arguments since some of these planes would need to have costly improvements The fuel efficiency standards would apply to smaller business and regional jets along with larger commercial planes weighing at least tonnes that account for the majority of aviation sector emissions two sources familiar with the matter said The rules for inproduction aircraft would come into effectby but could also be phased in over a fiveyear period until one source said The tougher standard for new designs could go into effect by Participants have beenweighing differentoptions for new targetswith one being the weakest and requiring the greatest reduction in emissionsthe documents seen by Reuters showed European representatives have said they will not back a standard higher than on large planes in production The United States and Canada had initially backed options and but said they would not budge below a and at one stage did not rule out breaking off talks the sources said However on Sunday some progress was reported in narrowing differences Tougher standards have higher cost implications for planemakers While Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>have already planned more fuelefficient upgrades to most of their programs including the popular A and B some jets would have to be upgraded or

demand for older jets can be resilient Environmental groups said the standard will boost efficiency but it will only make a small dent on the industrys greenhouse gas emissions which are projected to triple or quadruple from current levels by They say the standard needs to be accompanied by a strong global marketbased approach Trump almost buys the farm and hears Rubios boot steps behind him
