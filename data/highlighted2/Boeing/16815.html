The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Really Going To Help Air FranceKLM Part The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should aid Air FranceKLM in achieving higher load factors At higher fuel prices the fuel savings offset the higher lease rate In Part of this article I compared the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER and concluded that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should be able to return higher profits to Air FranceKLM OTCPKAFLYY OTCAFRAF AirFranceKLM has been coping with disappointing results on its longhaul operations The order for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s and Airbus OTCPKEADSF As should aid the holding in booking stronger profits on its long haul operations that has seen profit declines over the last years I will again compare the airframes at load factor and average load factor Due to the fact that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has about the same capacity I will not take into account an adjusted occupancy rate as I did in Part A typical mission that normally is operated using an Airbus A has been outline below Flight from Amsterdam to Vancouver trip distance nm reserve fuel jet fuel price of per gallon No landing or takeoff fees have been taken into account Figure Efficiency changes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>versus Airbus A Source DhierinPerkash Bechai Figure shows that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is a leap forward The airframe seems to be slightly heavier while having a higher aerodynamic efficiency and higher propulsive efficiency The capacity remains more or less equal Replacement Airbus A by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>First of all it is worth to look at both aircraft with load factors all seats are occupied The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>generates higher revenue and has lower fuel costs resulting in a higher profit Figure shows a visualization of the per seat results The fuel consumption per seat is lower The fuel consumption per passengerkm is L for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and L for the Airbus A Figure Per seat figures for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Source DhierinPerkash Bechai Figure shows that the revenue per seat is higher Aided by lower fuel costs per seat the profit per seat rises Figure Per seat fuel efficiency for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus A Source DhierinPerkash Bechai The figure clearly shows that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a significant fuel advantage over the Airbus A One of the things that has to be noted is that the load factors are never Air FranceKLM has an average load factor of Therefore it is better to have a look at the airframes at a lower load factor Replacement <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>at load factor of The load factor of for both airframes shows that the revenue is higher combined with lower fuel burn this results in higher profit At a load factor of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has more revenue generating seats compared to the Airbus A Capacity and fuel costs are important factors that determine the profit but what should also be taken into account are the lease rates of the aircraft If savings on fuel costs are completely offset by the higher lease rates the rush to attract fuel efficient aircraft mitigates The lease rate for a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is about mln per month for the Airbus A this is about mln Per month the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is approximately more expensive to operate Per year leasing the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>instead of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER is almost mln more expensive Assuming that the route is operated times per week or flights including return flight by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s instead of Airbus As gives an advantage of mln for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Figure Per seat fuel efficiency for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Airbus A and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER Source DhierinPerkash Bechai The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is able to actively lower fuel costs resulting in a higher profit which completely offsets the higher lease rate for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is a suitable replacement for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER and Airbus A With fuel prices of per gallon the attractiveness of replacing the <span style='background-color:
