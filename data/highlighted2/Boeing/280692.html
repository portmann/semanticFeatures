Review Of And My Top Picks For Seeking Alpha Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL GM BA LYG DIS MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article MA activity could be a positive or negative sign was an interesting year for stocks The continuous interest rate debacle which I think we all got a bit Fed up of terrible pun I know was eventually resolved a few weeks ago when the Federal Reserve decided to raise interest rates for the first time in years A further interest rate hikes are expected this year moving rates from a month ago to near by the end of this year August of was the worst month for the markets in years with worries about Chinese growth and collapsing oil prices at the forefront of investors minds MA activity was at levels not seen since the recession either suggesting stocks are still cheap and worth paying a premium for or that some companies are struggling for growth and are seeking to use acquisitions as a way of cutting costs and therefore grow EPS Of course management could be taking advantage of the lower interest rate environment to make acquisitions before rates inevitably increase More than likely its a combination of all but either way I think its a bullish sign for the market These deals would not be happening if management had a negative outlook on global economic growth even if it could mean that growth is expected to remain low for the foreseeable future Lower oil prices and a stronger dollar also weighed on the market Oil companies are cutting forecasts and dividends could be at risk if the fall continues with the resulting fall in energy stocks bringing the market down with it The US Dollar index rose in which had an adverse effect on all companies that sell abroad as well as making imported goods cheaper increasing the competitiveness of foreign rivals HarleyDavidson NYSE HOG is a good example of a firm that has suffered in the past months because of this With all of the above in mind its no surprise that the markets were almost flat for with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the SP NYSEARCA SPY both down approximately for the year Having said that US GDP was for the year and according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment fell from in January to in November I remain bullish on the economy in the long run but we have to be aware of the inevitable bumps in the road With interest rates on the rise its worth looking at the banks as they benefit from a rise in their Net Interest Margin I wrote about Lloyds Banking Group NYSE LYG a few months ago highlighting how the bank will benefit from the latest round of costcutting higher interest rates and becoming fully privatized later this year I remain bullish on the bank and given the recent fall under for the ADS shares I plan to add to my position sooner rather than later Once fully private the bank will be able to substantially increase its dividend without returning dangerous levels of capital to shareholders and increased EPS should send the stock much higher over the next few years Also PPI Payment Protection Insurance claims are coming to an end and legislation may mean claims made after this year are void which will remove a parasite that has been living off the banks bottom line for a number of years now The Walt Disney Company NYSE DIS has been widely debated over the last few months with The Force Awakens as the main catalyst for the increased coverage here on Seeking Alpha However Disney is so much more than the Star Wars franchise Nearly half of Disneys revenue comes from ESPN which as we know has been struggling as of late A small fall in subscribers is expected this year which has worried investors especially as Disney trades at a premium when compared to the SP There is one major advantage to Disney though ESPN has exclusive rights to many of the countrys favorite live sport which many loyal customers will continue to pay for because sport is best enjoyed live I mean who wants to watch major sporting events on a catch up service Disney has other major franchises that continue to make money every year Frozen and Mickey Mouse to name of many With the recent fall to Disney is cheap enough to start accumulating a long term position in The modest dividend is nothing to write home about but the share buyback program will provide some stability on the down days and help increase EPS over time Next on my shopping list is Apple NASDAQ AAPL The stock has trended lower since the new range of iPhones were announced with worries of China and a strong dollar on investors minds But the fundamentals remain the same the buyback is stronger than ever and the recent pullback means the stock is now yielding Apple is now cheap enough to be considered a value stock which for a company with a growing dividend a huge share buyback program a mountain of cash and exciting new ventures like selfdriving cars means Apple is somewhat of a bargain at current levels General Motors NYSE GM has been looking for a break from the seemingly endless recall saga for what seems like an eternity now but is looking positive for the Detroitbased Automaker Cases are slowly closing and new recalls are smaller and less severe than the ignition switch recalls of the past GM is trading at less than x earnings and is yielding a massive at the time of writing making this stock one of the most attractive in the SP There has been caution about higher interest rates putting customers off buying cars on finance which may be true but higher rates will actually help GM fund its hugely underfunded pension pot Sales are on the rise view my article on GM for the breakdown here but more importantly there is a shift from the lower margin fleet sales to more profitable dealers This plus the long term plan of increasing efficiency by drastically reducing the number of platforms down to just needed to produce of the current GM range will further increase margins in the future Finally I will add to my position in The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSE BA if we see prices below share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a near halftrillion dollar backlog a range of new aircraft like the and its customers the airlines have been making more money than usual lately given the slide in the price of oil At or below the stock is reasonably priced pays a solid dividend and can be relied upon for long term returns especially as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has enough orders to operate at full capacity for years without receiving a single order All five of these stocks are ripe for picking but of course we must proceed with caution I am holding more cash than usual because the market has been volatile in and if the opening day is anything to go by more of the same is to be expected Having said that investors with cash at times of panic will relish the down days because every selloff over the last few years has turned out to be an excellent buying opportunity for those with a long term horizon </div></body></html>
