class='textDiv'>Competition May Limit Boeings Double Digit Dividend Increases Going Forward The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Chinese stateowned enterprise COMAC is kicking butt and taking orders and may prove to be a thorn in Boeings side in the near future The threat of substitute modes of transportation is pretty much minimal and the dollar should act as a tailwind now after the rate hike we received today Earlier this week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA announced a shareholder capital return plan in the form of an increased dividend and a share buyback program The company whose stock price has appreciated on the year decided to increase the dividend by to per share on a quarterly basis and the board authorized a share buyback program of billion Per the buyback program which was announced last year for billion there is approximately billion leftover This money will be rolled over into the new program which is anticipated to start in January As for the dividend this is the fifth year in a row that the company has actually increased the dividend putting it in the famous US Dividend Champions list that David Fish publishes monthly Now what does all this mean for shareholders Dividend increases and buybacks shouldnt just be accepted blindly an investor still needs to observe all the fundamentals financials and market place of which the company is operating to determine if it is a great move or not Not all dividend increases and share buybacks are created equal Theres been quite a few times in the past that companies have increased the dividend only cut them shortly thereafter Boeings business environment is typically thought of as a commercial airline manufacturer and rightly so as nearly of its revenues come from commercial operations Id like to see the company diversify its risk a bit by expanding further into the defense sector somehow and lowering that number attributable to the commercial space Because as it stands now the projected of dividends the company is going to be paying next year is amounting to be a dividend payout ratio based on trailing earnings The payout ratio isnt too bad yet but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>operates in a very capital intensive environment Which brings us to the competitive landscape the company is a member of Since nearly three quarters of its revenue is brought in by the commercial space it behooves an investor to survey the landscape The commercial sector is indeed dominated by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus with Embraer and Bombardier making some of the smaller planes This is enough competition at the present time but there stands to be a new entrant to the market in the form of Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China COMAC for short The problem with this new potential entrant is that it is a stateowned enterprise SOE COMAC introduces a kink to Boeings business strategy at this point in time because it is an SOE COMAC has the complete backing of the entire Chinese government if it is going to try to win contracts away from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>This can be translated to fierce pricing competition This is definitely a situation that investors have to take note of as revenues are going to come under pressure if COMAC does indeed become a thorn in Boeings side Thankfully the aircraft business has extremely high barriers to entry so not too many entrants can make it in unless they are potentially an SOE To counteract any potential decrease in revenues <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is going to have to squeeze its suppliers going forward and they already have The company has been doing this over the past couple of years first by squeezing out its distributors and taking on inventory itself Check out the Inventories line item in the balance sheet below how it has nearly doubled from to By executing this strategy the company is capable of cutting out their distributors and go directly to the suppliers getting better rates by cutting out the middleman fees associated with distributors Inventories have gone from of shortterm assets to nearly in a four year period The company is going to have to continue to do this to maintain margins if revenues ever do come under pressure from the commercial sector After competitors one has to evaluate the substitutes for air travel to see if there are any threats to the business model Currently in the US there is no other way to travel long distances as quickly as possible other than plane There is currently a project underway to build a high speed train in California but that is too far out from being completed and even then it will be very costly for travelers High speed rails do exist in other countries but that threat has been existent for quite some time and hasnt posed any problems for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>To travel across the oceans there is no other way to travel than by plane if a traveler wants to get to their destination in a short amount of time Now let us evaluate the financial implications of The Fed rate hike today and how it should impact the company The theme of every earnings season over the past year from every publicly traded company that does business overseas is that the strong dollar has hurt them The consequence of a rate hike will hopefully lead to a weakening of the dollar against other currencies This should bode well for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as it derives quite a bit of its revenues from overseas and should lead to capital appreciation going forward After performing this industry and environmental analysis on the company Im not too concerned about the threat of substitute modes of transportation and a decreasing dollar will be a tailwind However I am concerned that there is a strong threat from an additional competitor coming online in the near future in the form of the SOE COMAC <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can only do so much to help margins for now by squeezing their competitors and I believe the key for the company is to begin diversifying its business model by increasing revenues from the defense side of the business The easiest way to do that is to make an acquisition but the company has to find a company which serves as a compliment where both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and a potential acquired company work together symbiotically I actually initiated my position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in late November but am not anywhere near a full position I never look to initiate a full position in a name immediately and will not until it gets to below at least I never like to dive full bore into a name I always buy in increments To boot Ill be getting paid a dividend yield to wait I swapped out of General Electric NYSE GE for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>during the portfolio changeout in late November because I had a huge gain in GE and felt that it might lag the rest of the market for the coming three months So hopefully I got out near the top in GE and hopefully <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>beats it for the coming quarter For now here is a chart to compare how GE and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>have done against each other and the SP since I swapped the names Though the chart shows a loss in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I am actually up on the name because I bought it towards the middle of the day on November Disclaimer This article is in no
