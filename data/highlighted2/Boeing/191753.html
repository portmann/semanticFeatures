Havent Fallen Out Of Love With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Future earnings projections are more reliable than most given a billion backlog stretching well in to the next decade With the recent pullback the stock is now reasonably priced This year I have been desperate to add to my position in The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSE BA but the stock has been expensive up nearly since and then climbing to in early However with the recent pullback to the stock is now trading at x earnings a much more appealing valuation for the long term investor There are a number of factors setting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>on a course to reach new heights in the not too distant future I have already mentioned the billion backlog consisting of nearly commercial aircraft source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Qreport meaning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could operate at full capacity for years without receiving a single order Lower oil prices over the last years have been increasing airline profits fuel costs generally make up approximately of an airlines total cost allowing these airlines to upgrade and expand their fleet A fastgrowing Chinese middle class is increasing demand for international travel which I explain in more detail later in the article Profit margins are increasing as commercial deliveries continue to set new records which when coupled with an increase in revenue is a recipe for much higher earnings billion remains of the buyback allocation which is due to be completed approximately over the next years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is in a strong financial position As of the end of Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had billion in cash and cash equivalents and billion in debt Revenue was billion up an impressive compared to the same period last year thanks to increased commercial deliveries Operating cash flow was billion compared to just billion in Q Once again this was helped by increased commercial deliveries and higher productivity Lower EPS guidance was due to a oneoff million aftertax charge on the KC program In addition million shares were repurchased in Q totaling billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will fall short of a bill to book ratio in ratio of new orders to deliveries A strong dollar weaker global demand uncertainty in the US and a Chinese slowdown are likely to blame Commercial deliveries totaled for the quarter higher than the deliveries in the same period last year The book to bill ratio is falling simply because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is delivering aircraft quicker than airlines are ordering them billion worth of aircraft were ordered in the second quarter suggesting a small fall in the value of the order book is not due to a lack of demand for Boeings airplanes The backlog for the is a very impressive years and this is lagging compared to the and By the end of the decade <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will produce MAX aircraft per month the fastest commercial jet production rate in history There have been a number issues regarding a shortage of components but will be resolved as suppliers increase production to coincide with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and is therefore unlikely to have an adverse effect on long term profitability As for the long term <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>predicts million new passengers will enter the Asian market every year for the foreseeable future contributing to the growth of the jet fleet from aircraft in to in Between now and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>predicts the worldwide market for airplanes will grow from in to in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>predicts new Airplanes will be delivered in the year period accounting for the growth in the market and replacement of existing aircraft totaling billion The program will see another rise in deferred production costs this quarter and then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>say the number will start to fall The deferred production costs balance totals billion which will slowly be returned to shareholders as the average unit cost of each airplane will decline throughout the airplane program There is of course some downside risk with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>A Chinese slowdown will likely lengthen the timescale for achieving the target Although The Chinese National Bureau of Statistics claim GDP growth was achieved in many analysts think Chinas actual GDP is closer to far below the doubledigit growth theyve enjoyed over the last decades But isnt this part of the usual economic cycle No economy has been able to sustain high growth for an extended period of time without some kind of slowdown or recession to follow Chinas middle class is still expanding and these are the new customers that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will profit from over the coming decades Lets not forget Buffetts billion purchase of Precision Castparts NYSE PCP a long term bet on aerospace which he paid a very unBuffett like x earnings for Given that PCP is predominantly a supplier to airplane makers of revenue is from aerospace the acquisition shows Buffetts confidence in the industry And Boeings stock is attractive all by itself at x next years earnings and a near dividend yield I think the recent pullback is a great opportunity to add <span
