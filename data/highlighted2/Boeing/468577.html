Golden Scenario Might Be Unfolding For The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Refined model and order mix reflective of reality lead to higher profits At this point I think a profit margin for the remaining deliveries is realistic Prior to reporting its Q earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA has announced it will be recognizing almost B in charges Almost million of the B aftertax charge is related to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program where the company will be reclassifying unsellable aircraft from inventory to RD expenses I will await the earnings report to see whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will actually lower their accumulated deferred costs Prior to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>announcing the writeoff of the airframes I penned an article on Boeings ability or better said Boeings inability to recoup the accumulated deferred costs within the current accounting quantity of units A reader however pointed out that the assumed order mix is not reflective of reality In this article I will present the results of the reworked model to accommodate for different profit margins and implementing a more realistic delivery schedule The method behind the calculations remains the same The accounting quantity can be sliced in almost equal subblocks The first block has been used by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to accumulate the deferred costs the second block will be used to ramp up profits and the third block will see full profit production For the first units I initially assumed an average sales price of million After analyzing the delivery schedule this has been increased to million For the units that follow after that the average sales price has increased to linear part of million and a second linear part of million up from million Figure Development deferred costs using various profit margins Source Figure shows the development of deferred costs using various profit margins What can be seen is that you can make things as good or bad looking as you want Using a profit margin of it can be seen that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will have B left in deferred costs after the th delivery for a margin this will be B and B for a profit margin of Ron Epstein analyst for Bank of America thinks that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will not be able to make more than mln per airframe on the remaining deliveries The AeroAnalysis model shows that this coincides with a profit margin of roughly which is probably not the profit margin that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has hoped for and one can also question whether this really is a realistic estimate given that end of life pricing of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>gives margins of There is one scenario which I dubbed the Golden scenario This scenario follows the high profit margin that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program once was A <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>sold for close to million not too long ago with production costs close to million This is equivalent to a profit margin of If we feed this into the model and let it do the math for us things start to make a bit more sense Figure Development deferred costs using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>profit margin Source What can be seen is that when using the profit margin of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>the math finally seems to add up I also think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is aiming to achieve margins closer to than to the analysts are expecting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is still a long way from being anywhere close to the required profit margin but with a lot of deliveries left in the accounting quantity and some leverages that can be utilized I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is actually aiming for the Dreamliner to follow the path of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>A highly profitable cash cow While some readers will be skeptical about this outcome it needs to be pointed out that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>of which over have been ordered was not Boeings cash cow from the start The aircraft found its sweet spot in the market while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>simultaneously increased profitability on the airframe A similar thing is likely to happen with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Whether the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will fully recoup the deferred costs within the accounting block is a question that nobody can answer with certainty today What is certain is that the deferred costs of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>where much lower than on the Dreamliner program This however does not mean that the Dreamliner cannot grow into the role the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has fulfilled for years in terms of profits and cash At this point I think the scenario where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>increases the accounting quantity is the most realistic one Additionally charges that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>might need to take are no more than B if it does not increase the quantity In the end ramping up profitability on the Dreamliner program remains a challenge and I am curious to see whether the charge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has taken will actually lower the deferred costs at all If you would like to receive updates
