The largest number of aircraft in the backlog is the 737 model, which is Spirit's largest program at ~4,200 orders across all 737 models.This amount of order backlog represents over 7 years of revenue giving the company a large amount of visibility into revenue generation.We also think the reauthorization of the Export-Import bank , which provides subsidized guarantees for foreign purchases of domestically produced aircraft, is not likely to have much effect on the company.For one, the five member board still only has two confirmed members, and thus lacks the quorum necessary to conduct business.We do not think it matters though as most Export-Import guarantees required over the next two years had been authorized already before the previous charter expired.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even if the affected countries ( oil-producers , Russia , China , Brazil ) seeing the potential for marked slowdown in their economies were to cancel all of their orders , research indicates that there would still be at least 5 years of backlog .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And the <b>likelihood</b> of these countries canceling all of their orders is miniscule , in our opinion .  (Uncertainty) </span>Thus, we think macro concerns are likely overblown given the strong amount of orders for new passenger jets.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We think the valuation is currently depressed by the <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> negotiations and the macro <b>risks</b> . (Boeing: Uncertainty) </span>But we think the amount of strength in the OEM production and global air passenger industry is not likely to slow despite any substantial slowdown in their economies.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Much of the oil-related macro slowdowns is likely to be <i>more</i> than offset by the benefit to the airlines , with <i>lower</i> oil costs reducing fares and promoting demand and increased capex spend for new planes .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We think the shares are worth <b>approximately</b> $ 65 based on the following growth drivers and operating metrics .  (Uncertainty) </span>First, while 2016 revenues are likely to be relatively flat, fuselage and propulsion systems growth should be strong, offset by a decline in wing systems.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Operating margins should see some upside from their cost savings of <b>approximately</b> $ 100 million during the year , driving the margins up by 20-30 bps .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company should earn $4.15 this year and $4.60 in fiscal 2017.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The current multiple is <b>approximately</b> 13x but we think that will get re-rated <i>higher</i> when a new contract comes out , simply due to the industry strength and very clear visibility in their revenue stream .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>At 15x those earnings, we have an intrinsic value of $62.25 and a one-year price target of $69, which we averaged to our current warranted value of $65, or upside of 38%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Spirit Aerosystems continues to be held back by the <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> contract <b>uncertainties</b> . (Boeing: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Despite this , we think Spirit is in a strong negotiating position , <i>stronger</i> than the market currently applies to the shares .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We <b>believe</b> that the shares will pop once a deal or at least a small piece of a <i>larger</i> deal is announced .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the interim , we think the <i>lower</i> cost infrastructure is starting to materialize and an eventual deal with both <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> and subsequently Airbus will be a key source of upside in free cash flow generation . (Boeing: Surprise) </span>We are bullish on the potential for additional cost savings on procurement and supply chain improvements driving free cash flow and the valuation, once the overhangs are removed.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Industrial Goods</div></body></html>
