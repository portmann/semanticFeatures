users to express a range of emotions from anger to love were added to the original thumbsup option They came in response to calls for a Dislike button However the new expressions are another big like for Facebook and a dislike for its users according to Belgian police who claim the site is using them as a way to collect information on people to target advertising toward them In a statement released on their official website on Wednesday the Belgian force warned people to avoid using the series of emoticons if they want to preserve their privacy The statement on the police website reads The icons help not only express your feelings they also help Facebook assess the effectiveness of the ads on your profile It adds One more reason not to click if you want to protect your privacy The statement warns that users are simply a product to Facebook claiming their reactions to posts are helping the social networking giant build up a profile of them As a result of the profiling the site will target ads it thinks users will be more receptive to based on how they are reacting to specific posts at the time By limiting the number of icons to six Facebook is counting on you to express your thoughts more easily so that the algorithms that run in the background are more effective the police said By mouse clicks you can let them know what makes you happy In short the moment Facebook

After an investigation followed by a test phase carried out in Ireland and Spain you saw appear in late February six new small icons If we had to describe them we could say that we now have a symbol to say I love another to express his joy a third say to his surprise and others to share his amusement his sadness or even anger In fact as you know for Facebook we are also a product The reactions that we express it possible to know us better and so as stated in the social network to offer us the best possible experience in terms of our profile that is more accurate But Facebook is also a marketing champion It now has a medium which allows it to measure our reactions to the publications of our friends or pages that we follow And now in addition to allowing you to express your feelings those little icons will also help verify the effectiveness of advertisements that are present on your profile Limiting them to six Facebook account the fact that you express your thoughts more easily allowing the algorithms running in the background to target you With your clicks it will be possible to determine those contents that put you in a good mood So that will help Facebook find the perfect location on your profile allowing it to display content that will arouse your curiosity but also to choose the time you present it If it appears that you are in a good mood phase so it can deduce that you are more receptive and able to sell spaces explaining advertisers that they will have more chance to see you react In conclusion it will be one more reason not to click too fast if you want to
