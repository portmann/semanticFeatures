operate B converted freighters a CMI contract for years Atlas Air Worldwide will also drylease the airplanes for years under its Titan Aviation leasing unit Zacks has set a new price target for the stock at per share which offers upside potential to secondary investors Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings NASDAQ AAWW is basically a holding company which owns its operating subsidiaries Atlas Air Inc and Titan Aviation Holdings Inc and has a minority stake in a few other companies It provides outsourced aviation operating services to the global aircraft markets Currently Atlas Air Worldwide runs a

aircraft crew maintenance and insurance services to customers Under Charter segment the company offers customers air cargo and passenger aircraft for moving goods and people from point A to B Lastly the company operates its Dry Leasing business via Titan Holdings Inc which is a freightercentric leasing company with one of the worlds largest fleets of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>freighters As of May Atlas Air Worldwide had a market capitalization of around billion and its latest quarterly revenue Q was at million On May Atlas Air Worldwide released its Q financial results which showed a Net Income of million or per share As soon as Atlas Air Worldwide made the press release its stock price jumped from at the close of May and reached as high as on May representing a increase within a day However year to date it is only up based on the current market price of per share This large upside move happened despite the fact that the companys revenue has fallen to million in Q which is lower compared with that in the same quarter last year However there were two factors that influenced the market the earnings adjusted for nonrecurring costs were per share which beat Zacks Investment Researchs forecast of per share and the deal with Amazon NASDAQ AMZN to provide and to operate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>converted freighters that will have a meaningful impact on Atlas Air Worldwides revenues in the coming years While betterthanexpected adjusted earnings pushed the stock price up by almost we believe the Amazon deal will turn out to be more significant for the company as such a longterm relationship with one of the largest ecommerce giants will create a recurring revenue opportunity Commenting on the deal with Amazon William J Flynn president and chief executive officer of Atlas Air Worldwide said the continuing expansion of Amazons ecommerce business and to enhance its customerdelivery capabilities are expected to be meaningfully accretive to our future earnings and cash flows We expect this service to begin in the second half of this year become accretive starting in and scale up to full service and full accretive benefits through he noted Mr Flynn also mentioned that the immediately accretive Southern Air acquisition has been completed Our acquisition of Southern Air with its highly complementary and aircraft operating platforms will provide a broader array of services for customers and new avenues of business growth for us he said The agreement with Amazon and the successful acquisition of Southern Air will help Atlas Air Worldwide offer some great upside potential for its secondary investors in the coming quarters Why The Amazon Deal Is Kind of a Big Deal On May the company released a second press release detailing the Amazon deal which mentioned that the longterm commercial agreements with Amazon will include the operation of B converted freighters for Amazon on a CMI crew maintenance and insurance basis by Atlas Air Worldwides airline subsidiary Atlas Air Inc as well as dry leasing by its Titan Aviation leasing unit While the dry leases will have a term of years the CMI operations will be for seven years with extension provisions for a total term of years Under the agreement the operations are expected to begin in the second half of and ramp up to full service through In order to align their interests the company also offered Amazon an opportunity to buy common stocks of Atlas Air Worldwide at per share where Amazon has the privilege for the next five years In addition Atlas Air Worldwide granted Amazon warrants to acquire up to an additional percent after the issuance of AAWWs common shares at the same exercise price over a period of seven years With this deal with Atlas Air Worldwide Amazon is practically cutting out the middleman Instead of relying on FedEx NYSE FDX United Parcel Service NYSE UPS et al which also lease cargo aircraft from companies like Atlas Air Worldwide if Amazon start leasing directly it will be able to cut down the cost of logistics Meanwhile having stake in the company will also ensure that Atlas Air Worldwide will always have Amazons strategic interest in mind while making future operational deals with direct or indirect competitors of Amazon While the deal is great for Atlas Air Worldwide it is even a better deal for Amazon especially after the company adopted a more aggressive policy to handle logistics itself Winning a contract to lease cargo planes to Amazon is a big deal but this revenue will not be visible on the companys balance sheet immediately However since Amazon has the right to buy up to common stocks of Atlas Air Worldwide at it will immediately create a technical support level for the stock price Furthermore the seven to tenyear deal will create a certain recurring revenue opportunity that is bound to have a meaningful impact on the top line Now the question would be how the management will turn this stable operating environment for the next decade to develop the company In coming quarters investors will be keen to see how Atlas Air Worldwide management plans to expand its business and what the key financial metrics are saying about that effort Meanwhile Zacks has updated its price target for Atlas Air Worldwide to per share on May which still offers a upside potential for secondary investors in the short term In the long term we believe the valuation will go much higher and longterm investors should consider increasing their exposure at the current price
