(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Commenting on the deal with Amazon, William J. Flynn, president and chief executive officer of Atlas Air Worldwide, said, "the continuing expansion of Amazon's e-commerce business and to enhance its customer-delivery capabilities, are expected to be meaningfully accretive to our future earnings and cash flows.""We expect this service to begin in the second half of this year, become accretive starting in 2017, and scale up to full service and full accretive benefits through 2018," he noted.Mr. Flynn also mentioned that the immediately accretive Southern Air acquisition has been completed.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>`` Our acquisition of Southern Air with its highly complementary 777 and 737 aircraft operating platforms will provide a <i>broader</i> array of services for customers and new avenues of business growth for us , '' he said .  (Surprise) </span>The agreement with Amazon and the successful acquisition of Southern Air will help Atlas Air Worldwide offer some great upside potential for its secondary investors in the coming quarters.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Why The Amazon Deal Is Kind of a Big Deal On <b>May</b> 5 , the company released a second press release detailing the Amazon deal , which mentioned that the long-term commercial agreements with Amazon will include `` the operation of 20 B767-300 converted freighters for Amazon on a CMI ( crew , maintenance and insurance ) basis by Atlas Air Worldwide 's airline subsidiary , Atlas Air , Inc. , as well as dry leasing by its Titan Aviation leasing unit . ''  (Uncertainty) </span>While the dry leases will have a term of 10 years, the CMI operations will be for seven years (with extension provisions for a total term of 10 years).Under the agreement, the operations are expected to begin in the second half of 2016 and ramp up to full service through 2018.In order to align their interests, the company also offered Amazon an opportunity to buy 20% common stocks of Atlas Air Worldwide at $37.50 per share, where Amazon has the privilege for the next five years.In addition, Atlas Air Worldwide "granted Amazon warrants to acquire up to an additional 10 percent (after the issuance) of AAWW's common shares at the same exercise price, over a period of seven years."With this deal with Atlas Air Worldwide, Amazon is practically cutting out the middleman.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Instead of relying on FedEx ( NYSE : FDX ) , United Parcel Service ( NYSE : UPS ) , et al , which also lease cargo aircraft from companies like Atlas Air Worldwide , if Amazon start leasing directly , it will be able to cut down the cost of logistics .  (Uncertainty) </span>Meanwhile, having 20-30% stake in the company will also ensure that Atlas Air Worldwide will always have Amazon's strategic interest in mind while making future operational deals with direct or indirect competitors of Amazon.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While the deal is great for Atlas Air Worldwide , it is even a <i>better</i> deal for Amazon , especially after the company adopted a <i>more</i> aggressive policy to handle logistics itself .  (Surprise) </span>Winning a contract to lease 20 cargo planes to Amazon is a big deal, but this revenue will not be visible on the company's balance sheet immediately.However, since Amazon has the right to buy up to 20% common stocks of Atlas Air Worldwide at $37.50, it will immediately create a technical support level for the stock price.Furthermore, the seven- to ten-year deal will create a certain recurring revenue opportunity that is bound to have a meaningful impact on the top line.Now, the question would be how the management will turn this stable operating environment for the next decade to develop the company.In coming quarters, investors will be keen to see how Atlas Air Worldwide management plans to expand its business and what the key financial metrics are saying about that effort.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Meanwhile , Zacks has updated its price target for Atlas Air Worldwide to $ 52.90 per share on <b>May</b> 5 , which still offers a 13.06 % upside potential for secondary investors in the short term .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In the long term , we believe the valuation will go much <i>higher</i> , and long-term investors should consider increasing their <b>exposure</b> at the current price level .
