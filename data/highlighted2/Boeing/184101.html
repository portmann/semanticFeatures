Alpha Chinese order will be a mix of and Addition to the order book will be less than the announced orders On his visit to the United States Chinese President Xi brought <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA an order for airframes In this article I will have a look at what is currently known about the order and explain why I am not particularly impressed with the order Figure Infographic Order China Source AeroAnalysisnet Rumors of a big order during Xis visit to the US already arose months before the visit but over the last few days more and more information became available <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>received orders valued at bn according to the jet maker or of the ordered airframes are orders for narrow body airframes while the remaining orders are for Boeings wide body products No further details have been disclosed yet but it can be assumed that the narrow body order will be a mix of current generation airframes and Boeings upcoming MAX airframe The order probably will also consist of the discounted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>So far Chinese airlines ordered airframes and of the new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Discounts for the current <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>probably are as high as while discounts for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>are close to Given the popularity of the among Chinese carriers and the discounts on the airframe it can be expected that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will be part of the order mix So far Chinese airlines ordered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>airframes Given the expected growth on the Chinese aircraft market order inflow for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is most certain Despite the size and value of the order the order itself might be a bit of a disappointment The main reason for that is that the order will not add as much to the backlog as is believed by many Currently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has unfilled orders the addition of airframes would imply a addition to the backlog However it has to be noted that some orders were already listed in Boeings order book as Unidentified Customers This is common practice among jet makers but does skew the image of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>receiving orders Currently unidentified customers ordered s s and s This means that some of those orders were already in Boeings order book it yet remains to be seen how big that portion is What is certain is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will be adding less than orders to its order book Although the order is quite big for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>this is not the order that will add a big chuck of market share In June Airbus OTCPK EADSF received a Chinese commitment for the purchase of As and on the South East Asian market Airbus Aneo is still leading with a market share Looking at the orders for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus it can be concluded that the order is nothing more but the duopoly being utilized by Chinese customers where both jet makers will have an about equal share on the market What can be concluded is that despite the order being announced as an order for jets valued at bn the addition to the order book will be considerably less On the other hand there are still a lot more orders to be won on the Chinese market in the coming years meaning that the long term picture still looks bright for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Combining that with the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares dipped on concerns about cash flow and a lower full year guidance I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares are valued nicely for longterm investors to buy Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not
