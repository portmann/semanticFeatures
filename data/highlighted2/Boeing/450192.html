style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X will as expected compete with the A on the lower end of the seat market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X will be the final nail in the coffin of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I Sources state <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA has been proposing a possible <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X jet to their customers In this article I will have a look at how this will affect the competitive playing field and how this places the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X in the market Just like the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X family the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X is a push towards bigger aircraft but not too big The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X jet would turn the member <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X family into a member family which could potentially make all members of the X family more attractive for airlines Table Seating and range for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X would have seats rows more than the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>which has seats more than the The range of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X is still unknown and probably one of the main subjects of discussions with airlines The range requirement is one of the most important factors that could determine the success of the airplane Assuming that the propulsion system and the wing planform stay the same an educated guess for the range is nm nm AeroAnalysis expects that customers will require the airframe to have a range of nm hence more fuel tanks bigger engines or a bigger planform might be required On paper the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X does not have any competitors The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X is seen by many as a direct competitive threat to the Airbus OTCPKEADSF A The Airbus A can seat up to passengers with a range capability of nm Those are the pretty figures on paper However there are a lot of Airbus As flying around with less than seats The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X could effectively compete with the Airbus A and even beat the airframe in terms of cost efficiency What needs to be said is that the Airbus A will be superior in the seat market but this market is a small one and likely unprofitable for any player that wants to be active in this niche Also for airlines the seat segment is a risky one The Airbus A has high capital costs and has shown to be hard to fill making it very cost inefficient to operate On the other hand the Airbus A offers a standard of luxury that even a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X cannot offer So the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X will target the lower bracket of the Airbus A market which cannot be operated with profits Although the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X can compete with the Airbus A I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will provide the ultimate blow to their very own <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I when they launch the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can be operated in class configuration with approximately seats while the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I has more revenue generating seats The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X would have around seats in class configuration thirteen more than the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I This means that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I will be squeezed by the and the X I think one of the most important conclusions that can be drawn is that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X would serve purposes Compete with Airbus A on the lower end of the seat market Replace the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I With the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>already has a replacement for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I but it could be lacking some space to put some luxury in place With the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can either offer that extra space to add luxury and comfort or offer higher revenue potential by adding additional seats An important thing to note is that the seat delta difference in number of seats between a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X and Airbus A in class configuration is substantial There are only a few airlines that operate the Airbus A with approximately seats Over the past few days I have read and heard many people stating that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X is a hypothetical aircraft for an unsuccessful market segment I think the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X does make sense in some way but will not be able to beat the Airbus A in terms of luxury The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X would be geared towards the requirements set by the Gulf carriers carriers that currently are operating the Airbus A even on the unsuccessful routes The reason for the market segment being unsuccessful is because the Airbus A in fact is too big to operate with less than seats So far airlines have been serving this segment with an oversized airplane The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X seems to be a better fit for the job and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>already knows who will be buying it It will take a while before the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X will be launched but what bodes well is that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X is a development that is supported by customer feedback whereas the Airbus A was a prestige project that did and still does not center on customer feedback In the end the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X could be the nail in the coffin of superjumbos in general not only the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I or Airbus A Airbus at this point does not have a suitable answer which gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>an advantage If you
