missed opportunities The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSE BA is a stock that I find myself constantly reflecting on and saying why didnt I buy it THIS time On every meaningful pullback I consider a position but never get in Make no mistake this aerospace and defense bellwether has created serious wealth for investors It has provided capital appreciation and dividend growth And I find myself once again in a situation that is all too familiar I didnt buy when the stock was under and this month the stock has started to come back on On top of that once again the company delivered a strong quarter I would like to discuss the results and more importantly the outlook for this company Is the stock still a buy even though its points above where I last wanted to get in Taken another way how many times have I asked this question on the way up from from from To answer the question we need to review the companys performance but also discuss where the company is heading First off the third quarter was a blowout The numbers crushed estimates The company reported revenue increased to billion on record commercial deliveries Core earnings per share for the quarter increased to as a result of massive success in most all segments of the company The revenues beat estimates by over billion and earnings beat by Wow Lets take a look at some of the sector highlights to get a feel for the outperformance The Commercial Airplanes segment saw thirdquarter revenue increase to billion on higher delivery volume and mix while operating margins were a strong Looking ahead for this segment the company began final assembly and achieved poweron of the first MAX airplane during Q In total the program has won nearly firm orders for the MAX since launch It is important to note that the companys X program is on schedule for first delivery in Commercial Airplanes booked net orders during the quarter Backlog remains strong with nearly airplanes valued at billion In the companys Defense Space Security segment revenue was a strong billion with an operating margin of But why Well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Military Aircraft performed exceptionally with thirdquarter revenue increasing to billion primarily as a result of F contract negotiations The company saw some strong contracts in the quarter as well The Network Space Systems division saw revenue of billion and its operating margin increased to One of the key developments was that NASA extended Boeings international space station contract in the quarter The Global Services Support Division saw the only blemish in the quarter Its revenue decreased to billion due to timing of airborne control deliveries but its operating margin increased to on strong performance While the revenue is disappointing for the longer term the company was awarded a contract to develop and provide the nextgeneration communications system for the Australian Defense Force Finally like with the Commercial Airplanes segment there is a significant backlog Backlog in this segment was billion of which represents orders from international customers Commenting on the quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>President and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg stated By continuing to profitably deliver on our large and diverse backlog we are driving strong growth in revenue earnings and cash flow Solid operating performance across our commercial and defense businesses during the quarter also supported our continued investment in innovation and our people and our commitment to return cash to shareholders Three quarters of solid results and confidence in our continued operating performance enabled us to raise our revenue earnings per share and operating cash flow guidance for the year Looking ahead our teams remain focused on improving productivity and quality and delivering improved capabilities to meet our customers expectations I am very pleased with the performance this quarter It was strong and the stock should be moving higher on this news but at the time of this writing shares are down That said we care about the longterm And the long term is where I am focused With that I feel like the market is discounting the fact that the company raised its guidance Core earnings per share guidance for all of increased to between and up from and Operating cash flow guidance was increased to approximately billion Finally revenues are now seen coming in billion higher to between billion and billion on higher commercial airplane deliveries Finally the company is very shareholder friendly During the quarter the company repurchased million shares for billion leaving billion remaining under the current repurchase authorization
