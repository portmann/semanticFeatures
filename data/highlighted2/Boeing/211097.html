(Uncertainty) </span>Looking ahead, our teams remain focused on improving productivity and quality and delivering improved capabilities to meet our customers' expectations."I am very pleased with the performance this quarter.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It was strong , and the stock should be moving <i>higher</i> on this news , but at the time of this writing shares are down 0.5 % .  (Surprise) </span>That said, we care about the long-term.And the long term is where I am focused.With that, I feel like the market is discounting the fact that the company raised its guidance.Core earnings per share guidance for all of 2015 increased to between $7.95 and $8.15, up from $7.70 and $7.90.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Operating cash flow guidance was increased to <b>approximately</b> $ 9.5 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Finally , revenues are now seen coming in $ 0.5 billion <i>higher</i> to between $ 95.0 billion and $ 97.0 billion on <i>higher</i> commercial airplane deliveries .  (Surprise) </span>Finally, the company is very shareholder friendly.During the quarter, the company repurchased 11 million shares for $1.5 billion, leaving $6.0 billion remaining under the current repurchase authorization.Year to date, the company repurchased 41 million shares for $6.0 billion.That is incredible.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Further , <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> also paid $ 0.6 billion in dividends in the quarter , reflecting an <b>approximately</b> 25 % increase in dividends per share compared to the same period of the prior year . (Boeing: Uncertainty) </span>The stock yield 2.6% at its current price of $137.20.So what should I do?I'm going to buy.Even though I have missed my shot over and over, I think over a 30 year period, it won't matter if I initiate at $140 or $135.Note from the author: Christopher F.
