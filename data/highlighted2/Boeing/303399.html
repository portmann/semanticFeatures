Keep in mind that aircraft manufacturers realize a bulk of their revenue once a plane is delivered.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite the popular belief that investors are disheartened by the grim 2016 outlook presented by the company in its latest filing , I <b>believe</b> that it 's a mixture of reasons which arose in ` perfect ' timing to wreak havoc on BA .  (Uncertainty) </span>Call it a perfect storm, if you will.The dim forecast was just a propellant to a number of other factors; albeit a highly sensitive propellant which did the trick.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As far as I see it , what started all of this off was when sanctions from Iran were removed <i>earlier</i> this month .  (Surprise) </span>As this news wrecked havoc in the crude oil market, many other businesses welcomed the move, especially those situated in Europe.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , is already on a European tour and landed in France <i>earlier</i> today .  (Surprise) </span>During this visit, he is expected to sign a deal worth $10 billion for 114 Airbus planes.The reason why this deal has seemingly moved into the spotlight so quickly after the removal of the sanctions is because it was already in the works for the past year.What stopped Airbus and Iranian companies from completing the deal were the limitations placed by the sanctions, banning any banking transactions with Iran.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To make matters <i>worse</i> , the orders are likely to be partly financed with loans from European export-credit agencies .  (Surprise) </span>What investors fail to realize is that Iran's aircraft fleet is severely outdated and a mere 114 planes are not enough to revamp the Iranian Airline industry.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Iran will need around 400-500 new planes over the next five years and the Iranian deputy transport minister , Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan , expressed the country 's interest in purchasing <i>more</i> than 100 planes from <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> .

(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>My point is that <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> stock is still a <b>wonderful</b> long-term option . (Boeing: Surprise) </span>The company is known for announcing conservative estimates and revising them multiple times over the course of the year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The board is even dedicated towards dishing out dividends ; cash dividends for the year rose by <i>more</i> than 24 % year over year to $ 3.64 per share , with the latest quarter 's cash dividend amounting to $ 0.91 per share as compared to $ 0.73 per share in the same quarter last year .  (Surprise) </span>Operating cash flows increased to $9.4 billion and the company maintains strong liquidity in the sum of $12.1 billion in cash and marketable securities.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Those of you with very healthy <b>risk</b> appetites should add <i>more</i> BA stocks .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Shares are trading a good 20-25% below its fair value, and once investors realize that share prices will recover, they just can't stay this low for too long.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Either way , <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> still <b>seems</b> like a <b>wonderful</b> long-term stock despite today 's bloodbath .
