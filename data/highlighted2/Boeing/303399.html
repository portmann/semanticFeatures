class='textDiv'>Boeings Post Earnings Crash Could Be Your Chance To Cash In The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company announced earnings for the quarter and full year The stock price collapsed in the trading session that followed as investors were particularly upset with the grim outlook the company presented I believe the company is still a wonderful option and might even offer a chance to make some gains when the market eventually adjusts Okay so opportunities like this dont pop up so often but when they do the only thing worse than not noticing such an opportunity is letting go of it after youve recognized it The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSE BA stock is down The company announced earnings earlier this morning and beat estimates by to post an EPS of for the fourth quarter Revenues for the quarter dipped by about but were up by for the whole fiscal year Investors were mostly disheartened by the disappointing forecast the company set forth Revenue guidance was placed between billion and billion with a core EPS set to hover between and per share By <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>standards this isnt a great outlook as it barely matches the performance of The trouble doesnt end there net earnings dipped by and for the year and quarter respectively The company also declared how it was taking a million aftertax accounting loss from its plan to cut production of its iconic jumbo jet in half Even the will see production rates cut down from planes a year to planes a year in Both these cuts are being driven by falling demands Fourengine aircraft demand along with the declining cargo market are impacting the operations while the is facing low demand due to falling interest in the plane as buyers look towards the new X which will see its first delivery in Thats most of the bad news Beyond that the Seattle Washingtonbased company saw a fairly decent year especially considering the global turmoil weve seen in the past few months Commercial airplane deliveries were up by as the aircraft manufacturer plans to increase production of its and Dreamliner planes For it plans to increase the production rate of the Dreamliner to planes a month up from planes a month The jetliner will see its production climb to planes a month by To prove its dedication towards increasing output the company is heading towards its first scheduled flight of its newest airplane the MAX on Friday The program remains the companys main source of revenue as it constitutes more than half of the companys total plane backlog All this comes from the massive backlog which swelled by billion worth of net orders in and currently stands at a total of billion Now the ultimate demise of the Jumbo Jet program needs to be understood with a cool head The fact is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would be better off closing the whole program altogether but it has to honor its deal with the US Air Forces presidential fleet which will need a replacement aircraft as Air Force One is due for an upgrade The problem is that lately s became more popular as a cargo plane and as the air cargo market has stopped growing since and shows littletono signs of recovery it only made sense for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to shift focus away from a stagnant business unit to more productive units In the list of companies I cover Boeings fundamentals are by far the most superior I doubt any other company even comes close to what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has achieved The last year was nothing short of a triumph for the company as it faced and overcame a stream of adversities which would have put many strong companies in a downward spiral The constant duel with Airbus OTCPKEADSY took an especially nasty turn when politics tampered with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>the death of the ExIm Bank popularly known as Boeings Bank for the large chunk of financing it took in for the company brought about fears as to how an organization such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could continue But as the year ended <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>not only saw its backlog balloon to an even larger size but the company also managed to beat Airbus in terms of deliveries Where Airbus delivery count stood at planes for Boeings count stood at Keep in mind that aircraft manufacturers realize a bulk of their revenue once a plane is delivered Despite the popular belief that investors are disheartened by the grim outlook presented by the company in its latest filing I believe that its a mixture of reasons which arose in perfect timing to wreak havoc on BA Call it a perfect storm if you will The dim forecast was just a propellant to a number of other factors albeit a highly sensitive propellant which did the trick As far as I see it what started all of this off was when sanctions from Iran were removed earlier this month As this news wrecked havoc in the crude oil market many other businesses welcomed the move especially those situated in Europe The Iranian president Hassan Rouhani is already on a European tour and landed in France earlier today During this visit he is expected to sign a deal worth billion for Airbus planes The reason why this deal has seemingly moved into the spotlight so quickly after the removal of the sanctions is because it was already in the works for the past year What stopped Airbus and Iranian companies from completing the deal were the limitations placed by the sanctions banning any banking transactions with Iran To make matters worse the orders are likely to be partly financed with loans from European exportcredit agencies What investors fail to realize is that Irans aircraft fleet is severely outdated and a mere planes are not enough to revamp the Iranian Airline industry Iran will need around new planes over the next five years and the Iranian deputy transport minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan expressed the countrys interest in purchasing more than planes from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Even though US trade sanctions on Iran are still intact the country could apply for a special waiver a scenario which seems highly plausible right now My point is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>stock is still a wonderful longterm option The company is known for announcing conservative estimates and revising them multiple times over the course of the year The board is even dedicated towards dishing out dividends cash dividends for the year rose by more than year over year to per share with the latest quarters cash dividend amounting to per share as compared to per share in the same quarter last year Operating cash flows increased to billion and the company maintains strong liquidity in the sum of billion in cash and marketable securities Those of you with very healthy risk appetites should add more BA stocks Shares are trading a good below its fair value and once investors realize that share prices will recover they just cant stay this low for too long Either way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>still seems like a wonderful longterm stock despite todays bloodbath Tagged Investing Ideas Industrial Goods </div></body></html>
