class='textDiv'>Irans Aviation Future Seeking Alpha th January marked a watershed moment for Iran as the European Union EU lifted sanctions in return for Tehrans implementation of restrictions to its nuclear programme as agreed in talks in July last year Under the deal negotiated between Iran and six powers the US the UK France Germany Russia and China Iran is required to markedly trim down its nuclear activities and to remain under mandatory supervision for the next decade It also include removal of thousands of uraniumenrichment centrifuges that are used to manufacture nuclear fuel disabling the reactor core at its Arak plutonium facility near Tehran and shipping its nuclear fuel stockpile out of the country The lift in sanctions would release billions of dollars worth of frozen Iranian assets and reopen doors for global companies that have been barred from doing business in Iran The EU has confirmed that the legal framework providing for the lifting of its nuclearrelated economic and financial sanctions is effective The United States today is ceasing the application of its nuclearrelated statuary sanctions on Iran said EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini in a joint statement Decades of sanctions the earliest of which were imposed in the wake of Irans Islamic Revolution in have left the country with dilapidated aviation infrastructure and one of the worlds oldest aircraft fleet The age of the countrys fleet at an average of years is almost twice the international average Air disasters have occurred with alarming frequency in the country Since there have been civilian aircraft crashes in Iran with a death toll of more than The lift in sanctions has prompted Iranian officials to start courting foreign investors and expertise to upgrade existing airports as well as conducting feasibility studies on new ones The Wall Street Journal reported that Tehran is in talks with French airport operator Aroports de Paris and French industrial conglomerate Bouygues SA to design and build a new terminal at Tehrans Imam Khomeini International Airport The imminent development would bring the airports passenger handling capacity to million passengers per annum The country has also pledged US million to modernise its air traffic management infrastructure In the last few months alone five new airspace corridors were opened with more planned in the future Iran will buy a total of planes per year from the two aviation giants in the first phase of renovating its air fleet said Mohammad Khodakarami director of Irans Civil Aviation Organisation at a conference in August We will purchase planes from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA and Airbus OTCPKEADSF in equal numbers On th January Farhad Parvaresh Iran Air chairman and chief executive signed an agreement with Airbus for the acquisition of aircraft The agreement signed in the presence of presidents Hassan Rouhani of Iran and Francois Hollande of France at the Elyse Palace is worth US billion at list price and is the largest aircraft order by Iran since the revolution The deal with the Toulouse Francebased planemaker includes Aceo family Aneo family Aceo family Aneos As and As Todays announcement is the start of reestablishing our civil aviation sector into the envy of the region and along with partners like Airbus well ensure the highest world standards said Parvaresh The skies have cleared for Irans flying public and Airbus is proud to welcome Irans commercial aviation back into the international civil aviation community Today is a significant step in the overhaul and modernisation of Irans commercial aviation sector and Airbus stands ready to play its role in supporting it said Fabrice Brgier Airbus president and chief executive Iran Air the countrys flagship airline currently operates around aircraft with an average age of years These include several <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s as well as outofproduction models such as the Airbus A and the Fokker The airline said it needs at least new airplanes in the next decade and of those in the next five years According to sources deliveries of the Airbus order would begin as early as July this year Despite its edge over rival <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in securing early aircraft orders the Airbus deal would still require US licence approval since more than of its aircraft come from US parts Even though Washington has eased rules to allow USbased and foreign firms Airbus included to seek licences to sell civilian aircraft to Iran so far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and other US companies have shown little initiative to take the plunge Top aircraft executives have been quoted as being worried about the risk of sanctions being reintroduced if Iran fails to keep its promise to curb its nuclear activities under a socalled snapback mechanism If this happens the status of deals negotiated during the interim becomes questionable In general companies in Europe have been more optimistic about the lift in sanctions than their US counterparts In Europe it is Yes unless and in the US it is No unless said Brian Mulier partner of law firm Bird Bird Europe dialed restrictions down from an eight to a four while the US went from a to on a scale of said Christopher Swift former US sanctions official and lawyer at Washingtonbased Foley Lardner It was unclear how soon a deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could be agreed We are open to buying from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said Iranian transport minister Abbas Akhoundi shortly after the sanctions lift On the other hand the Everett Washingtonbased aircraft manufacturer is allegedly still trying to sort out an arrangement with the US Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control Rules regarding its dealings with Iran There are many steps that need to be taken should we decide to sell airplanes to Irans airlines For now we are assessing the situation said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in response to the lift in sanctions The Iranian aviation market is open said Ahmadreza Bayati Doosti deputy for international cooperation at Iran Airports Co In future would Irans aviation industry flourish and prosper rivalling its Gulf neighbours such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi or would it flounder due to lack of investments despite the sanctions relief Many with vested interest would look on with anticipation Editors
