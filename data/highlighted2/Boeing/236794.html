<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>booms robots rise and job growth lags Reuters NEW YORK For most of its year history when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>turned out more planes employment soared and the Seattlearea economy prospered When the rate of production fell layoffs followed and the local economy crashed The cycle was so predictable that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>workers had a phrase for it Headcount goes by rate Now that longstanding cycle has broken down The worlds largest plane maker is in the midst of its biggest peacetime boom churning out percent more planes than when the last big cycle peaked in the s But it is doing so with onethird fewer workers In their place <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is turning to robots and outsourcing In the past year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>installed four banks of twostory riveting machines at the factory that makes its aircraft in Renton Washington When it switched them on in May the ageold clatter of handheld rivet guns gave way to the whispery hiss of the ton robots which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>says can work twice as fast as people with twothirds fewer defects At its sprawling plant in Everett Washington <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has installed robotic arms to drill and rivet together fuselages for the jetliner The machines are taking what is in the neighborhood of to fasteners in the fuselage that are today applied by hand and automating them <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said in a speech at an aerospace trade fair in Seattle in September Its a huge transformation in how we build airplanes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>says automation is essential to improve quality and worker safety lower costs and keep up with its European rival Airbus which also is automating and churning out more planes to meet worldwide growth in air travel But while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>says the robots have not caused any layoffs the company is not predicting significant job growth either Increased automation means we can go higher in rates with a stable workforce Barry Lewis head of wing manufacturing operations at Boeings plant said during a recent factory tour Manufacturing job loss is well documented at auto plants textile mills and other US factories More than million such jobs disappeared between and as companies automated and sent work overseas according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Now the shift is coming to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The companys airplane unit has hired about people since employment bottomed out at about in a bust spurred by the attacks But that percent increase in labor has allowed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to make almost twice as many planes meaning the ratio of workers to planes has plummeted The plane makers current backlog of plane orders worth billion dwarfs the billion tally during its last boom in the late s But todays workforce is about onethird smaller compared with when Boeings employment last peaked in Back then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>made planes a year about workers per plane This year it aims to make planes using about workers per plane and the figure is falling Amid the biggest commercial aircraft boom in its history Boeings airplane division employs fewer workers per plane than during all other booms since World War II <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus are catching up with the rest of manufacturing said Robert Reich a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and former labor secretary in the Clinton Administration There will be no let up in the loss of manufacturing jobs Boeings employment growth stopped in the year Washington state approved billion in tax credits for the industry In return for the incentives companies were supposed to maintain and grow aerospace jobs in the state Since then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has shed nearly jobs in Washington fueling tensions with its unions and state officials Machinist and engineering unions which represent about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>workers have joined with state legislators sponsoring measures that would tie the tax credits to job and wage targets The frustration level in the community is high said state Rep Mike Sells a Washington Democrat whose district includes Boeings largest factory which makes the and We need to be able to show real hard numbers to the public if were going to be granting these exemptions As recently as teams of workers drilled and riveted fuselages That year as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>increased output of s by percent it began using machines to drill the holes Now robot arms are drilling and installing the rivets Similar robot arms covered with protective cloth are now painting wings applying a more precise coat than people can European rival Airbus also is automating and industry experts say it is doing so at a faster pace than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>partly driven by rigid labor laws in Europe that made it difficult to lay off workers in a downturn The European giant is working on technology to more easily configure robots and run them with common software It also is testing a system that uses hand tools laden with sensors and Google Glasstype headsets to validate that workers install parts correctly Airbus plans to implement the system with the A this year After that we deploy it globally said Sebastien Boria technology leader for the future aircraft factory at Airbus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus decline to say how much manual labor the machines save At <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>production time will be cut in half while quality and safety improve Walter Odisho vice president of manufacturing at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Commercial Airplanes and a recent hire from Toyota said in an interview Suppliers say the machines reduce the need for human labor substantially Electroimpact which created the twostorywingriveting machines installed at Boeings factory said older machines required workers to frequently change tools the machines used a process that could take an hour if employees were on break Electroimpact cut the time to five minutes on the new machines by automating the tool change It has since cut the time to seconds On the line the labor savings from automated riveting could be more than fold One person can run eight sets of robot arms that each do the work of people replacing workers said Surinder Lamba president of Apache Aerospace Inc a Washington state company that supplies tooling to all of Boeings commercial jet programs The lights out factory is already happening he said Not because we dont want lights but because we want to run No Christmas No lunch No breaks Outsourcing also is limiting Boeings US job count <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said in September it would open a factory in China its first outside the US to complete paint and deliver s for the Chinese market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>says the plant is necessary to meet rising output and wont cause layoffs or reduce work in the US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is also sourcing more parts outside its factories reducing its own costs In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>sold facilities in Wichita Kansas that made fuselages The hullsare still made in Wichita but now Spirit AeroSystems Holdings employs the workers not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Around that time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>developed a radically different production system for its Dreamliner Large industrial partners around the globe make wings fuselages and other big pieces and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>joins them together at factories in Everett and in South Carolina with minimal automation Partly in response to production snarls from outsourcing large parts of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>brought wings and other work back inhouse for the X jet it is now developing But Boeingis pressing suppliers to cut costs so it can sell its airplanes for less prompting many to automate too After taking over Boeings facility in Spirit reduced its workforce by percent It has since continued to install robots and recently announced plans to invest million in further automating its plants And Boeings plans for its nextgeneration factories suggest it will rely on robots even more in the future Innovation in the factory is now as important as innovation in aircraft design Muilenburg said Not all politicians and leaders have grasped the new reality at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said Richard Aboulafia an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group But even when they do what choice do they have Across the economy highskill highwage manufacturing jobs are becoming scarcer every year Whats Next Tomorrows Digital Life Thomson Reuters is the worlds
