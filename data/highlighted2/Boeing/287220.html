Alpha Disclosure I amwe are long BA MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article AirBridgeCargo commitment does not bring any certainty to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will run out of backlog in the second half of In some of my previous articles I had a look at the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA Program and one of my main conclusions was Currently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>depends on a commitment from VolgaDnepr Airlines to take delivery of airframes The order loss following Transaeros bankruptcy does not weaken the bullish case for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>but does make an already vulnerable program even more vulnerable In this article I will have a look at where the program stands now and how AirBridgeCargos fleet expansion will affect the outlook for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program To get an idea about the current state of the program it is important to look at the orders and deliveries As can be seen the backlog is slim In total there are only aircraft in backlog almost split equally between the passenger and freighter variant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been waiting for growth on the cargo market to return to the historical annual rate for order inflow for the freighter model to materialize but while the jet maker kept delivering aircraft recovery of the market was slower than expected This forced <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to cut back rates eventually but it might have done this too late Currently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>produces <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s per month effective March the production rate will be reduced to per month This means that it will produce aircraft in or in other words <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will run out of backlog at the end of the year One of the things that marks weak demand for the superjumbo is the number of white tails aircraft that have been rejected by the customer or aircraft of which the customer was not able to take delivery Currently there are white tails <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I in storage chances are slim that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will actually be able to find customers for all those aircraft in the near future Three white tails once destined for Asiana Cargo have been taken up by AirBridgeCargo While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is finding customers for the freighter white tails it does have a negative impact as the company delivers a white tail instead of adding an order to the backlog During the Paris Air Show in June VolgaDnepr UK Ltd committed to taking delivery of aircraft At that time I stated that this means another year of production for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>stretching the backlog until the end of However recently more details about the commitment have become available and things look less vibrant than I sketched back in June In an article published on Bloombergcom Denis Ilin Executive Vice President of AirBridgeCargo said it would take delivery of aircraft in followed by or aircraft per year until Given that of the aircraft that AirBridgeCargo will take delivery of are white tails there are aircraft to be built by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>In total this means months of production but given that the cargo carrier only wants to take delivery of or airframes per year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is facing a dilemma Figure Backlog <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Program AeroAnalysisnet If deliveries annually for AirBridgeCargo are added <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will run out of backlog in months from now This means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>does not even have enough backlog to close the gap until production of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Is start as replacement of the current Air Force One aircraft The fate of the program after is even more uncertain To bridge the gap <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>needs at least orders from customers other than AirBridgeCargo To receive these orders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>again depends on fleet renewal programs on the cargo market a market that has not shown enough growth in the recent years If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>chooses to bet on a growth rate for the cargo market it does take a risk and even in that case the program will bleed to death within a few years A safer bet is one that includes a rate cut starting in This means that any order <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>receives will be spread out over a longer timeframe giving the jet maker the opportunity to market the airframe to carriers such as UPS NYSE UPS Cargolux and Cathay Pacific Cargo OTCPKCPCAY which could buy as much as aircraft to renew their fleets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>cut rates on the program far too late The AirBridgeCargo commitment will not save the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Program on its own To keep the program running at current rates at least additional orders and deliveries are required annually A safer option is to cut rates by In terms of units this means deliveries annually instead of This would buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>the time to pitch the airplane to other customers and would make the task of having booktobill ratio more attainable To keep the program alive even after the Air Force One aircraft are delivered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will need to cut rates again A short term sacrifice to achieve long term gain </div></body></html>
