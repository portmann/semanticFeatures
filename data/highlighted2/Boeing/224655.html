performance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSEBA is optimistic that their favorable results will carry into the fourth quarter and The firms strong operating cash flows have allowed them to return nearly billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases through the first three quarters of The Dreamliner is nearing profitability with Q deferred payments growth at

Strength Index RSI <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has seen its share price rise to since third quarter earnings were released last Wednesday Their RSI has risen points to a near overbought position during the same period a bullish indication from investors Prices have for the first time returned to preAugust th levels With a high RSI is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>too expensive Lets compare them to the Aerospace and Defense Industry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is actually trading at a discount relative to the Aerospace industry with a PE of for the industry and a Price to Sales of industry The company operates at similar margins as its industry with an operating margin industry and a net margin of What separates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>from its competitors here is its returns <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has nearly doubled the return of the industry the past five years vs and has more than x the industry return twelve months trailing But who exactly are Boeings competitors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>operations can be roughly divided into two divisions Commercial Aircraft Manufacturing which accounted for of revenues in and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Defense Space Security BDS which accounted for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>competes with Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics in the Defense industry In the Commercial Aircraft Manufacturing industry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>operates in an essential duopoly with Airbus OTCPK EADSF OTCPK EADSY and compete for aircraft orders in zerosum fashion Both companies have impressive backlogs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has unfulfilled deliveries and Airbus has At current production rates it would take <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>years to produce all the orders in its backlog and it would take Airbus years The backlog for both companies provides strong revenue visibility for the next five years even when accounting for possible cancellations While Airbus has a larger backlog than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>orders against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>maintains two distinct advantages the firm has a higher delivery rate than Airbus allowing it to capitalize on its backorder and it maintains an advantage in widebodied aircrafts as the majority of Airbuss backlog of is in narrow bodysingle aisle aircrafts Through the first three quarters of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has delivered aircrafts to buyers while Airbus has only delivered A greater number of deliveries has allowed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to maintain higher billed sales than Airbus The top graph below is Boeings share performance over the last two years with the share performance of Airbus as the baseline The second graph shows both companies sales over the same period plotted in millions of dollars Boeings second advantage is in widebodied aircrafts Through the first three quarters of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has delivered wide bodied jets while Airbus has delivered only Alternatively <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has delivered narrow bodied jets in to Airbuss With a forecasted demand for new aircrafts in the next years from replacement demand and air travel growth Boeings higher production rates will create a substantial advantage Current production rates for the are units per month with plans to increase production to units per month in The MAX the new engine model of the has a massive backorder of units and is scheduled to make its first delivery in Production of the will be decreased from units per month to starting in as it is phased out in favor of the The Dreamliner is currently being produced by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>at a rate of units per month with project expansion to units per month in and units per month by the end of the decade Expansion of current production capacities will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to more quickly fulfill backlogs and substantially increase revenues by the end of the decade Of all their aircrafts the widebodied aircraft will have the most pronounced effect on Boeings bottom line going into The with its modest order backlog has amassed a billion deferred payments account as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has struggled to cut costs of production of the model at their previously projected rate The deferred payments account for the increases each period that the costs of producing a single aircraft exceed the revenues from selling it When revenues exceed costs on a per unit basis this account will decrease in size A zero account balance is the breakeven point for the entire project and a break even in cash basis will allow future produced units to decrease the deferred payments account So far the deferred payments account has increased in size each period offsetting firm revenues and cash flows from other aircraft models In Q of this year deferred payments for the increased by million the lowest one quarter amount for the project to date Management believes that deferred payments will continue to have declining growth rates in the fourth quarter of and the should break even on a cash basis and become cash positive once <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>starts producing s at a amonth basis in By the end of the should start contributing to earnings and cash flows rather than offsetting them This alone should have a significant positive effect on Boeings share price next year Management is not only confident in the performance going into but also for the fourth quarter of After a strong third quarter where revenues increased to billion and Core EPS increased to management revised its forward guidance upwards for yearend Core EPS and Revenue Forward guidance for Core EPS was revised upwards by from to and forward guidance for revenues increased by million from billion to billion Analysts have been similarly bullish on yearend EPS Shown below current average EPS estimates for are up from the estimate days ago Operating cash flows in the third quarter were billion of which billion was used to repurchase million shares and the firm paid out million in dividends Year to date management has bought back million shares for billion and has paid out dividends yeartodate of billion The figure below shows Boeings shares outstanding and quarterly dividend per share over the last years Over this period the firm has sent positive signals consistently buying back shares as well as returning an increasing amount of value to investors with growing dividends Management is still authorized to repurchase billion worth of additional shares under the current repurchase program No company operates without risk and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is not exempt Any decline in US defense budgets could see Boeings Defense Space Security business suffer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>also lost out to Northrop Grumman last week on a DoD long range bomber contract which is worth an estimated billion In the Commercial Airline business Airbus has been able to bring their Aneo narrow body aircraft to market faster than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been able to develop their narrowbodied MAX This first mover advantage has allowed Airbus to compile a significantly larger backlog for the Aneo orders than the MAX orders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>posted strong third quarter earnings and management revised both yearend revenue and Core EPS predictions upwards This indicates that management is confident heading into the end of the year and analyst estimates mirror this sentiment The is set to become cash positive in and will begin to contribute to Boeings already improving margins Investors looking to get long in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing
