style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>announced its fourth production rate cut in years for jumbo jet From March onward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will manufacture one a month down from current rate of a month Analysts and industry experts are apprehensive as all this may impact Boeings profitability <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>management is however confident about the companys future prospects American aero major The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSE BA recently came out with a rate cut announcement for its iconic jumbo jet to jet a month down from its current production of jets a month While the news of a production rate decrease for the widebody commercial jet has become quite common in recent times its relevance has not been compromised Industry experts and analysts are apprehensive about the drop in the digit as they believe this may take a toll on the overall performance of the company However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>executives beg to differ Heres the lowdown on whats going on and how that might impact the company Boeings latest announcement adds to the recent series of similar announcements for the Queen of the Skies this is the fourth rate cut in years For some time now the Chicagobased airframer has been facing difficulties in attracting customers for its jumbo jet and on the back of weak demand the company was forced to reduce its production from jets a month to in April This was the first reduction in the production rate Since then the phenomenon has become more common After April <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>announced the second rate cut to jets a month in the same year Thats so much for the previous rate cuts Now this year from September onward the aero major is going to manufacture s a month and this is further slated to go down to jet a month from March as per the latest announcement However with these changes in effect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>feels the future of looks much more stable The move comes from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as an attempt to sustain the program until the air cargo space recovers and new orders start flowing in The lull in the air cargo segment and the weak demand from passenger aviation have cornered the humpedup model With technological advancements relatively smaller twinengine jets such as Boeings own have become capable of pulling off long distance flights at much lower costs and thus have eaten into the demand for the jumbo jet Earlier airlines needed to use a fourengine fuelguzzler to make transoceanic voyages but gone are those days Airlines today prefer to go with the new age fuelsipping jets But this doesnt mean the is not good anymore Even today if airlines can get a full booking using a will become meaningful However not many passengers fly those large distances in one go All this has resulted in hopes for a brighter future for the being tied to the freighter market Cargo demand has always played a significant role in the overall demand of the model as cargo carriers account for the major chunk of s order book However since the slump of the cargo market has been slow to recover Instead of using the for transporting cargo airlines are using the cargo space available in and similar sized jets On the back of lower cargo shipments these jet models have turned out to be sufficient to cater to freight needs Analysts and industry experts may be apprehensive about the slowdown in production but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is not Absent the production rate cut <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would have met its backlog for the sooner and that would have resulted in a production gap something thats definitely not desired by the jet maker and its component suppliers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had to pull down the production rate so that it can keep the production line running until demand again kicks in Earlier when the Chicagobased company announced a rate cut to jets a month several component suppliers had objected mentioning thats the bare minimum that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>needs to produce monthly so that the component suppliers can maintain healthy operations However the current production rate may result in further unrest But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>believes this should not pose as an issue for the suppliers The aero major has streamlined the manufacturing process and undertaken costcutting measures which will help in smooth functioning even at this rate Rather <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>believes this new production rate will add the much needed stability to the manufacturing process The demand for the widebody has been plunging so far But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>believes this trend is going to change in years to come The company is confident about the upswing in commercial aviation demand and believes once aviation megacities get developed the demand for will also shoot up Even the forecast for cargo demand is optimistic <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>expects over the next years an average planes will have to be produced annually to meet the cargo market demand Hopes attached to the jet got revived when Russiabased Volga Dneper placed a tentative order for Fs during the recently held Paris Air Show This order alone can stretch the production line by more than one and half years buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>time before actual demand again kicks in Thus while the current market stats may suggest otherwise expectations for the jet in the future dont look too bleak As the economy improves and more and more passengers start opting for flying as a mode of transport and as demand for cargo picks up orders should start flocking in Source Should Investors Be Worried About Boeings
