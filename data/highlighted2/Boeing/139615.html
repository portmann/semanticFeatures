indicate competent management Free cash flow generation is healthy earnings quality ratios indicate solid underlying business Despite lowering guidance last quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA managed to beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines while also revealing an impressive backlog of billion The company is now half way through its fiscal year and Id like to examine it as a candidate for investors looking for a longterm core position for their portfolios The first thing Id like to look at is return on equity and whats driving it I grabbed some numbers from Morningstar to compile the below DuPont Analysis We can see that Boeings ROE has been erratic over the last few years but margins were clearly higher for fiscal which is encouraging I used end of year equity and assets for yearoveryear comparisons but below Id like to examine ROE using average equity and also stack it up against the companys return on invested capital and return on assets All data is from Morningstar We can see that ROE has decreased significantly over the last years but this is largely due to a decompression in the firms financial leverage per below ROIC on the other hand has been solid over the last five years which indicates a solid management thats proficient at allocating capital It should also be noted that return on assets is at a five year high as well These facts coupled with the fact that the main reason ROE dropped over the last five years was mostly due to a decrease in the firms equity multiplier indicating less business risk tells me that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has only gotten better over the last five years efficiencywise Next Id like to look at Boeings earnings quality ratios Data from Morningstar compiled by Joseph Harry The company has managed to generate consistent increases in free cash flow over the last five years Despite a slight deterioration in the firms FCFNI ratio over the last few years its still a dramatic improvement as free cash flow continues to comfortably exceed net income Operating income has also shown a sustainable upwards trend over the last five years This taken into consideration with the increase in net income and free cash flow indicates a strong underlying business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>last reported July which marked the midway point throughout its fiscal So far revenues for the first six months have increased by an impressive yoy Net earnings however have slipped yoy which translated to only a drop in earnings per shares More encouragingly operating cash flow has increased by Despite capex being almost higher for the first half of this year compared to last the jump in operating cash led to higher free cash flow which came in at millions This was an increase of roughly I care more about free cash flow than I do earnings so to me this was an indication of continued strength in Boeings underlying business Boeings guidance still shows expected operating cash north of billion for FY with capex coming in at about billion Free cash flow therefore should fall in at somewhere around billion on the low end I personally expect it to be higher than last years especially since its already outpacing last years figures As of June th <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had about billion in cash and equivalents on its books which exceeds the amount of total longterm debt it carries The firm also has adequate working capital and overall the balance sheet sustains solid liquidity BA Debt to Equity Ratio Quarterly data by YCharts Looking at solvency ratios investors shouldnt be too alarmed by the companys high debtequity ratio because this is typical of firms with financing units such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>In other words not all of its debt is core debt According to the company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Capital offers assetbacked lending and leasing concentrating on assets that are critical to the core operations of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>customers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Capitals primary mission is to support the other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>business units by ensuring customers have the financing they need to buy and take delivery of their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>products BCC contributes about billion of the firms overall debt Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>second quarter performance review The companys core debt stands at only about billion so net cash is about billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Capital accounted for less than of total revenues for FY and only around of earnings from operations Despite its relatively tiny contribution to profits BCC is also essential to overall operations however and the debt it adds to the balance sheet is actually helping to assist sales Shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>currently trade at about times FY earnings but only around times s estimated earnings This seems like a reasonable valuation on earnings for long term investors especially if the company continues to throw off increasing free cash flow and pay increasing dividends The last dividend increase was an impressive bump yoy BA Price to Free Cash Flow TTM data by YCharts Price to free cash flow and price to operating earnings ratios both look reasonable as well on a trailing basis although not ridiculously cheap <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is a classic bluechip company that fits well within the overall context of a diversified portfolio The company continues to increase free cash flow earnings and dividends and a hefty backlog means revenues should be relatively stable going forward Impressive return on invested capital and dividend growth add to the case for adding this stalwart to the short list of blue chips currently trading at a fair price in an arguably overextended market Source Boeings Backlog And Strong Fundamentals Bode
