Look At Boeings Most Risky MegaOrder The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha A potential order from Iran Air has been the main subject of an earlier article In my article Iran Where Are You <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Needs You I looked at a possible order composition Earlier in June <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA and Iran signed a tentative agreement but very little information was disclosed about the size and structure of the agreement leaving investors in the dark More and more information has become available about the order Iran placed with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>In this article I will have a look at how the actual order composition stacks against the order composition and size expected by AeroAnalysis based on earlier orders and available information First of all it is important to have a look at what AeroAnalysis expected based on the order with Airbus Figure Estimate made by AeroAnalysis for the order composition of Iran Air order Source wwwAeroAnalysisnet AeroAnalysis estimated a total of orders valued at bn The order was expected to be a mix of narrow and widebody aircraft The split between narrow and widebody aircraft was expected to be roughly I estimated orders to be placed for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>a mix between the Next Generation and the MAX For the wide body aircraft I expected up to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to be part of the order and up to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s The s would be a mix of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Classic and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X Although Iran seemed to be charmed by the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I I did not include this in the order composition Figure Estimate versus the ordered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s Source AeroAnalysis New details of the tentative agreement between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Iran show that Iran indeed did order the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The division between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NG and MAX however is vastly different from what I expected Additionally the number of ordered units is different as well A total of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s are likely part of the order whereas I expected orders Secondly Iran seems to have a preference for the MAX instead of the cheaper NG The catalog value of the After discount the value is closer to bn Additionally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will help Iran with the lease of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NG aircraft So the total order for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>stands at will be bought and will be leased from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>While I expected Iran to order up to Dreamliners it seems the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is not part of the deal The orders I expected would have had a catalog value of bn and bn after discounts Iran seemed to be charmed by the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>so to me it was a surprise that the Dreamliner was not part of the deal On the other hand this should not have come as a surprise at all since it will take years for delivery slots to become available Irans demand for new airframes is urgent ruling out the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Figure Estimate versus the ordered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s Source AeroAnalysis The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>does seem to be part of the order and as expected Iran will be an order for the current model as well as the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X which will enter service in Orders for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER were lower than I estimated but still will help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in closing the production gap The order for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aircraft does meet my expectation of at least aircraft The catalog value of the order for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>airframes is bn Whereas I expected Iran to go for only one superjumbo for now namely the Airbus OTCPKEADSF A it has chosen to order <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Is This of course gives the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program some much needed orders On the other hand I do question whether Iran Air will be able to rapidly set up a network in which the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus A can be operated with profit Iran ordered a total of aircraft with a catalog value of bn Over of the order was for a wide body aircraft beating my expectations of a split between narrow and wide body aircraft My estimate for the order composition used a composition comparable to that of the order Iran placed with Airbus The main differences between my estimate and the actual expected order composition are the following The actual order will be for units in a sales agreement and aircraft to be leased totaling aircraft This is above my expectation of aircraft and aircraft shy of the number of aircraft Iran ordered with Airbus Iran has a preference for Boeings new narrow body product This feeds the thought that the Airbus Aceo that Iran ordered were acquired at endofproduction prices The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was not part of the deal while it was initially pitched to Iran The absence of early delivery slots likely is the reason for this absence The total value of the order is bn whereas I expected it to be around bn This bn difference is caused by the Dreamliner not being part of the deal All with all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Iran will be happy with the deal It has to be noted that the deal is far from final and needs to gain approval Some Congressmen already are trying to block the deal This politically motivated objection is a threat to the deal If the order were to fall through it would not mean that the Iranian market will be a monopoly to Airbus The Airbus aircraft do use parts produced by US companies as well which means that also that deal would likely be blocked The bigger threat to Iran might be taking delivery of over aircraft in the coming years The infrastructure airline network and crew training all have to be brought up to par with nowadays standards Additionally it yet has to be seen whether the airline will be able to operate a fleet of aircraft in a sensible way The order placed by Iran for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus is a welcome one but the size of the order is geared towards Iran becoming one
