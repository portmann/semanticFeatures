<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Lockheed Martin to determine which stock is currently the best longterm buy I will examine each stocks value as a stable growth value and defensive investment based on a wide number of metrics The results of the analysis lead me to believe that Lockheed Martin is the strongest buy for investors looking for stability growth or stronger defensive attributes In this article I will be taking a look at both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA and Lockheed Martin NYSE LMT to help determine which is the better long term investment for specific types of investors based on a variety of metrics In doing so I will be reviewing each stock based on the following characteristics Since all investors are not the same I believe that looking at companies through a range of lenses is useful in determining the worth of specific stocks In my review I will be comparing the two stocks on individual metrics and then tallying the results of those values to determine a winning stock for each category The purpose of this category is determine which stock has the best overall financial position possessing a stable and consistent balance sheet and overall value Lockheed Martin has the advantage in terms of ROA with a value of compared to a value for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Lockheed Martin maintains the advantage when it comes to ROIC as well with a value of versus for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Over the past year the earnings yield of these two companies have held fairly close to one another with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>currently having a very slight advantage Over the past five years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has increased its book value by over while Lockheed Martins book value per share decreased significantly Both companies have done a good job at lowering their outstanding share count over the past five years with Lockheed Martin seeing the larger decrease In the stability section I feel that Lockheed Martin is the winner With stronger returns on assets and invested capital I think it is the more stable of the two stocks The decline in book value is a concern but since it has actually been <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>that has seen the larger drop in book value The purpose of this category is to determine which stock has seen the most growth over the past several years and which stock is likely to continue seeing the most growth in the future Both companies have seen revenue growth over the past ten years but Boeings growth has been far more significant especially in the past few years While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has seen the greater revenue growth over the past ten years it is Lockheed Martin that has seen the highest earnings growth during the same stretch of time While both stocks have outperformed the SP over the past ten years Lockheed Martin has seen significantly higher returns I believe that Lockheed Martin wins this category as well While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has seen the largest revenue growth over the past ten years Lockheed Martin has outperformed in each of the other four metrics The purpose of this category is to judge each stocks current value to determine which one is more attractively priced The trailing PE ratios of these two companies are nearly identical at x for Lockheed Martin and x for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is slightly more attractive based on its forward PE ratio of x compared to x for Lockheed Martin <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has the lower price to book value compared to Lockheed Martin and has consistently done so over the past few years This value has been sporadic for both stocks recently with each company taking turns at who has the lower value Currently it is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>that is more attractive based on price to free cash flow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is clearly the more attractively priced stock at this point based on trailingforward PE and PEG ratios along with price to book and price to cash flow values The purpose of this category is to judge how well each stock will hold up during a recession I will be looking at both dividends and past performance to score this Both stocks pay dividends with similar yields for Lockheed Martin and for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Price Returns During Prior Recessions During the recession both stocks significantly underperformed the SP with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>seeing the worst decline in its stock price I dont feel that either stock is a great defensive investment option but if I had to pick one it would be Lockheed Martin It has the stronger dividend with a higher yield and higher growth over the past five years It also has performed better during the past two most recent recessions Out of the two stocks I feel that Lockheed Martin is the better long term option right now for most investors I believe it has stronger fundamental financials along with a stronger history of earnings growth and stock price appreciation The company has had most good news recently with a new B missile deal Marine Corps approval of its FB fighter aircraft and strong recent quarterly results The company did miss out on the Humvee replacement contract but its strong quarterly results and the companys increase in full year earnings forecast lead me to believe that Lockheed Martin will continue to perform well moving forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has also had some good recent news with a B Navy jet deal but has also had to deal with the recent class action k lawsuit and plans to cut several hundred jobs in its satellite unit after a large contract from ABS was cancelled Unlike Lockheed Martin <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>actually lowered forward earnings estimates and appears to have some cash flow concerns In the near term I think Lockheed Martin will clearly be the winner but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>remains a strong long term play at its current price for investors looking for a value stock As always I suggest individual investors perform their own
