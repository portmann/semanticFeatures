the loss of the ExIm Bank are overblown <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can offer its own financing to compensate for the loss of ExIm As of July the charter for the ExportImport ExIm Bank lapsed This means that ExIm can continue working on existing agreements but cannot approve new loans guarantees or insurance The ExIm Bank was established in for the purpose of financing and insuring exports of US goods for customers that were unable or unwilling to accept credit risk The news of the lapse has <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA investors wondering how a loss of the ExIm Bank would affect them over the longterm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has benefited from the ExIm Bank since some of its customers obtain loans through the program The current situation is only a lapse and will likely be discussed again as Congress just returned from its recent break It is possible that the ExIm Bank will be reinstated In the meantime <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>stated that it will provide financing to compensate for some aircraft purchases for customers that are affected by the lapse The company has offered financing to some customers before the lapse My thoughts are that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could expand its finance arm in the event that the ExIm Bank was to go away permanently Currently of Boeings expected delivery of planes for is to be covered by the ExIm Bank This would comprise about billion of Boeings expected revenue of billion Some customers who depended on ExIm might be able to find financing elsewhere without Boeings help So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>may not have to fill the entire billion gap by itself Extending Boeings finance business is probably not what the company wants since its primary function is to build aircraft However if faced with a loss of the ExIm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could adapt and lend to the customers who are in need This would create a new revenue stream for the company as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would earn interest on the loans So although the companys balance sheet would be weakened a bit by expanding its financing I dont think a total loss of the ExIm bank would be devastating to the company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is experiencing strong demand from customers in the US and abroad with an eightyear production backlog of aircrafts Since of Boeings delivery doesnt rely on ExIm financing the company will continue to thrive as it could compensate for the other Some recent news for the company shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is said to be close to a deal to provide FedEx NYSE FDX with a large aircraft order Market Intelligence stated that FedEx is likely to order up to more Fs and up to Fs With the priced at million and the priced at million the total deal is estimated to be worth approximately billion This would compensate for of the billion worth of revenue derived from ExIm loans If FedEx is ordering new aircraft United Parcel Service NYSE UPS is also likely to need new aircraft FedEx ordered aircraft in and from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>but UPS hasnt ordered a large number of aircraft since Therefore I would think that UPS would also have a need to order new aircraft as the company keeps up with an expanding economy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>received orders for customers around the world in from airlines of all sizes This doesnt include the potential FedEx orders Since there are so many airlines throughout the world <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is likely to maintain a steady flow of orders going forward This will keep its revenue EBITDA and cash flow growing yearoveryear as it has in past years It is not clear whether the ExIm Bank will be reinstated or not I wouldnt be surprised if it is reinstated However if the ExIm goes away I think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would likely be successful adapting to a new reality <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could adapt by extending financing to customers that need loans This may not be the preferred direction for the company but it is possible I think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would continue to thrive over the longterm even if ExIm were to go away From an investment standpoint <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>looks attractive I performed a discounted cash flow analysis using the companys WACC of as the discount rate If the company were to grow free cash flow at only annually for the next years and annually thereafter Boeings intrinsic value is The gap between the intrinsic value and the current price of gives the stock a good margin of safety This doesnt mean that the stock will immediately rise to over but it shows that the current stock price is a bargain I see the company as a bargain whether ExIm is here to stay or not Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Can Thrive Without The ExIm Bank Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions
