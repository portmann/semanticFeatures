returned to the companys owners High dividend yield and high dividend growth rate make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>attractive for income seekers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA offers high shareholder returns to its owners mainly through share repurchases but also with its dividends yielding right now By utilizing an option strategy investors can increase the income they derive from their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares further Boeings shareholder returns are high due to the fact that the company generates huge amounts of cash flows this allows the company to pay out massive amounts of cash to its owners Over the last five years Boeings operating cash flow has grown from billion to billion free cash flows grew to billion over the same time Since Boeings market capitalization is only billion this means that the companys shares trade at a price to operating cash flow multiple of only Boeings price to free cash flow ratio is This means that Boeings shares offer an operating cash flow yield of right now the companys free cash flow yield is What does a free cash flow yield of mean It means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is able to return of the current share price to its owners in the form of dividends and share repurchases without accessing debt or the current cash position When we include a small cash draw from the current cash pile billion the company can easily pay out a shareholder yield dividend plus share repurchases Right now the majority of Boeings shareholder returns are stock buybacks billion in the last year but dividends are paid as well billion over the last year The fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is reducing the share count at a fast pace is a positive for those looking for capital appreciation obviously but also for those looking for dividend growth A smaller share count means the total dividend payments are divided over a smaller number of owners thus the dividends per share increase at a faster pace The effect of the declining share count and thus a growing dividend portion for each individual share as well as a rising total dividend payout can be seen when we look at how fast Boeings dividend has risen over the last five years A rise from per share to per share means a increase in five years or an annualized dividend growth rate of In combination with a dividend yield this high dividend growth rate makes <span style='background-color:

an additional right now when using the above call option expiry in June strike price Your total income over the next year would thus be roughly twice what you get from dividends alone Based on your investment you would receive an annualized income yield of The downside to this strategy is that your maximum gain is limited If Boeings shares trade for per share by June you could not sell them for that price but would be forced to sell them for Your maximum gain however is still very sizeable in dividends over the next year option premiums and a share price gain of would allow for a total gain of over the next year or an annualized return of Since the maximum capital gain is capped this is a strategy that is primarily interesting for those who are looking for income from their investment
