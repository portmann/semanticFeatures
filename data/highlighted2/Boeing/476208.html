assembly line hangar at the Airbus US Manufacturing Facility in Mobile Alabama September WASHINGTON As the US Treasury Department decides whether to license sales of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co BAN and Airbus AIRPA commercial aircraft to Iran opponents of last years nuclear pact with the Islamic republic have launched a lobbying campaign against the deals The international agreement to curb Irans nuclear program made such sales possible by easing sanctions on Tehran but some members of the US Congress who oppose it want to block proposed sales of some jetliners worth about billion at list prices to renew Iran Airs aging fleet While the lawmakers oppose any action that could boost the Tehran government they also argue that Iran could use passenger aircraft for military purposes such as transporting fighters to battle US troops or allies in Syria or elsewhere <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus the worlds two largest planemakers struck provisional agreements with the Iranian carrier earlier this year The Republicanmajority Congress could pass legislation to block the sales even if the Treasury Department approved them The House of Representatives last month passed two amendments that would have stopped the sales although to become law they would have to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama a Democrat This week the Foundation for Defense of Democracies a Washington foreign policy research group which has criticized the nuclear pact and advocated tougher sanctions on Iran organized letters signed by dozens of national security figures expressing concern about the aircraft sales and promising to increase pressure on Congress This deal represents a legitimization of a State Sponsor of Terror and a direct benefit for a ruling regime responsible for gross human rights abuses support for terrorism including threats against the US and its allies said the letters to Dennis Muilenburg Boeings chairman and Fabrice Brgier chief executive of Airbus plane manufacturing unit The signers included former Secretary of State George Shultz former CIA Director Michael Hayden and former US Senator Joseph Lieberman Aviation industry experts said Treasury likely would not approve the sales until after the Nov US presidential election although the companies would like to move more quickly The campaign season is not the time to push it said Adam Pilarski a senior vice president at the Avitas aviation consultancy in Virginia Once we have a resolution of who the president is calmer heads will prevail It is business that is good for the US Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton a former secretary of state under Obama supports the nuclear deal Republican candidate Donald Trump opposes it Treasury said it would not address its engagement with specific companies Airbus spokesman Stefan Schaffrath declined comment on the lobbying campaign saying the company was working with US authorities to ensure that all its activities complied with applicable laws and regulations John Dern a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>spokesman said the company is continuing to talk with approved Iranian airlines that all its actions to date have been licensed by the US government and that any final agreements also would need approval Since it is based in Chicago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>must obtain a license from Treasury before the sale can go through Francebased Airbus must also obtain a license as would virtually any aircraft maker because its planes contain more than percent US content Supporters of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>sale say American firms will lose out to foreign competitors if the US government bars sales to Iran Although the nuclear pact eased sanctions connected to Irans nuclear program restrictions related to concerns such as terrorism support and human
