#A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>KCA occurred on Friday the first of the type in tanker configuration after test flights in the development of C Delivery of the first of Pegasus tankers is estimated for late Entry into service of the operational aircraft must run smoothly if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>plans to continue to offer the replacement of choice for the US Air Forces KC fleet As Airbus continues to match Boeings annual orders of civil airframes its crucial for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to maintain its stronghold in the military sector Boeings NYSE BA next generation tankercargo aircraft the derived KCA Pegasus made its first flight in tanker configuration on Friday a welcome milestone for the airframer who has endured substantial technical setbacks and test flight delays over its years of development <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>hoped the billion deal to replace the US Air Forces ageing fleet of KCs would be supplemented by orders from other nations who so far look to have favoured alternative manufacturers offerings This article reviews the technical merits of the Pegasus and its competitive placement in the worlds fleet of support aircraft The KCA program is of high importance to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>whose military aircraft arms revenues have not followed the upward trend of its commercial aircraft business Figure As Airbus OTCPKEADSF continues to meet and in some cases exceed Boeings monthly order count its crucial for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to maintain its stronghold in the military aircraft market and as such the performance of the Pegasus program should be considered significant for potential investors Modern air forces are spoiled for choice of next generation KC aircraft Figure shows the deployment range and fuel transfer capability of current models which fulfil three distinct performance envelopes Embraer NYSE ERJ and Lockheed Martin NYSE LMT currently offer highly versatile sublb MTOW aircraft that offers kerosene cargo support the KCJ and KC can operate as moderate capacity tankers from short fields while remaining combat ready for equipment and personnel transport Larger multirole offerings come in the form of the Airbus AM and A MRTT and the B MMTT conversion offered by Israel Aerospace Industries all of which attain longer onstation time performance and far greater ferry range Two long range high capacity tankers offer direct competition to the Pegasus the A MRTT and Il both offer comparable lb transfer fuel capability which enables them to offer fleet support to sizeable sorties for prolonged periods Although both Boeings and Airbus airframes offer comparable ferry range and station performance in their high capacity tankers the order books look very different Figure In terms of commitment volume the Pegasus is leading significantly with a staggering aircraft on order the sole customer being the US Air Force The A MRTT by contrast has attained far fewer orders the strong order book is built on commitments from different nations spanning Asia Europe and the Middle East There are several contributory factors that have led to Boeings lack of buyers for the Pegasus tanker The sizeable order attained from the US Air Force has enabled prolonged production of the baseframe however it has also meant the design architecture is focused specifically around the US militarys requirements resulting in an aircraft not ideally suited or priced for a smaller nations defense strategy This is reflected in the KCs tankerdriven design with cargo capability being very much a secondary role a capability the USAF is not short of with its strong fleet of Cs Cs and Cs The United States position both geographically and politically requires the ability to operate anywhere on the globe and the sheer size of the US airborne fleet requires extraordinary refueling capability Figure shows the relative refueling fleet size of some of the largest air forces The USs reliance on airtoair refuel capability is clear with three times as many tankers per aircraft as any other nation Figure Fleet composition by nation While the US will predominantly use the Pegasus for refuel missions smaller nations require a true tanker transport where the cargo function has not been compromised to enhance tanker performance The A MRTT is marketed as a highly versatile tanker transport that offers more flexible solutions for smaller nations making it just as effective during peacetime Although industry sources estimate the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is million more expensive per unit than the Airbus offering <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>sources have stated its aircraft is about cheaper to operate over its lifetime despite the higher acquisition cost The problem being that this figure is flight hour dependent Unlike the US a lot of nations simply wont utilize support aircraft to the same extent again making the KCA less attractive to more modest defense budgets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>spokesman Chick Ramey has said that acquisition of the Pegasus enables the host nation to dovetail with the USAF program this is an interesting statement particularly in the case of South Korea who frequently exercise with US forces and somewhat rely on USAFs ability to show force The fact that South Korea invested in the Airbus A MRTT indicates that this selling point isnt as appealing to the average nation as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>may think Another contributory factor to the differences in order count is the existing backlog Both airframes have low in comparison to the civil sector production rates and although order backlog will not reach the extremes of the singleaisle civil market will still be considered by buyers and Airbus reduced price and leadtime will influence any decisions based on more than just technical merit The KCA program has been at the centre of media attention since its inception The estimated billion worth of cost overrun and sizeable fines have helped to maintain the programs attention however the fact is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>already has commitments for four times as many aircraft as Airbus and the singledigit percentage profit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>makes from m aircraft will soon absorb the unexpected costs Perhaps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has indeed developed an aircraft that is specified for a single nations fleet but is this a concern for investors No <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would have still launched the project knowing USAF would be the sole buyer The US Air Force tanker fleet currently exceeds aircraft and the Pegasus ordered so far are only the first phase of a muchneeded replacement program Any investor can overlook lost orders to lessornations if the KCAs entry into service is painfree ensuring USAF continues to turn to the airframer for their tanker fleet needs The coming stages of the test flight program will remain under heavy scrutiny as the tanker displays its ability to fuel manned and unmanned aircraft from domestic and international forces Whether or not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>attains orders from international customers it has still achieved rejuvenation of an otherwise diminishing civil production line and created a fitforpurpose kerosenecargo airframe for the worlds largest air force The day <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>won the
