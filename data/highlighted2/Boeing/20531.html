NYSEBA Seeking Alpha CFM LEAP engines cope with significant shortfalls CFM LEAPB engine might need PIPs to address the shortfall Airbus OTCPKEADSF OTCPKEADSY and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA both are bringing their new narrow body airframe to the market in the coming years Both airframes as well as Comacs C are powered by CFM LEAP engines The CFM LEAPA is powering the Airbus Aneo while the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX is being powered by the CFM LEAPB turbofan Both turbofans should reduce fuel burn by compared to the current upgraded CFM engines Recent tests however have shown that both engines are missing their target for fuel consumption The LEAPA has a performance shortfall of while the LEAPB has a performance shortfall of The shortfall of the LEAPA which should enter service in October can be addressed by a performance improvement package NYSEMKT PIP The LEAPB which is scheduled to enter service in has a shortfall that might take or PIPs to bring the performance close to the spec The shortfall shows that there is something fundamentally wrong with some components of the engine which are performing far below expectations Whereas the LEAPA needs some tweaks the LEAPB needs a bit more work In this article I look at the implications of the performance shortfall for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX aircraft In a forthcoming part two I will have a look at the implications of the performance shortfall for the Airbus aircraft and look at how the <span

<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX will be more fuel efficient per seat compared to the Airbus Aneo Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus have their own way in comparing and skewing numbers to yield good results for their airframes I will not use any of the numbers provided by them Figure Impact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX on efficiencies compared to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Source DhierinPerkash Bechai In my analysis I compared the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>with CFM B engines which are less efficient than the CFM BE The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX weighs more but benefits from a higher aerodynamic and propulsive efficiency Additionally in typical class configuration the MAX can carry passengers more For a nautical mile trip <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>seems to be claiming better efficiency compared to the current <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>My analysis only shows an advantage per seat and this does not take into account the shortfall that the CFM LEAPB is coping with now Figure Impact on fuel efficiency compared to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>over a wider range Source DhierinPerkash Bechai The analysis above shows that even when the CFM LEAPB engines are meeting the specifications <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is not able to provide the advantage in fuel efficiency over the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Now that the shortfall became apparent it is worth looking what the consequences of the shortfall are on the fuel burn figures Figure Impact on fuel efficiency including shortfall compared to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>over a wider range Source DhierinPerkash Bechai Figure shows that the fuel burn per seat shift upwards a bit It is not a lot but it puts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in a very difficult spot Instead of being as claimed more efficient per seat the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX now only is more efficient This means that the Airbus Aneo will be more of a threat than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would like to admit Shortfalls on power plants seem to be nothing new The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>engines received performance improvement packages and its engines are still running below specification The CFM LEAPB engine is coping with a shortfall With each PIP addressing of the shortfall it will take PIPs or major redesign that have to be rolled out CFM has years to address the shortfall since it was guaranteed that the engine would meet its specifications If the turbofans miss specification on service entry it will probably costs CFM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>money Even when turbofans are running on spec the fuel burn per seat reduction is not as big as specified The shortfall means that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX is only more efficient whereas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>claimed higher efficiency A shortfall is quite difficult to address years before service entry Addressing a shortfall in years is quite a challenge and although I am convinced <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and CFM have some strong engineering skill and power I do not think they will be able have the engine running as specified within years In Part I will address the shortfall on the CFM LEAPA engines used on the Airbus Aneo and see how both airframes compare to each other with shortfalls Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major
