class='textDiv'>Boeings BA CEO Leanne Caret Presents at Deutsche Bank Global Industrials and Materials Summit Transcript Seeking Alpha Great I think well go ahead and get started So welcome this is towards the end of day one of the AB Track My name is Myles Walton the Aerospace Defense Analyst here at Deutsche Bank And with us today were pleased to have with us <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Hometown Chicago here and presenting for the company Leanne Caret who is the newly named President CEO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Defense Space and Security So its a pleasure to have you with us Leanne Thanks so much for joining us In terms of just setting the stage it will be QA and interactive RO there are RO slides to necessarily show other than the forwardlooking statement to cover everyone in the room And so with that Leanne thanks again for coming Could you mainly characterize for us how youre looking at the defense spending landscape both domestically but also with of your sales internationally how that is also looking for you At the high how its changed and how you think its going to change one way or the other over the next few years Its a really interesting environment Youre starting to see an increased demand If you look at the US government budget roughly over the next five years and we have a lot of folks who are pretty excited about that I still view that as modest growth Im clearly bit were continuing to see the effects of the geopolitical environment watch continuously tensions in the Middle East and then the South Asia and its driving different behaviors both within the US as well as internationally And so from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>position where we are positioned with our rotorcraft business with our fighter business with our services business there is all opportunity there to continue to advance in those areas Im not seeing a direct impact in terms of increased backlog this year whether it was both of that But I do think as were not trying to stabilize our backlog as we look through the future to take advantage of that and grow the business Okay And from an international visvis domestic how would you put those two in different characterizations comparecontrast which youre seeing in those two markets Within BDS were continuing to see the debate in terms of how the government wants to spend its money Clearly as we move into new administrations we will see also the outcome of that I dont think any one of us can forget what that means for us While we continue to see those from a US perspective services that have ageing aircraft we are focused on the need to do some replacements that they have put on hold for a number of years But even in doing so they are still facing its higher extremely tight fiscal constraints until how do they do that in a most affordable way and ensure that they have the reliability and availability they need as they continue to migrate those products and over the long haul On the international side what Im continuing to see and Im out quite a bit in a different move Ive had over the past couple of decades is a continued desire to be as aligned to the US as possible So when there are US products and services that are out there youre going to see many of these customers who want to be part of that family of products and services but in terms of the scale and the size that they can buy from a fleet perspective its not as significant but also they dont necessarily have all the infrastructure to be able to maintain upgrade and sustain them overtime And so thats from a services perspective where we have an advantage to really take to look at where we have that global programs and we have that installed base how do we bring a lot of what weve done in the US to those countries to help them make certain they are as efficient as possible And you think that the election outcome has a material impact not domestically but on the international front as it relates to those allies and friends who want to be closer to us through buying our products Is there positive and negatives to that I cant none of us can speak to it I just came back from Singapore that the ShangriLa Dialogue with past weekend where we were focusing on where the conversation revolves around Southeast Asia and the different environmental conditions that all the ministries of defense are facing There are just so many different of variables playing into their decisionmaking process and like the US they also have some significant budgetary constraint where they are trying to balance or what they are doing from a social perspective and social programs as well as from a different perspective There is just two specific ones on international the Vietnam opening of the exportability of weapons and then the Canadians decision to push out at F decision until the next decade opening the door to more F buys in the nearterm Can you talk about those two as maybe opportunities Vietnam I actually had the opportunity to meet with part of the Vietnam contingency while I was in Singapore And they are very excited about what it means to have the arms em bargo lifted but part of its figuring out to them what does that mean There is still going to be state department approvals and requirements that need to go through They are also a country that has to figure out fiscally what they can afford and what they cant afford So I do believe that there is opportunity there In terms of the timing I think its going to were all going to need to be patient to understand those impacts With regards to Canada we welcome the opportunity to put the Super up in a competition I continue to believe its a great aircraft with great capabilities and well let that customer work through its process and if they determine that its going to be open for competition well be allin to compete Okay Well lets stay on the fighter enterprise for a second So you have the F the F what is the current outlook for those two platforms in the mediumterm So in the shortterm we see demand signals that continue to indicate that well be producing both the and the through the early s What Im equaling if not more excited about is how we take the opportunity to modernize those existing aircrafts that are out there both for US as well as for other countries and modernize them for tomorrows fight I mean this is all about keeping these assets they are going to be flying into the s and keeping them relevant And relevant means addressing aging aircraft issues where they have corrosion because of the types of operations and the number of hours that theyve had to fly over the past few decades and the number of conflicts theyve had as well as how are they being outfitted from an avionics perspective and from our weapons perspective And I really try to bring focus back to a Chinook story when I talk about our fighter business because if you look at the history of the Chinook program it went into service during the Vietnam war and by everyone and the history books will show that it was at the near brink of being out of production how many different times over the course of the last years including us late as in the early when we produced less than aircraft in an entire year Yet you look at the demand for the Chinooks today and what advantage it its the focus we had on modernizing and upgrading it and continuing to evolve the technology so that we already win the next opportunity presents itself From our fighter perspective I think the same thing occurring not only from a service life enhancement program that addresses the corrosion addresses aging aircraft the issues but the modernization aspect so that when the next fighter competition is and there will be another one at some point in the future we have the capabilities to talent the expertise to compete And you are prime supplier on the program when it was being produced What is the thinking and probability important Okay alright Lets stay then still in the fixed swing markets The trainer is an opportunity on the horizon that youre Im sure going to be eagerly awaiting competing for CJSTARS Talk about those in terms of timeline and import to you And also put it in the context and well get to in a minute but how you would go to bid on those contracts I think people want you to win things but they want you to win them profitably I think if dont mind Miles it was kind of what Ive shared with our team and I shared it at the Investors Conference back in May that as I look to the future of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Defense I want to make certain that we have a clarity around where we want to have a leadership role from a market position and where we want to align our investment As you all know we spend roughly billion a year in RD on the defense side and we want to make certain to your point that were spinning in a way that adds value from a company perspective to our shareholders And those six markets are on our commercial derivative Overall JSTARS fits well into that thats strong ph You will also hear anatomist as one of my six focus areas and thats where its now called MG has been has several names as of late that is official designations now fits into that space But then you also have our rotorcraft business that talks a little bit about it and extending those lines we have human space exploration satellites business and then our services business And the fighter actually speaking about really sits well in that service play issue going forward But there are several campaigns that I view as I can win in that clearly very much want to win TX is one of those MG the JSTARS sweet cap and GBSD which by itself mainly focus still think about droves all over others in terms of size and scale Now that also will require the government to decide conversations running of nuclear triads versus the diad ph and I didnt know of that But clearly the conversation is such as that we need some of those defensive mechanisms When we look at how were going to bid I want to my focus is to bid to win but do in a way that is going to bring profitability to the company Weve been very clear I think you all heard Dennis Muilenburg say it just last week how we are targeting increasing our margins going forward Youve seen on the defense side over the past five years weve continued to show growth in that area and we continue to do that going forward And thats really based on ph first half is affordability in general making certainly structure the business the way it was from our overheads or benefit of our facilities in a way that really gives us that advantage there Secondly through our productivity and efficiencies I gave an example not too long where based on how weve been able to take lessons from commercial and pull them into our defense business weve been able to reduce the average unit purchase price by over the last five years And then finally its your business models and I think thats a lot of what folks havent talked about as much as what is an innovative business model look like how do you add in a service elements to it that will allow you to take advantage of the tail of the acquisition because as you all know as well as I do when you look at a total valuable weapon system is upfront with the acquisition of the asset itself of its been on support and sustainability over the decade And so how do we take advantage of that and those are the considerations and well be making in each of those campaign Okay And is the one that its kind of clear that would drop into your backlog this year the Presidential aircraft recap because the source solution has already been determined and its just I guess the matter of Ts Cs to get it under a contract Yes I spent years of my career supporting the special air missions slate of which the Presidents airplane is one of them It is definitely an honor and privilege to support that aircraft The contract structure is in line with the development type program we are working through trade studies with the US Air Force right now and we look forward to supporting that program Yes they are looking at right now they are looking to their formal process about the term of the aircraft and thats how they have made the program right now Okay And so to carry out those two weve talked about bleakly but bidding things profitably how has the bid process changed since something like the KC which was a strategic investment you kind of knew that you were skating on the edge when you bid it most likely maybe you didnt know you were skating over the edge but you knew you were skating on the edge Have you changed the process the risk hurdles and the gating process What have you learned from the process thats feeding into lessons or in for the new competitions Im not going to say our bid process has changed we were very aware of the bid we made on KC were very focused on the fact that weve recognized its a franchise program thats going to be in service for decades with aircraft Clearly all those things that are going to generate longterm profitability for us collectively While were continuing to look forth to understand how we are bidding in terms of the full life cycle and so one of the areas of options that we always have especially as we deal with defense contracts as so many times the evaluation is focused on the instant contract and the instant price and that support piece doesnt come along with it And so the more opportunities where we can look at holistic solutions where we can bring both the aircraft the aircraft and the vehicle Ill say as well as the support element That changes the conversation dramatically and I think its a real opportunity for us So in a sense where the KC and Dennis has talked about this over the entire lifecycle you obviously have access to the tail of that logistics and thats where the payoff is from a total program perspective But Id imagine youd still have learned some of the the lessons are in the system engineering Yes so in terms of the execution of it thats the execution of the program which isnt as much about the business case or the model the business model It is the US Air Forces top priority it is my top priority I spent nearly time every day on KC and its not time sitting miles away calling and making questions I am routinely in sales ph Monday or Friday Again when were out on the floor were talking and making sure we understand I grew up around airplanes Ive run shop floors before so the ability to be out there and really see firsthand where the challenges and issues are I think one of the key differences from when we did and started executing KC to where we are today with the startup of our development organization And with all confidence I believe that were better off on tanker todate because of the development organization effect that we established that last year and put that mechanism in place and there has been a lot of conversation weve seen all of the media I know there has been a lot of debate about what was known when and where Because of our the way weve organized that is why when we made the decision after tests that the software solution wouldnt work that we could pivot instantly to a hardware solution because from a development organization perspective we were operating down two paths We didnt spend a lot of time talking about the two paths but it allowed us to be proactive and our customer was with us every step of the way to make sure that they understood that as well So as external investors we see there is a few milestones that moved on the to stay on it for a second One was the milestone Cs it goes to August the other is the delivery of equipped aircraft and the third is the RAA formal contractual piece And so as external investors were trying to calculate and understand what the implications are financially of all that If I think about those three pieces is the biggest piece solving implementing the hardware fix in the nearterm in a twomonth period of time So getting their hardware fixed tested so again we still have of flight tests still to do and weve been clear on that We will be flying the aircraft in the July timeframe again our what we have remaining to do to prove out the boom is flying the flying the F and then flying the A Well give that data the Air Force will actually conduct those tests with us and then theyll do the data and then Ill prepare us for milestone C and the decision to go into production you know how that production configuration defined From a financial impact we are in the process of assessing what those impacts are implementing that solution as well as and weve shared before change in corporation because we are going to have beyond aircraft built next summer and were going to do not only the change in corporation weve always talked about but the modifications to the boom that will need to be done Now its not rebuilding an entire boom but there will be modifications required to the boom And so that will be incorporated as part of that Weve also talked from a cash perspective were not looking at cash to be impacted this year The timing supports the decision supports the timing based on what we know today but we do need to complete our financial assessment Got it Okay I think Dennis also said that linear growth from the cash flow this year to next year is also not derailed by this And so talk about the depth of business that has actually grown through sequestration its performance has been as if sequestration didnt exist and the down cycle So talk about the trajectory and the ability of that momentum to continue both on a top line and from a margin perspective It is Im real passionate about the services business and it goes back to that point of conversation that when you look at the lifecycle of a weapons system of the cost is associated with the initial purchase of the aircraft or the vehicle And most times more attention is spent on that than is spent on the whole tail end of it Many years back we made the decision to stand up a separate services business focusing on customer understanding and customer intimacy in terms of how do we give them the best access the best availability and the best support that they need in order to maintain a fleet especially recognizing that operational and support budgets always are under pressure And so when we look at what weve been able to achieve weve been successful not only taking advantage of the installed presence we have around the globe from a just pureplay <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>but weve also been able to move off <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>platforms into other areas where we can apply these same techniques whether its modernizing and upgrading or its providing parts support or some sort of predictive data management set that allows us to help our customers manage their fleets And thats really what allowed us to grow that business and youve seen that specifically as we set up <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Defense Australia <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Defense UK Saudi Arabia and then as we go forward in India On the side we also have the opportunity with those business models because these are customers who dont have necessarily all that infrastructure and so we have the ability to get truly paid for performance based on terms that weve set up and when we perform better than those stated goals we can get some upside out of that and thats been great Well thats an area that seems like a perennial upside So I think its six years in a row youve beat your initial margin guidance in GSS by basis points on average And you look like youre tracking ahead again this year So what is it that wont prevent this year from looking like the last six years in terms of this being kind of an offsetting function to some of the risks retirements and the other Im not going to obviously Im not going to talk forwardlooking guidance that wouldnt be appropriate What I would say is if this continues to be a business where we can be innovative not only in our business models but we really have been extremely aggressive in our costs on our affordability initiative And we continue to see really just great performance out of this area of the business So the affordability initiative last year the business talked about billion of cost savings achieved with another billion to go within the GDS the defense space and security business How much progress are you making towards that billion of incremental savings We actually achieved billion on savings over the last five years so we have surpassed all of our expectations on marketbased affordability I mean and for those of you all whove been following thats a combination of what weve done on partnering for success in terms of taking advantage and coming up with winwins with our supply base In addition to that its really have been about optimizing the workforce optimizing our benefit packages And in the services side thats an area where customers cant afford to pay highend engineering and development rates Youre looking at a certain service level and so we are able to tailor those mixes to that customer segment Ive been extremely aggressive part of these dates back to my time as CFO weve had great success todate My belief is that we can continue to push forward those affordability efforts and there is more to be gained and well continue to do so So to put your business in context of the whole <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>thesis as a stock right now a big piece of that thesis is tied to cash flow And the cash flow of the entire company obviously <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Defense is a big contributor to it If you look at your cash contribution your businesss cash contribution the last few years and the next few years is that a stable contributor and how would you classify its cash conversion versus the rest of the business We convert cash to earnings pretty consistently and we have so as you look at our earnings projections that gives you a good leading indicator on our cash Clearly as the C line has ended well we have one aircraft that would look at delivery next year that has clearly there has been some some of the cash has come from there and well see some adjustments there but at the same time well see the KC program ramping up So I dont see a fundamentally different profile going forward well still convert pretty much one for one with earnings And so I think were pretty consistent Man space so or human space my wife would kill me Cross Talk So ULA do you all fear that the SpaceX is going to take over the world And ULA is obviously not a big piece of your earnings stream but space in general is an area that you could do a lot more And you obviously have the presence on SLS you have the presence on our commercial crew and you have obviously a stake in ULA and its future as it relates to the bulk and what happens there Talk about that in its totality with particular emphasis I think on where it makes most important to you which I imagine is in the SLS and commercial crew My folks actually met at the Michoud plant in New Orleans Louisiana on the satellite program and I was actually I grew up born down in Florida at the Kenney Space Center And I was actually at Kennedy Space Center yesterday with the commercial crew program Space it is such an inspirational topic and whats really most exciting is that were actually talking about it again because for a number of years you havent heard a lot about it Its a challenging area because you have on one hand the requirements and the absolute nofail mission where youre going to provide safe reliable access that is assured with an emphasis on safe At the same time it is an expensive proposition so how do you break Ill use one of the popular phrases of the day how do you break the cost curve to do it in a way that totally disrupts and transforms that business Were on a journey together I think SpaceX is right in the middle of that with us were all looking for how we do it and we all bring something a little bit different to the game I think they are doing a great job in terms of how they are looking at it from a cost perspective I think were doing a great job in terms of how do we continue to ensure its assured and its safe And so its that reconciliation and that migration of those two elements I think what Im most excited about is it does present a lot of opportunities for us and the US as well as the rest of the worlds going to decide how much funding theyre going to actually put aside because it continues to be a fight yearafteryear as you know Also it isnt so the spending lines are just secured and nobodys going after them they usually see some impacts and there is plus back to restore them And so that always makes it challenging But we the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company have to continue to disrupt ourselves in terms of how were going to provide that nofail element of it and do it in a remarkably affordable way And were working our way through that Youre going to ask me for a new number I dont have a number off the top of my head And the gentlemen standing at the back end now ph Yes I mean were not talking double digit growth rate And again I think a lot of that is as a result of how its being funded I think there is some general conversations about is this going to end up becoming more of a commercial play as it goes forward more so than a traditional NASA play Yes that is my not only my desire my intent and that we do it the right way And sometimes doing it the right way means you need to go slow to go fast And so making certain that weve taken our lessons learned and weve put commercial crew within our development organization and really make certain that were doing the holistic systems engineering to your earlier point up front and make sure that we can deliver on that commitment Okay And then the ULA and your role as a Js partner and what you think are the future there what your commitment is what your requirements are for the Vulcan And then new launch where that would be required to compete Were all there is I dont know of anybody thats not interested in having a US rocket The discussion around the use of Russian rockets everybody is aligned the problem is we dont have a US rocket right now of the right size that makes it the most affordable and economical for our nation And so giving us the time to bridge to that continues to be part of the conversation thats had And aside to that is how do you how does ULA become costeffective from a price per launch And that is something that team is totally focused on and weve been seeing great progress on that todate And theyve read the tea leaves they understand whats needed and theyre going after it full court And from a CapEx requirements from or development dollars required from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to inject into the joint venture is that something that will show up on the radar And the million a year that you do spend in RD across the business whats the trajectory of that Is it a flat outlook relative to flat sales Pretty stable Even through even during the downturn if you look were a billion company we have been for a period of time we have never shied away from our investment dollars I think its one of the reasons why weve been able to stay the course through some fairly challenging times from budge perspective Were going to we dont have any intentions of changing that course significantly going forward Okay And maybe the last line would be around the programs in the rotorcraft market that are mature seeming like they kind of run like clockwork another business that you ran So think tell help us think about what the outlook is for rotorcraft Is that a stable piece of the business Yes one of the things I learned running that business is and around the world to the US we look to our fighters and our bombers as being the iconic aircraft that our military uses If you look at the UK if you look at other nations the Rotorcraft the Chinook fleet for instance is their iconic asset of choice And as the conflicts continue whether its in the Middle East whether its in the whatever happens in the Asia Pacific youre going to still continue to find that need for that type of capability And I really like to share a story as well because I think it talks a little about me as a leader and why what we do is so important I received a phone call one day at the office a few years back from my mother it was really odd because not many of us get phone calls from moms at work And she called to thank us for building the Chinook And I asked during the course of the conversation why the call because its a bit out of the ordinary And she said my son was a ground troop and he was involved in an IED incident and the majority of his team was killed he was critically wounded and a Chinook got him out and then he got into a field hospital and then eventually he came home to Walter Reed on a C And its not a plug per se for the Chinook or the C but she said he came home for Christmas because of what you all do And thats part of as part of this defense space and what we do is our contribution to the fight is really not determined purely by our proximity to the fight we do meaningful work The assets were building the assets that were supporting provide value to the war fighters and to all of us that are sitting here in this room today And so I think the rotorcraft fleet will continue to show its dominance because of that very need Okay Well Im not going to top the story of the mother calling about her son so I think well probably come to a conclusion there at this time Well thank you for the time I appreciate it I think you caused me to lose my voice Thank you very much Copyright policy All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking
