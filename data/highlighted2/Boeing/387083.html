Negative Trend For The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Order inflow for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Classic trailed the multiyear average Order inflow for was far below my expectations The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA production gap has been the main subject in some of my articles I concluded that between orders depending on the scenario are needed annually to close this gap Since then some variables have changed In this article I will not have a look at this gap in particular but will have a look at the trends prior to and after the X launch Figure Order trend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X since Source wwwAeroAnalysisnet Figure clearly shows that order inflow for the classic <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been lacking since the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X has been launched From until <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was able to receive order per year on average Looking at the years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was actually able to receive those orders per year However as soon as the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X was launched order inflow declined sharply In the years order inflow has dropped to on average this would be sufficient to close the gap according to my prior calculations However this was a backoftheenvelope calculation that does not take into account the fact that orders need to be placed at least one year before production actually starts was a make or break year for the program and that is also where I made a mistake assuming that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would be able to secure at least orders Halfway through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>secured orders for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Classic but ended the year with just orders It probably is also at this point that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>fully understood that a program rate cut would be necessary What is worrisome is the order composition in the recent years as shown in Figure While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>did offer significant discounts and introduced a performance improvement package for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>it seemed to have very little impact on the order inflow What can also be seen is that order inflow for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER declined sharply in whereas the importance of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F grew Although order inflow for the F is more than welcome there is a risk associated to that The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>are both active in more or less the same market segment which means that orders for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F might have cannibalized orders for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Additionally cargo market recovery has been weak meaning that there may only be so many airlines willing to buy the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F to keep the backlog afloat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>possibly did everything in their power to sell the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F but it was not enough Order inflow for the F has been rising but it is the question of how many of these aircraft the slowly recovering market can absorb Order inflow for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER has been quite good in and but was mediocre in The launch of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X directly affected order inflow for the current <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>family making orders drop below the multiyear average Share of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER in the order inflow strongly declined in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>saw solid order inflow for the freighter but this might have cost the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and it is also the question how many freighters <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can still sell in a market segment that is showing brittle recovery In the end <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was not able to seduce enough airlines with discounts and performance improvements A better move would have been to fill the gap using combideals where customers would order the X as well as the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER Airbus OTCPKEADSF proposed such a combideal to Delta Air Lines NYSE DAL in and it made them win the order eventually <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>probably has focused too much on selling the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X while it could have secured some orders for the current <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>simultaneously I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it
