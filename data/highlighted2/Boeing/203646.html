reports from leading pork producer Smithfield and aircraft giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA show that consumerfocused companies should continue to thrive despite Chinas slowing economy while policydriven staterun firms could suffer more A couple of upbeat new reports from aircraft giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and leading global pork producer Smithfield are providing an interesting contrast to broader forecasts of gloom and doom for Chinas slowing economy In the first instance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has upgraded its year forecast for aircraft demand in China while the second has Smithfield has saying its exports to China rose percent in the first half of this year Each of these stories is slightly different but both point to a growing divide in the Chinese economy that has big implications for the nations major industries On one side of the aisle are companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Smithfield which make products and services directly tied to consumer demand Such products and services are part of the socalled real economy and are things that the market really wants These should be able to continue thriving even if Chinas economy slows On the other side of the aisle are companies that produce products and services less based on market demand and more based on the wishes of local government leaders who use such activity to meet their centrallyset economic targets These products and services include things like steel and real estate in smaller cities which really arent needed and face the most serious difficulties over the next few years due to big oversupply Among the companies I write about including Internet cellphones and providers of retail products and services most are privately owned and thus make products that the market really wants and needs Both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Smithfield fall into that group as the former makes aircraft that are used to meet growing consumer demand for travel The latter makes one of Chinas most widely used food products But companies like new energy car and solar panel makers might feel a bit more pain since theyre a bit more prone to producing based on government directives and less based on market demand All that said lets take a quick look at the latest reports starting with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>which has raised its year outlook for demand from China by percent from its previous estimate made just last year English article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>says it now expects China will need aircraft over the next two decades which will be worth an estimated billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>made its prediction based on its expectation for a tripling of Chinas aircraft fleet between now and One of the big drivers for the new demand is an expected boom in budget airlines Chinas first such carrier Spring Airlines has done quite well in the market and held a successful IPO last year that looks like a good longterm bet Several other companies also have recently launched including Air and others are in the process of being formed Next theres Smithfield whose CFO is saying the companys exports to China soared percent in the first half of the year even as growing signs emerged of a broader economic slowdown English article This particular story is one of consolidation since Smithfields gains followed the departure of many smaller pork farmers from the market due to stiff competition that has undercut their ability to operate profitably This particular story also is related to Smithfields purchase two years ago by WH Group formerly called Shuanghui That acquisition carried a price tag of billion making it the largest such purchase of a US company by a Chinese buyer Part of the logic of the deal was for WH Group to use its own local connections to boost the export of Smithfields higherquality products to China which is whats happening now At the end of the day the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Smithfield stories both bode well for Chinas broader private sector especially more mature companies that are profitable and dont depend on big staterun banks for funding Many of these marketfocused companies should continue to thrive despite any economic slowdown and may even become the recipients of preferential policies from Beijing as their importance to Chinas
