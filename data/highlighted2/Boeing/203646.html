(Boeing: Uncertainty) </span>One of the big drivers for the new demand is an expected boom in budget airlines.China's first such carrier, Spring Airlines, has done quite well in the market and held a successful IPO last year that looks like a good long-term bet.Several other companies also have recently launched, including 9 Air, and others are in the process of being formed.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Next there 's Smithfield , whose CFO is saying the company 's exports to China soared 45 percent in the first half of the year , even as growing signs emerged of a <i>broader</i> economic slowdown ( English article ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This particular story is one of consolidation since Smithfield 's gains followed the departure of many <i>smaller</i> pork farmers from the market due to stiff competition that has undercut their ability to operate profitably .  (Surprise) </span>This particular story also is related to Smithfield's purchase two years ago by WH Group, formerly called Shuanghui.That acquisition carried a price tag of $4.7 billion, making it the largest such purchase of a US company by a Chinese buyer.Part of the logic of the deal was for WH Group to use its own local connections to boost the export of Smithfield's higher-quality products to China, which is what's happening now.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>At the end of the day , the <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> and Smithfield stories both bode well for China 's <i>broader</i> private sector - especially <i>more</i> mature companies that are profitable and do n't <b>depend</b> on big state-run banks for funding . (Boeing: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Many of these market-focused companies should continue to thrive despite any economic slowdown , and <b>may</b> even become the recipients of preferential policies from Beijing as their importance to China 's economy grows .
