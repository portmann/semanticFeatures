funds are buying and the stock price is high Bearish signals are being ignored high PriceBook and high DebtEquity The saying is Go big or go home So I am going after one of the big guys Verizon NYSE VZ is part of the Dow and it is on everybodys radar The analyst consensus recommendation for VZ is Buy VZ is trading at of its week high and of its year high Large valueoriented mutual funds are currently buying VZ VZ has a high dividend DY with a low Beta appealing to dividend seekers who think they are reducing their risk of capital loss Why the market is wrong about Verizon It is highly overvalued the PriceBook is way too high It is carrying way too much debt DebtEquity is very high The high dividends appear to be driven by a desire to boost the stock price rather than spending earnings on growth The company is betting that interest rates will stay low Growth prospects for Verizon are not as optimistic as conventional wisdom supposes Part How does Verizon compare to its Dow colleagues Lets just look at the companies on the Dow list that analysts are currently recommending as Buys Let me introduce my personal formula for screening stocks My approach as a value dividend investor is to initially look at the following four factors Dividend yield DY This is a key measure for people like me who want to maximize income You cant get income with a low DY Of course DY has to be balanced with risk factors such as the following three ratios I prefer a DY Beta A low beta is desirable is best since I want to sleep well at night and reduce the risk of capital loss Some people use Dividend Anchor Score which is DYBeta to screen for a high dividend payer with low volatility but Anchor Score doesnt tell enough of the story PriceBook PB This is another key metric for me and I think PB is a better measure than PE of stock price inflation I prefer a PB DebtEquity DE There are different ways to interpret DE Some companies prefer to leverage their growth using debt especially in these days of low interest rates To me that is a risky strategy which only seems to work well for governments that print their own money Again I like to sleep well at night I dont have debt so why would I want to invest in companies that do I would rather invest in companies that pay for their growth with earnings I prefer a DE Putting it all together I use this formula Stock Dividend Value SDV DYBetaPBDE Using my preferences the minimum SDV Any stock with an SDV less than doesnt make the cut So lets look at the stocks on the Dow which currently have Buy recommendations From the table there are only stocks that meet my SDV minimums CSCO JNJ MRK NKE PFE and PG By the way I own shares in CSCO and PFE but not the others At the other end there are a few stocks with truly dismal SDVs less than AAPL HD and VZ But before I slam all three lets look at charts of Dividend Yield vs the various ratios to see where these stocks fail AAPL certainly sticks out with its high Beta but so does VZ in a good way with its high dividend yield and low Beta So far it looks good for VZ Now lets look at PriceBook Verizon still sticks out but so does Home Depot and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Now lets look at Debt to Equity Now only VZ sticks out The charts of Dividend Yield versus the various ratios are useful because they show where the differences are Supposedly the Dow stocks should be similar in these metrics They are all big companies which should have evolved into similar valuations For the various charts there should be a cluster of points over a narrow range Outliers should raise questions AAPL is an outlier for Beta but is similar to its colleagues for other ratios Home Depot and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>have high PriceBook values but are similar to the rest of the Dow for the other ratios Only Verizon sticks out in all three charts One in a positive way for its very high dividend yield perhaps its actually a negative and two in a negative way for its high Price to Book and high Debt to Equity Part Qualitative evaluation of Verizon Since numbers are a snapshot and only tell part of the story what is happening at Verizon that would explain the contradiction between the bullish sentiment and the bearish valuation factors First what do the numbers mean Debt Lets look more closely at the debt VZ has a combined short and longterm debt of billion Yes thats right billion dollars Its not as much as Greece which has a billion debt but it is in the same order of magnitude Is Verizon in danger if its creditors get tough or is Verizon too big to fail The key question is what are the prospects for VZ to service their debt How reliable is their revenue stream Stock Price Stock price to book value is too high Why is it this high Is it because investors have a lot of confidence in the future of the company or are they being led down the garden path As per debt the key question is what will the future bring for Verizon Dividend Dividend yield is too high Normally I wouldnt complain about a high dividend but since it is much higher than its colleagues in the Dow we have to ask the question why Why does Verizon feel the need to pay such a high dividend Wouldnt it be better to use their earnings to pay down their debt or finance growth The future for telecom and wireless companies is not certain There are a lot of competitive pressures Notably the market for wireless plans is maturing and there will be more price competition as companies seek growth Verizon has taken on a lot of debt to improve infrastructure They currently have the money to service that debt with revenue of approximately billion and an operating income of almost billion They have a net income of billion of which billion is paid in dividends payout ratio Management is expecting continued growth but there are clouds excuse the pun on the horizon In the last quarter reported April they had a net loss of wireless phone subscribers mainly due to lower priced competition from TMobile and Sprint They had an overall gain in subscribers due to increased tablet registrations but many industry experts think that the wireless market is close to saturation with most people already having a phone and a tablet Going forward companies will gain customers by taking them from other companies This will lead to price competition and the US wireless industry could look a lot like the EU wireless industry where phone plans are half the price that they are in the US due to high competition Adding to the price decrease is the current pressuretrend in North America to reduce roaming rates It is inevitable given the widespread availability of public WiFi hot spots So there will be no easy route for Verizon to increase revenue A revenue decrease is likely and it will not have to be very large in order to put pressure on dividends To me this is the most difficult thing to understand about Verizon Why are they paying such a high dividend The dividend yield is higher than their sector competitors and their Dow colleagues They seem to be using high dividends to push up their stock price Why are they pushing up the stock price Stockholders like it but they usually dont decide what the dividend will be Hopefully the people that do determine dividends would be more incentivized by the longterm health of the company than by bonuses from shortterm stock price increases Source Verizon Communications Is My Favorite Idea That Everyone Knows But That No One Understands Disclosure The author is
