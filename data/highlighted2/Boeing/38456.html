Only Verizon sticks out in all three charts.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One in a positive way for its very high dividend yield ( <b>perhaps</b> it 's actually a negative ) and two in a negative way for its high Price to Book and high Debt to Equity .  (Uncertainty) </span>Part 2.Qualitative evaluation of Verizon Since numbers are a snapshot and only tell part of the story, what is happening at Verizon that would explain the contradiction between the bullish sentiment and the bearish valuation factors?First, what do the numbers mean?Debt.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Let 's look <i>more</i> closely at the debt .  (Surprise) </span>VZ has a combined short- and long-term debt of $113 billion.Yes, that's right - 113 billion dollars!It's not as much as Greece, which has a $425 billion debt - but it is in the same order of magnitude!Is Verizon in danger if its creditors get tough or is Verizon too big to fail?The key question is - what are the prospects for VZ to service their debt?How reliable is their revenue stream?Stock Price.Stock price to book value is too high.Why is it this high?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Is it because investors have a lot of <b>confidence</b> in the future of the company , or are they being led down the garden path ?  (Uncertainty) </span>As per debt, the key question is, what will the future bring for Verizon?Dividend.Dividend yield is too high.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Normally , I would n't complain about a high dividend , but since it is much <i>higher</i> than its colleagues in the Dow 30 , we have to ask the question why ?  (Surprise) </span>Why does Verizon feel the need to pay such a high dividend?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Would n't it be <i>better</i> to use their earnings to pay down their debt or finance growth ?  (Surprise) </span>The future for telecom and wireless companies is not certain.There are a lot of competitive pressures.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Notably , the market for wireless plans is maturing and there will be <i>more</i> price competition as companies seek growth .  (Surprise) </span>Verizon has taken on a lot of debt to improve infrastructure.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They currently have the money to service that debt with revenue of approximately $ 127 billion and an operating income of <b>almost</b> $ 20 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>They have a net income of $9.6 billion of which $8.6 billion is paid in dividends (89% payout ratio).Management is expecting continued growth, but there are clouds (excuse the pun) on the horizon.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the last quarter ( reported April 21 , 2015 ) , they had a net loss of 138,000 wireless phone subscribers , mainly due to <i>lower</i> priced competition from T-Mobile and Sprint .  (Surprise) </span>They had an overall gain in subscribers due to increased tablet registrations, but many industry experts think that the wireless market is close to saturation, with most people already having a phone and a tablet.Going forward, companies will gain customers by taking them from other companies.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This will lead to price competition and the U.S. wireless industry <b>could</b> look a lot like the EU wireless industry where phone plans are half the price that they are in the U.S. due to high competition .  (Uncertainty) </span>Adding to the price decrease is the current pressure/trend in North America to reduce roaming rates.It is inevitable given the widespread availability of public Wi-Fi hot spots.So, there will be no easy route for Verizon to increase revenue!A revenue decrease is likely and it will not have to be very large in order to put pressure on dividends.To me, this is the most difficult thing to understand about Verizon.Why are they paying such a high dividend?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The dividend yield is <i>higher</i> than their sector competitors and their Dow 30 colleagues .  (Surprise) </span>They seem to be using high dividends to push up their stock price.Why are they pushing up the stock price?Stockholders like it, but they usually don't decide what the dividend will be.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Hopefully</b> , the people that do determine dividends would be <i>more</i> incentivized by the long-term health of the company than by bonuses from short-term stock price increases .
