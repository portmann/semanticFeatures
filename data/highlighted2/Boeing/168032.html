is an important one for the gold market and is bullish for gold It shows once again that gold is slowly but surely becoming a cash equivalent and as money again At the end of the day the Fed has failed to implement any meaningful reform The very issues that caused the Crisis excessive debt particularly in the opaque derivatives markets are at even Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site As we documented and annotated if not with an Apple pencil yet the markets reception of AAPL latest convocation for the faithful was less than enthusiastic pushing the stock to close near its day lows after a flurry of product announcements that led many to wonder if the Steve Jobs creative magic is now officially dead However with AAPL still the most important stock in the world for the largest number of hedge funds not to mention the biggest by market cap the sellside banks felt compelled to immediately defend it and halt any further bloodshed even as AAPL is doing all it can by issuing about billion in EURdenominated bonds in a part deal today whose proceeds will be used for buybacks Apple announced several new products and updates at its September event in San Francisco CA including the iPhone s and iPhone s Plus the iPad Pro a new Apple TV and a series of enhancements for the Apple Watch Apple is also offering a new iPhone upgrade plan starting at a month whereby users can finance an iPhone with AppleCare and return the phone for a new model every year while we are not changing our iPhone estimates at this time we believe this program may eventually lead to higher iPhone sales as replacement cycles could compress Overall we were encouraged by the events announcements and we were perhaps the most positively surprised by the enhancements to Apple TV and by the introduction of tvOS There were no major surprises with the new iPhone cycle which is typical of an s device with that said as we have argued several times the s cycle is more likely to surprise on gross margins rather than units We are somewhat skeptical that the newlyannounced iPad Pro will be able to stimulate overall iPad demand consumer weakness continues to outpace commercial adoptionbut we believe the enterprisecentric iPad Pro is a step in the right direction We are not changing our model at this time although we present a series of sensitivity analyses in the body of this report We remain bullish on Apple stock and we reiterate our Buy rating Of course with Goldmans desk making millions in commissions executing AAPLs weekly if not daily buyback orders the last thing Goldman would dare to do is issue a report that angers Tim Cook But another problem may be emerging for AAPL China As a reminder China recently became the biggest endmarket for iPhone demand and any hints this may be jeopardized could have severe repercussions on the stock price Which is why we paid particular attention to a report overnight from Chinas finance ministry which accused a China unit of Apple of underpaying taxes in by million yuan million which comes as China toughens its stance on tax payments by foreign firms Apple Incs computer subsidiary in China failed to pay million yuan more than million US dollars in due taxes by the end of an official accounting inspection report showed on WednesdayApple Computer Trading Shanghai Co Ltd included maintenance costs into pretax deductions wracking up the giant deficit the Ministry of Finance MOF said in the report But the company has paid back the taxes and million yuan in late fees The firm also underreported billion yuan of revenue and billion of costs and overstated billion yuan of profit the report showed The problem was disclosed along with violations of rules in other stateowned private and foreign companies after the MOF inspected on accounting information for tens of thousands of firms across the country The Ministry of Finance MOF report dated Sept but cited by official news agency Xinhua on Thursday said Apple Computer Trading Shanghai Co Ltd had already repaid the taxes as well as paying million yuan in late fees So while AAPL may be out of the woods in this case the report and the investigation underlines an increasingly hard stance being taken by Beijing against foreign firms underpaying taxes after authorities said in December last year that they would crack down on the practice Apple officials in China did not respond to phoned and emailed requests for comment Worse the finance ministry report said the Apple subsidiary had understated its revenues by billion yuan and its costs by billion yuan It had also overstated its profits by billion yuan And considering the recent financial relations between China and the US have been anything but without blemishes the question on everyones lips is whether the currency war will progress to their next evolutionary phase namely trade wars and will the biggest symbol of former ChinaUS symbiosis ie AAPL products be the next casualty in what is becoming an increasingly more hostile relationship For the answer keep an eye on upcoming channel checks if recent history is any
