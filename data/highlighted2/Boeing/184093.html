Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>received its largest ever order for planes from China The company announced to set up a completion center in China to contest Airbus growing

before handover to the customer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would be sharing its technical knowhow with Comac which could cost the company in the future as the latter is building its own narrowbody Chinas President Xi Jinpings visit to Boeings NYSE BA Seattle facility will be marked as a historic day in the companys calendar as it was followed by some record orders The company also announced to spread its wings abroad for the first time ever The current events have apparently come in as a sign of strengthening relations between the two economies However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has always been very cautious of keeping operations within the domestic boundary in fear of transferring its valuable knowhow and technology to a foreign land Theres no doubting that China is among the fastest growing aviation markets and Boeings been importing components from the mainland But is it reason enough for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to move outside the homeland Certainly not Theres more to it China is a hotly contested market with both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and its European counterpart Airbus OTCPKEADSY battling to get a larger share The latter has an upper hand in terms of orders though China tries to even out orders between the two companies says Richard Aboulafia of Teal Group Airbus set up its assembly line in Tianjin China in The company has been solidifying its hold in the country ever since as bulk of the total orders from Chinese aircraft customers were awarded to the plane maker loading its order books This year Airbus stated its plans of extending its China venture by constructing a completion center for its popular widebody the A for sales in Asia Airbuss declaration was followed by a jet billion order from China and this is no coincidence The order flowed in as a sign of appreciation for investing in the countrys aviation industry This has become a point of concern for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>China is a growth market that demands more airplanes to manage increasing passenger traffic which is expected to grow annually as against other developed markets that primarily have replacement demand As such <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>got triggered to introduce operations in China to play catch up with Airbus to gain market share The Chicagoheadquartered companys efforts did not go without rewards China was quick to place orders for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>jets which is the largest ever placed by the country The deal is for s and widebody aircraft However the combination of the order for widebody planes is not known Though the catalogue price of the deal calculates to billion aircraft manufacturers typically give huge discounts The plane maker forecasts China to take deliveries of planes in the next two decades which translates to billion worth of business Of this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>expects single aisle to count for over of the total deliveries which precisely means three out of four planes delivered would be narrowbody As far as demand for widebody planes is concerned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said China has opened routes covering miles over the past two years Longhaul flights in these routes could see the company win orders for the and ER Considering Boeings market share will improve in China over the next few years it could bag sizable orders with only Airbus to compete The decision of constructing an industrial facility abroad is a big strategic move for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Boeings exposed to a broader market risk than just challenging Airbus dominance in the mainland The jet order has been placed on behalf of three Chinese airlines and a leasing company all of which are state controlled and tied to Chinas long term objectives China has been long yearning to develop a solid aviation base and looks forward to the entry of foreign companies that could help its workforce learn the technology and the manufacturing process The country has made a sound groundwork for an aviation industry but now needs to develop its workforce and infrastructure to be able to manufacture planes As such the Chinese government formed a subsidiary named Commercial Aviation Company of China Comac to enter the manufacturing space from making component parts Comac is currently involved in developing a single aisle plane the C to get a share of the narrowbody market and such arrangements would come in quite handy As part of Boeings agreement of setting up a completion center in China it will work in collaboration with Comac to carry out the completion activities of the jets until its handover to the customers That is to say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will coach Comac workers with the skill sets to design the C thats being developed to compete with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>workers are certainly not happy to see the plane maker build a plant abroad However Ray Conner CEO of Commercial Airplane division said that the move would not result in any job loss at Renton In fact it would take some load off them particularly when they are seeing the monthly production rate increase from to by The latest order flow and stronger China ties should pull up Boeings top and bottom lines but thats coming at the cost of building a nonUS factory and sharing the technical knowhow with Comac While it might appear Boeings assisting in building its future rival China is going to learn the art anyway from its tieup with Airbus If that is the case then why not capitalize on the ongoing surge in Chinas aviation market instead of letting Airbus gain dominion over the country Theres a great deal more to manufacturing planes than just fitting the interior and painting which comes at the bottom of the value chain Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware
