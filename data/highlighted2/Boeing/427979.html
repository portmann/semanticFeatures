class='textDiv'>Chances For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>As Qatar Cancels Aneo Order The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Strained relation between Airbus and Qatar opens up opportunities for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Delivery delays are impacting Qatar Airways earnings Qatar Airways has canceled its first order for the Airbus OTCPKEADSF Aneo following months of delays after problems surfaced shortly before service entry Additionally the engines were having problems during operations in high temperature environments such as Qatar The carrier has a clause in the contract allowing to cancel orders when deadlines or targets are being missed In one of my articles Engine Drama On Aneo Might Help The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX I already noted that the issues could give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>some leverage in pitching the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA MAX to potential customers I also noted that I do not expect the current issues to create waves Given Qatar Airways and CEO Al Bakers history of thorough inspection before accepting airframes walking away from the early order was something that could be expected and I expect them to refuse deliveries and cancel orders for other airframes as well if need be Qatar Airways ordered a total of Airbus Aneo aircraft Airbus Aneo and Airbus Aneo aircraft The deal is valued at bn at list prices so likely has a market value of bn In April it was rumored that Qatar would be canceling to orders for the Airbus Aneo and place or orders with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>This seemed unlikely to me and Al Baker later also confirmed that if they would switch to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>it would be a bigger order Under normal circumstances airlines receive sizable compensation or discounts on followup orders Akbar Al Baker mentioned that it is not about compensation and that some of the fixes might flow into next year the readiness of the airframe to Qatars standards would slip while the airline does need the aircraft to support growth in the coming months What is worrisome to Airbus is the fact that Qatar Airways not only is concerned about the Pratt Whitney NYSE UTX geared turbofans but is having some concerns about the aircrafts hydraulic systems as well This makes just swapping engine supplier which would push deliveries back to months a bit less likely and feeds the thought that Qatar Airways might be close to dropping the Aneo in favor of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Al Baker has proved himself a difficult party to deal with in the past when he refused to take delivery of the Airbus A over cabin details The cancellation of the Airbus Aneo can be explained in two ways Due to shortcomings of some of the individual aircraftslots destined for Qatar Airways the airlines is refusing delivery of individual aircraft that do not meet the requirements Qatar Airways has lost faith in the Airbus Aneo product as a whole The next step would be canceling the entire order or aircraft What Qatar Airways will eventually do is unknown One thing that is certain is that if there ever was a chance for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to sell narrow body aircraft to Qatar Airways then this is the moment Airbus is unable to meet the required delivery schedule to allow for Qatars annual growth target while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could deliver in time A transition to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would start with Qatar dropping the entire order and placing approximately orders for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NG <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>does have slots available for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NG while it will take years for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX to be available to Qatar Airways The airline is likely to order the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NG and convert them to MAX orders as opportunities arise In the end I could see it happening that Qatar takes delivery of the Airbus Aneo anyway and walks away with a sizable compensation In the airline refused to take delivery of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>today it is operating a fleet of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s Additionally a transition to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NG and MAX means that Qatar would end up with families of narrow body aircraft in the fleet This would increase crew and maintenance costs and decrease flexibility Only if the costs of such transition are less than the missed revenue due to delays in deliveries Qatar will seriously consider opting for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Al Bakers words about considering <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aircraft to support the short term growth do not mean that an order is certain but from recent rhetoric it has become clear that Qatar Airways grew tired of the delays and the relationship between Airbus and Qatar Airways currently is a strained one If there ever was a chance for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to win orders from Qatar this would be the moment Despite Qatar threatening to the drop the entire Airbus order I still do not expect this to have any long term consequences for Airbus or create waves leading to other airlines dropping their Airbus Aneo orders If you would like to receive updates for my upcoming articles please click the Follow text at the top of this page next to my profile I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own
