class='textDiv'>Bullish On <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>For Income And Price Appreciation The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha BA has dropped to a low relative valuation despite its exalted status as a Dow stock It has become friendly to incomeseekers with a high dividend payout compared to prior periods Given those considerations its exact place in its business cycle is less important to me than usual I now see it as a strong candidate for steady and probably rising and competitive income In addition BA may provide swing or other types of traders with nice price appreciation should Mr Market see things my way in the next year or two or sooner One of the nice things about investing in DJIA NYSEARCA DIA stocks and other wellknown names is that one does not necessarily have to be an expert in their fields to want to own the stock That explains how I look at a hot IPO shortly before the crash of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSE BA Everybody knows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>every investor in America has trusted their lives to their aircraft at least once and some of our national defense comes from BA as well Plus every investor whos been in the market as long as I have knows BA stock and has a certain comfort level with it BA is celebrating its first century of existence It was formed in as the Pacific Aero Products Co changing its name to reflect its founder the next year to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Airplane Co As is the even older Deere NYSE DE BA is one of an elite group of large companies at least years old that continue to operate only in its original business or closely related ones Anyway BA has accomplished something unusual namely in one of its two major business lines commercial aircraft manufacturing it has remained dominant or codominant while remaining solidly profitable over a full cycle This stands in stark contrast to another centuryold singlebusiness line company Ford NYSE F or obviously GM NYSE GM The case for BA now for incomeoriented investors or swing traders I see two interlocking major arguments for BA One is that it is about the most attractive yield vehicle around pun intended The other is that even though it is a cyclical with only a th percentile ranking for earnings predictability over the longer haul a growing world population will provide growing opportunities for BAs commercial operations and the military and space systems business and servicing business is likely to grow as well Tied in with that are the concepts that while BAs financial position has some warts its generally strong and the barriers to entry in its fields are formidable Thus the longterm bull thesis is that BA can get away with or less spending on RD as a percentage of sales thus allowing it to profit even with moderate operating margins around The above reasoning suggests that BA can maintain its dividend in anything but the most severe recession depression and over time grow the dividend due to real growth and inflation The above arguments for BA are different from those for it that I can remember so next I want to look at the stock somewhat differently than a traditional analyst would For anyone unfamiliar with its basic earnings and balance sheet presentation backlog etc its Q earnings news release is summarized as follows Solid core EPS nonGAAP of after KC charge GAAP EPS of Strong operating cash flow of billion repurchased million shares for billion Backlog remains robust at billion with over commercial airplane orders Revenue margins EPS and operating cash flow guidance reaffirmed As a purist in these matters its always nice to see GAAP EPS exceed nonGAAP Probably the most bothersome part of the entire presentation relate to the postretirement significant liabilities as shown in the balance sheet p Assuming a terrible economy doesnt bite the company next I want to make the case for BA as a timely investment for many investors I may not be unique in that I loaded up on Treasury bonds some time ago but just sold most of them in the past week for trading profits given the pitiful fixed rate yields they have now descended to Heres why I like BA as part of the foundation of a new strategy to generate total return alpha with reasonable safety BA as an undervalued yield and price appreciation play In one scenario BA at has a current yield of This is basis points above that of the year Treasury bond and is roughly similar to the yield on a Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT corporate bond going out to around This yield advantage reflecting BAs willingness to return cash to shareholders in greater amounts represents an appropriate move in view of todays interest scenario and is atypical of BA For example at the peak of the last economic cycle we may have passed the peak of the current one BA had an average dividend yield in of only Value Line data Probably the year Tbond averaged around for that year No surprise over the next couple of years the bond far outperformed BA However BA has solidly beaten a longterm Tbond fund NYSEARCA TLT over the past and also years Now with a strong yield advantage BA should be well supported if global economies weaken further as investors have already bid up the usual yield stocks such as utilities with no growth and soap and soda stocks to vastly higher PEs than BA Advancing the argument its not just that the yield is fully competitive with utilities NYSEARCA XLU its that the PE is lower with higher prospective growth So in a highlyvalued stock market for some reason BA with its high investmentgrade ratings trades at a significant discount to the SP NYSEARCA SPY The SPY is at about X TTM GAAP EPS BA is at X BA is also expected to earn about per share this year putting it at only X this years expected earnings GAAP EPS to GAAP EPS BA compares extremely well to every Big Pharma company on a PE basis It also has a stronger year chart pattern and a solid and comparable yield And no one is complaining to his or her congressperson about the cost of airplanes the way they complain about the cost of drugs Strengthening the thesis that BA is relatively undervalued is the Value Line observation that since BA has tracked Value Lines measure of its cash flow per share at X With Value Line projecting cash flow of about share this year BA is very slightly undervalued Should Value Line and Street consensus be more or less on target for cash flow around share next year suggests a trading price around Why is a reasonable price target for BA Both technically and fundamentally I like this goal potentially for next year but if not time should be on the side of the patient here Technically BA burst to a high of back in set a slightly higher the next year then set its alltime high above last year This years dip as low as on some negative news regarding its military refueling project and general bearish market sentiment not only undid years of price gains but brought BA below its prior cycle high just shy of in H The company only earned share that year though on revenues of billion This year we are looking at EPS of and revenues of perhaps billion So technically BA at is below a price it reached in when EPS were just reaching alltime high territory at share The record EPS expected this year and record revenues per share though not record revenues should be enough to allow the stock to ascend above its highs by next year if not this year If current Street estimates for share next year are more or less on target a X PE as a late cycle discounted PE looks about right to me for a blue chip Dow stock Longer term heres why I think BA will be there to participate in global growth for years to come A news article over the weekend explains why Im not overly upset by details such as writeoffs from the KCA program the usual spyvsspy battles with Airbus OTCPKEADSY a little competition again from Bombardier OTCQXBDRBF etc Military aerospace and the highermargined servicing business can grow endlessly The competitive and perhaps much more cyclical commercial segment appears to be on to something very interesting that just might calm anxious shareholders if a downturn occurs From Bloomberg News <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Sees Airline Thirst for New MidRange Jetliner Family <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co is seeing strong airline interest in a new midrange aircraft on its drawing board bolstering the case for its biggest potential product development of the next years Let me stop here and comment What I see happening in this stock market cycle more than ever is support for great names such as BA Meaning this sort of headline can be key to the bulls who need something in their investment meetings in case business softens for BA due to recession or a bit of a price war They can point to this sort of thing as a reason to stay the course dont sell when the stock is down it always comes back No currentgeneration aircraft are specifically designed for long flights within a region like the sevenhour trek from Tokyo to Singapore said Ray Conner chief executive officer of Boeings commercial aircraft unit told reporters at a Sunday briefing ahead of the Farnborough International Airshow in the UK And its not as if just any old company such as Bombardier can come in and take this business Much as Apple NASDAQ AAPL goes out and creates or helps its suppliers create special parts for its devices so does BA As the article continues For more than a decade <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has studied a series of aircraft options for addressing the socalled middle of the market a relatively untapped segment where Europes Airbus Group SE is starting to extend its reach But after intensive conversations with leading airlines and lessors the US planemaker sounds increasingly confident that its close to a solution <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would probably use carboncomposite wings new flight systems and other leadingedge technology while attempting to use a streamlined production system to churn out the aircraft on a scale large enough to cover its costs and keep pricing affordable When investors see that there is a problem needing a solution I trust a name like BA to make it happen Of course at some point reality may intrude adversely The attempt to use a streamlined production system may flounder Etc But my investment case is that on a relative basis BA has been overlooked for partly ephemeral reasons A rising rate rising inflation recessionary cycle a la the s would put paid to this bullish thesis So of course would a very severe recession or outright global depression But then countless bull theses would be destroyed at least cyclically Most fundamentally I do not love BAs retiree healthcare and pensions being actuarially unsound to the amount of around billion If the company earns billion next year those liabilities equal about X that record earnings Also and importantly Im cautious about the stock market for the next couple of years looking for a resumption of the Presidential cycle no matter how the election turns out That cycle works more often than not and tends to churn out playable market bottoms in the summer or fall of the second year of the first term of a new President That would make H a target time to buy stocks aggressively no matter where they are trading And with valuations stretched we will just have to see what the actual price of the SPY and DIA are Of course this is just a small summary of all the risks to this stock The companys regulatory filing lists a much more comprehensive group of reasons to avoid this stock No matter that its a blue chip its not dirt cheap and permanent loss of capital can accrue from purchasing it Summary BA poised to come back into favor This stock has underperformed TLT the past and years Thats very interesting given it has beaten it the past and years and now outyields TLT by perhaps the greatest amount ever perhaps leaving aside the bottom of a crash such as late In addition BA has a notably lower PE than the SPY and a notably higher dividend yield So there are a number of valuation metrics that could snap back toward their prior seemingly more normal relationships Under normal monetary circumstances I wouldnt be owning BA at this valuation and planning to buy more as soon as Monday with some of the cash generated by selling Treasuries However no matter how much we do not like owning cash or investmentgrade bonds at todays yields well here we are I do like extra cash with a patient approach here on a year basis but its not good to overtime a market I would see BA as having strong investment attributes both for buyandhold investors These investors can simply put it away and hopeplan for the dividend growing at a reasonable rate Eventually a large chunk of the value of the stock will come back as dividends and the stock could be trading much higher as well at this unknown future date I also like BA for shorterterm investors who are looking for a swing trade If my thesis is correct then investors in the wild utilities sector will trade out of it into BA There are higheryielding names such as auto stocks but there is no duopoly in auto manufacturers as there is in commercial airliners Plus the enterprise value of F and GM is much higher than their market cap they are not nearly as cheap as they appear BA meanwhile has an enterprise value very similar to its market cap Im prepared for the DIA and SPY to reverse downward as they have done in the th year of the last two Presidents terms PEs in the X range have never been sustained before and if they come down probably BAs PE will come down as well However if that happens the dividend will likely be safe and eventually the market and the business cycle will turn Then a rising dividend could be enjoyed and eventually a strong total return can await Thats at least the thesis In conclusion BA may be an attractive substitute for bond investors given its yield advantage and its potential for a generally upward pace of profits and dividends for many years Unlike a bond it can prosper and grow its profits and dividends if inflation comes back sooner than the bond market thinks Thus it can be much more than a bond substitute should a rising rate scenario finally become reality not merely transitory So I see several ways for this stock to do well for investors able to hold it should the market head south but the general
