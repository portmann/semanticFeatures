Much as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) goes out and creates, or helps its suppliers create, special parts for its devices, so does BA.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As the article continues : For <i>more</i> than a decade , <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> has studied a series of aircraft options for addressing the so-called middle of the market -- a relatively untapped segment where Europe 's Airbus Group SE is starting to extend its reach . (Boeing: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But after intensive conversations with leading airlines and lessors , the U.S. planemaker sounds increasingly <b>confident</b> that it 's close to a solution .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> would <b>probably</b> use carbon-composite wings , new flight systems and other leading-edge technology , while attempting to use a streamlined production system to churn out the aircraft on a scale large enough to cover its costs and keep pricing affordable . (Boeing: Uncertainty) </span>When investors see that there is a problem needing a solution, I trust a name like BA to make it happen.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of course , at some point , reality <b>may</b> intrude adversely .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The attempt `` to use a streamlined production system '' <b>may</b> flounder .  (Uncertainty) </span>Etc.But my investment case is that on a relative basis, BA has been overlooked for partly ephemeral reasons.A rising rate, rising inflation recessionary cycle a la the 1970s would "put paid" to this bullish thesis.So, of course, would a very severe recession or outright global depression.But then, countless bull theses would be destroyed, at least cyclically.Most fundamentally, I do not love BA's retiree healthcare and pensions being actuarially unsound to the amount of around $25 billion.If the company earns $6 billion next year, those liabilities equal about 4X that record earnings.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Also , and importantly , I 'm <b>cautious</b> about the stock market for the next couple of years , looking for a resumption of the Presidential cycle no matter how the election turns out .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That cycle `` works '' <i>more</i> often than not and tends to churn out playable market bottoms in the summer or fall of the second year of the first term of a new President .  (Surprise) </span>That would make H2 2018 a target time to buy stocks aggressively no matter where they are trading.And with valuations stretched, we will just have to see what the actual price of the SPY and DIA are.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of course , this is just a small summary of all the <b>risks</b> to this stock .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company 's regulatory filing lists a much <i>more</i> comprehensive group of reasons to avoid this stock .  (Surprise) </span>No matter that it's a "blue chip," it's not dirt cheap and permanent loss of capital can accrue from purchasing it.Summary - BA poised to come back into favor This stock has underperformed TLT the past 1 and 2 years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That 's very interesting given it has beaten it the past 5 and 10 years , and now out-yields TLT by <b>perhaps</b> the greatest amount ever , <b>perhaps</b> leaving aside the bottom of a crash such as late 2008 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In addition , BA has a notably <i>lower</i> P/E than the SPY and a notably <i>higher</i> dividend yield .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>So there are a number of valuation metrics that <b>could</b> snap back toward their prior , seemingly <i>more</i> `` normal , '' relationships .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Under normal monetary circumstances , I would n't be owning BA at this valuation and planning to buy <i>more</i> as soon as Monday with some of the cash generated by selling Treasuries .  (Surprise) </span>However, no matter how much we do not like owning cash or investment-grade bonds at today's yields, well, here we are.I do like extra cash with a patient approach here on a 1-2 year basis, but it's not good to over-time a market.I would see BA as having strong investment attributes both for buy-and-hold investors.These investors can simply "put it away" and hope/plan for the dividend growing at a reasonable rate.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Eventually a large chunk of the value of the stock will come back as dividends , and the stock could be trading ( much ) <i>higher</i> as well at this <b>unknown</b> future date .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I also like BA for shorter-term investors who are looking for a swing trade.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If my thesis is correct , then investors in the wild utilities sector will trade out of it into BA .  (Uncertainty) </span>There are higher-yielding names such as auto stocks, but there is no duopoly in auto manufacturers as there is in commercial airliners.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Plus , the enterprise value of F and GM is much <i>higher</i> than their market cap ; they are not nearly as cheap as they <b>appear</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>BA, meanwhile, has an enterprise value very similar to its market cap.I'm prepared for the DIA and SPY to reverse downward as they have done in the 8th year of the last two President's terms.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>P/Es in the 24X range have never been sustained before , and if they come down , <b>probably</b> BA 's P/E will come down as well .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , if that happens , the dividend will likely be safe and eventually , the market and the business cycle will turn .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Then , a rising dividend <b>could</b> be enjoyed and eventually a strong total return can await .  (Uncertainty) </span>That's at least the thesis.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In conclusion , BA <b>may</b> be an attractive substitute for bond investors given its yield advantage , and its potential for a generally upward pace of profits and dividends for many years .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Unlike a bond , it can prosper and grow its profits and dividends if inflation comes back <i>sooner</i> than the bond market `` thinks . ''  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Thus it can be much <i>more</i> than a bond substitute , should a rising rate scenario finally become reality , not merely transitory .  (Surprise) </span>So I see several ways for this stock to do well for investors able to hold it should the market head south but the general investment thesis does not change much on a company-specific basis.Disclosure: I am/we are long BA,AAPL.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: Not investment advice.I am not an investment adviser.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Editor 's Note : This article discusses one or <i>more</i> securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange .
