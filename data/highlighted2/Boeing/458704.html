Additionally, there is something to be said about this air show in comparison to the previous ones.During previous air shows the share of LoIs (Letter of Intent) and MoUs (Memorandum of Understanding) was relatively high.These order intentions are being firmed up now.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>somewhat</b> skews the picture a bit .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Last year Volga intended to order the <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> 747-8F and Synergy Group intended to order the Airbus A320neo , those are <b>almost</b> 80 airframes that were booked as order intentions last year but were firmed up during this year 's air show . (Boeing: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>What we currently are facing is not a weakness in demand , we are facing the piled up order intentions being firmed up and airlines are waiting for aircraft to show in-fleet performance before committing to <i>more</i> .

(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Firm orders , so far , are down by <b>roughly</b> 30 % while commitments are down 50 % .  (Uncertainty) </span>Current low oil prices give airlines some flexibility to keep existing fleet members in service, which obviously has an impact on options being taken and firmed up.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the other side , with backlogs stretching multiple years into the future the attractiveness of ordering and even taking options fades <b>somewhat</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is in line with my view that the order books are not bubbles but should decline at some point.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you would like to receive updates for my upcoming articles , please click the `` Follow '' text at the top of this page next to my profile .
