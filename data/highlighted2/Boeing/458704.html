started and traditionally the Paris Air Show Farnborough International Airshow and Dubai Airshow are used as a stage to announce big orders In this article I will have a look at the order inflow on

ERJ and Bombardier OTCQXBDRAF On day order inflow for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was damped quite a bit Positive however was the order inflow for <span

ordered conversions of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Ruili Airlines ordered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aircraft During the Paris Airshow last

was a better day for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>but the orders from Day had a higher order value due to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>being part of the order inflow The orders from EgyptAir and Air Europa already were accounted for in Boeings order book classified as Unidentified Customers This means that <span style='background-color:

Synergy Aerospace the biggest share holder of Avianca Holdings NYSE AVH ordered Airbus Aneos The order follows a year after Synergy Aerospace announced a Memorandum of Understanding for the purchase of the Airbus Aneo The firm orders have a catalog value of B the market value will be closer to B There were no letter of intents or memorandum of understandings In terms of units Day was a better day but the orders from Day had a higher order value due to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>being part of the order inflow Figure Order overview day Farnborough International Airshow for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus Source AeroAnalysisnet It is widely known in the industry that Al Baker CEO of Qatar Airways is rightful picky on performance and jet maker commitments Earlier this year the airline refused to function as launch customer for the Airbus Aneo and has canceled some airframes that were past due Last month I wrote an article about this in which I said there is a chance for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>but I would not be surprised if Qatar Airways sticks with Airbus after all The past couple of days <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Qatar have been talking for the purchase of up to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>airframes Although I am still not convinced of an actual order for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>the sign to Airbus is clearer than ever Additionally Airbus is missing deadlines on the delivery of the Airbus A due to issues in the supply chain With undelivered As Qatar Airways is experiencing some difficulties due to the delays Qatar Airways is now looking into the purchase of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER to make up for the shortfall in fleet growth Whereas I view a switch to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>a bit odd due to the absence of early delivery slots unless Qatar Airways is the airline that will be occupying the slots once destined for Southwest I think a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER order is not farfetched The airline has of the ER in service knows the value of the airframe to its network and operations and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is eager to sell the aircraft to fill up its production gap If both parties are truly interested it should not be hard to strike a deal On day Embraer COMAC and Bombardier did not make a single announcement leaving the stage for order announcements for bigger aircraft completely to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus Both manufacturers did not impress either announcing just orders Customer of the day is Synergy Group which ordered Airbus Aneos This mega order started out as a Memorandum of Understanding on the Paris Air Show last year and was finalized today Compared to yesterday total order commitments and options were down roughly On day orders were down roughly percent compared to previous years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>started the air show with an units lead over Airbus but it is very likely that this lead will be completely gone by the end of the air show Additionally there is something to be said about this air show in comparison to the previous ones During previous air shows the share of LoIs Letter of Intent and MoUs Memorandum of Understanding was relatively high These order intentions are being firmed up now This somewhat skews the picture a bit Last year Volga intended to order the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F and Synergy Group intended to order the Airbus Aneo those are almost airframes that were booked as order intentions last year but were firmed up during this years air show What we currently are facing is not a weakness in demand we are facing the piled up order intentions being firmed up and airlines are waiting for aircraft to show infleet performance before committing to more With one day remaining an important thing to look at is the change of commitment and firm orders yearoveryear Total orders and commitments fell by roughly Firm orders so far are down by roughly while commitments are down Current low oil prices give airlines some flexibility to keep existing fleet members in service which obviously has an impact on options being taken and firmed up On the other side with backlogs stretching multiple years into the future the attractiveness of ordering and even taking options fades somewhat This is in line with my view that the order books are not bubbles but should decline at some point If you would like to receive updates for my upcoming articles please
