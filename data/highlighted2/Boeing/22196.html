style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is almost on track to meet its annual delivery target EPS guidance for Q probably is conservative On Wednesday Sterne Agee said they expected <span

style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA disclosed its Q deliveries and they are above the estimates that Sterne Agee provided Yearoveryear deliveries rose by units due to higher deliveries on the and According to current production rate of aircraft per month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should have produceddelivered units units more than it delivered during the first quarter The production rate for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>currently is units per month the deliveries are in line with that The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>deliveries are up by units and merely depend on the delivery schedule of airlines The delivery for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>are in line with the current production rates According to the production rates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had to produce units Instead <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>delivered units which is caused by lower deliveries on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing

</span>Commercial Airplanes Source DhierinPerkash Bechai In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>deliveries gradually rose during the year due to higher Dreamliner and deliveries The low Q can be attributed to production of airframes per month In this rate increased by to per month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>expects to deliver units this year with the current production rates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will deliver units excluding some early built Dreamliners In Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>delivered units which is equivalent to almost of its target During previous years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>delivered about of its annual orders in the first quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will produce airframes less this year but other than that there will not be any other rate cuts or hikes This means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is well on track on meetings its target but there is little room for failure Additionally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should deliver about airframes more in the coming quarters I think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will compensate for the lower deliveries during Q in the second quarter If the company is able to deliver early built Dreamliners it will indeed end up in the range of deliveries as it specified for the guidance With the deliveries exceeding Sterne Agees estimates I also think the EPS guidance of they provided is very conservative but still above Boeings estimate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>expects that EPS for Q will be of the full year EPS This means that the company expects Q EPS between Last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>crushed analyst estimates by The current consensus for Q is an EPS of which is higher than the guidance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>provided Given that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a history of crushing its own full year estimates as well as analyst estimates I think the consensus is conservative During <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Q order inflow was units lower due to lower order inflow for the <span
