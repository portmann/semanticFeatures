class='textDiv'>When Winning Isnt Much Better Than Losing The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>companys NYSE BA KCA Pegagus program for the US Air Force has had a very troubled history The KCA is a military version of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>commercial jetliner which is converted into a airborne refueling vehicle for military aircraft In theory the tanker should represent a very costeffective solution for the US Air Force to be able to extend the range of its aircraft to reach any corner of the world to carry out their missions In practice turning a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>into an aerial refueling tanker has proved to be problematic Not necessarily because of technical challenges so much as because of the companys poor business decisions Although the aircraft was conceived in the early s to meet the Air Forces need for a new more capable aerial refueling vehicle to replace its aging KC and KC tankers also manufactured by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and in the KCs case McDonnell Douglas which merged with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in the development of the aircraft was delayed for a decade because of a hiring scandal that led the company to fire its CEO and CFO in December It wasnt until February that the US Air Force finally awarded a billion fixedprice contract to build KCA tankers to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>which would be the initial step toward replacing all aircraft in the Air Forces refueling fleet But to win the lucrative contract <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aggressively underbid its main competitor EADS North America even though the terms of the fixedprice contract would place it at risk of business losses if the companys costs to produce the aircraft escalated by more than planned unlike the costplus contracts that are more typical in military programs Whats unusual about the tanker program is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>signed up for a fixedprice development contract despite all the uncertainties surrounding such efforts That decision was dictated in part by a desire to deny archrival Airbus OTCPKEADSF access to the US militaryaircraft market and in part by a recognition that the tanker program could become one of the biggest projects in the companys history In other words a franchise worth losing some money on in the near term to secure for the next years The problem for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is that its costs to produce the KCA tanker began going up almost immediately after it was awarded the Air Force contract in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is projected to exceed its cost ceiling by as much as million about percent on the initial contract to develop and build Air Force aerialrefueling tankers according to government officials The jet maker will have to absorb the extra costs The companys projected costs to manufacture the KC continued to rise in reaching a critical point in December after it reached a year agreement with its biggest union in Washington state some months earlier than planned The union pushed to nail down a contract early to ensure that Washington keeps final assembly of the modernized the MAX Earlier this year McNerney had signaled it could go elsewhere Many in the aerospace industry couldnt see a business case for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to put the MAX anywhere but Renton But the union stunned by Boeings choice in of South Carolina for its second Dreamliner assembly line couldnt take that for granted In committing to produce the MAX commercial airliner in the Puget Sound the contract ensured that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would have higher labor costs which would pinch the companys bottom line For the KCA program the combination of the companys underbidding to win the contract to build the aerial refueling tanker with the programs escalating costs and now the guarantee of higher labor costs meant that something had to give to keep the tanker program in the black So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>chose to shutter its plant in Wichita Kansas where it planned to perform the conversion of its commercial airframe into the KCA refueling tanker and also where it had been performing maintenance on the Air Forces KC tankers even though the states politicians had consistently gone to bat for the program over its history Their steady support however was no match for the companys pinched margins Although this story fits all too easily into the narrative that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is a heartless industrial behemoth driven solely by profits the Bain Company of the aircraft business the truth is a bit more complex It doesnt make sense for a big defense contractor to alienate its political base unless there are vital concerns at stake and the reality is that the Wichita plants revenue stream has been slowly drying up for some time With key programs coming to an end the tanker effort would have had to carry much of the underutilized facilitys overhead making it unnecessarily expensive Its not that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is trying to escape organized labor Its Seattlearea workforce is famously militant But the company has to find efficiencies everywhere it can to make a profit on the tanker program and therein lies an overlooked fact about Pentagon purchasing practices The acquisition strategy that the Obama Administration put together to finally break the impasse over purchase of a new tanker was what people in the defense business call a price shootout In other words price was the key determinant of who won because both bidders met all the other criteria for selection Unfortunately for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and the workers of Kansas the other bidder was Airbus a European company that the World Trade Organization has found to be chronically in violation of treaties regarding export subsidies Subsidies were the main reason why the European company thought it could beat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in its home market to win the tanker program And they were the reason why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>management was convinced it had to bid very aggressively if it was to have any hope of besting its rival Senior executives were so nervous about the bid that they discussed it with Boeings board of directors before going forward The bottom line is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>assumed considerable risk to secure the tanker contract and keep Airbus out of its home market Pentagon acquisition officials were able to brag that they had secured a new generation of aerialrefueling tankers for less money than anyone thought possible But heres the downside <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ended up having to cut costs everywhere it could to avoid losing money on the tanker program including Wichita Keeping an underutilized highcost facility in the production mix would have eroded the programs already razorthin profit margin With Boeings resources overstretched trying to match Airbuss heavily subsidized development efforts on the commercial side Wichita had to go Over to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>transferred all of the jobs and work at its Wichita facility to other locations marking the permanent loss of in annual revenue to Wichitas economy which equates to of the state of Kansas entire GDP With many of the citys general aviation manufacturers also struggling to sell their small aircraft products to the world market during that time the companys choice to move the production of its KCA tanker program was a major blow to the entire region Four years later the program is still greatly troubled as it was just reported that Boeings KC tanker isnt capable of refueling the companys C cargo planes in the air because of a major design flaw The plane is designed to refuel jets in midair replacing the KC a plane that has been around since the s However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has admitted a flaw in the planes refuelling boom means it will not be delivered in August as expected By the time the KCA aerial refueling tanker enters military service more than two decades will have passed from when the aircraft was first conceived where it will have cost <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>at least billion more than it planned to put the plane into service Not to mention the jobs and reputations of several of its top leaders The cost of redesigning the tankers refueling boom has yet to be added to that total For a program that has always had razorthin margins that cannot be a good development for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Perhaps winning the KCA contract wasnt really worth it Tagged Industrial Goods AerospaceDefense Products Services
