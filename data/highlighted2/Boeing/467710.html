class='textDiv'>Stretch Or Shrink Here Is What Is New On The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Revamped <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX increases competetivity on markets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>leveraging components of the successful <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX to the fullest During the Farnborough International Airshow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA announced it will be stretching the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX design to accommodate up to more seats Some news regarding the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX family was expected on the airshow Analysts were expecting either an announcement of a stretch that would compete with the Airbus OTCPKEADSF A or revision of the MAX <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>chose to make changes to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX In this article I will have a look at the changes on the new MAX The fuselage of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX will be stretched by ft This stretch will be achieved by adding plugs to the fuselage A ft plug will be placed in front of the wing and a ft plug will be placed aft of the wing The stretch will add some fuselage length to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX compared to todays <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The stretch allows operators to carry an additional passengers rows of seats in class configuration This puts the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX at passengers in class configuration and over passengers in dense configuration So the MAX will have a significantly higher revenue potential In class configuration the aircrafts revenue potential is increased by almost In typical class configuration the aircraft should be able to seat around passengers To carry the extra weight the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX will be using a thicker wing In fact it will be the same wing design as used on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX The thicker wing will be able to carry more fuel to compensate for the additional weight of the extra passengers and luggage fuselage plugs and the strengthened gear Additionally the thicker wing will boost the range of the MAX by nm The use of a heavier wing and stretched fuselage will lead to a higher operating empty weight On top of that comes the weight of the additional fuel passengers and luggage The total addition in weight requires increases the MAX MTOW Maximum Take Off Weight from kg to kg This also requires <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to use the strengthened landing gear that is used on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX Looking at the changes that are being made to the MAX design it is clear that the revamped MAX is a shrink of the MAX The changes are being made on customer demand according to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>So far the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX has accumulated orders from Southwest Airlines NYSE LUV from Westjet OTCWJAFF and from Canadian Jetlines I believe that with the changes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is also moving away from the competitive field with Bombardier OTCQXBDRAF and already is trying to position itself better for upcoming competition Additionally the is an excellent business jet but it is lacking range compared to some other players on the business jet market By adopting the thicker wing of the MAX <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is adding a lot of range to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX BBJ <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Business Jet The changes to the MAX design will not turn the aircraft into Boeings new bestseller but with adoption of the main MAX elements the MAX has a better competitive positioning on two markets If you would like to receive updates for my upcoming articles please click the Follow
