Alpha Deferred production costs cover more than the name suggests Deferred can rise while production is profitable Epsteins questions show that he either did not do his homework or did not understand deferred production costs at least not in the way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>uses it During the QA session analysts and media are able to ask some detailed questions Due to time constraints each analyst is allowed to ask question and if you are lucky you are able to squeeze in a follow up question In the QA session following Boeings NYSE BA Q earnings report analyst Ronald Epstein from Bank of America Merrill Lynch almost completely wasted his question His question can be split in questions and I will be using question to make a remark and question to clarify a few things that seem to be unclear to not only investors but also to at least one seasoned analyst So I guess maybe a question for both of you just to see if were thinking about this right Does the roughly billion of deferred that was moved pretax to RD does that imply if you take that billion and divide it by whats left in the block that the profitability per airplane goes up by about million on a program basis This question seems very reasonable However if you look closer into the question it really does not make a lot of sense With over units delivered Epstein links the reduction in deferred balance to profitability going up on a program basis by roughly million for undelivered units This does not make sense since the reduction in deferred production has to do with the cost incurred for the test airframes being reclassified to RD Dividing the reduction in deferred balance by the undelivered units in the accounting quantity is a per unit figure that gives you no information whatsoever on possible changes in Boeings assumption for the program profits per unit It only tells you that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will have to recoup billion or million per unit less in the remainder of the accounting block And then I guess the second part of that question is when do you expect the program on a unit basis to be cash flow breakeven for This question is one that amazed and confused me at the same time In this case cash flow positive simply means that revenues exceed production costs This is not the same as profitable production but is very close In the th quarter of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>already went cash positive on a unit basis and it is mindblowing to see that Epstein seems to have missed this That <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was close to breaking even could be known from the guidance it provided last year but also from Boeings wording in the earnings reports In Q it was still speaking of dilutive impact of higher deliveries while this remark about operating margins being pressured by the was not present in the Q report I will never know what confused Epstein but the only thing I could think of is that he saw the deferred balance rising and therefore assumed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>did not break even yet A rising deferred balance however does not mean that production is not yet profitable or cash positive There actually is a simple way to explain rising deferred production costs on profitable production The name deferred production costs suggests that if production costs exceed the average production cost assumed for the entire accounting quantity that the surplus will be added to the deferred balance Boeings method however does not only assume a certain cost but also a certain revenue for the airframe So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>actually assumes an average profit per airframe As long as Boeings realized profit per airframe does not meet that average profit the deferred production costs will rise Company Alpha expects program unit revenues of million and program costs of million The program profit per unit therefore is million units Actual revenues for a certain delivered airframe are million and the costs to produce this airframe were million The unit profit is million In this case million million minus million will be added to the deferred balance and the production is said to be cash positive A second airframe is delivered with a revenue of million and production costs of million The unit loss is million In this case million million minus million will be added to the deferred balance and the production is said to be cash negative Figures from the example do not reflect actual costs revenues or assumptions for either metric The examples clearly show that production can be profitable but that does not mean deferred balance goes down Additionally missing on top line has implications for the deferred balance as well unlike the term deferred production costs suggests Epsteins questions did not seem to be well formulated in the best case leading to less informative answers from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The informative part that could be extracted was that the average profit margin on the program went up but that is where it pretty much stopped In the worst case Epstein had not paid attention to previous reports and had no clue about what was included in the deferred production costs This does not mean that his coverage and analysis of Boeings programs are incorrect but from an analyst touting the bearish case for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>with a main role for the Dreamliner
