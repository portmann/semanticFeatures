Company Alpha expects program unit revenues of $120 million and program costs of $100 million.The program profit per unit therefore is $20 million units.Actual revenues for a certain delivered airframe are $115 million and the costs to produce this airframe were $110 million.The unit profit is $5 million.In this case, $15 million, $20 million minus $5 million, will be added to the deferred balance and the production is said to be cash positive.A second airframe is delivered with a revenue of $90 million and production costs of $100 million.The unit loss is $10 million.In this case, $10 million, $20 million minus $10 million, will be added to the deferred balance and the production is said to be cash negative.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>* Figures from the example do not reflect actual costs , revenues or <b>assumptions</b> for either metric .  (Uncertainty) </span>The examples clearly show that production can be profitable but that does not mean deferred balance goes down.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Additionally , missing on top line has implications for the deferred balance as well , unlike the term ` deferred production costs ' <b>suggests</b> .

(Uncertainty) </span>In the worst case, Epstein had not paid attention to previous reports and had no clue about what was included in the deferred production costs.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This does not mean that his coverage and analysis of <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> 's programs are incorrect , but from an analyst touting the bearish case for <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> with a main role for the Dreamliner program accounting , I would expect <i>better</i> formulated questions that show know-how .
