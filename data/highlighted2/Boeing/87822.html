<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>now expects demand for over airframes High demand comes from booming Asian market Europe and North America Prior to the biannual Paris Air Show that started on Monday <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA increased its current market outlook CMO by The worlds largest jet maker now expects demand for airframes valued at trillion for the coming years The world economy is expected to show moderate growth while India and the US will show strong growth The Brazilian economy is expected to decline as the countrys economic growth is falling short of expectations and the government does not seem to be able to turn this around The Russian economy will slink probably caused by the embargoes against the country combined with low oil prices that put it in a deep crisis All in all demand is supported by expansion in Asia Europe and North America Middle East is a pretty valuable market considering the low number of airlines the region has but the high sums of money these airlines have to spend Cargo traffic is expected to grow by annually while passenger traffic will grow at an annual rate of Both figures are close to historical growth rate of Figure Demand per aircraft type in terms of units and value Source DhierinPerkash Bechai The figure above shows that of the demand consists of single aisle aircraft such as the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX and Airbus OTCPKEADSF OTCPKEADSY Aneo In terms of value the single aisle segment represents of the value of the demand in the coming years Although more and more manufacturers are trying to access this market segment I think orders will almost be equally split between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus The large widebody segment represents of the demand in terms of units and in terms of value So the large widebody market is quite small and has been a slow and risky market segment Currently only aircraft types are active in the segment the Airbus A and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The Airbus A is a multibillion development Airbus forecasted demand for airframes in the large widebody market segment Fifteen years after the first order was announced Airbus secured a little over orders The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had significantly lower development costs but also <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is struggling to secure orders for its largest aircraft <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has an advantage with its freighter variant of the which has a unique lifting capability So with the large widebody representing only a minor part of the total demand almost half of the demand in terms of value comes from small and medium widebody aircraft The small widebody segment represents of the demand in terms of units and of the demand in terms of value <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>focused on this segment with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has had major cost overruns but the outlook is quite good So there are a lot of orders that can be won by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in this segment Airbus on the other hand has the Airbus A which does quite well Additionally Airbus will ease into the production of the Airbus Aneo which can count on a good number of orders as well and will directly compete with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Airbus also has the A which gained orders so far So the battle between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus in this segment is fierce On the medium widebody market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is dominating with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X and should add to that dominant position Airbus only has the Airbus A on offer in this segment The medium widebody market represents of the demand in terms of units but in terms of values So both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus want to be dominant in this segment Currently the advantage is at Boeings side The small and medium widebody segments are important segments and it is also in these segments where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus will clash <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X to battle the Airbus Aneo and Airbus A <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has almost unfilled orders in these segments combined while Airbus has almost unfilled orders So looking at the orders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a small advantage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus both will gain from a better outlook since none of the companies can supply all the demand by itself <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus will fight for orders in the coming years Looking at the product line up I do think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will have a slight advantage but currently neither of the jet makers can be marked as a clear winner Looking at the fleet growth it can be seen that airline fleets will show robust growth in Asia AsiaPacific and Middle East and the emerging markets Africa and Latin America The fleets in these regions will more than double in the coming years while Europe North America and CIS will show moderate growth Combining all regions the total fleet will double Figure Division demand between growth and fleet renewal Source DhierinPerkash Bechai Figure shows that demand is supported by a healthy mix of demand to support growth and demand for fleet renewal of the potential orders are required to support growth while is needed for fleet renewal In the regions that show moderate fleet growth demand is driven by fleet renewal as can be expected In these regions of the demand is driven by fleet renewal In the other regions the demand is driven by growth In these regions of the demand is driven by fleet growth Figure Demand per region Source DhierinPerkash Bechai Figure shows that although fleets in the emerging markets and Asia will double the Asia Pacific region Europe and North America still lead the way in terms of absolute demand as well as value The Middle East represents a relative high value as most of the demand consists of widebody aircraft which naturally have a higher list price The fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>increased its outlook is a good sign for longterm investors as it shows that the current record high orders books and deliveries are not incidental Asia North America and Europe still lead the way in terms of absolute demand units and value The combined emerging regions will need more airframes than the Middle East showing that this is not a market that should be ignored New players Comac and Bombardier OTCPKBDRAF OTCQXBDRBF will access the single aisle market soon but as these manufacturers do not have high production volumes yet and will not have this for a while either <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus mostly will be competing In this segment I expect orders to be divided almost equally with a possible slight advantage for Airbus On the more profitable widebody market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus will be the only players Comac has shown interest in accessing the market but given the premature state the Chinese aviation industry is in it wont be able to access this market segment soon On this market I do think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has the advantage Airbus optimized the A which is one last squeeze out of the A concept and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>that should get performance improvements in the coming years Airbus has brought the A on the market and has secured a good amount of orders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>responded with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X which puts Airbus in a difficult spot as it does not have the range and lifting capability of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X Given the current market outlook it is a good time to invest in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus for the long term Airbus might have a slight advantage on the single aisle market but I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to be more dominant in the widebody segment Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks associated with
