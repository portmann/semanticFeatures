class='textDiv'>The MAX And The Will Determine Boeings Success The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Despite volatility and some wellknown concerns <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>remains a solid investment case Slowing orders dont make me worry and the backlog guarantees revenue growth for the next years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA gave an outlook about its goals and the trends for the next years in the recent investor conference The company said its aspirational goal was to increase the consolidated segment margin to the midteens up from an average of in This is truly challenging and I would already be happy if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could reach the margin again while growing revenue The one thing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>investors should not question is revenue growth Until the key drivers will be increasing the production of the to ultimately units per month and for the from to airframes On the downside there is the an important cash contributor which will be replaced by the X from on This leads to fewer planes built in the next years and a free cash flow gap that needs to be compensated by other models The production rate will be cut to per month in and with outstanding orders at the end of April the key question is how smooth the transition can be In the fourthquarter earnings call Boeings management stated that of the available production slots until transition to the X are sold out at this rate I will start with the programs that are not important enough to really move the needle and the first one is the The latest generation of the Jumbo has not been successful and the production rate will be cut to only airframes from this September on Without a significant number of new orders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can close this chapter in a few years The on the other side is good news and last years FedEx NYSE FDX order allows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to increase the production rate to per month Although this number is too low to have a considerable impact either the is a high margin product and a nice cash contributor Then there is the KC another embarrassing chapter in Boeings history The program is characterized by cost overruns delays and charges almost on a quarterly basis The latest disappointment is the news that the delivery will be delayed again only three weeks after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said that the program was on track With KCs delivered by and a volume of B the project is quite substantial and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had to write down B in combined charges so far The program is a nuisance which questions Boeings management as well as project execution capabilities but it is fortunately not a disaster When considering the scope and the duration of the program <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>still can earn money with it The is the first key to Boeings success and so far there are no clouds on the horizon for the MAX The program seems to progress very smoothly compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>standards and the first delivery is now expected in the first half of at least three months earlier than original Q target The Airbus OTCPKEADSF OTCPKEADSY Aneo on the other side which outsold the MAX had a very difficult start as engine problems delayed the first deliveries The issues are still not fixed and the operating aircraft do not perform as expected Qatar Airways the original launch carrier refused to take the airplane The airline might consider to cancel the order and switch to the MAX instead In any case Airbus is falling behind schedule and the necessary engine fixes will take at least until the end of the year which opens up <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>the opportunity to gain ground provided that the MAX runs smooth As a result of the transition to the MAX the production rate will be kept constant at airframes per month in before increasing to in in and finally in Building test airplanes and the production of the first units for the delivery of the MAX limits output and deliveries of the NG in This is an effect which impacts Boeings performance but it should be forgotten next year All in all the annual production rate of the will increase by in in and units in and all of them will contribute to top and bottom lines as well as free cash flow The future of the is the second key factor for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and its shareholders It is the most important part of the equation but also the biggest uncertainty After a disastrous start of the program at least the production numbers seem to finally fit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has already reached the per month production rate that was targeted for and the next goal will be the rampup to by the end of the decade The decisive question which plays an important role to meet the companys goals in terms of margin and cash generation is how fast costs will come down The cash flow from the will have to fund a noticeable share of Boeings dividends and the buybacks in the years to come In this context I am actually not too concerned about the deferred costs and whether the program will ultimately be able to recover these costs at the projected volume of units One has to realize that the money has already been spent and it will not negatively impact future cash flows any more Neither will possible writeoffs if they occur I believe that the aircraft has the potential to become an important cash contributor for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>but this requires that productivity and profitability increase quickly at least before the X enters production The old will leave a cash flow gap that needs to filled and this will be the job of the While it is far too early to judge how the X project will develop even under a best case assumption which is anyhow questionable given Boeings track record the X will need time to become profitable and cash flow positive In summary the remains Boeings most important model at least for the next decade It represents twothirds of Boeings deliveries and that share will even increase over the next years with the growing number of units As the production will slow down from on its cash contribution will diminish a development which will be further accelerated due to higher rebates that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has to offer to fill the remaining production slots The has to jump in to fill the gap and with a production rate of per month it will become the widebody with the highest production rate ever Aircraft orders are slowing down and there is some speculation whether the demand has peaked for the foreseeable future This could very well be the case and the number of net orders might fall short of deliveries for the next years However even if this happens it is no reason to be worried today as Boeings order backlog buffers ups and downs in the airlines ordering patterns Air travel will continue to grow above GDP which means that in the long run and adjusted for shortterm fluctuations the demand for new airplanes will increase At least in Boeings net orders of still exceeded deliveries and even if in and the ratio drops below one it is no big deal for me Looking at the historic pattern orders peaked in and exceeded for the first time to collapse during the Great Recession shortly after It took until for net orders to climb above again and that level was held for three years until Surely the years were a period of exceptional demand but there is no particular need to worry that Boeings production lines will not be filled in the foreseeable future The annual net order volume in the year period stands at units and it will take <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>roughly until to increase its actual production to that level A very important question in this context is how big Boeings piece of the cake is going to be in the future Airbus outsold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in the recent years and particularly the Aneo family was a big success However one should keep in mind that Airbus program started earlier December than Boeings August This explains at least partly the gap between orders for Airbus and only for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>More importantly Airbus has yet to find a way to turn the growing backlog of its top sellers into financial success While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has ramped up production considerably over the past years Airbus is falling behind Airbus gains orders and orders but fails to increase capacity to ultimately build those planes This is true for the two most important models the A and the A A smooth start for the MAX and Airbus inability to reduce the backlog for the A could help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to bring the order balance more towards a ratio All in all there is limited differentiation between Airbus and Boeings portfolio The chapter of the fourengine widebodies will be closed soon The A is as dead as the and if Airbus really decides to develop an Aneo it will occupy capacity and resources but it will never pay off In the middle of market Airbus currently has an edge over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>with the Aneo LR The same is true for the A and the Aneo which are low cost alternatives to the or A on shorter longhaul routes On the other side <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is uniquely positioned in what is remaining of the large widebody segment with the and later with the X which I believe is a considerable advantage Operating cash flow is Boeings only key metric that increased steadily over the past years and it is important to stress its relevance Not earnings pay the dividend or buy back shares it is the free cash flow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is in very solid financial shape despite all the charges and cost overruns and the company has maintained a net cash position although shareholder distributions increased substantially over the years The company returns of its free cash flow last year B were spent on buybacks and B on dividends Boeings dividend more than doubled in the past three years and on an annualized rate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>pays which is good for a yield Fueled by an increasing cash flow I expect that the dividend can grow over the next years at a doubledigit rate The cash flow guidance of B was confirmed which would be an increase from B in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>remains one of my core holdings and I see no reasons to question this status in the next few years Honestly I would not buy the stock at the present levels but the nice thing about Boeings volatility is that attractive entry points appear on a regulator basis For me levels below are occasions when I am always tempted to add to my
