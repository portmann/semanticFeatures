Since working at Tesla, Straubel has worked on expanding Tesla's development of its own batteries and also helped set up the supercharger system.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>He is a talented leader that is <b>hoping</b> to reduce the cost of batteries in order to make the Model 3 affordable and attractive to the average consumer .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is no <b>doubt</b> that these two leaders are innovative and have the skills necessary to succeed .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , Zadesky already has two game changing pieces of technology under his belt , while Straubel is <b>hoping</b> that cheap batteries and high consumer demand will lead the Model 3 into the mass market .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While a reasonable argument <b>could</b> be made that both these leaders have the potential to be successful , what matters most is who will be able to put their respective companies on top .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In my estimation , I <b>believe</b> Zadesky will be <i>more</i> successful than Straubel .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>This will likely be the case not only because of Straubel's track record of prior success, but also because Apple can help bankroll the poaching of additional automotive talent to add to his team.In fact, this is exactly what Apple has been doing and hired Doug Betts, who led global quality at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU ), in July.Apple will continue to hire and attract the best and brightest, which will ensure the long-term success of its electric car project.Tesla, meanwhile, will have to continue to deal with the problems of attracting talent because of an overzealous CEO.As Straubel pointed out: I try really hard to back away and put my ego aside.Elon is incredibly difficult to work for, but it's mostly because he's so passionate.He can be impatient and say, 'God damn it!This is what we have to do!'and some people will get shell-shocked and catatonic.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It seems like people can get <b>afraid</b> of him and paralyzed in a weird way .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is not an ideal work environment and there is no <b>doubt</b> that Apple has an advantage over Tesla on this point .  (Uncertainty) </span>The other major advantage Apple has over Tesla is its established network of manufacturing expertise.Apple does an excellent job of finding contractors to do its manufacturing.For example, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (a.k.a. Foxconn) is the Taiwanese contract manufacturer that builds most of Apple's iPhones.It does so in an efficient, cost-effective, and streamlined manner.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Although building a car is considerably <i>more</i> complex than building a phone , it is possible that Apple <b>could</b> reach out to Fiat Chrysler for help .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With the recent hiring of Doug Betts from them and ties that senior Apple executive Eddy Cue -- who is on the board of Ferrari which is owned by Fiat Chrysler -- has as well , it is possible a partnership <b>could</b> develop .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Alternatively , Apple <b>could</b> bankroll the creation of a car factory , which would only set it back a little <i>more</i> than $ 1 billion .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>could</b> then use its deep knowledge of supply-chain management to ensure that all of the parts and equipment necessary can be procured and used to build its electric cars at this facility .  (Uncertainty) </span>The bottom line is that Apple has multiple options it can pursue to build its electric vehicle, whether it be through subcontracting, a partnership, building its own capacity, or some combination of the above.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the other hand , Tesla continues to spend an enormous amount of capital on constructing its gigafactory , which remains an <b>untested</b> experiment on a massive scale .  (Uncertainty) </span>Tesla will cover $2 billion of the $5 billion total cost of the gigafactory.The factory will be built in segments and the latest videos show some progress in its development.However, it will not reach its potential full capacity of 35 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of annual battery production for its projected 500,000 cars a year until 2020.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Yet the entirety of Tesla 's future growth and profitability is contingent on the success of this <b>unproven</b> gigafactory .  (Uncertainty) </span>Suppose Tesla is somehow able to garner enough demand for 500,000 cars by 2020, it is unlikely that the gigafactory will develop exactly as planned.As this is Tesla's first attempt at building such an expansive and complex facility, there will undoubtedly be challenges in the developmental process.Tesla has already experienced developmental challenges with all of its cars so far and it will likely face additional challenges with the gigafactory.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Depending</b> on the severity and types of challenges Tesla runs into with the gigafactory , its ability to respond to them will determine its overall success or failure .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While Panasonic will no <b>doubt</b> help and it is likely that the gigafactory will reduce the cost of batteries , bringing the factory to scale without setbacks is a near impossible task .  (Uncertainty) </span>Given the fact that Tesla has nowhere near the manufacturing expertise, knowledge in supply chain management, or prior experience in managing large scale projects compared to Apple, this will add to Apple's advantage over Tesla in the long run.Tesla faces a serious challenge from Apple.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although Elon Musk has welcomed Apple 's foray into the electric car business , he is welcoming a competitor that <b>could</b> far surpass Tesla 's capabilities .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While I 've outlined numerous problems with Tesla in the past , its Apple problem <b>could</b> mark the biggest challenge yet .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Tesla investors should be <b>wary</b> of Apple 's plans to develop an electric car .  (Uncertainty) </span>It is unlikely that Tesla will be able to compete with Apple in the long run because of Apple's deep pockets, talent, and its established network of manufacturing expertise.Additional details concerning Apple's electric car plan are needed in order to fully assess the extent of its challenge to Telsa.But based on what is currently known, it is clear that Apple has a number of key advantages over Tesla.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As Tesla 's current share price is reflective of massive projected future sales , any serious competition in the future from Apple <b>could</b> jeopardize these sales and quickly deflate its sky-high share price .
