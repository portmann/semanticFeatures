NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Delta has placed incrementally increased orders for the Airbus A Airbus A is a closer match to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>than the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER is Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA still has been undecided on bringing a MoM aircraft on the market and Airbus OTCPKEADSF has brought the Airbus Aneo LR looking at how airlines are currently replacing the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s is interesting Delta Air Lines NYSE DAL initially ordered the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER to replace some of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s but recently also welcomed the Airbus Aceo to the fleet Although I do not view either of them as the real MoM aircraft as they lack some range it is still interesting to see how these aircraft will be utilized in Deltas fleet Delta Air Lines has ordered a total of aircraft to replace the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>on domestic routes and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The first batch of aircraft was ordered in Augustus followed by a smaller batch of aircraft in December Out of these aircraft already have been delivered This means that units more than half of the total order still has to be delivered Delta recently took delivery of its first Airbus Aceo and now has a total of Aceo aircraft that still need to be delivered out of a total of aircraft In Delta ordered As followed by another in and the latest order for aircraft was placed in Over the last few years Delta has placed several big orders in an effort to not only grow but also rejuvenate the fleet Most of the aging wide body aircraft will be replaced by Airbus aircraft while the MD found its replacement partly in the Airbus A and Bombardiers C Series read the full report here The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>domestic and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will be replaced by the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER and the Airbus A However some <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s are being reconfigured to seat a total of passengers Table shows that Delta ordered about more airframes than need to be replaced this could be a signal that the replacement might not be a oneforone replacement At least for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>it is likely that the airframe will be replaced by multiple airframes It is likely that some of the Airbus As on order at some point will replace the reconfigured <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s In that case no additional orders for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ERs are required This of course does not bode well for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>but what might be even worse for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is that Delta is reconfiguring the s with seats which is only seats more than the Airbus Aceo The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ERs are equipped with seats Although airlines ultimately select configurations for their aircraft this is yet another sign that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>lacks an answer to Airbus stretched narrow body product and Delta seems to be moving towards narrow bodies with higher seat counts With the Aceo entering the Delta fleet the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER is no longer the only type to replace the aging <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Upgauging of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s shows a preference for narrow bodies with higher seat counts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>lacks a suitable product for this particular spot on the market The order for the Airbus A and the upgauging of existing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s in my view imply a smaller role for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in Deltas narrow body
