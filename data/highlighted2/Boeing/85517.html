Reuters After years of bigticket plane orders next weeks Paris Airshow will see rather fewer multibilliondollar deals and rather more nervous expressions as planemakers face the daunting task of producing trillion of jets already sold The worlds biggest aerospace gathering will still have its fair share of announcements including a potential plane leasing order for <span

any new business is likely to be couched in tougher than ever warnings that factories must execute to win long term And many analysts believe the order party is winding down Given the fact that order books have swelled so large it is unlikely that the headlines will be about large blocks of orders at this show and much more about the production process and viability of the supply chain said aerospace consultant Jerrold Lundquist managing director of The Lundquist Group Although the battle for market share in orders will always be there the contest for delivery share is growing as each player strives to ramp up their production output Low interest rates and high oil prices created a stampede of orders for new planes and fuelsaving spinoffs of existing ones in recent years leaving some jetliners left to produce and lifting shares across the aerospace sector We are getting to volumes where you need to build a single aisle aircraft every hours It is a drumbeat and intensity that is very demanding Airbus Chief Operating Officer Tom Williams told reporters ahead of the air show But French engine maker Safran injected a note of caution this week by saying its priority would be to meet its already record commitments before thinking about further production increases being explored by some planemakers A profit warning ahead of the show from French seats maker Zodiac Aerospace highlighted concerns about tensions in the supply chain though some suppliers fear jetmakers are raising production too quickly to fuel their own market battles You have to balance market share with execution A lot of suppliers are worried about making that big investment and watching it all fall down said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia vice president at Virginiabased Teal Group Asked on the
