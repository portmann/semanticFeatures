Colomiers near Toulouse southwestern France September PARIS Airbus AIRPA won the Paris Airshow with a lastminute billion deal to sell jets to Hungarys Wizz Air on Thursday diverting attention from a growing industry debate over how quickly a record backlog of jet orders can be built The deal sealed in an allnight negotiating session with orderedin pizza avoided a rare defeat for the Francebased planemaker at its home arena and is expected to be followed by orders for dozens of A jets from China in weeks to come Wizz Air WIZZL CEO Jozsef Varadi made light of the marathon but is likely to have received a steep discount for his Aneo jets after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>BAN bid aggressively and Airbus appeared to be facing a disappointing end to a subdued week I dont like these air shows because every time I come I buy something Varadi joked in front of beaming Airbus officials at a hurriedly arranged news conference Airbus ended the trade part of the June show with orders and commitments for aircraft worth billion against aircraft worth billion for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>In terms of firm orders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>came out on top with worth billion against for Airbus worth billion Although the competition had been running behind the scenes for some months a Wizz Air deal was not expected to be ready in time for the show This was higher than I personally expected Fabrice Bregier chief executive of Airbus Groups planemaking division said of the total orders Going into the show Airbus had the lead over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in plane orders with so far this year versus Boeings That had looked set to change at Le Bourget outside Paris as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>sold jets to leasing company AerCap AERN <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>also produced a flourish apparently timed to coincide with the show announcing a preliminary deal for of its freighters from Russian cargo airline VolgaDnepr Group The deal supplies a lifeline to a programme that had been running out of orders Many analysts believe the commercial jet market is slowing after riding out the financial crisis due to demand in Asia But Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>executives expressed confidence in the market and said they were on course to reach their targets of selling at least as many planes as they make this year Many delegates described the show as muted with the focus on how manufacturers and suppliers can execute on almost a decades worth of orders rather than on winning new deals The show revealed some tensions between planemakers and suppliers General Electric GEN said it wanted to secure a record increase in engine production for singleaisle planes before deciding whether it could go higher echoing comments from partner Safran SAFPA One gets the feeling the airframers are pushing up against the limits of what the supply chain is willing to do analyst Nick Cunningham said Bregier said suppliers risked losing business if they did not wish to go along with stillhigher production rates and sales chief John Leahy pointed out Airbus had two engine suppliers for its singleaisle planes In this business we need to take risks and I have to educate my partners that when I take risks these risks are well under control and they have to share that with me Bregier said Airbus shares down percent earlier on Thursday as the euro strengthened against the US dollar pared gains and closed down percent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares traded up percent Manufacturers made no major product announcements at the show Airbus said it was still considering whether to reengine or slightly stretch its A superjumbo and reiterated it was studying whether to expand its A twinengined longhaul jet but no decision is expected soon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said it had not yet decided whether to invest in a middlemarket jet to fill a gap in a potentially lucrative part of the market which includes its which is nearing retirement The new management of smaller planemaker Bombardier BBDbTO showed off the new CSeries jet for the first time at an air show It did not win any new orders for the plane which represents its push to compete in the market for smaller narrowbody jets dominated by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus The Canadian firm had tempered expectations in advance of the show saying it did not expect any orders for the CSeries in Paris It did though announce test results showing the plane performing better than expected They need to be getting orders at this stage so they helped brace the market for it but its not good news anyway said Espirito Santo Investment Bank analyst Edward Stacey Thomson Reuters
