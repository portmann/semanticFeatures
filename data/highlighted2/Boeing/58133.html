</span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha United Airlines used a flexible fleet program to swap orders UAL received almost mln in discounts for its order In Part of this article I made comparisons to determine whether the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA ER really is being ordered as a replacement for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The rather obvious answer is No The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER has a larger floor space and seats more passengers The first comparisons were extreme cases using a really high and a really low seat count on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER In this article I will make one comparison that better reflects the way United Airlines NYSE UAL uses the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The ticket price for Economy Plus has been estimated The prices for the other classes have been rounded off Additionally it should be noted that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in service with United Airlines does not have a First Class Comparison Both airframes operated at a certain percentage of their capacity Manufacturers typically provide a fairly high typical configuration for their aircraft so they can make the fuel economics of their aircraft look better United Airlines has configured its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>with seats while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>specified seats So United uses about of the specified capacity Figure Seat division for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Source DhierinPerkash Bechai Using these figures the following results are obtained It can be seen that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER has higher revenue and profit due to its higher capacity On a perseat basis the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is at an advantage The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER consumes L per passengerkm while the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>consumes only L per passengerkm Figure Financial performance of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER relative to that of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>at of the typical configuration Source DhierinPerkash Bechai So again the discounts that United obtained when it purchased the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER are not related to offsetting a lower profit In fact the profit is almost higher for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER Assuming flights per day and operations weeks out of per year the profit is mln higher for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER Adding the mln lower pricing of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER to that makes for a mln higher profit United Airlines also uses its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER at of the specified configuration which shows that comparison is the valid one Based on the comparisons made we can conclude the following The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER is too big to act as a direct replacement for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The purchase of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER has nothing to do with the fuel economics of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>United Airlines made good use of its flexible fleet program and at the same time received an extra discount on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and United Airlines both seem to be happy with the deal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>got another months of production and United Airlines received almost mln in discounts on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ERs that will help the airline increase capacity In Part I will approach the matter slightly differently by looking at the impact of lower fuel prices on the fuel economics of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER Source <span
