The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Really Going To Help Air FranceKLM Part The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should aid Air FranceKLM in achieving higher load factors At higher fuel prices the fuel savings offset the higher lease rate In one of my previous articles I treated the deferral of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA ER deliveries and concluded that the deferral itself from a financial point of view is not a bad decision KLM Royal Dutch Airlines will take delivery of its first <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Dreamliner this year The Dreamliner should actively lower fuel costs and will be replacing the Airbus OTCPK EADSF A and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER With the seat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>replacing the seat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER on some routes the capacity is lowered which should result in a higher load factor Part AmsterdamXiamen typically operated by a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER Part AmsterdamVancouver typically operated by an Airbus A For each analysis I will add a comparison with a load factor as well as a comparison with average load factors for both aircraft A third comparison will be made assuming a higher load factor on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>due to its lower capacity Flight from Amsterdam to Xiamen trip distance nm reserve fuel jet fuel price of per gallon No landing or take off fees have been taken into account Figure Efficiency changes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>versus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER Source DhierinPerkash Bechai Figure shows that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is a leap forward The airframe is about lighter while having a higher aerodynamic efficiency and higher propulsive efficiency The capacity is lower but is not a bad thing since it should enable Air FranceKLM to have higher load factors on their long haul fleet Replacement <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>First of all it is worth looking at both aircraft with load factors all seats are occupied The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>generates lower revenue and has lower fuel costs resulting in a lower profit Figure shows a visualization of the per seat results The fuel consumption per seat is lower The fuel consumption per passengerkm is L for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and L for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER Figure shows that the revenue per seat is lower Aided by lower fuel costs per seat the profit per seat rises This shows that when the Air FranceKLM OTC OTCAFRAF OTCPK OTCPKAFLYY is not able to fill the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>might be a better option to achieve a higher absolute profit Figure Per seat fuel efficiency for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER Source DhierinPerkash Bechai The figure clearly shows that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a significant fuel advantage over the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER One of the things that has to be noted is that the load factors are never Air FranceKLM has an average load factor of The higher profit per seat for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could indicate that in terms of absolute profit the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>might be more profitable than the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER Replacement <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>at load factor of The load factor of for both airframes shows that the profit is almost lower However the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>having less seats should be able to have a higher load factor Using the numbers of passengers on board of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER and use those for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>gives a load factor of Replacement <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER load factor by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>load factor At higher load factor the following seat counts are obtained When the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is indeed able to transport the same number of passengers as the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER the following results are obtained The revenue will be slightly lower for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>but aided by lower fuel costs the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should be able to generate a higher profit So the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should be able to generate higher profit with a smaller airframe that has a higher load factor Additionally the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should have lower costs related to take off of and landing fees Figure Per seat figures for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>adjusted for load factor Source DhierinPerkash Bechai When taking the load factor into account the load factor fuel costs per seat are lower instead of and the profit per seat is higher instead of Capacity and fuel costs are important factors that determine the profit but what should also be taken into account are the lease rates of the aircraft If profit on operation are completely offset by the higher lease rates the rush to attract fuel efficient aircraft mitigates The lease rate for a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is about mln per month for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER this is about mln Per month the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is approximately more expensive to operate Per year leasing the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>instead of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER is almost mln more expensive Assuming that the route is operated times per week or flights including return flight gives an advantage of mln for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER However on the days that the route is not being flown both aircraft can operate other flights Assuming those flights are somewhat similar in stage length and the aircraft operate of the year leads to the conclusion that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is bringing Air FranceKLM mln more profit per year The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aids Air FranceKLM in reducing fuel burn by Per flight the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>generates higher profit Taking into account lease rates the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>generates about higher profit The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should help Air FranceKLM trimming down capacity where needed while simultaneously increasing the load factor of their long haul fleet In Part I will compare the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus A on a
