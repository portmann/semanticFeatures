Ex-Im is currently putting together a liquidation plan and completing transactions that had already been approved, but the lapse of the bank's charter last month means it cannot work on any new deals.its a shame they shut the bank down.does it need some sort of over haul ?sure.there is no denying that the charter of the bank was to help businesses and help create jobs that we desperately need and cannot afford to keep losing to other countries.is boieng a big customer of the bank right now ?of course because they are going thru an unprecedented growth in orders !so of course they would use the bank.most of the orders are to export the planes.there are 60.60 other banks in 60 other countries.we cannot  make it impossible for our companies to compete when their competitors have that banking option.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>if you think this wont hurt boieng and other companies and as a result lose more jobs , then I believe people are being naive With all the lobbying/corruption , crazy politics and fed printing going on this was probably the last thing the US needed to do to `` fight government subsidies & corporate welfare '' especially since it will effectively kill one of our biggest exporting manufacturers in <b>Boeing</b> and because in the global playing field everyone else has subsidized financing .
