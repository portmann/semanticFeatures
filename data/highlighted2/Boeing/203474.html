Investors Edge clicks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>BA is well positioned for future growth in commercial airlines Air Force renewal projects and future space exploration initiatives Despite BAs strong performance the recent market chaos has knocked over off the share price despite longterm catalysts remaining intact BA pays a dividend with impressive growth history BA has free cash flow capacity to continue to substantially boost dividend payments over the next years I believe a fair price range for BA based on free cash flow multiples is to representing fair value upside of over Challenges to BA include reliance on government spending the potential for a Chinaled global slowdown and a lack of success in cybersecurity and UAV platforms In the latest edition of my value series I am highlighting a quality firm trading at a reasonable price Although I am an active investor and trader who commonly scours for market disconnects as part of my Value Investors Edge research service I keep approximately of my assets in indexes and blue chips My focus for this portion of my portfolio is quality companies at a reasonable price over the past months I have highlighted a dozen firms that I find attractive based on the current market pricing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA is a strong aerospace and defense firm that continues to post impressive free cash flow and faces a bright future in all of its business lines Boeings free cash flow has room to grow and deserves a slightly higher multiple in my opinion BA is currently trading for just over x its free cash flow with substantial growth potential remaining I believe BA is fairly priced between and based on a multiple to year average free cash flow With shares trading around the recent market panic is offering a very attractive entry point for a longterm focused investor with current upside of over to a fair valuation level Strong Trending Dividend but Cyclical Dependent BA has impressively grown their dividend over the past years but they do not shy away from flat payouts during challenging years Despite the year slump of unimpressive growth BAs y and y growth rates are still very impressive at and respectively The current projected payout of is easily covered by free cash flow with a payout for the y average and only a payout of free cash flow Even if growth slows down there is still financial room for several years of double digit growth BA has reduced their share count by over the past years which is a positive metric but nowhere near as impressive as the dividend growth Ultimately <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is what I refer to as a fair weather repurchaser The firm buys back stock when firing on all cylinders and the pricing is naturally higher When times are tough the company gets defense and commits the cardinal sin of issuing equity at basement levels Note the huge jump in at average prices of The stock is today That type of nonsense speaks to poor confidence and discipline at the board level especially as BA has plowed B into repurchases over the last months alone That capital in would have reduced the share count by over alone now its only good for an reduction BAs actions speak to a firm that is likely to overpay for their shares and lack the confidence to invest during downcycles I am especially harsh here in part to balance out my appreciation for everything else about the business Unlike most other analysts who focus heavily on dividend growth metrics I admire a firm that keeps the dividend flat during hard times Throwing away precious cash when the stock is dirt cheap is an abysmal management decision and BA earns my appreciation for their fantastic dividend control Over the past years BA has spent B net to reduce the share count by approximately M or approximately per share This horrendous figure represents the effect of a timid fairweather repurchase policy While I certainly agree with BA repurchasing shares over the past months considering the tremendous growth prospects I hope they will be more aggressive during the next downturn Unlike most other defenserelated firms <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a thriving commercial segment that comprises the majority of its revenues and a large portion of corporate profits <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has published a convincing longterm market overview which was recently updated to reflect additional projected demand from China for a total of B in aircraft over the next twenty years India is also a huge player in rising global demand and BA estimates B worth of orders over the next two decades Whether or not China is slowing down the demand growth is huge and many international airlines are flying outdated fleets Although the US airline fleet has undergone tremendous renewal following the Great Recession and subsequent mergers and recaps US carriers overall have lots of improvement and expansion capacity left to go The following snapshot from Bloomberg shows that US carriers have of the oldest fleets Note that all Majors are represented in the top The US Air Force operates a clearly aging inventory and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>recently won after over a decade of struggling and controversy a tanker renewal contract worth up to B total <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is a major competitor in the nextgen stealth bomber contract <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>might also be eligible to compete for future fighter expansion projects or a new transport initiative to replace aging Cs or Cs The Air Force also needs to replace its T trainer aircraft and is soliciting contracts for a award timeframe With TX models projected this contract could easily exceed B Space exploration and general resupply are rapidly shifting towards privatization <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is among a small group of firms that have the potential to develop these advanced platforms especially if government funding is not guaranteed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a strong history of development and innovation in this field and if future Administrations decide to reenergize NASA I would anticipate BA as a strong competitor for the majority of the topdollar contracts The US Air Force is rapidly expanding their Unmanned Aerial Vehicle UAV or drone platforms and is building up new pilots and expanding training programs in anticipation of further expanding mission flow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has missed out on most of the major platforms todate including the Reaper and Global Hawk platforms each with a total pricetag of over B BA is well behind the curve but in the longterm year time horizon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has the capacity to win substantial contracts UAVs are far more economical to operate and they have proven to be effective combat support platforms for all Services Although Boeings longterm revenue is stabilized by a substantial backlog secured with significant prepayments the growth of the commercial airline industry which comprises the majority of BAs revenue and profit is clearly tied to global economic growth The primary thesis behind Boeings rosy forecasts is a sharp increase in Asian air travel as an inevitable result of economic growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has recently boosted their forecast for Chinese airplane orders despite recent speculation that the Chinese market is rapidly slowing If China plunges into a recession or even a period of Japanstyle stagnation these forecasts could fail to fully develop and Boeings growth will obviously suffer Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>makes the lions share of its revenue and substantial profits from its commercial segments the Department of Defense is a major customer and has partnered with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>on several lucrative contracts in the past <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was the ultimate winner of the KCX tanker project KC Pegasus and is a major competitor for the nextgeneration stealth bomber However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been struggling to deliver the KC on schedule and budget and although the potential program size is up to airplanes at B total the Air Force has only locked in and Im doubtful that even that amount is enforceable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is struggling to gain global acceptance of the latest tanker model placing them at the behest of the Defense budget The US Air Force flies a massive fleet of old airplanes including the B Stratofortress and the C Galaxy not to mention the shockingly outdated tankers Despite the clearly aging inventory the current budget is very tight and any hint of an economic pullback could further nix any major fleet renewal plans <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is likely to be a serious competitor for nearly all of the Air Force contracts so any budget impacts will likely impact BAs future profits On an additional bearish note BAs cybersecurity business which has seen strong government traction recently sold off its commercial projects BA continues to focus on government projects but I am not optimistic regarding their growth potential here The Air Force has been steadily upgrading and enhancing its unmanned platforms UAVs and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has largely been left in the dust Both the surveillancefocused RQ Global Hawk and the strikeequipped MQ Reaper represent massive programs at over B each General Atomics and Northrop Grumman NYSE NOC have been the major players and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has only produced conceptual platforms <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had multiple impressive prototypes dating back to but they havent produced significant Defense contracts There is some promise if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can secure a meaningful contract in some type of UAVconversion project similar to the recent F conversion With the Air Force looking to retire a significant amount of Fs and Fs over the next two decades there is significant testing and combat application potential in this pipeline Regardless <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is behind the curve in terms of major projects and I would expect to see an uphill battle for the next mainline strike and reconnaissance platforms As previously discussed I prefer to utilize an average price to free cash flow NYSE FCF ratio in determining valuation targets My broad range is typically from x yield With a company like BA with an impressive product pipeline and a bright future in both the commercial and defense sectors I am comfortable with average multiples of x yield The average FCF figures are shown in the chart below The threeyear figures are considerably higher due to steadily improving performance since a weak performances in and caused by both temporary aviation hiccups and defense budget cuts Applying a x multiple to the year average results in a fair market capitalization of B to B With M shares outstanding as of July the fair price range for BA is to I believe this range is fair perhaps even slightly conservative as BA arguably deserves a premium due to its fantastic performance and strong product pipeline potential I recently read an outstanding report on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>from Valuentum which I wanted to offer to my readers as an additional quality report Their report derived a valuation range of to based on a customized discounted cash flow model My model is a simpler approach based on not adjusting for cost of equity or debt and assigning a quality factor discount instead of a weightedcost metric No approach is perfect and a smart investor will consider multiple angles before committing BA has surged over the past years but the next years have even more potential as the global aerospace industry continues to surge space exploration is rapidly shifting towards privatization the US Air Force has multiple fleet renewal projects and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has established a strong foothold in the defense cyber services sector The recent market panic and pullback have allowed investors to acquire a stake in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>for an attractive price I believe shares of BA have compelling upside until they reach their fully valued mark <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is clearly correlated to the global economy but its product pipelines offer strong general portfolio diversification making them an attractive component of a diversified blue chip portfolio I do not currently own any BA shares but will heavily consider acquiring equity at this level when cash becomes available They are currently on my blue chip buying list We only use your
