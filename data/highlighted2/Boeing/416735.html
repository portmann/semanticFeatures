Look At Boeings Plans With The Early X The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha A total of six test aircraft will be produced out of aircraft will be delivered to customers As many analysts and investors already know <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA is facing a major challenge to close the production gap it is facing on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>production <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has already taken measures by reducing output by While the gap is a major challenge for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>that does deserve extensive coverage I think it is also important to look beyond that and see what Boeings plans are with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X As part of my research on the potential impact of purchase options on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>order inflow I contacted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>spokesman Doug Alder Jr was unable to answer most of my questions but did have some things to say which I think can be informative to investors The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X which is the family name for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>mainly competes with the Airbus OTCPKEADSF A and at the same time tries to be a replacement of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The aircraft is another push towards bigger aircraft but not too big On the other hand the aircraft makes use of light weight wings that are more aerodynamically efficient while the turbofans are significantly more efficient So the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X is a push towards bigger and more efficient aircraft If you are interested in the differences between the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER I can recommend you reading one of my previous articles <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Wat Is New On The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X Figure One of the autoclaves for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X Source wwwheavyliftpficom While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is facing some challenges on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Classic production gap the plans for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X are firm One of the biggest investments <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had to make was for the construction of the Composite Wing Center featuring autoclaves where the wings for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X and the empennage will be produced In just little over a year the Composite Wing Center has been realized In production of the composite wing and empennage parts will commence The program will start off by the manufacturing of the test aircraft and there also were I was able to get some information from Boeings spokesman In well continue the production rate of seven airplanes per month But we will build six test airplanes This sentence does contain some information that is already known The production rate is per month which likely includes the production of the test airplanes accounted for at a rate of per month What people might be less familiar with is the number of test beds that will be bought which for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X is Dennis Muilenberg CEO of The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company already confirmed this number in February but has remained uncovered so far We expect the test articles minus two static airplanes that will never deliver to deliver in and beyond This sentence contains information that so far was not yet known Two aircraft will be used for static tests and will never be delivered and are likely to be part of the RD costs The other test aircraft are set for delivery in The information that can also be extracted is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>officially still aims for commercial service entry of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X in while many believe the internal target is A last thing that Doug Alder Jr added was Its important to note that all of the above have already been baked into our plan and accounts for our expectations for margin accretion and cash growth While many are having concern about Boeings cash growth and margins these words clearly show that all of this is already accounted for in Boeings forecasts and they are still seeing margin and cash growth What is clear is to me is that lack of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>order inflow can result in lower profits and cash flow for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>already has things planned out for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X pretty well and surprised such as unsellable airframes like happened on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should not be expected In the end Boeings view on margin and cash growth remains intact If you would like to receive updates for my upcoming articles
