class='textDiv'>Spirit AeroSystems A Buyout In The Making Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc NYSESPR Seeking Alpha And one thats heavily reliant on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Spirit AeroSystems Holdings NYSE SPR is a roughly bn market cap aircraft parts maker Its generating about billion in annual revenue and only has a couple million dollars in net debt having transitioned into a cash flow generating machine The key for the company is that its a key supplier of aerostructures to both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA and Airbus Aerostructures include propulsion systems fuselages and wing systems Spirit makes every aerostructure for each <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>commercial aircraft in production Its heavily tied to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>which is good and bad Specifically the companys top line is somewhat limited but its done a lot with costs over the years to boost cash flow The biggest catalyst from an event driven standpoint is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could easily roll up Spirit AeroSystems Spirit supplies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus via longterm contracts roughly of revenues are from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and from Airbus of the products that Spirit makes for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus are solesource making it very critical player namely for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Spirit has been doing some divesting of late in terms of dumping underperforming sites and factories Its positioned itself nicely to have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>make a run at buying it The current BoeingSpirit relationship dates back over years to a time when Spirit was a division of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Now the Airbus partnership came about when Spirit bought BAE Since then its been winning more business from Airbus OTCPKEADSY OTCPKEADSF Note that current CEO Larry Lawson took over in and has been shaking things up including the selloff of underperforming and noncore assembly operations and plants Spirit is now a leader in terms of volume production thanks in large part to Lawson where operating margins are up from in to over the trailing twelve months Interim margin improvement should continue given the divestment of its Gulfstream business last year All this means more cash flow where the company could do million to million in cash generation this year a cool to free cash flow yield Theres a long runway in terms of revenue generation too with a billion backlog equal to times sales In the meantime Spirit should continue to succeed with Boeings strong performance including the success were already seeing with the and the orders being placed for that aircraft The is the twin aisle aircraft and Spirit already has a contract win that makes it the largest aerostructures content supplier for the Scopia Capital Management is kingmaker here owning of the company and having over a quarter of its portfolio invested in Spirit Hound Partners and Darsana Capital also have Spirit as a high conviction pick with over of their portfolios invested in the stock owning and respectively Notable other hedge fund owners include Falcon Edge Capital Findlay Park Partners Eton Park Capital Aravt Global Greenlight Capital TPG Axon SAB Capital Snow Capital Newtyn Management and Lakewood Capital All told the funds above own over of Spirit Aerosystems Spirit has a solid flow of work but the issue is that returns on capital are somewhat capped given the limited pricing power and customer concentration And while new aircraft and orders are a positive at some point the volume discounts built into its contracts will start to work against it And given the divestitures and margin improvements by Spirit it seems likely for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>that bringing a major producer of components for its jets inhouse would be a big positive for its margins Spirit already gets most of its revenues from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and finding a buyer for its Airbus shouldnt be hard In the worst case theres still lower margin programs that could be dumped and its developmentlevel programs can be further scaled back Along with that capital deployment should be a focus for Spirit in the interim including buybacks and dividends where given the visibility into its business and balance sheet theres a large deployable opportunity for shareholder returns at Spirit Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a
