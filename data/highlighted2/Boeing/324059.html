Aircraft engine makers are placing bets that could reshape their industry for decades as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>weighs a novel design for an airplane with seats a neglected area of the jet market The plane is designed to fill a slender gap between narrowbody jets which typically have seats and intercontinental planes with or more Competition to get onboard would usually be a skirmish for the big engine makers But technological bets and partnerships on that plane could reshape the engine industry for the next two decades and influence who has the upper hand when Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>come to renew the main part of their fleets in years This could well determine what happens in the next round of the great engine restructuring game said aerospace consultant Richard Aboulafia <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aims to broadly replace its model a topend narrowbody jet with a single aisle The new model would try to rewrite airplane economics by being wide enough for two aisles to seat seven people in each row but able to produce the skintight margins of a smaller singleaisle sixabreast plane like the workhorse <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus A Airbus calls the project a bluff and says it reflects Boeings frustration at losing market share to its A One of the designs on Boeings drawing board is an unusually ovalshaped crosssection rather than a rounder shape typical of most designs It strips away unneeded cargo space and would potentially be made of weightsaving carboncomposite industry sources say It would also need a new engine that could cost billion to develop That comes at a time when engine makers are split over the latest engine technology and marking time in the shifting alliances between General Electric GEN RollsRoyce RRL and Pratt Whitney UTXN Pratt Whitney elbowed out of the commercial market by Rolls and GE in the s is on the rise again with a geared turbofan design that went into service last month Its engines power half of Airbuss newest small jets but it has been years since it was selected by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The new president of Pratt Whitney Robert Leduc believes the midmarket idea is attractive It is for me because I want to get back on a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>airplane he told Reuters at the Singapore Airshow Britains RollsRoyce is also studying the plane It recently abandoned a venture with Pratt in small jets to focus on widebody aircraft Industry sources say it is regretting the decision because the narrowbody market is growing at record speed Pratt is meanwhile hungry to return to the market for larger jets With both companies facing pressures Boeings design offers an opportunity to break out of the current box Rolls in big engines Pratt in small ones without shouldering all risk That has triggered speculation that something like their former venture International Aero Engines IAE could be revived But Pratt is reluctant to rush back into the arms of RollsRoyce with whom it occasionally clashed inside IAE This week the US company that powered Amelia Earhart sketched out a more independent strategy Asked whether Pratt could revive cooperation with Rolls on Boeings study Leduc told Reuters There is no room left They made their decision and we had to move forward Asked if the UK manufacturer could buy its way back onboard his message was firmer They could always be a financial investor but there would be nothing for them to make To press the point that Pratt now sees itself as a standalone force he pronounced as dead a separate alliance with GE on the A superjumbo Id say pretty much yes Id say the A is won and done he told Reuters asked if the venture had run its course The remarks reflect Pratts conviction that it has invested in technology and earned an independent place at the top table But it also has an interest in seizing the opportunity presented by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>quickly to maximize its advantage It is a negotiating position an air show delegate said In reality analysts say Pratts options depend on how its geared turbofan performs The technology aims to increase efficiency but critics say it adds complexity RollsRoyce has not ruled out working with Pratt on the new jet a testbed for technology that could reopen the door to the narrowbody market in time for the next new designs in We are not closing any door but we are not active on any door We are kind of neutral and it is more wait and see on where this market is going Eric Schulz president of civil aerospace told Reuters Sitting back with the least interest in upsetting the status quo is GE the worlds largest engine manufacturer which is strong in both small and large markets Industry analysts nonetheless speculate GE is working on the new geared engines but GE is not showing its hand GE has a roadmap of technologies including advanced materials and designs to position us for new engine opportunities a spokeswoman said Building a new engine could cannibalize existing sales GE has the biggest share of all Pratt is doing well out of the A and RollsRoyce could see some widebody business affected But after busting budgets on ambitious designs in the past decade planemakers have little fresh on their drawing boards and few suppliers can afford to stay out of the next round It is better to cannibalize your own market than have someone do it for you Aboulafia said Thomson Reuters is the worlds largest international multimedia news agency providing investing news world news business news technology news headline news small
