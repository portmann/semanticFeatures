class='textDiv'>Forget About The Mega Orders For The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Needs Wide Body Orders The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Order increase to per month or above is a next logical step Production rate for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could increase by next decade With the Farnborough International Airshow starting on the th of July some solid order inflow is expected during the month Despite expectations being damped quite a bit the month of July is an important one for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA and Airbus OTCPKEADSF as it could give an idea on how realistic the full year targets of both jet makers are In this article I will explain why the smaller wide body orders should be valued more for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Despite order announcements being an important part of the Farnborough International Airshow I do think that this years focus will be on some arising challenges the jet makers are facing China represents a market with a trillion potential but economic growth has been slowing For Airbus it is likely that there will be some focus on the Airbus A deliveries which are lacking quite a bit and the issues on the Airbus Aneo For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>of course there will be some focus on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Classic which is running out of backlog the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X and a MoM aircraft Looking at the backlogs one would say that this air show in terms of orders is a nonevent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has almost aircraft in backlog according to their Junes figures In comparison Airbus has over orders in backlog Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>backlog June split by aircraft type Source What can be observed is that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>almost naturally has the biggest backlog The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is the cheapest airframe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has and it easily fits in an airlines network The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is a bit of a dying program while the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should become one of the most used freighters in the coming years The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a backlog of units which is not a lot considering that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been delivering of those airframes annually For the Dreamliner there are over units in backlog which looks solid Now these figures look impressive and I often see news outlets and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>quoting that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has over units in backlog That is a pretty figure but in order to make that backlog figure useful you need to split it and connect it to the production rate per type and announced rate increases Table <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>backlog in years per type production and average order inflow The annual production is the maximum planned annual production What can be seen that fort he <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program based on backlog and the year average there is some room to increase production to per month annually by the end of the decade Current production rate for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is in line with the year average For the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>FedEx adds some orders to the backlog every few months The average order inflow however is higher than what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>plans to produce by decade end This means that backlog will be shrinking at some point Nevertheless I do not see this as a problem since the can rely on some options conversions for its freighter and the tanker program The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>currently is facing some difficulties but its backlog and average order inflow signal that a rate increase by next decade is an option Demand for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>depends to a large extent on development of oil prices For the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>things look a bit less vibrant This has partly to do with airlines not ordering the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>at this point but awaiting deliveries to be completed and the low fuel prices After that there should be option conversions and follow up orders Nevertheless it looks like planned rate increases for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>are less connected to order inflow and remaining backlog than they are for the other commercial <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aircraft I think it is a matter of time before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>announces a further rate increase for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to per month Airbus is already making this step and it is likely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will follow not only to improve its earnings and cash flow but also to remain competitive For the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I think the rates are aligned pretty well with order inflow and market outlooks Despite the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>facing difficulties in its transition to a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X production there seems to be room to increase production rates back to aircraft per year For the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I do expect order inflow to increase due to option conversion at the same time the planned rate increases to per month might be a bit too high I view production rates of to be healthier fort he backlog For the sake of maintaining a strong backlog <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could decide to increase rates on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and align rates of the Dreamliner with order inflow By the time this happens the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>combined should be able to show a solid contribution to Boeings cash flow Additional rate increases for the Dreamliner only make sense if fuel prices continue to climb The Dreamliner was launched when oil prices were about the same as today with the difference being that oil prices were in an uptrend Using a year backlog mark as acceptable waiting times for airlines and a booktobill ratio of rate increases on the and programs are justified I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>does not need mega orders for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>badly but could use some strong order inflow for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>for which the year average has been trailing the annual number of deliveries by a wide margin If you would like to receive updates for my upcoming articles please click the
