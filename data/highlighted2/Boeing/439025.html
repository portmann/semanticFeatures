#A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>stock continues to trade at a discount due primarily to the SEC inquiry announced earlier this year But this is a shortterm issue Boeings long term growth remains intact Global demand for aircraft continues to rise and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>recently sealed a major deal with Iran The company generates a lot of free cash flow which it uses to buy back stock and pay a nice dividend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is an attractive longterm investment Shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA have underperformed the market this year despite the company ringing up several positive developments The stock is down about yeartodate making it one of the worst performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in By comparison the SP Index is up about in the same time A lot of the concern over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>stems from a report earlier this year that the SEC was looking into Boeings accounting of costs and expected sales of its Dreamliner and planes The inquiry is in regards to Boeings use of program accounting which spreads its high early costs over a large block of deliveries The method allows the company to book future profits and costcutting expectations in current earnings The SEC decided the questions were significant enough to announce a formal inquiry This is what sent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares into a tailspin earlier this year The SEC inquiry is a concern since it involves one of Boeings flagship planes As a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shareholder I feel the SEC inquiry is much ado about nothing and that the longterm growth potential for the company far outweighs any shortterm bumps in the road While the SEC inquiry news continues to be a drag on Boeings valuation it likely wont be a meaningful issue over the long term Boeings type of program accounting has been used for decades Whenever a companys name is brought up along with the words SEC and inquiry in the same sentence the stock typically declines as shortterm investors sell first and ask questions later But it should be noted that this issue is not likely to affect the company over the long term It remains entirely possible the SEC will not take any action and even if it does it could levy a modest financial penalty In both cases Boeings longterm prospects would remain intact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>made huge news recently when it announced an agreement to sell planes to Iran Terms of the deal have not yet been disclosed but The Wall Street Journal reports it could be worth as much as billion This is a major opportunity for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Irans reluctance to curb its nuclear ambitions and the resulting sanctions have saddled the country with one of the worlds oldest aircraft fleets This news is going fairly unnoticed by the market primarily because of the SEC issue which continues to be an overhang on the company The good news from Boeings selloff this year is that it gives investors a great buying opportunity The stock went down as low as this year It has recovered off its week low and now trades around but it is still well off its week high of At its current price the stock is valued for times earnings That is below the SP valuation and is also below Boeings average valuation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>stock traded for a high PE of about times in the past year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>forecasts per share in fiscal core earnings This would represent roughly growth this year and the Iran deal should fuel even further growth going forward At the midpoint of managements guidance an earnings multiple of would represent a stock price of per share over the next year That represents an approximately return When you add in Boeings dividend yield its not inconceivable to think the stock could return nearly over the next year and perhaps more if Boeings earnings come in better than expected In the past few years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shifted focus from defense to commercial aircraft I believe this is a great strategy over the long term because global demand for aircraft is increasing Of Boeings billion in revenue last year approximately billion more than twothirds came from commercial aircraft The commercial aircraft business grew last year while its military aircraft revenue remained flat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should continue to see strong growth because the global commercial aircraft market is booming Boeings commercial aircraft deliveries increased last year and set a company record And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ended the first quarter with a strong backlog at billion including orders for more than commercial airplanes not including the Iran deal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is a massive generator of cash flow The company generated billion of free cash flow last year a year over year increase and even more growth could be in store thanks largely to the Iran deal as well as the broader rise in global aircraft demand With its prodigious cash flow the company rewards shareholders with attractive cash returns In December <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>raised its dividend by It has done a great job raising dividends over the past five years Along with the dividend increase it also unveiled a new billion stock buyback program which amounts to approximately of the companys market capitalization This is why I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is making the right decision focusing more on its commercial aircraft business going forward and entry into new geographic markets will fuel future earnings growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>isnt a screaming buy like it was in February but its still trading at a discount The stock is still an attractive investment over the long term for growth and income Disclaimer This article
