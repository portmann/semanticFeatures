class='textDiv'>Does A Million <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER Compare To A Brand New Dreamliner Part The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has the operational advantage Cost advantage still is in favor of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER In my previous article I had a look at the difference in ownership costs for a secondhand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA ER and a new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>As was to be expected the ownership costs for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER are much lower and over a timeframe of years the ownership costs are almost mln lower On the other hand I also looked at the annual revenue and concluded that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a significant advantage which makes it interesting to have a look at other costs such as maintenance costs crew costs and landing and navigation fees Figure Comparison of annual maintenance costs of secondhand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Source wwwAeroAnalysisnet One of the most important decisions that affect the financial performance of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER is the moment the aircraft is taken out of service For an aircraft that is years old a good moment would be right at the moment when the aircraft would need a costintensive heavy maintenance This would occur somewhere about years from now So the aircraft would be years old when it is taken out of service With aircraft typically having an economically viable life of years this seems to be reasonable It has to be noted that aircraft can be used as long as years Compared to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has significantly lower maintenance costs per flight hour Per annum the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could save an airline more than mln Additionally the secondhand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER has a heavy maintenance just before it will enter service Costs are expected to be mln Figure Comparison of annual crew costs of secondhand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Source AeroAnalysis With the cruising speeds of both aircraft being almost similar I am assuming the crew costs are almost similar with the only exception being cockpit crew of the Dreamliner having slightly lower wages and needing more flight attendants This would give the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER a mln advantage per annum Figure Comparison of annual navigation and landing fees of secondhand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Source AeroAnalysis The navigation costs and landing fees are a function of maximum takeoff weight and differ per country With the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER having a higher certified maximum takeoff weight the advantage is for the Dreamliner Per year the landing and navigation fees are about mln lower for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>With the information that has been gathered in the first article and this one a graphical representation of the costs advantage for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can be made Figure Advantage secondhand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Source AeroAnalysis What can be seen is that the initial advantage is about mln which is the difference in market value of both aircraft minus the heavy maintenance costs for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER and this advantage decreases to mln in the last year So when we solely consider the costs clearly the advantage is for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER but the advantage decreases due to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>having favorable operating costs Figure Advantage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER Source AeroAnalysis What can be seen in Figure is that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a disadvantage in the first years but in the years after the higher revenue potential offsets the higher costs this excludes any fuel costs When the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER is taken out of service it would have had a mln disadvantage Whereas the capital costs and market value gave the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER a significant advantage the lower maintenance costs and landing and navigation fees narrowed this advantage However taking into account the revenue the advantage shifts towards the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>In a following piece I will implement the fuel costs as well For now it can be concluded that the only reason Delta NYSE DAL prefers the secondhand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER over a new one is the advantage in purchase price and capital costs A reason not to choose the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is the availability the airframe is not available until Delta has not been a big fan of the X and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>so choosing for a secondhand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER is actually a step that was to be expected Delta has the maintenance facilities to make a secondhand aircraft work I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no
