Deliveries Company commentary on the rate of production of the current generation of could lead to a buying opportunity for long term investors It seems almost certain that <span

cash flow in the medium term Pressure on Boeings management to announce its and plans for the current generation of is coming to a head and investors should expect to hear an update on the current program with much greater specificity on production rates during this weeks earnings call The current generation of Boeings is widely known as the cash cow of Boeings commercial business The company has been ramping up production of its and aircraft to meet the companys staggering backlog of orders but the current generation s produced each year constitute the backbone of the companys profitability An early October research note from Goldman Sachs estimates the current program could account for as much as of the companys pretax profit While there is no consensus in the analyst community due to uncertainty of contracted prices many analysts are skeptical that ramping production of the and programs would be able to fully offset slowing production rates in late or Boeings primary obstacle to maintaining its current rate of production is that its customers know that a vastly improved version of the wildly popular wide body that incorporates a variety of cost saving innovations and an improved customer experience will be available beginning mid <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has orders that push any new customers X orders out to at least assuming a production rate of the current program for the X but customers are expecting that current generation s will come at a significant discount and as a consequence orders have largely dried up for the current generation plane As of October th the company currently counts orders for the ER a little more than a year and a half of production at the current rate Further pressuring the current generation of s according to Goldman Sachs is that legacy s will be coming off leases over the next five years adding supply to a market with already weak demand This supply and demand dynamic in the market was referenced by Delta Airlines CEO Richard Anderson last week in admittedly self serving comments regarding pricing of used s over the next months It would seem that Boeings current generation of is being squeezed by both its eventual replacement as well as the used s coming off lease over the next years To be sure steadily rising demand for air travel will absorb some of the excess s projected to be available via the used market and new production but a significant production gap will remain between mid to late and the arrival of the X in mid The company faces a choice of either attracting new customers to fill vacant production slots from mid with significant price concessions on its most profitable commercial product or slowing the rate of production In either event the company will likely realize a significant impact to earnings in the medium term that is unlikely to be fully offset by the ramping production in less profitable commercial products Commentary during Boeings next earnings report regarding the future of ER production may provide long term investors an attractive entry point The comments of Deltas CEO regarding the used market created a
