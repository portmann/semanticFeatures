Lower order inflow is not a bad sign in the end deliveries bring in bulk of the cash Decision from Emirates about ordering the Dreamliner or Airbus A will slip into During the Dubai Air Show in customers placed orders valued at more than bn This years air show was less spectacular and some see the absence of orders from the Gulf Carriers as a bad sign for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA and Airbus OTCPKEADSF In this article I will explain why this is not the case First of all it is important to have a look at what was different compared to the Dubai Air Show in The biggest difference between this years show and the air show years ago is the fact that neither <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>nor Airbus offered anything new In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>launched the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X which gathered over orders and commitments valued at over bn So the launch of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X caused a oneoff bump in the Dubai Air Shows order tally accounting for almost half the total order value Additionally there was an order from Emirates for Airbus A airframes valued at billion Combining Emirates mega orders the airline accounted for almost half of the order value which should not be considered a standard for every edition of the air show Additionally flydubai ordered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX aircraft valued at bn or of the total order value Etihad Airways ordered A and Aneo airframes valued at bn So what can be concluded is the following Emirates accounted for almost half of the total order value During the edition of the Dubai Air Show no new aircraft were launched Due to the absence of new aircraft launches a lower order inflow during the Dubai Air Show was to be expected and that is exactly what happened Before placing follow up orders for relatively new aircraft such as the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X Airbus A <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX and Airbus Aneo airlines will first take delivery of the new aircraft and evaluate their performance in the fleet A second reason for the lower order inflow during the air show is the absence of orders for the Airbus A which accounted for over of the order value during the show Emirates which is the main operator of the A is looking for an improved version of the superjumbo and in order to keep pressure on Airbus for coming up with the Airbus Aneo it was to be expected that the airline would not place an order for the current superjumbo A possible mega order could have come from Emirates that is going to add either the Airbus A or the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to the fleet but a decision about that will slip into as the airline awaits performance data for both aircraft The absence of performance data and the absence of an Airbus Aneo made an order from Emirates which accounted for of the order value last year very unlikely The lower order inflow should not be seen as a sign of weakness but is a direct consequence of the X launch and mega orders in Airlines are awaiting the first deliveries for the X before placing any followup orders Additionally Emirates that is a big player on the Dubai Air Show is awaiting the launch of the Aneo and still has to decide whether it will add the Airbus A or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to the fleet The significantly lower order inflow becomes more apparent on the Dubai Air Show since this mainly is the stage for the big Gulf carriers that already placed their mega orders years ago The lower order inflow is not an indication of a downturn in demand for aircraft but is to be expected since airlines are integrating new aircraft types in their fleet before placing additional orders Another reason is the fact that orders that are placed now will be delivered years from now airlines will most likely wait for order books to decline before committing to ordering new aircraft The Dubai Air Show was not the big order festival it was in but this is not a bad sign The lower order inflow supports my view that order books are not bubbles but should decline at some point for airlines to make it more attractive to buy aircraft
