million charge for its KC aerial refueling tanker on Wednesday pushing firstquarter profit down percent amid concern about meeting deadlines for the US Air Force program The worlds largest plane maker also took a million pretax charge for its program or about cents a share after tax reflecting a weak air cargo market that has slowed sales of freighter versions of the jumbo jet Earnings fell to billion or per share from billion or per share a year earlier But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>backed its fullyear profit and revenue forecasts saying it was confident other parts of its business could make up for the added expenses It reported a better performance in its defense business for the quarter Analysts largely looked past the charges noting that cash flow was slightly better than expected and revenue was strong The cash flow story is intact along with the outlook Citi analyst Jason Gursky said in a note to clients Wed be buyers on weakness today <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares were up percent at after falling percent in premarket trading Some analysts had anticipated a tanker charge after the government said earlier this year that the program was at risk of falling behind schedule <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has already taken nearly billion in charges on the program Its the gift that keeps on giving Gursky wrote Other analysts said they would not rule out more tanker charges as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>races to deliver the initial tankers by August a commitment reiterated on Wednesday Analysts also had said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could still write off some of the deferred costs incurred in building the Dreamliner which has been the subject of an accounting probe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>did not take a charge and said deferred costs rose million to billion in the latest quarter a slower pace than in the past It dismissed the idea of abandoning the accounting method that allows such large cost deferrals Some investors still think a large writeoff is ahead Analysts said that fear and slowing orders are likely behind a rise in short sales of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>stock Short interest reached million shares in the latest tally the highest level in at least a decade <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could avoid such a charge by extending the number of planes it uses to account for costs But that means it must sell more s at a time when low fuel prices have reduced demand for the fuelefficient plane analysts said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has blamed price competition from rival Airbus for rigorous cost cuts this year including eliminating up to jobs in its commercial airplane unit But the runaway success of Airbus Aneo family has put pressure on <span style='background-color:

profit margins to midteens by the end of the decade <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said on a conference call In the latest quarter Boeings
