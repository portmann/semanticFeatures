Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>usually raises its dividend with the first quarter payment and announces the increase in December The dividend grew by over the past two years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA declares the first quarterly dividend for the next year in early December After a raise in followed by a increase last year investors can look forward to more good news in a few days With an annual dividend of and a share price of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>yields today Although I believe that last years dividend growth rate will not be maintained another comfortable double digit increase is realistic After trading more or less sideways in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares performed nicely in and gained vs the SP which is only up by despite the fact that Boeings bottom line will not improve in After the third quarter the company guides towards FY core EPS in the range of to and GAAP EPS between and for This compares to core EPS of and GAAP EPS of in and is below the first guidance that was issued at the beginning of the year Equally important for the market is Boeings operating cash flow which is now projected to come in at around B up from B One reason why core EPS are declining in is another charge in the KC tanker program which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had to recognize and negatively impacted EPS in the second quarter by Another factor to consider is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Commercial Airplanes BCA product mix and particularly the higher number of deliveries led to declining margins for the segment Not much needs to be said about the fundamental situation in the aircraft industry Despite recent concerns about a slowing demand for aircraft as a result of lower oil prices and Delta CEO Richard Andersons comments about a bubble in widebody jets there are no reasons for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to worry in the next few years The companys order backlog still stands at a comfortable level of close to aircraft at the end of the third quarter and the production will continue to increase over the next years So far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has provided no guidance for but revenue will grow driven by a larger number of aircraft built and the market sees EPS to climb to provided that there will be no further unexpected charges next year Given the fact that Boeings guidance is traditionally conservative I expect a lower figure which will be released with the earnings report my guess is a guidance range with a midpoint of The most important question for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>going forward remains the The program must finally turn cash flow positive in and the deferred costs need to fall This is crucial since the next two major transitions from the NG to the MAX and a few years later from the to the X are looming which will determine Boeings way forward in the years beyond In order to prepare for the future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>must do its homework and the has to become profitable and a cash cow in the very near future This is mandatory to grow profits and to safeguard dividend increases for the next years The major part of Boeings shareholder remuneration is the buyback program The company repurchases shares aggressively and has reduced the number of outstanding shares by million about of the total share capital in The buyback supports EPS growth and reduces future dividend payments in spite of the continuously growing dividend per share Boeings payout ratio of is still relatively low leaving room for higher distribution in the future Boeings balance sheet is rock solid and the company had a net cash position of B after Q Similar to and I think that the dividend increase will outpace EPS growth and a likely scenario for me is a raise somewhere between and This would result in a quarterly dividend between or annually In this case the yield would increase to to and approach the level Boeings CEO James McNerney stepped down in and has left the challenging task to finally make the program profitable to its successor Dennis Muilenberg In his last two years as CEO McNerney gave generous gifts to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shareholders by increasing the dividend at an unsustainable rate While I am convinced that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will continue to be a dividend grower for the foreseeable future sooner or later dividend growth will have to slow down more in line with EPS and cash flow growth The main question is at what rate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can grow earnings over the next years BCA will continue to see top line growth as a result of higher production rates and more deliveries The operating margin in the first nine months of fell to compared to in FY If the margin can recover again and possibly exceed the level there is still room for plenty of EPS growth To emphasize it again the reason for the lower margin in and the driver for a recovery over the next few years will have to be the Therefore the next dividend increase might be an indication how well the program progresses and what Boeings management expects in terms of future cash flows Looking beyond BCA <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Defense Space Security increased its operating margin in from to and reported higher earnings despite lower revenue A continuation of this trend would be highly welcomed as it would help to grow EPS and cash flow further The two other factors beyond operational performance which have an impact on Boeings dividend are the payout ratio and the buyback program The payout ratio is still conservative and there is room for higher distributions even in case of slowing or even stagnating earnings growth Secondly the extensive share repurchases are a reliable contributor to EPS growth In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>spent B on dividends and bought back shares for B more than of its share capital In dividend payments will climb to B and until the end of Q another B were already used for repurchases From my point of view <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>remains a solid investment for longterm oriented investors with double digit dividend potential for the foreseeable future My assumption is that the next dividend increase which will be announced shortly will be in the range of bringing the yield closer to Disclaimer Opinions expressed herein by the
