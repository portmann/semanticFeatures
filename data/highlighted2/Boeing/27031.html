and Shelby Sebens WASHINGTONPORTLAND Ore April Reuters It is crunch time for President Barack Obamas push to finalize an ambitious Pacific free trade pact and anyone wondering why it is such a tough sell may want to talk to the people of Oregon This West Coast state of million people which hosts major operations of global giants Nike Inc and Intel Corp exemplifies the nations ambiguity about free trade and shows the battle lines between its advocates and critics With percent of Oregons exports already heading to the Trans Pacific Partnership countries and an estimated one in five jobs dependent on trade local businesses are lobbying for the nation pact that would stretch from Japan to Chile covering percent of the world economy Yet scars from two decades of globalization and fears that big business will hijack the agenda make even many of those who may benefit from more trade apprehensive We understand that its a necessary thing you have to have trade you have to be able to put your products in other markets says John Kleiboeker <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co worker of years and machinists union president at the aircraft makers Gresham factory east of Portland Most people I know though feel it should be on a basis where everybody wins instead of just large corporations he said adding the main concern is that more jobs will get moved to countries with lower wages and labor standards Kleiboeker and many others fear that will be facilitated by proposed fasttrack legislation that would set ground rules and objectives for the administration to negotiate but only give Congress a yesorno vote on the final agreement Oregon senator Ron Wyden is working with Republicans to make the bill more palatable to fellow Democrats and the public His pivotal role has made him a target of antitrade campaigners with one group even following him at one point with a foot m blimp saying Ron Wyden Its up to you Dont betray us Different polls show different outcomes perhaps reflecting how questions were framed A survey for leftwing Democracy for America shows percent of Oregonians think trade deals cost jobs although Portland Business Alliance polling shows percent think trade is good for the state Fasttrack legislation could come within days with the goal of passing it in spring to allow the TPP to clear Congress this year The administration argues that without such authorization US partners will balk at the prospect of whatever they agree being picked apart by Congress However the process makes it hard to sell free trade to a skeptical public Take Hillsboro an affluent Portland suburb known as Silicon Forest where Intel Oregons biggest private employer with a workforce and several other tech firms have operations Tina Johnston whose husband works at Intel owns nearby yarn shop BlackSheep and counts many Intel workers as customers She buys yarn both locally and overseas navigating a maze of tariffs and trade barriers Still she is of two minds about the Pacific pact and simply not confident that politicians will get it right I dont really trust the people who are making the decisions she said Mindful of such doubts Representative Suzanne Bonamici whose district includes Hillsboro remains on the fence about fast track legislation The diverse district I represent is home to several companies that benefit from trade but it is also home to many workers who want to know that their jobs are secure she says Oregon has suffered less from the manufacturing decline than many other states tech products are its top exports and a wide array of businesses are active exporters For example Corvallisbased Baker Seed Technologies exports grass seeds to China Vietnam Indonesia and Japan and its president Stan Baker sees a clear growth opportunity in Asia I believe theres the potential to double our business with the TPP Still memories of jobs lost to foreign competition and factory closures such as that of International Papers Gardiner mill in with jobs keep voters wary The White House says the Pacific pact promises unprecedented workers rights and environmental safeguards but the fact details are kept under wraps makes it hard to win over skeptics something which frustrates Wyden who has backed eight of major trade bills since If you believe deeply in trade and you want more of it you should want to get rid of all of this secrecy that makes the public so cynical about trade Thomson Reuters is the worlds largest international multimedia news agency providing investing news world
