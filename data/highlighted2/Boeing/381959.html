(Boeing: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Amazon <b>could</b> link cities near all of its European warehouses to this airport , meaning that for instance a package <b>could</b> be delivered to Poland from a warehouse in Spain overnight via one stop in Hahn , Germany .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This <b>could</b> make the Amazon Prime program much <i>more</i> attractive to many customers in Europe .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Img 3 : Aerial View Of Frankfurt - Hahn Airport Taking a <i>closer</i> look at the airport on Google Earth shows that it is in a very rural area , surrounded by very little other than fields which is an ideal location if Amazon needed to build additional warehouses in the area to support growth of the air hub .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is an important attribute as airports in much <i>more</i> built up areas such as London 's Heathrow airport see much needed expansion endlessly blocked due to its location in a built up area .  (Surprise) </span>One of the major issues with Amazon in much of Europe is its lack of products relative to its offerings in the United States.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Table 1 : Amazon Products For Sale By Country Having a system in place that <b>could</b> efficiently move products from a warehouse in the UK for instance to one in Italy <b>could</b> allow the retailer to list <i>more</i> items in many of these other countries .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In addition, the TTIP , a free trade agreement in the works would remove customs duties on many goods shipped between the United States and Europe.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This could make it <b>possible</b> in the future if implemented for Amazon to fly goods to Europe overnight from its U.S warehouses for products that it does not stock in Europe .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This <b>could</b> increase the number of products available in its European markets substantially , making it a <i>more</i> attractive platform for Europeans to shop on and in turn increasing sales .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The above map shows the current Amazon Airline operation in the United States.The current operation, though small allows the company to easily move goods to any region of the United States overnight from any of its warehouses.The operation, internally called project "Dragon Boat", aims to have Amazon control much of its supply chain.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Bloomberg has reported that the initiative may be formally launched as early as <b>sometime</b> this year as `` Global Supply Chain By Amazon . ''  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Earlier</i> this year Amazon announced a deal with ATSG to lease 20 <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> 767 aircraft and also registered with the US Federal Marine Commission , allowing the company to sell ocean freight services . (Boeing: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Eventually , a network of shipping , trucking and aircraft <b>could</b> allow Amazon to become a global shipping powerhouse , and as I described in my in depth analysis here , <b>could</b> lead to a $ 870 million revenue improvement by reducing shipping costs only 10 % .
