(Boeing: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Plus this <b>assumption</b> does not include the `` lessons learned '' savings <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> will recoup as R&D savings on other new programs yet to be developed . (Boeing: Uncertainty) </span>o As we can see in the chart above, orders wax and wane with the business cycle.A current slowdown means nothing.The next up cycle is coming, just as the next downturn is also coming.The 787 program is a long way from sales drying up.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>· Low fuel prices make the 787 <i>less</i> attractive .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>o Low fuel prices are a recent event , and also subject to market <b>variances</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>We do not think oil prices are going to go as high as they were two years ago for a long time.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But the 787 story is about much <i>more</i> than low fuel burn .  (Surprise) </span>The aircraft has unique range and payload capabilities.· Airlines have not been attracted by the 787's "hub busting" capabilities.o This is only partly true.There are exceptions - British Airways, ANA and Japan Airlines have all been doing this very successfully and opened new markets in the US using the 787.Ethiopian is going that way now, with its first nonstop service the US.o Another operator exploiting the unique range/payload capabilities of the 787 is Thomson/TUI, which is replacing 767s with 787s.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As 787 operators become <i>more</i> experienced with the aircraft , they will push it to its limits - as United is doing serving secondary markets in China .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Without the 787 , United <b>could</b> not do this .  (Uncertainty) </span>o Norwegian is disrupting markets by using the 787 as the lowest cost competitor in its markets and lowering yields for competitors.Which is why the US airline industry is trying to stop Norwegian's growth.The 787 is Norwegian's trump card.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>o Every success by a 787 operator will force a competitor flying a <i>less</i> capable aircraft to rethink their strategy .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>may</b> even force Airbus to further discount their A330 even as <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> can start to drive up its 787 pricing as operators see the benefits the 787 brings . (Boeing: Uncertainty) </span>· Airlines that wanted the 787 have already bought the aircraft.o This is plainly an exaggeration.The 787 was developed to replace the 767.There were 887 767s still in operation as of the end of 1Q16.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Many , and <b>perhaps</b> most , will eventually be replaced by 787s .  (Uncertainty) </span>When one adds the, say, 500 of these 767s to the 1,154 ordered to date, the total of 1,654 is comfortably over the 1,300 block in place today.Airlines have not finished buying the 787 by any stretch of the imagination.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Editor 's Note : This article discusses one or <i>more</i> securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange .
