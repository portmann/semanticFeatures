class='textDiv'>Boeings In The News Seeking Alpha Judging by the news you might think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA is in big trouble Chief among the concerns is Boeings use of orders as its block accounting number for costs With sales through April and slowing sales there is a view that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>may never recover its costs on the It is true that sales have slowed in the past months But then sales for all commercial aircraft have slowed not just sales Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>have had some blockbuster years recently They both have a seven year backlog on single aisle aircraft In addition to the regular business cycle the massive drop in oil prices have enabled airlines to keep older fleets in operation a bit longer New aircraft on order have seen deliver dates slide to the right but only for some airlines For example Southwest is accelerating its first MAX delivery because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is able to get this done sooner Back to the Take a look at this chart The current backlog peaked in That is not because orders tapered off Orders grew from and The order spike occurred because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had offered the latest model of the the There were a lot of orders for that new model The real driver in decreasing the backlog is Boeings expanding production capabilities With two factories delivering s <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should be able to push out aircraft per year In fact in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>delivered of the The Airbus OTCPKEADSY A is the s primary competitor It is cheaper and now has been offered in a neo version Looking at the equivalent chart we see the following The Airbus A all models except freighter backlog is about a quarter that of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s It is true that the delays helped Airbus sell a lot of As But now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has production humming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>faces brutal pricing competition from the cheaper but also lowertech A Airbus decision to create an Aneo was a smart move to crimp pricing on the So is it as bad as the news suggests Wed say no and here is why The concerns people have expressed about the come down to these issues <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>cannot recoup bn invested in the o This is a fair point <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>says it can recover the investment which is based on a block of aircraft We think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will sell many more s and will exceed the number Plus this assumption does not include the lessons learned savings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will recoup as RD savings on other new programs yet to be developed o As we can see in the chart above orders wax and wane with the business cycle A current slowdown means nothing The next up cycle is coming just as the next downturn is also coming The program is a long way from sales drying up Low fuel prices make the less attractive o Low fuel prices are a recent event and also subject to market variances We do not think oil prices are going to go as high as they were two years ago for a long time But the story is about much more than low fuel burn The aircraft has unique range and payload capabilities Airlines have not been attracted by the s hub busting capabilities o This is only partly true There are exceptions British Airways ANA and Japan Airlines have all been doing this very successfully and opened new markets in the US using the Ethiopian is going that way now with its first nonstop service the US o Another operator exploiting the unique rangepayload capabilities of the is ThomsonTUI which is replacing s with s As operators become more experienced with the aircraft they will push it to its limits as United is doing serving secondary markets in China Without the United could not do this o Norwegian is disrupting markets by using the as the lowest cost competitor in its markets and lowering yields for competitors Which is why the US airline industry is trying to stop Norwegians growth The is Norwegians trump card o Every success by a operator will force a competitor flying a less capable aircraft to rethink their strategy It may even force Airbus to further discount their A even as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can start to drive up its pricing as operators see the benefits the brings Airlines that wanted the have already bought the aircraft o This is plainly an exaggeration The was developed to replace the There were s still in operation as of the end of Q Many and perhaps most will eventually be replaced by s When one adds the say of these s to the ordered to date the total of is comfortably over the block in place today Airlines have not finished buying the by any stretch of the imagination Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks
