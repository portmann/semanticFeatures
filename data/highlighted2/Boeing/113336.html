#A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could be looking at billion of deals French hard line in nuclear talks may cost Airbus at first By Tim Hepher Parisa Hafezi and John Irish PARISVIENNA July Reuters Western planemakers look set to reap billions of dollars in deals with Iran if a deal is done on its nuclear programme to allow one of the worlds most promising aviation markets to come out of quarantine Iran and six world powers were struggling on Friday to remove the last obstacles to an historic deal in Vienna that could resolve a more than year dispute over Tehrans nuclear ambitions extending talks through the weekend For Tehran the prospect of sweeping economic sanctions and a longstanding US trade embargo being lifted represents a chance to renew a fleet whose average age of years is almost twice the international average and to do so at affordable prices after years of paying over the odds on the black market For Airbus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and other manufacturers that could mean up to billion in deals shaped in part by the negotiating positions of various camps during the lengthy nuclear talks And for Iran Airs yearold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>SP the last of its kind it should mean welldeserved retirement There are a lot of aircraft that are really at the end of their lives said Maximo Gainza senior consultant at UKbased fleet watcher Ascend Flightglobal Iran is going to be a very hot market as and when sanctions are lifted The chairman of Iran Air Farhad Parvaresh told Reuters last year that as soon as sanctions were eased Iran would seek to obtain at least widebody and shorthaul jets but that it would turn to Russia and China if nuclear talks collapsed Iranian and Western industry officials estimate that Iran a country of million people will need a total of aircraft in the next decade suggesting there will be business for both major Western suppliers due to the long waiting times Officials cite a broad potential shopping list from the latest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus A lightweight jets to workhorses such as the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and or the Airbus A and A and even the most recent version of the jumbo the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>still in production but with declining sales <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>appears best placed to take advantage of the first wave of sales partly because France which is home to Airbus and owns percent of the firm took a particularly hard line with Iran in the nuclear talks according to industry sources diplomats and people familiar with Iranian thinking Paris has become more hawkish toward Tehran in recent years as France aligns itself with Shiite Irans Sunni rivals across the Gulf Qatar and Saudi Arabia The position of the French particularly foreign minister Laurent Fabius has not made things easy for Airbus said a European aviation industry source asking not to be identified Irans transport minister last month warned France it risked missing out on billion worth of business unless it changed its stance towards Tehran A French Senate panel recently expressed concerns that local firms were falling behind in the race to Tehran Being the first one in doesnt mean youll be the first served responded a senior French government official Well be ready Dont worry about our firms he told Reuters Iran Airs Parvaresh also told Reuters last year that Iran would give preference to suppliers who had cooperated during a window for sanctions relief that opened up in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said in October it had sold aircraft manuals drawings charts and data to Iran Air in its first acknowledged dealings since the hostage crisis that wrecked USIranian relations and triggered a US boycott The European Union does not specifically prohibit civil aviation trade with Iran but banned the export of dual use technology in and has progressively tightened restrictions since then effectively ruling out sales of civil aircraft and jet engines Airbus said it had applied for export licences under the scheme for temporary sanctions relief that allowed the sale of some aircraft parts but declined to say whether any goods or services had actually been provided Iranian officials say numerous exchanges have been held with people representing Western aerospace firms to explore future deals including meetings in several European cities Two senior Iranian officials said it was already understood that Iran would buy planes from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>once sanctions are lifted but US industry officials deny any informal deals or commercial discussions Its certainly an opportunity We sold a lot of planes there before and that fleet is really old But until our government says its OK were staying on the sidelines <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Commercial Airplanes CEO Ray Conner told Reuters in Washington this week Some industry analysts urge caution in projecting the number of planes Irans airline industry will eventually order noting that to sustain a large fleet it also needs to develop profitable passenger business by opening up the domestic market and building up an attractive international hub They have to deregulate the economy before you see the kind of numbers you would associate with a country of its potential said Richard Aboulafia of Virginiabased Teal Group There are plans to loosen regulated domestic fares but traffic on some foreign routes may already have been lost permanently to regional rivals such as Emirates he said In the long term Iran has strategic ambitions to rival Gulf cities as a hub attracting traffic from Western Europe and North America to the AsiaPacific region But getting a new fleet of aircraft flying quickly may need more than a lifting of sanctions After a boom in airplane demand the major Western manufacturers are sold out for most of the rest of the decade Experts say Iran may have to resort to the secondhand market or lease planes to get started But leasing firms will want to clarify thorny issues such as jurisdiction that have gathered dust during its enforced absence from the market There is not much choice because of the way production lines are sold out said Tony Whitty CEO of UKbased aircraft trading company Cabot Aviation In the short term if you go to Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>you have got to wait three or four years In the interim that could mean leasing or buying secondhand outmoded fourengined models such as less recent versions of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>or the outofproduction Airbus A Though less popular than newer twinjets experts say such planes are easily available at bargain prices and would still offer fuel savings for Iranian carriers Additional reporting by Andrea Shalal Victoria Bryan Editing by Kevin Liffey Thomson Reuters is the worlds largest international multimedia news agency
