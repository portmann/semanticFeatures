class='textDiv'>The C May Be A Bigger Threat To <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Than Anticipated The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha The ARJ disaster left many under the belief China does not have what it takes to compete in the commercial aircraft sector Big structural differences between the nationalistic ARJ project and commercially focused C project Img An ARJ Regional Jet undergoes assembly in China Made in China It is a common term seen on nearly every household item these days and a term many associate with low quality cheap goods That is why when China tried and failed to launch a commercial aircraft many dismissed it as being able to become much of a threat to the established players <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA and Airbus OTCPKEADSY Now it is working full speed ahead to launch a rival to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus A but things are uniquely different this time around The ARJ was Chinas first go at a regional jet First announced in it was scheduled to be quickly developed and see its maiden flight in with its entry into service months later The first flight occurred in and to date it has still not entered service after suffering delay after delay Reports indicated the aircraft suffered many problems in its development with the wings cracking wiring issues and avionics issues The latest reports now say the jet will enter service in The design is based off a MD an aircraft designed in the US that launched in and ceased production years later in Some MD models were in fact assembled in China for a short period of time and the tooling from this venture is now being used to build the ARJ The Chinese wanted as much of the plane as possible to be Chinese built with many parts other than the engines all being Chinese Richard Aboulafia an aerospace analyst said Any airline forced to operate this jet will be at a severe competitive disadvantage against any airline with a modern aircraft Well despite the disaster the program has been it has racked up orders from Asian African and Chinese airlines The aircraft has not received FAA certification so will only be able to be flown in countries that recognize CAAC certification The FAA has been suspected of dragging its feet to avoid adding credibility to Chinesebuilt aircraft and potentially harming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in the process The C was a clean sheet try at competing with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus Comac took a completely new approach to the development and brought in expat engineers from abroad who had previously worked at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus along with some local talent In addition rather than trying to do everything in China COMAC decided to work with suppliers who had the expertise needed to make the project a success The aircraft has racked up orders to date from China and Thailand and overall the project is looking like a much greater success than initially Ryanair NASDAQ RYAAY and British Airways were even brought onboard to help with the development of it and Ryanair CEO expressed heavy interest in ordering the aircraft at some point in the future It turns out many of the experts China decided to work with to develop the C are American firms I was shocked to see how much of the aircraft is made in America It starts to become a question of how Chinese is it with design work from many foreigners and many parts all American made Another interesting point is that many of the Chinese made parts are also parts that international companies such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus use in their aircraft Some of these parts made in China used on Western aircraft include the Bombardier Q fuselage vertical fin tail cone and doors as shown below Img <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>components made in China A similar strategy was deployed when China first introduced high speed rail into its country It brought in foreign companies to provide the rail in partnerships with domestic companies It then gradually began switching the parts over to domestic parts as it quickly gained the technical expertise and knowhow from working with international suppliers COMAC has made no secret of the fact that it would like the aircraft to eventually be powered by Chinese engines and use more Chinese technology over time Img A Chinese built MD at Delta Airlines Many Americans do every day It is a little known fact that Delta Air Lines NYSE DAL operates several Chinese built MD aircraft that many Americans unknowingly fly on every day Similar to the C the MD was designed in the USA and assembled in China with largely American parts In Tianjin Airbus successfully manufactures its A jet for many of its Chinese customers Just as the Japanese overcame a stereotype that they were cheap and low quality the Chinese overtime will be able to do the same if they develop a solid product This question is a complicated one and there are dozens of things taken into account when ordering an aircraft Price is a big factor and with the C being subsidized by the Chinese government and the labor costs of Chinese assembly workers being less than that of their American counterparts the Chinese will have an advantage in cost Next up comes availability If an airline requires X number of aircraft by a certain date and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>or Airbus cannot deliver they may seriously consider the C as an alternative This however is not such a problem anymore Before the financial crisis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus had years and years of backlog for their and A aircraft and kept their production rates low causing in some cases these aircraft to be resold used for higher prices due to their immediate availability Since then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus have had numerous production hikes likely to bring down their unit costs per jet in an attempt to compete better with the Chinese and also to soak the market to an extent Finally and this is a big one is politics Many airlines around the world are still state run or are largely influenced by the state Aircraft are usually the largest single good a country will import by value so there is a desire to try and get favors in return for spending so much money Japan tries to sway its airlines to purchase <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aircraft since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>performs a lot of manufacturing in Japan in return Meanwhile countries such as Israel and close American allies will buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aircraft almost with no second thought When Indonesia ordered a record number of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aircraft the CEO was reported as saying he did not have a choice and was pressured by government officials to buy the American aircraft A similar situation played out when Air China ordered aircraft and John Leathy was reported as saying they were unable to sell the A to China as it was a political purchase Vueling airlines of Spain was pressured to buy Airbus aircraft in return for additional landing slots at Paris So economics technology and price aside as China becomes a bigger partner to many countries around the world going forward many countries will be pressured to buy Chinese aircraft just as many are pressured to buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus today The shortage of landing slots at key Chinese airports and the ability for the Chinese to use this as a bargaining chip in securing overseas orders is also overlooked Delta strikes me as an opportunistic airline in the US who may look to purchase Chinesemade aircraft once they receive FAA certification in return for additional prime landing slots at key Chinese airports The ARJ was a disaster however I do not believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shareholders should write off the C due to this COMAC has taken a completely different approach when designing this aircraft and the approach looks like it will be much more successful and convincing to international customers that the aircraft is a solid product with top quality parts from around the world The Chinese will undoubtedly pressure their airlines to order as many of the aircraft as possible to reduce the huge sums of money that flow out of the country annually to import Western aircraft That alone will have the potential to sell huge volumes and in addition the Chinese ability to use politics and slots to win orders is something I believe many have overlooked and something that could drive a large number of overseas orders for this aircraft Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please
