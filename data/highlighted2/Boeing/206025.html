style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>sits on the assembly line at the companys operations in Everett Washington in this October file photo NEW YORKPARIS An airlines warning of a bubble in the market for used jetliners shows how vulnerable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co BAN may be because of slowing sales of its widebody jets and fueled speculation that it may have to cut the planes production rate Delta Air Lines Inc DALN CEO Richard Anderson said on Wednesday he expects prices for used twinaisle jets to fall and that the weakness will spread to singleaisle planes presenting airlines with some huge buying opportunities <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>which is due to report its thirdquarter earnings next Wednesday needs to secure orders for about more s at its current rate of production before its successor the X enters service in Orders for the current generation of aircraft have fallen from in to in and just so far this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>which declined to comment for this article has repeatedly said it is confident of making the transition to the new model without cutting production But some industry consultants and aircraft appraisers see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>struggling to achieve those sales and expect it to cut its current permonth production rate That could hurt profits and cash flow as it delivers fewer planes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is going to have to slow down the production rate said Gueric Dechavanne a vice president at appraisal firm Collateral Verifications Falling prices for used widebody planes especially Boeings older ER are making new sales more difficult Prices for ERs are down about percent over the last year said Rob Morris head of consultancy at UKbased Ascend an aviation appraisal and consulting firm Ascend estimates such aircraft are parked and out of service representing about percent of the global fleet Around of the aircraft will be available on the market within the next months the firm predicts Availability has increased while demand is weak Morris said Some of Airbuss A longhaul jets also face slower demand That is partly because of interest in a fuelefficient successor known as the Aneo and due out in But Airbus believes it has adjusted for this by twice cutting planned production rates WHY PAY RETAIL The comments by Deltas Anderson triggered a plunge in the shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Airbus AIRPA and some big suppliers such as Spirit AeroSystems Holdings SPRN a major parts maker <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Spirit shares recovered some of those losses on Thursday as some on Wall Street played down the talk of a bubble While demand for widebodies is soft we believe the magnitude of that pressurewas grossly overstated Wells Fargo analyst Sam Pearlstein wrote on Thursday My wife wants that threebedroom apartment in Manhattan for and she has as much a chance of getting it as Mr Anderson does at getting a million yearold B wrote Jefferies analyst Howard Rubel referring to a price the Delta chief cited on Wednesday Most analysts said that they didnt agree with Andersons warning that the weakness could spread to narrowbody jets given huge demand for the smaller planes A Delta spokesman declined to elaborate on Andersons comments but said the airlines fleet strategy was opportunistic Modern aircraft are built to stay in service for years or more and are often traded between airlines during their lives providing values that serve as a barometer of jet prices Low fuel prices have encouraged some airlines to think twice about spending billions of dollars on new fuelsaving models Cheap used planes can help airlines bridge the few years until they can get the fuelefficient Xs or Aneos Airlines have to tack on million to million to the sale price of a used plane to refresh the cabin and overhaul the engines but even with those costs the used planes are significantly cheaper than a new one A yearold ER or A currently costs about million and prices are falling down about percent and five percent from last year respectively according to Collateral Verifications data Cheaper used planes probably wont affect new plane prices much some industry experts said Manufacturers are keen to preserve profit margins for new planes by avoiding deep discounting And airlines that want the most efficient plane are still willing to pay a significant price for new Dechavanne said Whats Next Tomorrows Digital Life Thomson Reuters is the worlds largest international multimedia news agency providing investing news world news business news
