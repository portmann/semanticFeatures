today as they were preceding the global economic crash years ago Bailins are now the rule As far as the Central Banks are concerned this is a good thing because if investorsdepositors were ever to try and convert even a small portion of this wealth into actual physical The World Platinum Council do not believe that platinum stocks will be completely depleted and reach zero because the amount

Icahn whose billion in AAPL holdings makes him nearly a x bigger holder of the stock than the Swiss National Bank is correct and AAPL is truly worth share today or about trillion roughly equivalent to of US GDP then this is how AAPL would rank if it were a sovereign nation and yes we know comparing market cap to GDP is idiotic but so is everything else these days For the purists at share AAPL would be x larger than the entire market cap of the Italian or Swedish stock market x larger than all Spanish public companies combined it would be almost the same size as the market cap of all Swiss companies and is just about of the market cap of Germany or France Mon slotmouth Mon nuclearsquid Mon BlindMonkey Mon KnuckleDraggerX Its not rotten its the living embodiment of our modern society Sadly this is the world as it is and not much hope left for a soft landing and reset I guess death and destruction are the coming cool thing Mon Skateboarder Mon Butterflying My last pay check was

Mon DetectiveStern Mon HonkyShogun How does the Russian Federation have such a high GDP I thought the Zios sanctioned them or some such shit Mon pods My wife went to upgrade her phone of course Apple and the people at the Verizon store were just gaga over Apple The one chick sitting there was talking about the watch and how her and her dad were in competition on geting one blah blah blah She suggested to my wife to get a certain color case because it doesnt show makeup on it Like if you apply a lot of makeup like I do One guy piped up that you can draw on it and send the picture to others I about had to wash that place off of me when we left You would seriously pay for a way to send doodles to your friends Mon Jeff Cosford Are you kidding me we pay ballplayers s of millions per player in salary A watch is nothing Small compared to the need to fill freetime Not everything has to be in the stricktest sense productive Maybe when we get our priorities straight vis a vis ballplayers and say a school that really teaches somewhere then your on ot something Mon e You are comparing GDP to market cap a better comparison would be GDP to revenue instead The US isnt worth B it just has that much revenue Mon venturen I am getting a car loan and student loan and going to go all in on AAPLit is all about LEVERAGE Mon qx That much power with no morality means we are all doomed unless of

store to try the watch out of curiosity the thing is the biggest POS i have ever seen completely uselessunusable Mon TheRideNeverEnds Once you consider the future QE guaranteed and everyone knows it only unknown is who when and how all stocks are grossly undervalued and since Apple is a stock Mon Counterpunch All stocks are overvalued or most the thing is relative degree of overvaluation and ability to expand to innovate and to get repeat customers Apples inroads into China continue to develop india will be next but Chinese companies will block expansion at some stage Icahn naturally overstates it but it remains one of the best tech stocks Essentially any argument apple bashers make applies even more to other tech companies all this said if you go on amazon say and search for tablets and order lowest to highest price some of those low end companies are probably great buys Mon Anglo Hondo Mon Loucleve Icahn got crushed on RIG where he accumulated a stake at it hit when oil tanked and I wet my pants Mon Dr Gonzo I bought an Ipod touch years ago its nice I bought or newsongs for it too after I burned all my old CDsbut thats the only apple product Ive ever boughtNo plans
