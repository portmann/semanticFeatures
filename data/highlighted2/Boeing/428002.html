for airliners worth B <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus divide the market but Airbus has the advantage for now China will play <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus against each other Future orders and developments will indicate who will become market leader The Chinese airliner market will grow into the largest in the world Although the US and Europe are still the biggest markets now the fastest growing is China Replacements and new orders will be worth B over the next years Airbus OTCPKEADSY and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA divide the market Fleet age and connections with Chinas stateowned aviation industry indicate that Airbus has the advantage for now But China will play Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>for its own advantage New orders and developments will indicate who will become the future market leader Important indicators are What will the stateowned airlines order What will the Low Cost Carriers order Will the capacity of new airliners grow Airbus A versus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX In absolute numbers the US and Europe are still the largest markets for air travel China is increasing but is a distant third The relative numbers tell a different story China is growing much faster than the other regions The rise in the Arab world is the hubstrategy employed by the United Arab Emirates Emirates and Qatar Qatar Airways to become a transfer hub for the rest of the world Europe is increasing slightly but the US market has hardly grown during the last decade The US and Europe are large but will become mature markets in the next decades The main battlefield for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus will be China China has a quarter of the world population and China is growing fast <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Current Market Outlook Over the next two decades fast growth in Chinas domestic market will make it the largest domestic market in the world and traffic within Asia is set to become the largest travel market China is the latest region to embrace the LCC model with a large increase in the number of entrants in the past two years Although the vast majority of this activity has been in shorthaul markets using singleaisle airplanes the region is beginning to see joint ventures flying widebody airplanes on mediumhaul operations in response to strong traffic growth It is expected that by passenger travel between China and the United States will triple This growth will drive a need for at least new widebody airplanes valued at billion Included in this number is a demand for widebody freighters valued at billion Airbus Global Market Forecast On the other hand within or between developed countries the gap in terms of product offering and business models between legacy carriers and LCCs has narrowed in recent years The PRC however is an exception to this trend where LCCs have captured above market share intraregionally and less than domestically There appears therefore to be opportunities for further development in LCC operations from to and within China this would also serve to increase the connectivity between growing population centres within China and with the rest of the region However in terms of growth rates Western regions will experience higher rates within the next decade This movement of economic activity westwards should be mirrored by aviation development as cities in the centre and west grow and need improved transportation and connectivity with the rest of China and Asia Aviation has demonstrated in the past that it is ideally suited for this purpose being more cost and land effective than other mass transportation modes not to mention the benefits of speed which are unmatched Airbus doesnt focus on the domestic market and existing international traffic flows alone but also views the regional growth The growth potential of Africa which is the worlds fastest growing region and its strong connections with China is taken into account The market share of the airlines operating specifically in each subregion has followed a similar pattern with airlines domiciled in the PRC increasing their market share from of AsiaPacifics total Available Seat per Kilometre ASK in to in Over the period international origin and destination traffic between Africa and China has grown more than ten times with nearly million monthly OD passengers traveling by air between the two Airbus predicts a much larger market demand for China which can be attributed to the internationalintraregional vision The Airbus very large widebody the A estimate however is unlikely high and optimistic Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>share the market A more detailed view is created by looking at the average age Hong Kong is excluded as well as orders The backlog is huge and orders might be delivered many years from now Fleet age reflects the present situation and shows the average age Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>dominate the Chinese market Bombardier OTCQXBDRAF OTCQXBDRBF and Embraer NYSE ERJ have a small share in the smaller airliner segment Split into narrow body single aisle and widebody <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>leads with older single aisle airliners and Airbus leads with newer widebody airliners Changing the Status Quo what is important Looking at the current data Airbus has the advantage over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Airbus airliners in use are on average younger and Airbus has more extensive links with the Chinese aviation industry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will open a Completion Center in China The interior will be finished and the airliner painted This is a first step to strengthen the hold on the Chinese market China will demand more transfer of activities such as a Final Assembly Line as the next step Airbus is strategically Asiaoriented AsiaPacific is the first region in the outlook showing the importance Airbus considers AsiaPacific as the growth region for the th century This is also visible in the large cooperation between China and Airbus China will get a second Final Assembly Line for narrowbody airliners in and an A widebody Completion Delivery Center is under construction Airbus also owns of AviChina OTCAVIJF and is the largest foreign shareholder AviChina is one of the daughters of the AVIC which is a stateowned aerospace and defense company AVIC is one of the largest companies in the world Future orders deliveries and developments will determine which company will benefit from the growth China will use the competition between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus to its own advantage The A widebody Completion Delivery Center could become a Final Assembly Line If this happens it would be a major development with major consequences for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>In Airbus Going For Growth Boeings ability to produce more widebody aircraft is shown The A is a cashcow for Airbus as a competitor for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and an extra FAL would help speed up the plus backlog The successful A multi role tanker transport has also nibbled production capacity away over the years Another option could be the A but that doesnt make sense Airbus Composite Materials is owned by AviChina and HAIFEI which in part is majority owned by AviChina This indicates Chinas interest in composite materials although they probably will be used for the COMAC C What will the stateowned airlines order Air China China Eastern which is the parent company of LCC China United Airlines and China Southern are government owned Although it is unlikely that they switch to a single manufacturer and they will use orders as bargaining chips for international policy or access to technology Both Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>see growth in Low Cost Carriers LCC in China LCC often use a single aircraft type to reduce maintenance costs and negotiate a better discount China United Airlines <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Spring Airlines Airbus and West Air Airbus are the largest LCCs Air Ruili Airlines and Urumqi Air are smaller and have all chosen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>At the moment Airbus leads both in numbers and in age Chart by Confero based on Chinese airline fleet data Click to enlarge Will the capacity of airliners keep growing Most of Chinese airspace is military and strictly regulated This limits both available landing and takeoff slots as well as the timewindow available for these scheduled flights Frequently flights have to return to departure airports because the timewindows cannot be reached anymore This severely limits increasing scheduled flights and indirectly forces airlines to order airliners with more capacity Airbus A versus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX Narrow body airliners are getting bigger in number of seats The A airliners are the youngest narrow body in use and can carry passengers The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX is Boeings equivalent and almost equals the A with passengers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will have to sell these to Chinese airlines to keep pace Selling these to LCCs would be a good segment for this The A regional is designed for domestic and regional use with a lower takeoff weight It was designed for the Asian market India and China It could be a good candidate for a first widebody Final Assembly Line in China The average age shows that the Airbus widebody airliners are a lot younger than the average <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>widebody This could indicate that older <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>widebody aircraft will be replaced by new aircraft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Dreamliners are entering service now but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>lags in numbers and average age This could indicate a shift towards Airbus Conclusion who will become market leader Decision making and policy in China is often a black box In most cases there is a strategic longterm vision involved Even nonstate actors depend on tacit approval from the Chinese authorities The Chinese longterm is counted in generations and not in years When new orders are announced or news is published on Chinese commercial aviation they often contain valuable information on the direction The questions above can be used as indicators or triggers for the direction that will be taken The average age and composition of airline fleets are a snapshot of the current situation Combined they will provide insight if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>or Airbus will become the market leader in the fastgrowing Chinese airliner market Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
