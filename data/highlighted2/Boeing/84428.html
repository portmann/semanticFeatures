<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>finally admits that production rates will be cut The rate cut will lower revenue by annually In some of my previous articles I dealt with the discounts and performance upgrade package on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA which should help the company close the production gap it is facing on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program The discounts will put a bit of pressure on margins for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>In the article from December I had concluded that a production rate cut is likely despite company management claiming otherwise <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>recently admitted that the rate will be cut The company will cut the production rate of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>from per month to per month starting in This means that the jet maker will deliver only <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>airframes per year instead of The current discounted value of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER is mln So starting in until probably until the end of start of the company will generate a bn lower revenue on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program Although it is good news that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has finally admitted that it has to cut production rates the way they did come out with it is disturbing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Vice President Elizabeth Lund said the following weBoeing will feather in with some blanks This basically means that there would be some production slots left unoccupied these slots will be used to start production on the X parts but what the VP said next raises some questions Yes you would deliver one less airplane the month that you get to delivery but that is not a rate break In terms of the allocation of workforce this is indeed not a rate cut but in terms of production and delivery it is certainly a cut and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>VP seems to be extremely unwilling to admit this Since the jet maker is basically cutting production and delivery for the current <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>the VPs statement that there would be no rate changes is unsettling <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>CEO Jim McNerney also acknowledged there would be a little dip but claimed this dip was not related to low demand for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>but instead was related to the transition from the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X So Mr McNerney does acknowledge the rate cut but denies that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>cannot fill the empty slots Although I think the words from Mr McNerney have a bit more truth in them they are different from his previous statement during the Q results presentation when he said he was confident about maintaining production rate and bridging the gap I mentioned the production skyline in and and its beginning to firm up So were increasingly confident that we can implement this bridge and its important not only commercially and to keep the rate going The way I see it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is having a hard time admitting that a rate cut is required due higher slot availability than demand for the airframe It is indeed necessary and will result in a lower revenue and profit on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program starting in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>seems to be trying to trick investors and analysts by denying the rate cut calling it out as standard procedure when switching production from one model to the other Although this is partly true the fact that no <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Xs will be rolling out of the factories until and that only <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s will be produced instead of will make this a rate cut <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>first claimed it would be able sustain current production rates for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>until the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X enters service in The fact that the company will slash production in poses question on how many orders it is expecting to fill the remaining slots after the rate cut The good news here is that the cut comes years later than I expected it would
