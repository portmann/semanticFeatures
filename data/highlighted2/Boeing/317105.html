BAN shares plunged as much as percent on Thursday hit by a report that regulators are probing the companys accounting and by mounting concerns about slowing sales and production The US Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>properly accounted for the costs and expected sales of two of its biggest jetliners the and Bloomberg reported on Thursday citing people with knowledge of the matter The SEC under Chair Mary Jo White has stepped up scrutiny of corporate accounting practices The company declined to comment on the Bloomberg report We typically do not comment on media inquiries of this nature a spokesman said On Wednesday <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said that competitive pressures from rival Airbus AIRPA were prompting it to cut middlemanagement and executive ranks at its commercial airplane unit to reduce costs It also warned that it might face about billion in charges for the and programs if it cannot sell more of both aircraft The issues at a time when Boeings jetliner order book is bursting with billion in orders show the deep financial hole that the has dug for the worlds biggest plane maker The hightech jet has racked up more than billion in deferred production and tooling costs that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has not yet charged against its income statement It is perhaps the eyewatering size of this deferred balance that has drawn the SECs interest RBC analyst Robert Stallard wrote in a research note on Thursday Boeings shares ended down

accounting method known as program accounting to defer the costs of producing jetliners and spread them over a large block of airplanes For the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has delivered just over a quarter of the planes it has sold It seems way too early to make a judgment call on whether Boeings estimates for manufacturing costs are wrong said Peter Arment an analyst at Sterne Agee who recommended buying the stock on Thursday Its too early to book a charge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been accused of leaning on auditors in the past The company dismissed two audit employees in for leaking information about problems with the companys compliance with SarbanesOxley rules on computer security At the same time the accuracy of program accounting is a longstanding concern within <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said John Tollefsen a lawyer in Lynnwood Washington He said he is not involved in the
