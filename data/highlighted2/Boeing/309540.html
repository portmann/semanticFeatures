</span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>BA beat earnings estimates but earnings overall have dropped since the previous year While the MAX is expected to be delivered ahead of schedule the Airbus Aneo will still be delivered faster <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has seen a significant downturn in the cargo and defense markets In my last analysis of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA I had given a personal view that the stock may remain rangebound for some time as a result of a potential decline in widebody aircraft demand going forward In this context I had made the recommendation that investors should wait for the Q earnings release before deciding whether or not to take a long position in the company In spite of earnings meeting estimates I am still skeptical as to the companys potential performance this year With Q earnings having beaten estimates the company has also met my forecasted earnings target I had predicted that on the basis of projected earnings growth for Boeings earnings should reach given a discount rate With a EPS for earnings are on target assuming a percent growth rate for subsequent years Moreover <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has just raised its dividend per quarter to which on an annualized basis will meet the dividend target for While earnings have beaten analyst estimates EPS overall has fallen by roughly percent since In this regard while EPS has beaten estimates I stand by my assertion that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should be seeing growth in dividends and earnings to the tune of at least percent or above to justify longterm growth Previously I had mentioned that competition from Airbus OTCPKEADSY in the narrowbody aircraft market could pose a competitive threat to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in this regard This is particularly since the industry has appeared to increasingly favor utilizing smaller aircraft on longhaul routes in recent years and this trend could be set to continue Nevertheless <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has kicked off with somewhat of a positive surprise since the company is expected to fulfill deliveries of the MAX model earlier than expected According to the Wall Street Journal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will deliver the first model to Southwest Airlines in Q and the aircraft is said to be at least percent more fuel efficient than previous models Should <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>succeed in early deliverance of the aircraft this will be quite a significant success since the has accounted for just under percent of the companys overall operating profit Moreover with an order commitment of MAX planes by European lowcost carrier Ryanair NASDAQ RYAAY the aircraft is set to see significant demand going forward While this is positive news for the North American and European markets Asia tells a different story Much of Boeings success will hinge on how effectively the model can compete with the Airbus Aneo which is set to deliver aircraft by In this context <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could face a significant hurdle in that an earlier delivery by Airbus has highly appealed to Asian carriers such as AirAsia OTCAIABF which rely significantly on shorthaul routes Therefore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been losing significant ground in the Asian market due to an inability to keep up with Airbus in the narrowbody market Moreover while Boeings MAX does hold some promise for the company other business lines have been declining I had previously made reference to the fact that a significant rise in the cargo market would be needed to ensure higher sales of the However this does not show signs of materializing and the company is set to scale back production of the from per month to per month Additionally Boeings Defense Space Security division has also seen losses with net earnings of billion in representing a percent decline from that of the previous year Moreover the company projects that it will fall short of the billion in revenue expected by analysts instead coming in between billion and billion To conclude <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>still faces significant risks in the narrowbody aircraft market and the cargo and defense business lines are on the decline In this context I am still not convinced that a long position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is sustainable at this time </div></body></html>
