Million <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER Does Not Compare To A Brand New Dreamliner Part The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Lower purchase price provides a mln advantage Fitting a modern cabin into the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER will add significantly to the costs Delta NYSE DAL CEO Richard Anderson shocked <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA investors claiming that it could obtain used <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ERs from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>for a price of mln This of course put some pressure on Boeings share prices as more and more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s will come off lease in the coming years and this could seriously impact Boeings order inflow for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>It is not the first time Delta is not favoring new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aircraft in Delta favored Airbus OTCPKEADSF bid replacement of the older wide bodies over Boeings In this article I will have a look at how the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER compares to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Dreamliner which could be used as a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER replacement Figure Comparison market value secondhand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Source wwwAeroAnalysisnet What is clear is that mln for a yearold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER is reasonable Fitting a modern cabin into this yearold aircraft might add another mln in costs Assuming that no other major replacements are required the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER that Delta bought for mln will actually cost mln to bring it to todays standards in terms of comfort This still is much cheaper than the mln for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The lower market value also means that Deltas insurance costs for this airframe are lower Typically the annual insurance costs are of the market value for new aircraft For older aircraft this can be as high as In this case I will apply of the market value for the secondhand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>giving it the maximum penalty possible Figure Comparison annual insurance costs secondhand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Source AeroAnalysis What can be seen is that the insurance costs for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>are almost mln lower per annum compared to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Figure Comparison annual depreciation secondhand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Source AeroAnalysis The depreciation depends on how many years the aircraft will be in service For the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER I assumed that the aircraft can operate about years before needing its next heavy maintenance at which point Delta probably will get rid of the airframe The value after years is assumed to be almost zero For the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I used a year depreciation model with a value after years Figure Advantage ownership costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER Source AeroAnalysis Figure shows that the annual ownership costs and the purchase prices for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER yield an advantage of almost mln over the remaining economical viable life of the aircraft One would say this shifts the advantage to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER without doubt However to put this cost advantage into context it is important to have a look at the difference in revenue as well Generally one would say the reliability of an older aircraft will be less However with average dispatch reliabilities in excess of for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>the gap seems to be small Nevertheless loss of revenue days should be taken into account but this is hard to quantify Table Seat count and ticket prices Assuming that the flight is operated on average times per day this includes downtime for maintenance with a load factor of and the seat count and ticket prices as shown in Table the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a mln advantage per annum What can be concluded is that a major part of the costs to purchase the aircraft are already being compensated for in the first year of service Despite the higher costs of ownership for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>the higher revenue potential makes the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>an interesting candidate to evaluate This article focused solely on the cost of ownership and market value In the following pieces I will add the costs of maintenance crew navigation and fuel as well I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any
