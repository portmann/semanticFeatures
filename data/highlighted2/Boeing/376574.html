Look At Boeings Commercial Orders And Deliveries In January The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha January orders were boosted by order for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>January deliveries are in line with expectations In I started the monthly wrap ups of orders and deliveries of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA and Airbus OTCPKEADSF aircraft In I will continue this series of articles Despite the month of January having passed quite a while ago I will still dedicate an article to the January order inflow and deliveries in order to keep a complete overview for the entire year Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>orders up until January Source AeroAnalysisnet In January <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>booked orders with orders for its singleaisle product and orders for a widebody aircraft With of the orders being for narrow body aircraft the order inflow was rather unbalanced In terms of value the narrow body orders accounted for of the market value while the wide body order inflow accounted for the remaining At list prices the orders are valued at bn but after discounts the orders have a market value of bn Air China ordered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ERs probably this order was part of the mega order placed by China in Order inflow was boosted by an order for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s from United Airlines NYSE UAL worth bn at list prices Remaining orders include order for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and order for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>BBJ MAX Yearoveryear <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>booked significantly more orders In the same month last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>booked just orders versus the orders in January Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>deliveries up until January Source AeroAnalysis Important to note is that Boeings guidance implies a lower delivery target compared to The jet maker expects to deliver between and airframes in compared to targeted deliveries in Despite expected deliveries standing at average per month deliveries were in line with expectations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>delivered airframes in January compared to deliveries in January or out of all deliveries was a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I was delivered to Korean Air Various operators took delivery of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ERs Dreamliners were delivered of which are <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s It can be concluded that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will have the overhand in the Dreamliner deliveries which bodes well for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as the aircraft has higher profit margins Just like in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is targeting a booktobill ratio In January <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>booked orders and delivered airframes resulting in a booktobill ratio of If the number of average needed deliveries to meet the delivery target is being used the book to bill ratio is also in excess of This shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had a moth in which it realized its book to bill ratio However with only month having passed nothing can be said about Boeings full year performance Order inflow was boosted by an order for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>which accounted for out of the orders Deliveries were in line with expectations So far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>managed to realize a booktobill ratio in excess of but with months remaining a lot can happen In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>achieved its booktobill target at the very last moment Despite lower anticipated deliveries in I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to be facing a major challenge to achieve its booktobill target In April I published an article in which I said that the order books of jet makers are not bubbles but should decline at some point In that article I shared my thoughts and expected order inflow to decline in a few years from now With oil prices having declined ever since chances are the order books will decline sooner than I expected at first With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>just barely meeting its target last year might be the year in which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will not achieve its booktobill ratio This however is not necessarily a bad thing although a lot of investors and analysts might think so I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business
