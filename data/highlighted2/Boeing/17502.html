facet of the operations Id like to see the company increase the asset turnover ratio to be able to increase the ROE some more The company increased its ROE by basis points from the prior quarter Most investors take a look at return on equity as a measure of how well a company is doing with respect to net income as a ratio to shareholders equity on the balance sheet Companies such as IBM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>or Altria even have huge returns on equity Typically a high return on equity value is pretty nice to have but not all returns on equity are equal Although it is a straight ratio as suggested it is a bit more complex than that Not many investors know this but return on equity can actually be decomposed into three parts made popular by DuPont back in the s The decomposition of return on equity tells us three things Operating efficiency which is measured by profit margin Asset use efficiency which is measured by total asset turnover Financial leverage which is measured by the equity multiplier Prepare yourself for some algebra I promise it will be pretty easy We already know that profit margins are dictated by the equation of profitsales Total asset turnover is dictated by the equation of salesassets and the equity multiplier is dictated by the equation of assetsequity So when we multiply them all together we get the following proof I for one am looking at return on equity in a much different manner now after learning this method The part of the proof above that got me to investigate ROE more intently is the equity multiplier portion Depending on how a company chooses to finance its assets by debt or by equity the equity multiplier can be really huge causing the overall return on equity to be high Personally I dont like a whole lot of debt on the balance sheet But for capital structuring reasons debt can be used as a tax shield as taxes are calculated after interest payments Ive chosen to evaluate Disney NYSE DIS today because since Ive been writing about the company the return on equity has been increasing with the following profile As mentioned earlier operating efficiency is the profit divided by the sales This in essence tells us how efficiently the company is operating from an operations financial and tax perspective From the table below we see that the profit margin increased by for Disney from the fourth quarter to the first quarter We see that net income has increased and sales increased over the period but at a lower clip Nonetheless profit margins increased which means the increase in ROE was partially due to the increasing profit margin From the equation I showed above the total asset turnover ratio is defined by sales divided by assets Total asset turnover gives us the big picture of how well the company is transforming all of its assets into sales From the table below we see that the total asset turnover actually increased from the fourth quarter to the first quarter Total sales increased slightly while average assets increased at a lower clip This portion of the equation tells us that the ROE increase was not really related to Disneys ability to make more money on their assets because the increase was negligible The equity multiplier is the part of the ROE equation that I dont like Its with this portion of the equation that a company can choose to get risky or play it safe It completely depends on how the company manages its debt equity and on how well the cash flows are coming in to pay those debts From the previous portions of the equation we pretty much determined that the ROE has increased thanks to the increase in profit margin but we still have to look at the equity multiplier An equity multiplier number of is pretty good for my taste But it isnt until we break it out like I did in the tables below that we can see if it is a good thing or a bad thing As we can see assets have increased and equity has decreased causing the equity multiplier to increase by If we dig a little further we see that the equity value decreased primarily because of an increase in share buybacks over the past year In a recent study performed by MoffettNathanson it was determined that ESPN would have to charge if it were to go the way of a la carte service I have to say that is a pretty good price considering I like sports I would definitely pay that amount if I could get rid of all the other fluff that my cable provider gives me With the recent talk of unbundling programs it would be good for Disney to be able to provide ESPN to the masses on either a payperview style program or the entire channel for the month and a fee Disneys return on equity is increasing from the prior quarter and it is primarily increasing because of the increasing profit margins When you multiply all the numbers together you get an ROE of an increase of from the previous quarter This ROE makes Disney the th highest in the entertainment diversified industry out of companies Id like to see Disney increase its asset turnover number closer to one but that would mean they have to balance that by trying to increase the profit margins as well otherwise the ROE would remain stagnant Disclaimer This article is in no way a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned This article is meant to serve as a journal for
