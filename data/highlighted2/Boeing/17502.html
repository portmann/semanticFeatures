Typically a high return on equity value is pretty nice to have, but not all returns on equity are equal.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Although it is a straight ratio as <b>suggested</b> , it is a bit <i>more</i> complex than that .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Not many investors know this, but return on equity can actually be decomposed into three parts, made popular by DuPont back in the 1920s.The decomposition of return on equity tells us three things: Operating efficiency, which is measured by profit margin Asset use efficiency, which is measured by total asset turnover Financial leverage, which is measured by the equity multiplier Prepare yourself for some algebra; I promise it will be pretty easy.We already know that profit margins are dictated by the equation of profit/sales.Total asset turnover is dictated by the equation of sales/assets and the equity multiplier is dictated by the equation of assets/equity.So when we multiply them all together we get the following proof: I for one am looking at return on equity in a much different manner now after learning this method.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The part of the proof above that got me to investigate ROE <i>more</i> intently is the equity multiplier portion .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Depending</b> on how a company chooses to finance its assets ( by debt or by equity ) , the equity multiplier can be really huge , causing the overall return on equity to be high .  (Uncertainty) </span>Personally I don't like a whole lot of debt on the balance sheet.But for capital structuring reasons debt can be used as a tax shield as taxes are calculated after interest payments.I've chosen to evaluate Disney (NYSE: DIS ) today because since I've been writing about the company the return on equity has been increasing with the following profile.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As mentioned <i>earlier</i> , operating efficiency is the profit divided by the sales .  (Surprise) </span>This in essence tells us how efficiently the company is operating from an operations, financial, and tax perspective.From the table below we see that the profit margin increased by 2.29% for Disney from the fourth quarter to the first quarter.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We see that net income has increased and sales increased over the period but at a <i>lower</i> clip .  (Surprise) </span>Nonetheless, profit margins increased which means the increase in ROE was partially due to the increasing profit margin.From the equation I showed above, the total asset turnover ratio is defined by sales divided by assets.Total asset turnover gives us the big picture of how well the company is transforming all of its assets into sales.From the table below we see that the total asset turnover actually increased from the fourth quarter to the first quarter.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Total sales increased slightly while average assets increased at a <i>lower</i> clip .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This portion of the equation tells us that the ROE increase was not really related to Disney 's ability to make <i>more</i> money on their assets because the increase was negligible .  (Surprise) </span>The equity multiplier is the part of the ROE equation that I don't like.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's with this portion of the equation that a company can choose to get <b>risky</b> or play it safe .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It completely <b>depends</b> on how the company manages its debt , equity , and on how well the cash flows are coming in to pay those debts .  (Uncertainty) </span>From the previous portions of the equation we pretty much determined that the ROE has increased thanks to the increase in profit margin but we still have to look at the equity multiplier.An equity multiplier number of 1.88 is pretty good for my taste.But it isn't until we break it out like I did in the tables below that we can see if it is a good thing or a bad thing.As we can see assets have increased and equity has decreased, causing the equity multiplier to increase by 1.08%.If we dig a little further we see that the equity value decreased primarily because of an increase in share buybacks over the past year.In a recent study performed by MoffettNathanson it was determined that ESPN would have to charge $36.30 if it were to go the way of a la carte service.I have to say that is a pretty good price considering I like sports.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I would definitely pay that amount if I <b>could</b> get rid of all the other fluff that my cable provider gives me .  (Uncertainty) </span>With the recent talk of unbundling programs it would be good for Disney to be able to provide ESPN to the masses on either a pay-per-view style program or the entire channel for the month and a fee.Disney's return on equity is increasing from the prior quarter and it is primarily increasing because of the increasing profit margins.When you multiply all the numbers together you get an ROE of 17.47%, an increase of 4.47% from the previous quarter.This ROE makes Disney the 7th highest in the entertainment - diversified industry (out of 18 companies).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I 'd like to see Disney increase its asset turnover number <i>closer</i> to one but that would mean they have to balance that by trying to increase the profit margins as well otherwise the ROE would remain stagnant .
