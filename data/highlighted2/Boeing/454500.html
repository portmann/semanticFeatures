Look At Boeings Commercial Orders And Deliveries In June The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Order overview of July will give better insight on possible slowdown in order inflow The order battle between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA and Airbus OTCPKEADSF OTCPKEADSY is one of the ways for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus to flex their muscles next to marketing their products as the best solution with the highest fuel efficiency and passenger comfort Despite the fact that the orders in terms of value are in no way a reflection of financial performance it is important to have a look at the order inflow since it gives a nice idea of which manufacturer offers the best mix of discount comfort slot availability and efficiency In this article I will have a look at the order inflow during June for both manufacturers and have a look at their role in the narrow and wide body market In June Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>together hauled in orders compared to in the same month last year This figure is skewed due to the Paris Air Show taking place in June last year Looking at how the orders were divided in June Airbus can be marked as the winner Airbus received orders while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>received orders Boeings order inflow was a mix of wide and narrow body aircraft The full report can be read here FedEx NYSE FDX ordered <span style='background-color:

During the month of June all orders were for the Airbus A An undisclosed customer ordered Airbus Aneo airframes and Airbus Aceo airframes A second undisclosed customer ordered Airbus Aceo aircraft A

cancellations and swaps leaving the jet maker with net orders yeartodate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is clearly in the lead The jet maker received orders and cancellations bringing the net orders to Order inflow in May was focused on narrow body aircraft Over of the orders was for a narrow body aircraft Both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus had a very soft June month mainly caused due to some order announcement being pushed into July for the Farnborough International Air Show <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus so far have been following different paths Airbuss orders from January up until June fell by roughly yearoveryear due to soft order inflow so far in Boeings orders were lower Both figures are somewhat skewed by the Paris Air Show event in June So far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is having a strong year not only booking more orders than Airbus but also roughly matching last years order inflow and there should be some bigger order announcements coming up in July The total order inflow for both jet makers combined was lower Sales have been strong so far especially for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>but not big enough to offset the lower Airbus sales and the high order inflow in June I am however convinced that after July we will be seeing total orders showing yearoveryear growth again Many analysts are expecting a slowdown in order inflow I expect a slowdown in order inflow as well but so far is showing some robust order inflow and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been able to write most of those orders in its order book so far If you would like to receive updates for my upcoming articles
