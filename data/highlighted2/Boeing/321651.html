<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>flag while landing after a flying display during the st Paris Air Show at Le Bourget airport near Paris June SEATTLE Some suppliers to <span

sustained in the face of slowing growth and low oil prices Consider AccraFab Inc a precision manufacturer in Spokane Washington that produces parts for Boeings and other aircraft It recently spent for highspeed punching equipment that can stamp complex metal cutouts used in housings for cockpit display screens said President Greg Konkol Were dragging our feet on two more investments worth about million Konkol said We know we have to ramp up but were being conservative about investing too much and getting overextended The situation is similar at Tech Manufacturing a maker of milled wing and airframe pieces that supplies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Airbus Bombardier BBDbTO Embraer EMBRSA Lockheed Martins LMTN F Joint Strike Fighter and business jet makers Were taking a waitandsee attitude said Frank Kimball senior vice president of sales at the company located in Wright City Missouri Tech Manufacturing bought three new machines in the last five years he said but now is looking very carefully at investing Executives have priced other new equipment they want he said But it depends on some of these bids coming in The comments made in interviews during a supplier conference in Seattle last week reflect growing caution among the thousands of companies that produce parts for plane makers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus

back costs in one to two years down from two to five years Not all suppliers are being so cagey Some say the lackluster growth forecasts and fears about falling sales of new fuelefficient planes due to low oil prices are just temporary We all know oils going to go up said Rick Taylor a vice president at ALTEK Manufacturing a parts maker in Liberty Lake Washington And if oil goes up youre right back into new aircraft demand he added This is just a snapshot in time But automation companies also report caution among some suppliers Theyre trying to plan but they dont want to get too far ahead
