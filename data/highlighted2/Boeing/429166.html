class='textDiv'>Who Is Buying The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Order book for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X primarily consists of Gulf carriers Order inflow collapsed after oil prices crashed In one of my previous articles I had a look at Boeings NYSE BA plans for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X test program and test aircraft In this article I will have a look at the order inflow and customers for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X is the next generation family of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and consists of types The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is an ultralong range aircraft that is placed between the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>LR and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER in terms of range and capacity The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has range characteristics comparable to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER but is optimized for a capacity of seats The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X was launched at the Dubai Airshow in November <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>managed to gather orders and commitments for the X marking it the most successful launch in the history of commercial aviation in terms of value The orders at commitments are valued at bn Despite the launch being a success it is interesting to look how many orders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>won for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X postlaunch and who the customers are Figure Order inflow per year for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X Source The order inflow per year shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>finalized orders in in and in In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has secured no orders for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X and I do not expect this to change either unless a deal between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Iran includes the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X The order inflow in was exceptionally high due to the order of units from Emirates was finalized It is noteworthy that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>managed to secure just postlaunch this is likely caused by a focus on selling the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER and lower oil prices As oil prices collapsed in so did order inflow for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>secured orders during times of high oil prices and was able to sell only after oil prices started dropping Figure Division orders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X Source AeroAnalysisnet What can be seen is that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is the more popular aircraft This is to be expected since the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is the aircraft with higher revenue potential while the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is the optimized for the thinner ultralong range market The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>captured over of all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X orders leaving the remaining for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>As a reference The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>LR sold over units combined with a share of for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER Figure Division orders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X by customer Source AeroAnalysisnet Looking at the order division by customer it can be seen that Emirates accounts for almost half of the total order inflow followed by Qatar Airways with a share of The other airlines all have a share in the X order book smaller than Sorting the order inflow by region it can be observed that over of the orders comes from the Middle East followed by from East Asia from Europe and belongs to an undisclosed customer While many said the Airbus OTCPKEADSF A program was carried by order inflow from Gulf carriers this holds for an even broader extent for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X Currently order inflow for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X is weak with list prices between million and million putting it in the price range of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I do not expect order inflow to increase significantly until the first airframes are being delivered This partly has to do with the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>at the moment is more concerned about selling the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Classic rather than the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X On the other hand it also has to do with low oil prices not justifying the purchase of an expensive airframe that was brought on the market to push fuel costs While fleet planning is a long term planning process the current low oil prices are not pushing airlines to secure slots for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X Since oil prices are likely to head higher again I do expect order inflow for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X to pick up pace after If you would like to receive updates for my upcoming articles please click the Follow text at the top of
