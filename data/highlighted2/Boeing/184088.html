Airbus took the lead in the order battle The order battle between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA and Airbus OTCPKEADSF OTCPKEADSY is one of the ways for the two companies to flex muscles next to marketing their products as the best solution with the highest fuel efficiency and passenger comfort Despite the fact that the orders in terms of value are in no way a reflection of financial performance it is important to have a look at the order inflow since it gives a nice idea of which manufacturer offers the best mix of discount comfort slot availability and efficiency In July <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>won the monthly battle aided by FedExs NYSE FDX mega order that was finalized In this article I will have a look at how the order inflow was divided between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus and how the orders were divided between narrow and widebody aircraft In August Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>together hauled in orders Looking at the division of the orders Airbus can be marked as the clear winner Airbus received orders while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>received just orders Whereas Boeings orders in July were lifted by orders for freighter aircraft narrowbody aircraft naturally led the way in Boeings order book in August The only widebody ordered in August was a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F for FedEx as part of the earlier announced deal for freighters Ruili Airlines finalized a deal for MAX aircraft that was announced during the Paris Air Show in June The remaining orders were placed by an unidentified customer What can be concluded is that Boeings order inflow was kept afloat by deals that were announced earlier Secondly most orders were for Boeings narrowbody families Airbus on the other hand seemed to be having a much better month after a slow July IndiGo accounted for over of the order inflow with a mega order for Airbus Aneo aircraft IAG placed an order for aircraft a mix of Airbus Aneos Airbus As and Airbus As Undisclosed customers ordered Airbus Aneos and Airbus As of the orders were for the Airbus Aneo while the widebody families accounted for of the orders Even without IndiGos mega order Airbus would end up on top of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>with orders So it is safe to say that in August Airbus won the monthly battle in terms of numbers as well as in terms of value Figure Infographic Orders July Source AeroAnalysisnet Up until July <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus were quite close to each other in the annual order battle but aided by a mega order from IndiGo Airbus took the lead <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>received orders while Airbus secured orders After cancelations Airbus booked orders while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>distantly follows with orders Whereas Airbus was trailing in the order battle until July it took the lead in August and now has almost more orders Helped by the IndiGo order Airbus ended on top in August YeartoDate Airbus took the lead in the order battle Boeings order inflow during August primarily consisted of deals that were announced at an earlier stage Yeartodate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has achieved a booktobill ratio of below the target of receiving order for each delivery Yeartodate Airbus achieved a booktobill ratio of Reason for the seemingly better booktobill is the fact that Airbus has lower production rates and therefore needs lesser orders to receive a booktobill of As an investment Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>both are nice investments but Boeings lead on the cargo and widebody market means that the jet maker is leading on the market that potentially is more profitable on a per unit basis On the other hand Airbus sees a big order inflow for its Aneo family Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US
