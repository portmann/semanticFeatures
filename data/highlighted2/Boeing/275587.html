Stone Fox Capital Stone Fox Capital clicks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>continues to run into a multitude of worries from the investment community The company offers strong capital returns to back any investment at the current levels while the competition struggles to even get planes into the air Despite record backlogs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA has traded mostly sideways for the last two years The stock started quickly moving above to now trade at only The end result is a meager capital gain though shareholders do collect a decent dividend The combination of customer claims of an over supplied commercial aircraft market and new entrants into the airplane manufacturing market clearly have investors holding back on the stock Is now the time to load up on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as the company delivers large profits while the market builds a wall of worries For a long time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus OTCPKEADSF have had a virtual duopoly on the commercial aircraft market Any disruption to this market situation would naturally hurt orders and future profit margins Naturally the big profits of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>forecasted travel growth in Asia and the record backlogs are leading to new competition Building a commercial aircraft is now easy task My previous investment research took on the fears of over supply in the market This article will focus on the worries of new entrants into the passenger plane market from Japan and China The Mitsubishi Regional Jet from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries OTCPKMHVYF is a seat regional jet with reportedly planes on order The airplane similar to all other commercial attempts around the globe is seeing big delays The latest news is that the first delivery wont take place until if even by that date The airplane isnt a direct competitor for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>planes but a quality plane could encourage carriers to move back to more regional jets The more important competition for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>at the present is the Chinese plane targeted at the narrowbody commercial airplane market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is seeing substantial orders from carriers around the world including those in China Similar to the MRJ the C made by Comac has a history of failures and delays The plane was originally launched back in and has yet to take its maiden voyage needed before moving into a lengthy production timeframe Naturally most carriers outside of China will hesitate to purchase a Chinese plane The issue though is the majority of future airplane demand will come from this country and the region The claims of over orders will eventually dent demand for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in years beyond if Comac actually gets the plane into production Noteworthy is that President Xi Jiping recently signed large deals with both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus with the intent of assembling more airplanes within China While the competition keeps talking about delivering planes sometime in the distant future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is utilizing cash from actually delivering planes now to reward shareholders The company recently increased the dividend by and raised the buyback authorization to an incredible billion With a market cap approaching billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is far too big to play games with cash If the commercial airplane manufacturer saw a realistic threat in the future the company wouldnt be repurchasing shares at these levels <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>spent billion on buybacks last year so the company is clearly not blowing smoke on the intent to utilize the available cash to retire up to billion worth of additional shares Maybe most interesting is that the increase in the quarterly dividend to brings the annual yield above With a stock buyback yield of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>now offers a net payout yield to investors The best part about buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>at these levels is the ability to buy stock knowing the company is repurchasing shares to protect the downside Keeping one eye on competitive threats is always wise for investors Not acknowledging the possibility that competitors from afar will eventually take market share isnt financially responsible For this very reason one shouldnt ever over pay for a stock like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Though ignoring the strong market position massive backlog and strong cash flows isnt prudent investing either The recommendation remains to use the current stock price and any dips to load up
