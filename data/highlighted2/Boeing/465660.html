style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>recognized B pretax charges in its Q earnings Charges have little to no impact on cash flow Boeings NYSE BA reported earnings on the th of July will be heavily impacted by a set of charges related to its most troubled programs In this article I will have a look at the charges and explain why some of them were to be expected while others were not Image courtesy of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company The biggest chart is related to a writeoff of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>test airframes that were supposed to be delivered to customers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>intended to deliver those aircraft to customers but the refurbishment has turned out to be too expensive The aircraft were once used as test aircraft and accumulated a total of test hours for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The test program consisted of test aircraft have been donated to museums and serves as the presidential aircraft for the President of Mexico The aftertax charge of million per share is taken to reclassify the aircraft from deferred balance to RD expenses I did not expect this charge it is a heritage of the earliest Dreamliners There are things that need to be noted though The first thing to be noted is that the charge does not have any impact on cash flows The second thing is that the deferred costs should be going down as the reclassification means the costs are now RD costs instead of being part of deferred costs The second charge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>recognized is a million per share aftertax charge for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program The chart reflects lower aircraft in the accounting quantity and lower revenues This basically means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>expects to sell less freighters for less money Additionally the jet maker will keep its production at per year through whereas they earlier anticipated to increase rates back to per month in The charge is probably partly affecting the companys cash profile as the costs on lower production rates are higher while the company also anticipated to sell less aircraft for less money Given the slow market and the program being in reachforward position for years the charge does not come as a surprise The program is in a reach forward position meaning that even the slightest changes will lead to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>being forced to recognize a charge The charge announcement comes weeks after the jet maker announced it finalized a deal for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Fs with the VolgaDnepr group of which were are already delivered Although I already concluded in December that this order at that time still a commitment is not going to save the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program it can be said that the timing is a bit odd Earlier in June delivery of the KCA slipped from August to to January In a conversation I had with a Seeking Alpha contributor a couple of days ago I already said that although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has completed all requirements for the Milestone C skies have not cleared for Boeings tanker program I had an article slated for publication on Monday that would touch this subject and possible additional charges which I expected to be in excess of half a billion dollars pretax <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>did announce a million per share aftertax charge The charge covers the costs the jet maker had to make for a hardware fix on the refueling boom and costs related to flight testing for this fix Additionally part of the charge has been taken to keep the delivery of the first KCA on schedule Figure Wall Street Horizon WallStHorizon Create your own custom event calendar today One of the things that needs to be noticed is the actual impact of this charge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>booked million per share in charges for its Defense Space and Security department and B per share on its Commercial Airplanes department Translated to pretax charges the charge will be B or per share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>guided for a GAAP earnings per share for the full year With a consensus of per share for Q earnings and per share for the full year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is likely to report a big miss In its Q earnings report the jet maker will reaffirm the guidance for cash flow and revenue but is expected to considerably lower its EPS guidance The charges yet again show that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a tendency to delay charges until the very last moment It has become inherent to the company to have spokesmen tell there is nothing wrong and when thing go wrong eventually the company releases an K and use those same spokesmen to mitigate the charge In the end it is what investors called upon themselves The pressure to report quarteroverquarter or in Boeings case yearoveryear growth is immense To end on a positive note the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F should see no further charges after this The B charges that some of my readers were expecting is not there either Additionally Boeings cash profile remains intact which is a strong sign for a cash intensive industry For investors that focus on cash any drop in share prices is a nice buying opportunity Currently I am holding my shares and might possibly increase my position postearnings if any weakness in share prices
