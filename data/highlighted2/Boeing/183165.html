Toulouse January PARIS European planemaker Airbus AIRPA is pressing suppliers on its A jet program to slash prices by at least percent by in order to make the companys main cash cow more competitive three people familiar with the matter said The demand for austerity echoes rival Boeings BAN costcutting Partner for Success initiative which has redrawn the relationship between suppliers and the worlds biggest planemaker as the industry gears up for record output Airbus cuts are just one part of an internal efficiency program called SCOPe that also seeks savings through a close look at procurement and the way planes are developed and sold according to suppliers and an Airbus document seen by Reuters Airbus has told suppliers that the prospect of increased volumes and a longer lifespan for its bestselling jet which has enjoyed a surge in sales due to an important makeover means it is time to review all options in its supply chain This includes a fresh look at the companys procurement strategy that could include extra use of dual sourcing for crucial parts a strategy designed both to reduce costs and to reduce the risks of shortfalls as production increases Airbus is also looking at further shifting its business model to allow airlines less choice over accessories that they previously ordered direct known as Buyer Furnished Equipment Also involved is a longerterm effort to weave manufacturing costs into the design process to prevent unintended overruns in costs on the factory floor a tool known as Redesign to Cost Though Airbus has confirmed the existence of the SCOPe initiative its details have not been publicly disclosed The initiative is part of Airbus longterm commitment towards boosting competitiveness through operational efficiency and continuous improvement a spokeswoman said In Airbus spent about billion euros on parts for its A family of jets which compete with Boeings in the busiest part of the billionayear aircraft market Each plane contains three million parts Mounting pressure on suppliers for price cuts comes as Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>are raising production of their singleaisle models to around aircraft a month each up from a month and pondering a further stepup to a month Such increases in volume are traditionally the aerospace industrys most valuable lever for driving down unit costs But the SCOPe and Partner for Success programs aim to complement this with direct contributions from suppliers driving profit margins further up industrys food chain <span

companies in the aerospace sector by operating margin are all suppliers according to Deloitte That rankles with manufacturers who argue their willingness to gamble on hugely popular upgrades of the A and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>jets is driving record sales and creating wealth across the industry that ought to be shared through lower parts prices But many small suppliers argue the efficiency campaigns mask a grab for part of their profit margins They say they face their own challenges in investing in equipment to support higher production with no guarantee how long the boom will last Some are pushing for higher not lower prices The increased tension is the latest evidence of a shift in industry focus After a decade of bold developments Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>are putting their energy into upgrading existing models With fewer new projects in the pipeline they have less leverage to demand better terms from suppliers in return for a place on the next new plane and observers say this has led to a growing cost battle over existing programs There is a balance of power between prime contractors and the supply chain Those who supply things that can be dualsourced like aerostructures feel price pressure But a lot of the supply chain is singlesourced and it is harder for those suppliers to see why they should give anything up said Nick Cunningham aerospace analyst at UKbased Agency Partners Whats Next Tomorrows Digital Life Thomson Reuters is the worlds largest international multimedia news agency
