InDepth Analysis Of Plans For An Amazon Airline Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Sources say Amazon is looking to be the worlds largest overnight parcel service within years The logistics and transport industry is ripe for disruption a share would add billion in annual revenue FedEx and UPS are very inefficient highcost operations in many ways and an Amazon run airline could undercut them and become a disruptor in the industry Img A <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>with Amazon Prime Air titles After over a month of speculation more details are beginning to emerge surrounding Amazons NASDAQ AMZN rumored plan to launch an inhouse freight airline The rumor started with someone close to the talks posting on an online forum stating that Amazon is working to create the worlds largest overnight parcel service within years The source stated Amazon would not buy an existing company as it did not want to inherit the problems so instead resorted to launching its own operation In this article I go into detail about the implications of such an operation for Amazon financially structurally and the risks associated with such a venture Some have suggested that this could just be a threat by Amazon to secure better rates from FedEx NYSE FDX and UPS NYSE UPS and while the whole move could be bargaining chip it seems likely at this point that this is a serious move into the transport and logistics space by Amazon Amazon has been quietly building up sorting centers across the country replacing work that was previously done by FedEx and UPS something many are unaware of A move towards bringing transportation inhouse would be a logical next step for Amazon In addition FedEx and UPS have been increasingly unable to meet Amazons ambitious needs and at the same time ecommerce still has enormous room to grow By launching its own logistics operation Amazon can spread some of the risks from this away from those external companies and onto itself preparing itself better for continued ecommerce growth This year has yet again proven to be problematic with reports suggesting UPS is once again struggling to handle shipments this year FedEx has delivered of packages on time and UPS for the week ended December very unimpressive numbers To put this in perspective Amazon delivered million packages in With a ontime rate this means at least million packages are being delivered late annually leading to a customer service nightmare Sources familiar with the plans have stated Amazon will do whatever it takes to serve every community in the USA with this new service making it possible that this is a much larger plan than the s currently being talked about Amazon is also planning on using this service to assist its efforts to eventually be able to deliver packages minutes to hours from when they have been ordered It seems like with this goal in mind it is smart that Amazon starts to move away from FedEx and UPS and build its own infrastructure as it is unlikely FedEx and UPS would be able to deliver those targets for Amazon without large fundamental changes to how their businesses operate Img Abandoned DHL facility in Wilmington Ohio The current trial run for Amazons freight airline is operating out of Wilmington Ohio DHL used this facility many years ago when it was trying to establish an express operation in the United States to rival that of FedEx and UPS The whole operation at its peak handled over million packages daily but was eventually deemed a failure and closed down resulting in over jobs lost Since Nov the airport has seen flights versus in the period a year ago With the DHL operation having been closed less than years ago there is a huge amount of infrastructure already in place for Amazon to use as it tries to launch a delivery hub This operation is currently using five aircraft and rumors are saying Amazon is looking to purchaselease an additional aircraft over the next years While the media has been caught up in the operation out of Ohio they are overlooking the second trial Amazon is running Operating out of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA field in Seattle Amazon has been using a freighter aircraft to fly cargo between Seattle and west coast destinations There is certainly potential for Amazon to look at growing the operation and purchasing a large number of these which would be much more readily available compared to s and could expand the operation further An AOC is expected to be issued in meaning at that point Amazon would begin flying the aircraft themselves rather than through third parties Despite this however Amazon is unlikely to be able to bring anywhere close to of its air transport needs inhouse any time soon Amazons airline and ground transport will likely supplement purchased transport services for many years to come The transport and logistics space is an area ripe for disruption with billion market cap of legacy logistics and transport companies ready for disruption The current logistics market is said to be not unlike the enterprise IT market prior to cloud computing Img FedEx fleet utilization daily One does not need to look too deeply into the operations of FedEx and UPS to see how a disruptor could be successful against them The two companies are slow to adopt cloudbased computing and cutting edge technology compared to what a tech company like Amazon could probably do In addition FedEx uses its aircraft on average hours per day This crazy low utilization is a result of FedEx in many cases only running one flight per day during the night between most city pairs In addition despite periods of huge delivery volume such as the Christmas season overall these flights in are recording a load factor of something that would be considered horrendous in the overall airline industry This load factor of barely over and the fact that FedEx flies its aircraft a fraction of the time other airlines do expose huge inefficiencies that Amazon could take advantage of in undercutting FedEx and UPS on price High labor costs at both FedEx and UPS also do not help and the Fedex operation runs separate entities FedEx Express AIR FedEx Ground and Smartpost that do not work with each other at all These entities run separate warehouses and separate fleets An operation like Amazon could use computing to determine the most effective way to deliver a certain package within a specific time using a combination of ground and air transport While FedEx today runs incredibly inefficient flights such as the minute run from Tucson to Phoenix an operation like Amazon could send packages on a mix of its ground and air network and send them from a specific warehouse to shorten the delivery distance and optimize its delivery Data analysis could also forecast what products will be needed where and have them being transported in that direction prior to them being ordered cutting down on transportation costs after an order is placed Img Monthly flight operations at FedEx You only need to look at the growth of FedEx and UPS to see they may not be the best equipped to handle the growth of ecommerce Growth at FedEx this year in RTM revenue ton miles of seems insane while ecommerce grows at this year The FedEx airline fleet has stayed very steady over the past few years despite this impressive ecommerce growth and FedEx has started contracting out a lot of flying instead By utilizing its USA fulfillment centers and its recently announced ground network through trucking and Amazon Flex Amazon could deliver a compelling alternative to UPS and FedEx An Amazon freight airline utilizing strong data analysis could fly many more hours per day while flying planes much closer to full If this perfect scenario were possible Amazon with only aircraft would already be flying as much cargo as over of FedEx Express Amazon is said to be looking at offering this service to third parties looking to outsource their fulfillment With an impressive portfolio of fulfillment centers data analysis computing Amazon Flex and Amazon ground and air transport it could eventually take a large slice of this market from FedEx and UPS and become a compelling disruptor Amazon spent billion on logistics in At this point many industry sources say that Amazon is paying bare bones rates to FedEx and UPS not giving them much ability to reduce these costs This is one reason FedEx and UPS are reluctant to make large investments for Amazon Shipping revenues for Amazon in came in at billion leaving a billion loss for shipping Even a improvement to shipping costs by bringing it inhouse which seems feasible would reduce Amazons shipping costs by almost a billion dollars enough money to have allowed Amazon to turn million profit or almost margin as opposed to the million loss it reported Some impressive numbers to note are a market share in US domestic parcel deliveries million contract logistics billion and freight forwarding billion would add billion in annual revenue to Amazon At margin this could easily deliver another million to the bottom line In comparison Amazon Web Services had revenues of billion after years with billion expected in Despite many potential positives for Amazon by moving into the logistics and transportation business there are many concerns Airlines in particular are notoriously volatile and risky ventures Richard Branson was once quoted as saying if you want to become a millionaire start with a billion dollars and start an airline Despite excellent profits now across the board many are quick to forget troubles all of these companies faced when oil was over By bringing transportation and logistics inhouse Amazon is also bringing these problems inhouse when they arise again The timing may be good with many aviation analysts predicting an aircraft bubble causing used aircraft values to plummet something that would be very beneficial for Amazon as it looks to buy used aircraft for its transport operation Despite this such a venture will still require a phenomenal amount of money and resources to build FedEx and UPS make much of their profit from last minute express deliveries for highvalue clients as opposed to making their money from Amazon deliveries By relying almost on its Amazon deliveries to fill these aircraft Amazon will need to have much lower operating costs and a much more efficient operation to successfully run the operation financially Another big concern many have overlooked is the potential for Amazon to alienate FedEx and UPS Amazon will not be able to build up an operation that can replace FedEx and UPS for many years at least If both of these companies see Amazon becoming a threat it does not seem unreasonable to think they could start making it difficult for Amazon to do business with them by either limiting the volume from Amazon or raising prices for Amazon This would wreck havoc on Amazon a company that will absolutely require the corporation of FedEx and UPS to run its operation successfully for many years to come Can Amazon turn the logistics and transport business on its head and into a billion dollar plus business Will this effort turn out as the Amazon fire phone did or will it be more reminiscent of the success of AWS These are all open questions and only time will tell how this venture works out for Amazon While I am doubtful it can create the worlds largest overnight package delivery service within years as the original source suggested was the plan I am much more certain it can become
