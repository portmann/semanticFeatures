(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>An AOC is expected to be issued in 2017, meaning at that point, Amazon would begin flying the aircraft themselves rather than through third parties.Despite this, however, Amazon is unlikely to be able to bring anywhere close to 100% of its air transport needs in-house any time soon.Amazon's airline, and ground transport will likely supplement purchased transport services for many years to come.The transport and logistics space is an area ripe for disruption with $170 billion market cap of legacy logistics and transport companies ready for disruption.The current logistics market is said to be not unlike the enterprise IT market prior to cloud computing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Img 3 : FedEx fleet utilization daily One does not need to look too deeply into the operations of FedEx and UPS to see how a disruptor <b>could</b> be successful against them .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The two companies are slow to adopt cloud-based computing and cutting edge technology compared to what a tech company like Amazon could <b>probably</b> do .  (Uncertainty) </span>In addition, FedEx uses its aircraft on average 3.3 hours per day!This crazy low utilization is a result of FedEx in many cases only running one flight per day during the night between most city pairs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In addition , despite periods of huge delivery volume such as the Christmas season , overall these flights in 2015 are recording a load factor of 55.7 % , something that would be considered <b>horrendous</b> in the overall airline industry .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This load factor of barely over 50 % and the fact that FedEx flies its aircraft a fraction of the time other airlines do , expose huge inefficiencies that Amazon <b>could</b> take advantage of in undercutting FedEx and UPS on price .  (Uncertainty) </span>High labor costs at both FedEx and UPS also do not help and the Fedex operation runs 3 separate entities, FedEx Express (AIR), FedEx Ground, and Smartpost that do not work with each other at all.These entities run separate warehouses, and separate fleets.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>An operation like Amazon <b>could</b> use computing to determine the most effective way to deliver a certain package within a specific time using a combination of ground and air transport .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While FedEx today runs incredibly inefficient flights such as the 25-minute run from Tucson to Phoenix , an operation like Amazon could send packages on a mix of its ground and air network and send them from a specific warehouse to shorten the delivery distance and <b>optimize</b> its delivery .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Data analysis <b>could</b> also forecast what products will be needed where and have them being transported in that direction prior to them being ordered , cutting down on transportation costs after an order is placed .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Img 4 : Monthly flight operations at FedEx You only need to look at the growth of FedEx and UPS to see they <b>may</b> not be the best equipped to handle the growth of ecommerce .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Growth at FedEx this year in RTM ( revenue ton miles ) of 1.14 % <b>seems</b> insane while ecommerce grows at 12.5 % this year .  (Uncertainty) </span>The FedEx airline fleet has stayed very steady over the past few years despite this impressive ecommerce growth, and FedEx has started contracting out a lot of flying instead.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>By utilizing its 92 USA fulfillment centers , and its recently announced ground network through trucking and Amazon Flex , Amazon <b>could</b> deliver a compelling alternative to UPS and FedEx .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>An Amazon freight airline utilizing strong data analysis <b>could</b> fly many <i>more</i> hours per day while flying planes much <i>closer</i> to 100 % full .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If this perfect scenario were <b>possible</b> , Amazon with only 20 aircraft would already be flying as much cargo as over 5 % of FedEx Express .  (Uncertainty) </span>Amazon is said to be looking at offering this service to third parties looking to outsource their fulfillment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With an impressive portfolio of fulfillment centers , data analysis , computing , Amazon Flex and Amazon ground and air transport , it <b>could</b> eventually take a large slice of this market from FedEx and UPS and become a compelling disruptor .  (Uncertainty) </span>Amazon spent $8.7 billion on logistics in 2014.At this point, many industry sources say that Amazon is paying bare bones rates to FedEx and UPS, not giving them much ability to reduce these costs.This is one reason FedEx and UPS are reluctant to make large investments for Amazon.Shipping revenues for Amazon in 2014 came in at $4.48 billion, leaving a $4.22 billion loss for shipping.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even a 10 % improvement to shipping costs by bringing it in-house , which seems feasible , would reduce Amazon 's shipping costs by <b>almost</b> a billion dollars , enough money to have allowed Amazon to turn $ 629 million profit or <b>almost</b> 1 % margin as opposed to the $ 241 million loss it reported .  (Uncertainty) </span>Some impressive numbers to note are a 1% market share in U.S domestic parcel deliveries ($800 million), contract logistics ($2.5 billion), and freight forwarding ($1.7 billion) would add $5 billion in annual revenue to Amazon.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At 10 % margin , this <b>could</b> easily deliver another $ 500 million to the bottom line .  (Uncertainty) </span>In comparison, Amazon Web Services had revenues of $1 billion after 5 years with $10 billion expected in 2015.Despite many potential positives for Amazon by moving into the logistics and transportation business, there are many concerns.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Airlines in particular are notoriously volatile and <b>risky</b> ventures .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Richard Branson , was once quoted as saying `` if you want to become a millionaire , start with a billion dollars and start an airline . ''  (Uncertainty) </span>Despite excellent profits now across the board many are quick to forget troubles all of these companies faced when oil was over $100.By bringing transportation and logistics in-house, Amazon is also bringing these problems in-house when they arise again.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The timing may be good with many aviation analysts <b>predicting</b> an aircraft bubble causing used aircraft values to plummet , something that would be very beneficial for Amazon as it looks to buy used aircraft for its transport operation .  (Uncertainty) </span>Despite this, such a venture will still require a phenomenal amount of money and resources to build.FedEx and UPS make much of their profit from last minute express deliveries for high-value clients as opposed to making their money from Amazon deliveries.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>By relying <b>almost</b> 100 % on its Amazon deliveries to fill these aircraft , Amazon will need to have much <i>lower</i> operating costs and a much <i>more</i> efficient operation to successfully run the operation financially .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Another big concern many have overlooked is the potential for Amazon to alienate FedEx and UPS.Amazon will not be able to build up an operation that can replace FedEx and UPS for many years at least.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If both of these companies see Amazon becoming a threat , it does not seem unreasonable to think they <b>could</b> start making it difficult for Amazon to do business with them , by either limiting the volume from Amazon or raising prices for Amazon .  (Uncertainty) </span>This would wreck havoc on Amazon, a company that will absolutely require the corporation of FedEx and UPS to run its operation successfully for many years to come.Can Amazon turn the logistics and transport business on its head and into a 5 billion dollar plus business?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Will this effort turn out as the Amazon fire phone did or will it be <i>more</i> reminiscent of the success of AWS ?  (Surprise) </span>These are all open questions and only time will tell how this venture works out for Amazon.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While I am doubtful it can create the world 's largest overnight package delivery service within 2 years as the original source <b>suggested</b> was the plan , I am much <i>more</i> certain it can become an industry disruptor and solid competitor to UPS and FedEx .
