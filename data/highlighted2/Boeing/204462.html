style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>currently is leading on the cargo and wide body market The order battle between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA and Airbus OTCPKEADSF is one of the ways for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus to flex their muscles next to marketing their products as the best solution with the highest fuel efficiency and passenger comfort Despite the fact that the orders in terms of value are in no way a reflection of financial performance it is important to have a look at the order inflow since it gives a nice idea of which manufacturer offers the best mix of discount comfort slot availability and efficiency In this article I will have a look at the order inflow during July and have a look at their role in the narrow and wide body market In July Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>together hauled in orders Looking at the division of the orders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can be marked as the clear winner <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>received orders while Airbus received just orders Boeings July orders clearly reflect its dominance in the cargo market out of the orders that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>received were for cargo aircraft FedEx NYSE FDX ordered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F aircraft The remaining orders were placed by unidentified customers that ordered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s So Boeings July order book was split between wide and narrow body aircraft Airbus on the other hand received orders An undisclosed customer ordered Airbus Aneo airframes This customer could possibly be Asiana Airlines converting its Letter Of Intent into a firm order Parent company of Air Carabes ordered Airbus A So whereas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had an order inflow that was split equally between narrow and wide body aircraft Airbuss order inflow is almost completely for narrow body airframes That also means that in terms of value <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ends up on top in July In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus are quite close when it comes to orders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>received orders while Airbus secured orders After cancellations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>booked orders while Airbus follows closely with orders Helped by the FedEx order <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ended on top in July Boeings dominance on the cargo market clearly becomes visible in Julys order book In July <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been leading on the wide body market which is more profitable than the narrow body market Yeartodate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has slightly more orders and achieved a booktobill ratio of Yeartodate Airbus achieved a booktobill ratio of Reason for the better booktobill is the fact that Airbus has lower production rates and therefore needs less orders to receive a booktobill of Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>both are nice investments but Boeings lead on the cargo and wide body market means that the jet maker is leading on the market that potentially is more profitable on a per unit basis On the other hand Airbus received orders for the Airbus Aneo which adds to the already robust order book for the narrow body next generation family and simultaneously demonstrates demand for an aircraft with range and payload capability similar to the Airbus A and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>So far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is lacking an answer to the Aneo Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities
