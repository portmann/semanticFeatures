yet again on Wednesday But it was much less than a resounding victory for the bulls Both the SP NYSEARCA SPY and Nasdaq NASDAQ QQQ ended the day with gains of less than and both fell heavily from the days highs Most notably commodities continue to underperform Copper NYSEARCA JJC dropped again The metal is really becoming a thorn in the bullish argument Oil NYSEARCA USO also pulled a big reversal It was up as much as Wednesday morning and spiked higher following what appeared to positive inventory numbers Inventories of oil gasoline and distillates were all below expectations And yet oil couldnt sustain its gains fading off the days high to close with a loss This is on top of Tuesdays big drop even with the Yellen market prop At the other end of the risk spectrum biotechs NYSEARCA XBI resumed their fall With both basic materials and risky new economy stocks losing any momentum they picked from the Fed comments its worth considering if the effect of Yellens capitulation will be shortlived Perhaps the best indicator of global risk appetite Brazil NYSEARCA EWZ put up an ugly day It started the morning much higher moving to new month highs But by the end of the day the gains were gone and the breakout had failed Investors who use fundamentals have been frowning at the Brazilian move now almost up off the lows The country is running a of GDP budget deficit the government is already junkrated and staterun oil giant Petrobras NYSE PBR is leaking at a rate that would make even a BP offshore platform blush The country is woefully unprepared for the Olympics setting the stage for an even more chaotic experience than the unruly World Cup Zika continues to breed concern And thats to say nothing of the political mess The West has become convinced that Rousseff will be forced to resign and that when she does political power will transfer peacefully This is expected to somehow bring into being a new government that is investorfriendly and to end the worst economic tailspin in the country in more than a century Even disregarding the fact that the countrys vice president would be little improvement and that Rousseff has said she wont resign under any circumstances this is still hopelessly magical thinking How many times have Latin American countries peacefully overthrown a corrupt leftwing government and replaced it with a friendly and upright procapitalist one without causing major social unrest Ive read multiple articles suggesting wishing that Rousseff and her Socialist friends will step aside and eagerly hand over power to conservative probusiness people such as Joaquim Levy This sort of voluntary release of power to your degree ideological opponents hardly ever happens even in the first world Why would it happen in one of the worlds most corrupt thirdworld states I wonder if the Brazilian bulls have ever spent a single day in Latin America At the risk of ranting let me get back to the point Recent data suggests Brazilian locals are heavily selling stocks to foreigners Good on them Economic data since January continue to be negative in Brazil the rally is almost all driven by general commodity bullishness and a complete misreading of the political situation by foreigners In short theres little reason for Brazilian stocks to be up This is an example of irrational exuberance by uninformed outsiders bidding a junk asset class way up The foolishness has been made possible by the same perfect storm of bullish factors that have propped up oil and global equity markets since January Brazil is a much bigger version of the same sort of trade that sent zombie energy companies screeching higher a few weeks ago At this point I believe Brazil is one the single best global indicators of risk tolerance It takes a great deal of bravery to buy that index up in two months while the country heads toward a potential civil war as the government dissolves Other perilous emerging markets such as Turkey NYSEARCA TUR have taken the liberty of following Brazils silly season Turkey is up in recent weeks despite that country being a focal point for geopolitical tensions and also having a severely dysfunctional government When the smart money in New York and London starts having doubts on the longevity of the upswing these outposts for international hot money will get hit hard and fast Once you see Brazil drop or in a week look out because the rest of the world will then be on watch for a correction <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA announced itll be cutting about of its

been warning that the overvalued US dollar NYSEARCA UUP will surely lead to trouble Yes its nice to be the strongest economy on the block but it comes with its own set of problems In a world as globalized as ours you cant operate as an economic or political island anymore While the Fed may be backing away from their excessive hawkishness now the ill effects of the overvalued dollar are already coming home to roost Take Boeings job cuts and multiple it across dozens of other multinationals that are facing similar layoffs to react to pricing pressure from European and Japanese competition and you have the seeds of the next recession While this recovery has generated plenty of service jobs the loss of highquality jobs is much harder to overcome I wrote this article myself
