was unable to prevent major cost overruns on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program During the McNerneys lead the MAX and X were launched <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA shares dipped in afterhours trading on the news of CEO Walter James Jim McNerney stepping down effective July st McNerney will be succeeded by Dennis Muilenberg In this article I will have a look at what McNerney is leaving behind for its successor and what to expect from Mr Muilenberg <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares dipped in afterhours trading following the news of McNerney stepping down McNerney became CEO of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company in prior to that he was CEO of M and held various positions at GE His GE training brought the focus on financial performance which is a good thing for investors While McNerney was CEO <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>increased production rates to meet market demand and increase revenue and launched the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X which should support Boeings long term performance McNerneys relation with Boeings actual work force has been bad for years In the union leaders called for a strike which cost <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>over bn in profits In the years after that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>management would move jobs from the Puget region and decrease Boeings exposure to the unions The South Carolina plant also gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>some leverage in negotiating work rules with the workers in the union states to award assembly of aircraft With this way of negotiating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>tries to squeeze out the maximum out of their workforce For investors this is a good sign but trust and moral of the workforce has been damaged and many hold McNerney responsible for this Under McNerneys lead <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>increased output on their popular and airframes Although this might put severe pressure on the supply chain investors will be pleased as it increases the quarterly output of the jet maker and allows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to pay higher dividends <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been increasing its dividend from in to in One of the aircraft that have been added to the product line is the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The concept was given green light before McNerney became CEO but the multibillion cost overruns that came with the program was not something that McNerney was able to turn around The high costs have been caused by Boeings effort in reducing costs by outsourcing work As of the accumulated losses exceed bn while the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should go cash flow positive on a per unit basis later this year In order to effectively compete with Airbus OTCPK EADSF <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>came up with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX to counter the Airbus Aneo and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X to counter the Airbus A and strengthen Boeings position on the market Although McNerney is known for cutting costs he was not able to prevent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>from a multibillion cost overrun on the program About Muilenbergs view on how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should be led we dont know much The only thing that we know is that he supports Boeings Partnering for Success program The program is controversial as it is considered invasive by some suppliers and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>probably benefits more than its suppliers Muilenberg has an engineering background and has been leading Boeings Defense unit where he led a major restructuring as defense budget decreased after the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq So Muilenberg is probably even more of a cost and job cutter than McNerney He has no experience in the Commercial Aircraft department so he probably will have other executives aiding him with that in the coming years Although he has an engineering background engineers probably will not benefit a lot from it On the other hand as an engineer Muilenberg should have a better understanding of the production of engineering products and the development of aircraft So whereas McNerney is seen as a business man that focuses on financial performance with very little affection for aerospace Muilenberg actually has an aerospace background but will not be doing things differently as soon as he becomes CEO So for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>investors I do not expect things to change focus will be lying on financial performance under Muilenbergs lead as well The ExIm Bank In July a decision will be made about continuing the ExIm Bank If it will be decided to discontinue the ExIm Bank it is interesting to see what will happen to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>jobs within US McNerney said that if the ExIm Bank will be eliminated a major relocation of jobs is required to remain competitive Although McNerneys words should be taken with a grain of salt it is interesting to see how Muilenberg will deal with US jobs relocating them to other countries will surely spark anger and will mean a bad start for Muilenberg Filling the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Classic order book Muilenberg and his team have to finish what McNerney already started Selling enough <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Classic airframes to fill the delivery slots until Ramping up production for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X In the coming years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will bring the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X on the market It is up to Muilenberg to meet the targets set for both aircraft Decision about a MoM aircraft Probably most challenging for Muilenberg will be the possible development of an aircraft family that can address the middle of the market and possibly replace the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Considering the cost overruns on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and the tanker program <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>needs to make sure they keep development costs at a manageable level Under McNerneys lead <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ramped up production and increased dividends making McNerney a favorite for investors Looking behind that McNerney also has been the man that fought unions and was unable to keep costs on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>manageable Although Muilenberg has an engineering background he will not be doing things differently than McNerney but a major challenge awaits when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is about to develop a new aircraft Muilenberg and his team need to show that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>learned from its mistakes on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>For investors not a lot will change McNerny and Muilenberg both have different backgrounds but their vision probably will be the same Muilenberg has been Boeings number since December and nothing has changed in Boeings strategy a strategy that probably also has been laid out by Muilenberg Editors Note This article discusses one
