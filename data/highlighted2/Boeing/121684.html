Look At Boeings H Orders And Deliveries The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is on track to meet its delivery target for The company currently has a booktobill ratio of In one of my previous articles I had a look at Boeings Q orders and deliveries Order inflow for widebody aircraft increased compared to last year Given the charge that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>recognized on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>C development it is likely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will be trimming its EPS guidance but if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>matches or even exceeds its guidance for cash flow and shows a strong cash flow a trimmed EPS guidance should not have a big impact on Boeings stock price In order to see whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is on its way to meet its target it is important to look at the orders and deliveries Table Deliveries Q versus Q and In Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>deliveries fell short of expectations for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>for the and deliveries were in line with the announced production rates During Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>delivered more airframes partly compensating for lower deliveries in Q and also delivered more and airframes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will be quite pleased with the fact that it managed to produce Dreamliners versus the Dreamliners that were scheduled reflecting higher deliveries at the Everett and Charleston production sites In total <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>delivered more airframes compared to the previous quarter and more airframes compared to Q delivery figures Figure Quarterly deliveries <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Source aeroanalysisnet Using the current production rates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should be able to deliver about aircraft per quarter or airframes annually So in the first quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should have delivered about airframes which it did <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>delivered airframes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>however has put a delivery goal of airframes for or approximately airframes per quarter This means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>needs to deliver airframes in the upcoming quarters and currently is ahead on schedule Figure shows that deliveries during Q were airframes short to meet Boeings annual target but delivered aircraft more than required in Q For the first half of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is airframes ahead on schedule What bodes well for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is that it managed to deliver Dreamliners while according to production rates it should have delivered airframes Figure Quarterly deliveries <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Source aeroanalysisnet Figure shows that in the number of deliveries increased towards the end of the year which probably is related to airlines wanting to receive their aircraft before the end of the year if possible For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>does not necessarily need to increase deliveries towards the end of the year which gives the company some breathing space For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aims for a booktobill ratio of which means that the number of deliveries equals the order inflow In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>booked orders and delivered airframes this is equivalent to booktobill ratio of almost Table Orders Q versus Q and Q In the first months of the year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>managed to secure orders In Q orders were up due to higher order inflow for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Compared to last year orders in the second quarter were down In the first months of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>delivered airframes and secured orders which is equivalent to a booktobill ratio of This is slightly below Boeings target of receiving order for each delivery In Q Boeings booktobill ratio equaled up from in the previous quarter For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>it will be a challenge to secure enough orders to reach a booktobill but I do expect some order inflow towards the end of the year Excluding the charge on the tanker program <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should be able to report higher EPS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>probably will be lowering the EPS guidance for reflecting the charge it had to take on the tanker program <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should be able to reach a booktobill ratio of During the earnings presentation most attention will go out to free cash flow and cost reductions on the <span style='background-color:
