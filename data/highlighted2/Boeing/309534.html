compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co Management reduced next years plane deliveries by planes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co dividend is high at and has been increased of the last ten years This article is about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co NYSE BA and why its an income investment with good growth company thats of the Good Business Portfolio The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company together with its subsidiaries is an aerospace company both commercial and military aircraft The individual plane cost went cash positive in fourth quarter the Good Business Portfolio guidelines total return earnings company business will be looked at At the last earnings conference call January management said that in the fourth quarter the individual cost for the went cash positive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>took a charge of million for the quarter or an average negative cost of million per plane In the second quarter of the negative cost was million and in the third quarter it was negative million This progress if continued will get to the average positive cash per plane of million in the next quarter or million total for the first quarter Considering that the is becoming a larger share of the planes delivered where the profit margin is higher and the increased plane delivery to planes a month Boeings program should have increasing cash flow each quarter This is a big positive for the innovation of the technology The biggest thing that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has going for it is its technical superiority over Airbus OTCPKEADSY that was developed on the and will be used on future aircraft The plane is opening new direct point to point routes each month with the latest being Dubai to Panama city in hours Two other milestones that just occurred in the last two weeks are the first test flight of the Max and the first refueling test of the KCA tanker both were very successful This should allow the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co stock price to increase well for the growth investor and keep the dividend rate attractive for the shareholders as the growth continues with the and Max and KCA tanker These new products coming on line soon makes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>a bargain at todays price <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co passes of Good Business Portfolio guidelines These guidelines are only used to filter companies to be considered in the portfolio There are many good business companies that dont break many of these guidelines but will still not be considered for the portfolio at this time For a complete set of the guidelines please see my article The Good Business Portfolio All Positions These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income defensive and growing companies that keeps me ahead of the Dow average <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co is a largecap company with a capitalization of billion The companys largest competitor is Airbus in the commercial plane sector but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is delivering more planes per year and a superior company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co has a dividend yield of that has been increased for of the last ten years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co is therefore a good choice for the dividend income investor and its dividend is very safe The average payout ratio is over the past five years Mr Market is not giving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co credit for the new planes that will start delivery in the next few years There good cash flow leaves plenty of cash remaining for investment in new planes and share buybacks after paying its high dividend I also require the CAGR going forward to be able to cover my yearly expenses My dividends provide of the portfolio as income and I need capital gain in addition for a yearly distribution of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co has a threeyear CAGR of well above my overall requirement Looking back invested five years ago would now be worth today from SP Capital IQ This makes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co a good investment for the income investor with the addition of good growth in the long term <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co cash flow is great at billion which leaves it with plenty of cash allowing it to pay its high dividend and have cash left over for stock buyouts and company investment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co SP Capital IQ has a fourstar rating or buy with a price target of This makes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co very underpriced at present and a good choice for the income investor in addition to good growth in the worldwide aerospace commercial and military business The Good Business Portfolio guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules When I look at a company the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the Good Business Portfolio <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co had better total return than the Dow baseline in my month test period I chose the month test period starting January because it includes the great year of the moderate year of the small loss year of and the losing year of YTD I have had comments about why I do not compare the total return to the SP average I use the Dow average because the Good Business Portfolio has six Dow companies in it and is weighted more to the Dow average than the SP Modeling the Dow average is not an objective of the portfolio but just happened by using the guidelines as a filter for company selection This good total return of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co makes it appropriate for the income investor that also wants good growth to keep well above inflation DOWs month total return baseline is For the last quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co reported earnings on January beat expected at compared to last year at and expected at Revenue was better than expected by million at billion This was a good report showing earnings above expected but the million write off for the program and the forward reduction in deliveries hurt and Mr Market took <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>down Earnings for the next quarter will be released in late April and are expected to be at compared to the same time last year at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co has a headwind due to the strong dollar but has good growth going forward as it starts to deliver more planes and continues on the KCA program <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is known to promise little and overdeliver and I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to beat last years plane deliveries The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company together with its subsidiaries is an aerospace company The company operates through five segments Commercial Airplanes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Military Aircraft BMA Network Space Systems NSS Global Services Support GSS and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Capital BCC The Defense Space Security BDS business includes BMA NSS and GSS The Commercial Airplanes segment develops

aircraft and weapons systems for global strike The NSS segment is engaged in the research development production and modification of the products and related services The GSS segment provides a range of support solutions The BCC segments portfolio consists of equipment under operating leases finance leases notes and other receivables assets held for sale or release and investments <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company business is World Wide and the strong dollar is a head wind to revenues at present The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company has a backlog of billion or more than years to build all the planes in the backlog there business is booming and makes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>a good growth investment as the newer planes come off the assembly line Takeaways and Recent Portfolio Changes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co is a dividend income and great total return choice long term with better growth as they start to deliver more and the KCA tankers Considering <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co stock price and its total return over performing the Dow average <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company will be held by the portfolio and let it grow until it gets well above my normal trim point of of the portfolio to at least of the portfolio <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co has a high dividend of providing the dividend income investor with a reasonable entry point to lock in this high yield with good growth in the long term If you dont already have a position in the aerospace sector <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co is a buy for your portfolio but you must be patient as new planes start to be delivered in the next few years Bought FreeportMcMoRan Inc NYSE FCX and increased its percentage in the portfolio to This is now a deep value play for the portfolio The Good Business Portfolio embraces all styles of investing so FCX is the first deep value company to be increased in the portfolio FCXs up potential is great as the copper price should start to stabilize and then start to go up as demand becomes larger than supply in the long term The Good Business Portfolio generally trims a position when it gets above of the portfolio Home Depot NYSE HD is of portfolio Johnson Johnson NYSE JNJ is of the portfolio <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA is of the Portfolio and L Brands Inc NYSE LB is at of the portfolio Therefore HD JNJ BA and LB are now in trim position After the earnings are out HD may be trimmed if its still well above and let the other winners run a bit more I have written individual articles on CAB JNJ EOS LB GE and HD and other companies in the Good Business Portfolio and other companies that the portfolio is evaluating if you have an interest please look for them in my list of previous articles Of course this is not a recommendation to buy or sell and you should always do your own research and talk to your financial advisor before any purchase or sale This is how I manage my IRA retirement
