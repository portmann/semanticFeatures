</span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Order backlog of Airbus A shows demand for MoM aircraft MoM aircraft would give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>a strong member to occupy middle of the market As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>does not want to build any moonshot aircraft a MoM aircraft should return value to the company and its investors Day of the Paris Air Show was not the one to remember in terms of orders A single order for the Airbus OTCPKEADSY OTCPKEADSF Aneo coming from a European lowcost carrier Wizz Air was the only event The order included a commitment for Airbus Aneo aircraft valued at bn and additionally Wizz Air holds options for another aircraft If the options are fully exercised the total value will be almost bn although after discounts probably only bn has to be paid The order was the biggest order for the Airbus A so far During the Paris Air Show Airbus secured almost orders for its A aircraft neo and ceo combined while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA received only orders for its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX of which one is a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Business Jet So far Airbus received over orders for the Airbus Aneo outselling <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>with a ratio With the Airbus Aneo and the launch of the Airbus ALR which has an additional range of nmi due to the addition of extra fuel tanks Airbus is effectively targeting the airlines that need to replace their older <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aircraft With the high order inflow for the Aneo a suitable competitive answer from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in the form of a MoM aircraft seems to be necessary Although there hasnt been any big announcement about this MoM aircraft during the Paris Air Show sooner or later the aircraft concept should be presented to the board for approval Figure Market division in the payloadrange diagram Source Wikipediacom altered by DhierinPerkash Bechai With the Airbus ALR Airbus is sitting right on the spot where the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>currently is This market segment currently is not being addressed by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>since the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was taken out of production years ago and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is not on offer either So this leaves a market segment for which there is demand to Airbus What makes this market segment a difficult spot for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX probably cannot be stretched even further without needing bigger wings and bigger engines which is a major engineering task and almost the same as building a new aircraft This segment is also not addressable for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>with the Dreamliner The Dreamliner does have the required capacity for the MoM but is built for longrange operations This means that it is overweight for operation in the MoM So the MoM is the segment between the single aisle aircraft and the widebody aircraft Airbus is able to somewhat address this segment with its Airbus A <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>on the other hand does not have that possibility For airlines a middleofmarket aircraft is interesting as it can be used on routes for which it is uneconomical to use widebody aircraft So the only thing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can do in order to not give up this market segment to Airbus is coming up with a new aircraft that specifically addresses this segment Although it will take years probably even a decade before this aircraft rolls out of the factory a few things became clear already during the Paris Air Show Boeings CEO Jim McNerney said the following about the MoM aircraft I know there is a requirement We are trying to define that with our customers I am convinced there is an unmet requirement there that we will have to address This shows that the board of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>actually is aware of the need for a new aircraft to address the middle of the market What bodes well for investors is that McNerney previously stated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should not pursue doing any moonshots in the development of new aircraft According to Mike Sinnett VP of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Product Development the new MoM aircraft would seat about passengers and has a range of nm David Joyce from GE NYSE GE Aviation stated that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would need a new engine with a thrust rating of pounds for its new aircraft The fact that a new engine is required means that it will take year to develop the airplane and components and that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should make haste to approve a new aircraft that can profit from the huge demand for air travel in the coming years There is a strong demand for a like aircraft A decision regarding the MoM aircraft can be made soon It will take years before service entry If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>approves the MoM concept it can address a segment of the market that it previously could not serve very well For investors the MoM aircraft is good news as it means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>expands its product line but is not going to do a moonshot like it did with the <span
