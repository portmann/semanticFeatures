Boeings accounting practices which caused the stock and the sector to tumble Despite a recovery in the stock price is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>really the best way to invest in the robust demand for new commercial airplanes Meet Hexcel A supplier of carbon fiber and composites which appears to be a better way to play the secular growth With a recent report that the SEC is investigating accounting practices at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA the whole sector took some damage This includes suppliers like Hexcel NYSE HXL which saw its stock drop in sympathy Short of an Enron type case of fraud which I believe is extremely unlikely I cant envision anyway that Hexcel will be impacted I guess the argument could be made that Boeings access to the capital markets will be impaired which will then disrupt the companys liquidity and impact supplier payments but the company did deliver billion in operating cash flow during FY which mitigates this concern to a certain extent Nevertheless investors looking to capitalize on the robust demand for new commercial aircraft should consider Hexcel instead of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>with or without accounting issues With its FY results Hexcel reported commercial aerospace sales for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus OTCPKEADSY grew yoy with new aircraft programs A B Aneo and B MAX growing Given that the A and B are still not at maximum production rates Hexcels sales are set to accelerate as supply chain demand for composites increases In addition composite materials continue to capture a greater proportion of material with each new generation of aircraft Per Hexcels k page Hexcel has been awarded a contract to supply carbon fiber composite materials for the major primary structures for the A and has total content of about million per plane The A has about composite content by weight The has more than composite content by weight including composite wings and fuselage compared to the composite content used in the construction of its B aircraft and for B the aircraft it is primarily replacing Hexcel averages about million of content per plane B As of December Airbus had orders in backlog for the A while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had a backlog of orders for the B This equates to sales for Hexcels composites of almost billion for just these two planes alone obviously spread out over the better part of a decade And in case you are concerned that a potential bubble in widebody planes will be a headwind for the company Hexcel also had this to say in its k Both Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>have announced new versions of their narrowbody planes that will have new engines Airbuss Aneo had its first customer delivery in January while the Boeings B MAX had its first flight on January and is expected to enter service in Both of these aircraft are expected to provide opportunities for Hexcel to increase its content on these new programs up to higher than on the current models of the A and B And as the carbon fiber composite craze continues to propagate to other commercial aircraft per the k In Airbus announced a new version of its A the A neo which will have new engines and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>announced the BX a new version of the B with composite wings and new engines Our sales on these four new programs plus those that will develop from the Aneo and the BX will represent an increasing percent of our Commercial Aerospace sales in the future With commercial aerospace sales already representing of Hexcels sales in the company appears primed to see meaningful growth as it catches the tailwinds from the commercial aircraft boom On its Q and FY earnings conference call Hexcel management stated that it is still on track to deliver billion in sales and in EPS in along with billion in FCF during the year period This represents pretty explosive growth over the timeframe considering that the midpoint of guidance for sales is billion and for EPS Stated another way in the company expects to grow sales by compared to FY and grow EPS by This equates to an EPS CAGR of from levels not too shabby for a stock with the PE currently sitting around <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>faces intense competition from Airbus whereas Hexcel benefits from both companies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is currently trading at a forward PE around using the midpoint of Boeings Core EPS outlook compared to a forward PE around for Hexcel This means Hexcel is given a very small premium over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>despite a much easier path to almost double EPS over the next years Hexcel will continue to benefit from the adoption of carbon fiber in the space defense segment and industrial markets whereas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is primarily limited to the secular growth in commercial airplanes Investors looking to capitalize on the secular growth of commercial airplanes should look further down the supply chain rather than just at the big ticket item Even if the potential accounting issues at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>end up being nothing more than distracting noise the relative valuations and growth potential favors Hexcel I wrote this article myself and it expresses
