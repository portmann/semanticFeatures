are long BA UNP MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article The stock is down for the past three months while the SP is down The stock however is trading inexpensively based on next years earnings estimates but those estimates may come down soon Theres lots of news surrounding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA these days with the stock having the potential to drop on the news that they are cutting back the production rate of their fleet Its not the entire fleet thats getting axed but just the portion of the fleet The production rate is getting cut in half down to six a year which is to take place later in the year and will result in a charge of million for the fourth quarter after taxes which will be equivalent to per share The is produced for both the passenger side of the business and the freight side of the business but the weakness being experienced is on the freight side <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has twenty orders that have been booked for the series of planes The company cited the fact that global shipping volumes were down November which had an impact on the decision On the flip side passenger traffic grew to the tune of This freight issue that is taking place has me thinking that there is a broader macroeconomic issue taking place and that it is not just a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>specific story Dont forget that it was just probably a couple of months ago that Delta CEO Richard Anderson stated that there was glut of wide body planes which sent shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>downwards So not only did <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>take it on the chin from the passenger side but not it is taking a hit on the cargo side Since that time in mid October the stock is down against a drop of on the SP But it is very important to state that the cargo side of the house amounts to a very small portion of the companys revenue stream Even though it is a small portion of Boeings portfolio Im more concerned about the macroeconomic affects that are taking place The entire transport complex has been disastrous for a very long time just take a look at Union Pacific NYSE UNP it is down nearly in the same timeframe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was down <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has broken all support levels now and appears to be in a tailspin The company currently trades at a trailing month PE ratio of which is fairly priced but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past On that note the year forwardlooking PE ratio of is currently inexpensively priced for the future in terms of the right here right now I consider anything with a PE value below to be worthy of a buying opportunity Next years estimated earnings are per share and Id consider the stock inexpensive until about The year PEG ratio which measures the ratio of the price youre currently paying for the trailing month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time I like looking at a year horizon tells me that the company is fairly priced based on a year EPS growth rate of The company has great nearterm future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of On a financial basis the things I look for are the dividend payouts return on assets equity and investment The company pays a dividend of with a payout ratio of of trailing month earnings while sporting return on assets equity and investment values of and respectively which are all respectable values The really high return on equity value is an important financial metric for purposes of comparing the profitability which is generated with the money shareholders have invested in the company to that of other companies in the same industry On this metric I consider anything above to be great The really high return on investment value is an important financial metric because it evaluates the efficiency of an investment that a company makes and if an investment doesnt have a positive ROI then the investment should not be made From this perspective I like companies that make above return on their investments Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safety play I believe the yield of this company is good enough alone for me to take shelter in for the time being The company has been increasing its dividends for the past four years I do believe that the stock offers value below which is the midway point of the week range As for me I have a loss in my current <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>holding and am fine with it Im fine with it because I never go full bore and buy my entire position at once I always layer in and I layer in on a weekly basis I am able to do it on a weekly basis because Ive been
