further insight on Boeings pursuit of a new middleofthemarket jet Airlines are becoming ever more vocal in their need for a replacement Since the last flew from the Renton facility in theres been a gap left in the mediumlong haul market that is being slowly depleted by airliners with everwidening operational flexibility The resulting void is one that the current generation A and families cant entirely serve and the A and Dreamliner cant serve efficiently At the Paris airshow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA announced that it is considering development of a middleofthemarket MoM jetliner that can carry passengers up to nm This initial article gives a toplevel overview of the market opportunity that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is considering pursuing with its next cleansheet project and summarizes key considerations for those considering long positions Over the past decades major airframers have focused development on revenuegenerating shorthaul singleaisles and highcapacity longrange widebodies Meanwhile the expanse between these route sectors has largely been served by superstretched narrowbodies and small twinaisles operating at the extremes of their efficient envelope <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>situated itself centrally in this window with the seat km range Although unmatched in terms of operational ability the aircrafts high capacity and thirsty powerplants worked against it as airport turnaround time became ever more critical and oil prices continued to rise The post industry decline led the company to cease production of the and no equivalent aircraft has entered service since Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aircraft orders have increased sixfold Figure and a replacement appears to be a project the company is considering once again This would be a significant step for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and a strong signal for investors showing the airframers drive to exploit new sector opportunities as well as stand toetotoe with Airbus OTCPKEADSF on timeproven aircraft configurations VP of Marketing Randy Tinseth has said the company sees a market for a seat aircraft without the range requirements of the placing the MoM concept at the base of the latest widebodies efficient operating range and at the extents of the nextgeneration longrange singleaisles capability This is visualized in Figure which shows a projection of aircraft availability in Figure is based on personal research and considers the efficient load factor to be Aircraft perseat fuel burn relative payload and max zerofuel weight are used to estimate range limitations The target market described by Randy Tinseth is well defined dividing the aircraft families entering service between now and Head of Sales John Wojick stated that a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MoM replacement would exceed the s range by and its capacity by This correlates well with the MAX which also achieved an average range increase and a capacity increase across the range in comparison to the NG family indicating an overall shift in market requirement as opposed to changes in Boeings concept of the middle of the market The Airbus fleet currently being developed will serve regions of the middle of the market with the longrange Aneo and highcapacity Aneo These aircraft have proved to be extremely popular bagging nearly orders between them since their launch However for an airline such as Delta NYSE DAL which has placed a number of its s on transatlantic routes where passenger numbers are insufficient for a large airframe and the range requirement is outside of the As capability the Airbus aircraft are inadequate Its disputed if the Aneo can be stretched any further the latest A can already seat more passengers than the first A to enter service The A can operate highcapacity mediumlong haul routes very efficiently however its reliance on passenger numbers means it cannot match the diversity of the and the As target market which means there is insufficient fleet niche for Airbus to develop an MoMspecific aircraft just yet Its difficult to predict demand for what is essentially a new aircraft entering a bornagain sector Airbus sees total demand for the MoM to be around aircraft not a long way from the number of s sold Whats interesting is that the combined BoeingAirbus orders over the past five years are more than twice what they were in the five years running up to the s prime This trend doesnt appear to have extended to the middle of the market and as a result the relative demand for the aircraft has reduced This could largely be due to the increasing versatility of the shorthaul singleaisles and small twinaisles that have entered service since the and as a result have contributed to airframers hesitance to target this market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>however seems to be indicating that a high share of the envisaged aircraft sales is worth the investment particularly if development and technologies can be used as a precursor for the New Small Aircraft anticipated later next decade If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>goes ahead with development of a replacement the project start and subsequent timescale will likely be driven by X project execution developments in the companys New Small Aircraft concept and market response to the Aneo over the next years If the MoM jet happens a long position executed before the MAXs entry into service could benefit from the highrate program the longterm X program and the unchallenged MoM airframe over the course of a single decade Figure shows that Boeings engineering teams have a busy years ahead where the MAX X and developments coincide however from onwards the companys available engineering resource will be sufficient for the development of a new airframe Some of the USs largest airlines and freight carriers including Delta United NYSE UAL FedEx NYSE FDX and United Parcel Service NYSE UPS all operate sizeable fleets of s and the average aircraft age shows that the type maintains relevance in todays market as well as security for airlines and investors in the airframe Since the first mention of a replacement Air Astana Air Lease Corp NYSE AL and American Airlines NASDAQ AAL have all been vocal in expressing interest in the concept For a longterm investor the MoM can be considered an aircraft with sufficient niche and demand for the next decades market from an airframer with engineering resources to utilize My subsequent article will look further into the risk potential design paths and anticipated performance of a
