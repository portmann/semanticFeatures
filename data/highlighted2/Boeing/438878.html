class='textDiv'><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Overhyped Risks The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has traded flat for nearly three years now The airplane manufacturer sits on a massive backlog but the market focuses too much on orders such as the recent deal with Iran As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA apparently collected another plane order the stock trades at levels originally touched to start The bears dont want to touch the stock due to the feared late stage of the current aerospace industry upcycle and concerns over narrowbody plane demand The stock is up slightly this week on the news amid the generally bullish market The amazing part of the stock is that the market apparently wants to throw out the yield and the sizable backlog due to other fears The question is whether these arent these signs that the market only sees the risks The not so surprising news starting via Reuters on Sunday was that Iran suggested the deal to buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>planes was finalized The order was highly expected after Iran agreed to a deal with Airbus OTCPKEADSY for planes worth a listed billion Iran has repeatedly stated that a fleet of passenger planes needed an almost complete rehaul suggesting for months now that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would obtain the other half of the order The question though is whether the deal matters that much For investors thinking that the upcycle in the aerospace sector is long in the tooth a large order from Iran is refreshing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>only has net orders this year in comparison to plane deliveries through May Those suggesting the aerospace upcycle is approaching an end had a point based on new orders this year in comparison to the yearly net order peak back in at planes The prime reason that even the planes from Iran and still even new orders dont matter is that the backlog remains rather large What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>delivers over the next five years is highly independent of any new orders Sure planes accounts for over of the order book for the H of this year but this order is a meager of the orders on the books Revenue and more importantly profits are built on deliveries out of the backlog that stands at over seven years now Is the peak in orders due to a lack of demand or a lack of manufacturing capabilities limiting the reason to order something that cant be delivered for over five years While the market obsesses over a peak in the order cycle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will continue to produce significant cash flows As the company returns that capital to shareholders in droves investors should use that signal for the stock Unless one thinks the management team would spend billions on repurchasing shares prior to an industry collapse For Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>spent billion on share buybacks as the stock collapsed The fact the airplane manufacturer spent so aggressively during a weak period is a positive sign that management is in tune with the true value of the stock based on the prospects The net payout yield dividend yield plus net stock buyback yield has soared to Note this number is very difficult to squeeze above without the stock being very cheap though the number is never full proof Sure the order level is hitting a trough in but even the orders this year are approximately keeping up with deliveries The reality is that the numbers arent indicating whether orders are low due to extended delivery date options or any sign of a lull in future demand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>remains a solid buy in the low s and offers shareholders a solid dividend
