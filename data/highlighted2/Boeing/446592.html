Dreamliners Will Not Be Enough For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha AeroAnalysis model shows that there likely will be billion left to be recovered once the last airframe in the accounting block has been delivered By the th delivery all the deferred cost balance should be zero Earlier predictions of airframes to recoup the costs seem to be overdone The development of deferred costs has been the subject of some of my previous articles Besides the quarterly updates I also have looked at some common mistakes regarding the deferred costs on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA program completely being zeroed out In this article I will have a look at whether Boeings accounting block of aircraft is big enough If that is not the case I will try to determine what is a more realistic block size An article including the latest sanity check in simple form The articles above serve as a base for this article and make sure you have enough knowledge to understand this article and also prevent me from repeating myself too much Some key figures and milestones to keep in mind Currently the size of the accounting block is units Accumulated deferred costs excluding unamortized tooling costs and other nonrecurring costs are bn at the start of the year Year over year deferred costs are expected to be flat airframes have been delivered by the end of leaving airframes in the accounting block Expected deliveries for are units With these points in mind it is already possible to draw a curve of the accumulated costs and the projection of cost development this year Figure Development deferred costs Source AeroAnalysis One of the most important things that can be seen is that the peak of the deferred costs will be approximately bn At that time the jet maker will likely have delivered aircraft a mix of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aircraft The peak in deferred costs is expected to be reached at units or a third of the block of units Ramp up of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>production To refine the calculations I am taking into account that the average sales prices and production costs will increase after the launch of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>scheduled in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>needed airframes to reach the peak in deferred costs For this analysis I will assume it will need another units to ramp up profits This leaves units on which the jet maker can make full profits So I am assuming that each phase building deferred costs ramping up profit and production on full profit equals roughly a third of the total block size In future analyses I will have a look at the impact of different rampup patterns but I think this pattern is a good one to start off with An important element of the estimate of the deferred cost development is the assumption for the revenue and cost per airframe For revenue it is important to note that in the long term the sales price will balance around a discount Table Estimated value in millions for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>members For the second half of and half of I am not expecting any <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>deliveries In those years I expect a total of Dreamliner deliveries with an average sales price of million and cost of production of million per airframe For the aircraft that are used to ramp up profits the average revenue per airframe is million with average costs of million per airframe These values will be used for the ramp up model For the airframes that follow after the rampup a revenue per airframe of million and cost per airframe of million are used What can be seen is that the introduction of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will positively impact the profit per airframe Figure Projected development deferred costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Program Source AeroAnalysis My model shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as many analysts also expect will not be able to recoup costs within the current accounting block The AeroAnalysis model shows that at deliveries there is bn in deferred costs left to be covered and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will not be able to zero out the deferred cost balance until the th delivery My model indeed produces results similar to that of analysts and confirms earlier backoftheenvelope calculations that it will be a major challenge for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to recoup costs within the accounting block Analysts have been quick to say that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>almost certainly will have to take a charge In my view that is not necessarily the case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could increase the block size stating that it is expecting to sell more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>airframes than it had anticipated earlier This would justify the airline spreading costs over more airframes Additionally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is actively and aggressively negotiating with suppliers to lower the cost of parts If successful this could drastically increase Boeings profit per airframe Also in this view I differ from analysts who expect the profitability to be driven by the learning curve What is also important to note is that the number of units required to zero out the costs is within the total number of aircraft that will be needed in the next years Earlier analyses expected <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>not to be able to zero out costs until the th delivery and this analysis has been cited by many analysts and aerospace news portals Even if the charge comes I think investors should not worry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is active in a cash intensive industry and its cash flow forecasts are looking good and are what attract most investors A charge will only shake out the earningsfocused investors offering a nice opportunity for investors who invest in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>for its cash flows If you would like to receive updates for my upcoming articles
