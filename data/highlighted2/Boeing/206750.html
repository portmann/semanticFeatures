</span>is poised to profit from Chinas growing aircraft demand in the longer term Chinas COMAC could take market share in the singleaisle market This article will look at Boeings NYSE BA long term prospects in China Please take note this is only one aspect in weighing the attractiveness or nonattractiveness of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as an investment and should not be used independent of other factors With Chinas transformation into a consumerdriven economy rising income levels and a swelling middle class have driven surging Chinese tourist numbers which are set to grow in the long run Chinese airlines reported carrying million passengers in the first quarter of a increase from the first quarter of It is also the first time first quarter traffic exceeded million With the Chinese passport penetration rate standing at around theres good potential for further growth in Chinese outbound tourism China is poised to overtake the United States as the largest airline passenger market by according to a report by the International Air Transport Association IATA Chinas population is over three times the size of the United States and its middle class population is roughly as large as the entire US population yet Chinas airline fleet is just one third the size of the United States indicating ample room for growth in Chinas aircraft demand China has about commercial jets inservice whereas the United States has roughly industry analysts predict Chinese airlines will add about aircraft mostly singleaisle over the next years <span

market accounting for about a quarter of airplane deliveries last year and Chinas importance is set to grow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>expects China to be the worlds largest commercial aircraft market in the decades ahead valuing Chinas aircraft demand at US billion over the next twenty years With solid growth potential in a duopolydominated industry with highbarriers to entry the prospects for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in China should be bright <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus claim to have a roughly share of Chinas inservice fleet However the dominance isnt expected to last <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has expected competition from commercial aircraft manufacturers in Canada Russia China Japan and Brazil But Marc Allen president of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>International and former president of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>China believes Chinas homegrown commercial jet made by Chinas stateowned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China COMAC is the best positioned to succeed The ARJ is a seat shorttomediumrange turbofan powered regional jetliner and COMAC has already built a backlog of over planes so far from firms such as GE Capital Aviation Services Shanghai Airlines Lao Airlines Air Congo and Myanmar National Airlines Chengdu Airlines is expected to be the launch customer and is expected to take delivery of the first ARJ in late November this year and the plane is expected to enter service in February COMACs C is a larger project and is a direct competitor to Boeings and Airbus A singleaisle aircraft A market outlook report by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shows that of the worlds aircraft fleet was singleaisle and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>expects that share to rise to by Of Chinas projected aircraft requirement of planes over the next years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>expects or about to be singleaisle planes Chinas lowcost carriers account for about of Chinas singleaisle aircraft demand and as the countrys domestic air travel market grows that share is expected to rise to about in The IATAs year passenger forecast shows China will be the fastest growing domestic air travel market with a growth rate of per year to For comparison The United States is forecast to expand by per year in the same period COMACs C has garnered a respectable orders so far mainly from local buyers such as Air China China Eastern Airlines China Southern Airlines Hainan Airlines China Merchants Bank and China Industrial Bank The foreign buyers include GE Capital Aviation Services and Bangkokbased City Airways The C is expected to complete assembly this year but its maiden flight has been pushed back to next year and deliveries of the C are expected between and Hence the C will not satisfy Chinas near term singleaisle aircraft requirements and even when the plane does enter service it would need time to establish a reputation and build public trust over safety and reliability Additionally COMAC will have to develop its fleet support service infrastructure as well as be able to provide fleet support services from a distance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has decades of experience and a strong network in these areas This suggests that while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should enjoy solid benefits in China over the next five years in the longer term it is likely to face competition in the singleaisle segment and loss of some market share as COMAC gains ground COMAC does not have a widebody aircraft and the company is currently working together with Russian aerospace and defense giant United Aircraft Corp UAC to develop a widebody jet Under the terms of the agreement first flight is expected to be achieved in and deliveries in Overall although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>may encounter competition and loss of potential income as a result of new entrant COMAC given that Chinas market is valued at
