every Dreamliner passenger jet that leaves the factory is trying to stem the losses by cutting the use of one of its signature ingredients titanium The strong lightweight alloy used extensively on the costs seven times more than aluminum and accounts for about million of the cost of the million plane according to industry sources The push to reduce titanium costs is part of a broader longrunning effort by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to make the profitable that includes pressing suppliers for price cuts and adjusting assembly lines to improve efficiency said Bob Noble vice president of Partnering for Success Boeings supplier costcutting program Boeings other commercial planes are profitable and on Wednesday <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing

introduced in but it has spent more than billion on production tooling and onetime costs And it has curbed its ambitions for future planes Former chief executive Jim McNerney said last year <span

lift its profits by churning out more s while cutting costs Aerospace titanium at to a pound is front and center especially when you have the cost problems that you do on the said Kevin Michaels a vice president with ICF International a publicly traded management technology and policy consulting firm based in Fairfax Virginia Commercial jetliner programs typically lose money in the early years of production until the heavy upfront investments in engineering and production are repaid Boeings accounting spreads those costs over a large block of planes the company expects to deliver Investors expressed concern in April when the s deferred production cost balance reached billion about billion more than earlier targets The tally is a gauge of the losses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has built up making s so far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said the deferred cost balance will keep rising until when the company plans to begin turning out of the planes a month up from currently At that point <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>expects the balance will start decreasing Overall <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said it earns a operating profit margin of per cent in its commercial jetliner business including sales of planes and related services The represents Boeings bid to reinvent the civilian jetliner using lightweight carbon fiber and new engines to allow it fly farther and burn percent less fuel than current jets made largely of aluminum Unlike aluminum which corrodes when it comes into contact with carbon fiber titanium works well with carbon fiber and expands minimally in response to the large temperature swings the big jets experience But the now faces dual competition from Airbus its own carboncomposite plane the A and a lowcost alternative the Aneo based on an older aluminum design updated with new fuelefficient engines Those are likely to keep price pressure on both plane makers especially in a low oil price environment said Russell Solomon aerospace analyst at Moodys Investor Service While the rising level of deferred costs affects the s ultimate profitability Solomon said its the ongoing cost that were really paying attention to As part of its costreduction effort <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>considered shifting to less costly aluminum for seat tracks on the industry sources say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said it didnt end up making the change but declined to say why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has changed the cockpit window frame to aluminum from titanium and has changed the frames of some doors to composite from titanium Special coatings or materials are used to prevent aluminum corrosion experts said It wasnt known how much <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>saved by the change <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>declined to comment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said it also is aggressively pursuing recycling to recapture the waste metal chips created as titanium parts are machined into finished shapes The company is looking for even greater savings in its supply chain and production methods The changes are not likely to affect raw metal prices but could reduce the sales of some suppliers and stem concern about supply constraints from Russia experts said One large piece used to help join the wings to the body shows the potential for saving The piece known as the double plus chord requires <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to buy about pounds of titanium for every pound that ends up flying on the aircraft said Bill Bihlman president of metal consultancy Aerolytics LLC After the piece is forged a large amount of the outside must be ground off leaving interior metal with intact grain and strength Add in the high cost of machining hard metals like titanium and the value of such pieces soars You can see why theres so much emphasis on titanium Bihlman said Noble the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>official declined to discuss specific parts but said pieces with high buytofly ratios are a focus There are a whole lot of strategies we can use to reduce the buytofly he said But substituting other metals wont be easy Bihlman said Steel weighs percent more than titanium and aluminum lacks titaniums strength and has the corrosion problem But even though the titanium savings may ultimately be modest Bihlman said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will wring them out because they have to Thomson Reuters is the worlds largest international multimedia news agency
