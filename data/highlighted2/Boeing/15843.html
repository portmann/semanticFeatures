class='textDiv'>Very Large Aircraft Market Analysis Why MiniJumbos Are Closing In On Superjumbos Part The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X poses biggest threat to Airbus Aceo Airbus Aneo will combine capacity as well as luxury that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X cannot achieve In the previous parts Part Part and Part I analyzed various airframes and had a look how they compare to the Airbus OTCPK EADSF A In this Part I will add a final conclusion that should give somewhat of an idea why things are not working for VLAs in general First of all it is noteworthy that the superjumbos do have superior figures for revenue and profit per seat This is caused by the fact that the superjumbos are bigger and carry a relatively large number of business and first class passengers which increases revenue significantly In my previous articles I tried making a fair comparison between the airframes by using a normalized seating This was necessary since the seat counts that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA provided hold for configurations with very low seat pitches which decreases passenger comfort Figure shows the five numbered aircraft in normalized configuration The red dotted line shows the profit per seat of the Airbus Aneo and the black line shows the revenue per seat What can be seen when looking at the corrected configurations is that only the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I is able to perform better than the Airbus A This however does not mean that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I is better The Airbus A has a larger cabin area which allows for the addition of luxury facilities such as bars Additionally the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I can carry up to passengers in uncorrected configuration This is a difference of revenue generating seats with the Airbus Aneo which should be able to carry passengers In corrected configuration this difference is as high as seats So the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I and the Airbus A are not direct competitors but demand for the Airbus A that occupies the high end of the VLA market is bigger than demand for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I which occupies the lower end of the market So the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I is not preferred because It does not have the cabin area available that allows for luxury facilities Its carrying capability is significantly lower compared to the Airbus Aneo placing it at the lower end of the VLA market where high density <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s are eating away orders for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I Without decreasing passenger comfort it cannot compete with the Airbus A in terms of absolute profit Some airlines are having difficulty filling the Airbus A One would think that for such airlines it would be more attractive to order the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I This does not seem to be the case Airlines are preferring the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>instead of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I since the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can transport an equal number of passengers but has a lighter airframe Figure Relative fuel burn per seat Source DhierinPerkash Bechai Figure shows the relative fuel burn seat It can be seen that only the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X is able to beat the economics of the Airbus Aneo Currently however the Airbus Aneo has not been announced and only Emirates has shown interest in the airframe and has been pushing Airbus to come up with the Airbus Aneo Figure Relative fuel burn per seat Source DhierinPerkash Bechai Figure quite clearly shows why Emirates is pushing for an Airbus Aneo All widebody airframes shown in the figure have a lower fuel burn per seat The Airbus A is a heavy airframe with a dated propulsion system that cannot match todays or tomorrows competition Figure Empty weight per seat Source DhierinPerkash Bechai Figure clearly shows the higher weight for the Airbus A The weight has been expressed in structural weight per seat to account for the fact that in order to carry more passengers a heavier structure is required Dividing the structural weight by the number of seats gives a fair measure of the structural efficiency While all airframes stay below the kg mark for their design point the Airbus A goes as high as kg per seat An empty weight per seat of about kg seems to be more appropriate for a design point The high OEW for the Airbus A can be explained by the fact that the wings of the Airbus A are able to lift the stretched version of the Airbus A So far we have concluded the following The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I lacks capacity and cabin area therefore you cannot see it as a direct competitor of the Airbus A The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER are eating orders away for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I airlines are preferring a twinengine jet over a engine jet The absence of competition for the Airbus A does not mean it is safe The design is already quite old heavy and inefficient Additionally airlines are having a hard time filling the seats on the airframe The combination of a low occupancy rate and a heavy structure makes the Airbus A vulnerable and an undesirable fleet member for airlines More and more airlines have a tendency to add seats to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>This poses a threat to the lower as well as the higher side of the market for the Airbus A With the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X coming up the superjumbo could be losing its position as most profitable airframe as shown in Figure Figure Profit for the analyzed airframes Source DhierinPerkash Bechai The figure shows that in terms of absolute profit the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I performs best but there are no airlines operating the airframe in a typical seat configuration For the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I the corrected case is a better reflection of the actual case The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X is matching the Airbus Aceo in terms of profit and additionally even has more LD containers available for revenue generating belly freight The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X has more potential than the Airbus Aceo and could even threaten the Airbus Aneo but again thats comparing a comfortable seat aircraft with a less comfortable seat airframe The Airbus A itself is not a bad aircraft The airframe offers superior cabin area which allows for luxury facilities and Gulf carriers are also using this However for other airlines such as Asian and European airlines it is hard to fill the superjumbo The A fits the luxury standard of the countries in the Gulf area but outside of that area the attractiveness of the Airbus A fades rather quickly One of the things that make the Airbus A unattractive is the fact that the design is quite old When the aircraft was being designed it featured revolutionary technology Years later technological advancement leaped leaving the Airbus A as a heavy design with dated engines Especially for airlines that operate the Airbus A with low seat counts the airframe is particularly unattractive as it has low revenue and high per seat costs Not a lot of airlines want to operate a heavy aircraft thats hard to fill when they have the possibility to buy a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X thats more efficient easier to fill and can generate the same profit The Airbus A is too big and has not been sized properly leaving the airframe vulnerable to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X If Airbus would have analyzed the market a bit better they would have come up with a VLA that carries less passengers and had been sized down for its mission Airbus thought that socalled mega airports would rise for which big aircraft were needed This has not been the case and Airbus did not take proper action to make the Airbus A more attractive Now with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X coming up Airbus can either come up with the Airbus Aneo or hope for a change in the air travel market that will require onboard luxury facilities The highend market of the Airbus A does not need to fear the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X The Airbus A offers a combination of comfort and capacity that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X can never achieve The low end market of the Airbus A that seats slightly less than passengers has to fear a bit more as the combination of low occupancy rate and belly freight weakens its position Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a
