heightening the possibility it could be wreckage from missing Flight MH Malaysia Airlines was operating a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>on the illfated flight which vanished without a trace in March last year while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in one of the most baffling mysteries in aviation history The plane was carrying passengers and crew Search efforts led by Australia have focused on a broad expanse of the southern Indian Ocean off Australia roughly km miles from Frances Reunion Island There have been four serious accidents involving s in the years since the widebody jet came into service Only MH is thought to have crashed south of the equator Frances BEA air crash investigation agency said it was examining the debris found washed up on Reunion Island east of Madagascar on Wednesday in coordination with Malaysian and Australian authorities but that it was too early to draw conclusions Aviation experts who have seen widely circulated pictures of the debris said it may be a moving wing surface known as a flaperon situated close to the fuselage It is almost certain that the flaperon is from a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aircraft Our chief investigator here told me this Malaysian Deputy Transport Minister Abdul Aziz Kaprawi told Reuters Abdul Aziz said a Malaysian team was heading to Reunion Island about km miles east of Madagascar It would take about two days to verify if the piece was from MH he added Australias Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said the object had a number stamped on it that might speed its verification This kind of work is obviously going to take some time although the number may help to identify the aircraft parts assuming thats what they are much more quickly than might otherwise be the case he said A person familiar with the matter earlier told Reuters the part was almost certainly from a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The piece usually contains markings or parts numbers that should allow it to be traced to an individual aircraft the person added Investigators believe someone deliberately switched off MHs transponder before diverting it thousands of miles off course Most of the passengers were Chinese The plane piece is roughly metres ft in length according to photographs It appeared fairly intact and did not have visible burn marks or signs of impact Flaperons help pilots control an aircraft while in flight The part has not yet been identified and it is not possible at this hour to ascertain whether the part is from a B andor from MH a BEA spokesman said in an email on Wednesday Greg Feith an aviation safety consultant and former crash investigator at the US National Transportation Safety Board NTSB said his sources at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had told him the piece was from a Whether it was MH was not clear he said But we havent lost any other s in that part of the world Feith said Oceanographers said vast rotating currents sweeping the southern Indian Ocean could have deposited wreckage from MH thousands of kilometres from where the plane is thought to have crashed If confirmed to be from MH experts will try to retrace the debris drift back to where it could have come from But they caution that the discovery was unlikely to provide any more precise information about the aircrafts final resting place This wreckage has been in the water if it is MH for well over a year so it could have moved so far that its not going to be that helpful in pinpointing precisely where the aircraft is Australias Truss told reporters Robin Robertson an oceanographer at the University of New South Wales in Sydney said the timing and location of the debris made it very plausible that it came from MH given what was known about Indian Ocean currents Malaysia Airlines said it was too early to speculate on the origin of the debris The Australian Transport Safety Bureau ATSB said it was working with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and other officials <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>declined to comment on the photos referring questions to investigators Aviation consultant Feith said that if the part was from MH the bulk of the plane likely sank while the flaperon had air pockets that allowed it to float below the waters surface Finding the wreckage would involve reverse engineering the ocean currents over months Feith said Its going to take a lot of math and science to figure that out he said Reporting by Tim Hepher Emmanuel
