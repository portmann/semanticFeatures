To some extent this reflects Goldman's view, but it has to be noted that their view on the gaps are significantly different.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Coming to <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> the same required production rate <b>might</b> have been mere luck .

(Boeing: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In this article I had a look at the required rate using the annual order trend and concluded that using the annual rate the production rate will have to come down to 3-4 aircraft per month.Which is in line with what Goldman Sach's analyst team expects.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , the way I came to this conclusion <b>differs</b> significantly from the way Noah Poponak and his team got to it .  (Uncertainty) </span>Additionally, I do not think the annual order trend is a good measure of order inflow, since it does not include the zig-zag pattern that jet makers often see.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Therefore , in the following article I will be using the bi-annual average which in my view <i>better</i> reflects order inflow for the coming years .
