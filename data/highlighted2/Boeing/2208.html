of Jim Cramers Mad Money TV Program Thursday March Cramer started the show by talking about the last years he spent in educating investors Commenting on the movement on Thursday he said that investors have been gripped with currency fears The fear is so much that weak retail numbers prompted investors to buy as they thought that weak numbers will discourage the Fed from raising interest rates Even if the Fed gets it wrong and raises the rates the market could see a decline He added that the Euro finally showed some strength against the dollar When Intel NASDAQ INTC gave a weak preannouncement the market ignored that news too and still went higher This shocked Cramer CEO interview Apple NASDAQ AAPL Apples CEO Tim Cook called in as a viewer to surprise Cramer on the th anniversary Cook spoke

people would not want to buy efficient planes if the cost of oil keeps declining McNerney answered in the negative saying I suppose you could talk yourself into them not needing fuel efficient planes if the price of oil was zero Then I would buy that But the facts are that a fifth of the outlay is for the new plane and fourfifths is living with that plane for years The efficiency at almost any oil price really pays back for these guys CEO interview Chipotle Mexican Grill NYSE CMG The stock of Chipotle has run too much and many think that they have missed the boat Cramer however thinks that the
