Airbus Aneo should decrease fuel burn by Airbus Aneo should be able to decrease fuel burn per seat by In one of my previous articles I had a look at the upcoming performance upgrade for the <span

superjumbos are operating Although the superjumbos offer more comfortable pitches airlines seem to be preferring the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and are adding seats to these airframes For the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER a configuration with seats abreast is becoming the standard leaving the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I in the cold In this series of articles I will have a look at how airlines are using the minijumbos instead of the superjumbos and see how it is affecting the costs and per seat figures I will look at how the minijumbos are performing relative to the superjumbos I will also incorporate possible changes to the Airbus OTCPKEADSF OTCPKEADSY A and the announced changes to the current <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I have performed a similar study in the past but changes to the model used make it worth redoing the analysis Secondly new aircraft that have a market on the lower side of the VLA Very Large Aircraft market will be considered in this analysis as well The following mission flight will be used As the study itself is quite extensive I will divide the presentation of results in several articles Part will look at the Airbus A and Airbus Aneo Part will look at the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER PIP Part will look at the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I Part will form a general conclusion and a more indepth conclusion on why things are not working out In this part I will deal with the Airbus A and Airbus Aneo The Airbus A currently is the biggest passenger jet on offer and is popular among the Gulf carriers For Airbus however the A is a disaster The airplane is a prestige project and is not generating any profit for Airbus Even if it will generate profit one day the program is not going to be as successful as Airbus once thought it would be Meanwhile Emirates the biggest operator of the Airbus A is pushing Airbus to come up with a reengined version that burns less fuel per seat The Gulf carrier is claiming it will buy as much as superjumbos if Airbus comes up with the Airbus Aneo In one of my previous articles I did a small study on the Airbus Aneo and concluded that new engines winglets and additional seats were needed to achieve a reduction in fuel burn Figure shows a short summary of the efficiencies of the Airbus Aneo Source DhierinPerkash Bechai The Airbus Aneo features a higher propulsive and aerodynamic efficiency The higher efficiencies will actively lower the fuel burn while the higher capacity divides the fuel burn over more seats The following seat counts will be used for the Airbus Aneo For our mission point we obtain the following results With jet fuel prices at per gallon the fuel costs are lower for the Airbus Aneo resulting in a higher profit The fuel consumption per passengerkilometer is L for the Airbus A and L for the Airbus Aneo Using current fuel prices of approximately the profit is about higher for the Airbus Aneo Figure Fuel consumption per passengerkm for the Airbus A and Airbus Aneo Source DhierinPerkash Bechai Figure Fuel consumption per passengerkm for the Airbus A and Airbus Aneo Source DhierinPerkash Bechai One of the things that is interesting to notice is the revenue potential of belly freight this has not been taken into account in this analysis However making a quick calculation using the containers on the Airbus A and calculating the number of LD needed for carrying baggage it can be concluded that the Airbus A has LD containers available for the transportation of revenue generating belly freight The Airbus Aneo is already a leap forward for operators but this does not mean it is a winner For airlines it remains a challenge to fill the Airbus A and smaller yet efficient alternatives will be available soon In Part the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER along with its performance upgrade and optional seat addition will be analyzed and added to the comparison Editors Note This article discusses one or
