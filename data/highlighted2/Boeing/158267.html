Precision Castparts Corp is encouraging investors to consolidate the fragmented aircraft components industry even as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co uses its clout as the worlds biggest plane maker toput a check on some deals Berkshire chief Warren Buffett isnt alone in seeing potential for profits from rising demand for commercial aircraft Private equity and strategic buyers have been pouring into the sector and foreign companies such as Chinas AVIC and Senior PLC of the UK have recently been prowling for deals bankers and company executives said Potentially standing in their way though is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>these people said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is thebiggest customer of most aerospace suppliers andis slowing some acquisitions by using its power to approve the transfer of its supply contracts from one owner to another <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can act like as an unofficial regulator on aerospace mergers and acquisitions because of the assignability clause inserted in most of its contracts with suppliers The clause allows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to refuse to transfer the contracts to the new owners giving it a de facto veto over deals <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said it hasnt changed the process it uses to scrutinize mergers and acquisitions among suppliers and that the time taken depends on the size and complexity of the deal Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg who took over July is continuing predecessor Jim McNerneys policy of derisking We have an ability to have our voice heard in the MA process and we use that ability said Kent Fisher vice president and general manager of suppliers at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Commercial Airplanes But bankers and company owners said approvals from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>that used to take a couple of weeks now take much longer putting deals at risk with no explanation from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>for the delay Any time you have a pause in a transaction it increases the risk that it wont get across the finish line said Brian Murphy a managing director at Meridian Capital an investment bank based in Seattle For example <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>took four months to approve the purchase of a small supplier by Liberty Hall Capital Partners a New York private equity firm focused on aerospace and defense LaCroix Industries which has employees and was founded in Kent Washington in has long supplied parts directly to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>for the and jets It earned awards from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>for nearperfect quality the last seven years cofounder Philip LaCroix said The company began talks with Liberty Hall last September and sought Boeings blessing in April he said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>took until July to consent and the deal closed that month The approvals from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>were the major slowdown and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>wouldnt say what was causing the delay LaCroix said in an interview That part of it was frustrating he said You could lose a deal over something like that where the acquirer says Hey Im out of this Liberty Hall declined to comment It plans to integrate LaCroix into its Irving Texasbased Accurus Aerospace Corp subsidiary which also supplies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>LaCroix had already agreed to give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>percent price cuts on existing contracts starting in The alternative was slow death by losing the right to bid on future work LaCroix said Staying in business with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was much preferable he said and still had plenty of profit for us Some bankers say they routinely exclude potential bidders for a company if they know those wont pass muster with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>which looks at financial strength track record and investment intentions of prospective buyers Some also see the logic of talking with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>about meeting assignability requirements and understand Boeings need to minimize supply chain risk Reviewing the companies that would acquire their suppliers is part of that said Jet Wales a managing director at Moss Adams Capital in Seattle North American aerospace and defense deals shot up percent last year and their value nearly doubled to about billion Thomson Reuters data show Private equity buyers are involved in an increasing number of transactions according to data from PitchBook a Seattle firm that tracks transactions fueling competition for choice targets The big attraction Boeings eightyear backlog of commercial jet orders worth billion Investors see an assured revenue stream and have bid up the prices of supplier companies to lofty levels Ownership changes can increase risk however A stumble by a key supplier can disrupt Boeings carefully orchestrated factories and run up hefty costs When Zodiac Aerospace of France failed to deliver premium seats earlier this year it delayed delivery of s to American Airlines and hit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>with what analysts said were several hundred million dollars in added costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said those estimates are overstated Many experts expect Buffetts aerospace purchase will spur even more consolidation and likely will prompt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to look even more closely at deals that affect its suppliers Precision Castparts a yearold firm based in Portland Oregon locked up key aerospace products and production capabilities by doing its own strategic acquisitions It is now an integral supplier of parts for commercial and military aircraft and engines <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>woke up to the fact after the fact said Christian Schiller a managing director at Cascadia Capital investment bank in Seattle referring to Precisions success in achieving vertical integration They couldnt undo it so theyre making sure they can exert more control over the MA process to make sure a PCC doesnt happen again He and other bankers said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a legitimate need to protect its interests and avoid the rise of another powerful supplier But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should make it easier for the smaller deals to go forward Schiller said Theres no need to take really hard looks at million to million deals <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>subjects even small deals to detailed scrutiny such as the purchase by Kidd Co and Centerfield Capital Partners of Imaginetics Inc then a person precision machining shop in Auburn Washington a top supplier to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Approval took more than a month said a source familiar with the deal Imaginetics declined to comment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has turned up the heat on who is the buyer and is taking longer to decide that a deal is OK said Michael Black a principal at Zachary Scott an investment bank in Seattle Theyve got a pretty tough filter and its gotten tougher and I dont see that changing Thomson Reuters is the worlds largest international multimedia news
