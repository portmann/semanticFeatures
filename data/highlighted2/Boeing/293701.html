be banned from the site With the topic of distress among US oil and gas exploration and production companies becoming more important with every passing day that oil not only continues to drop but certainly fails to rebound to levels that allow US energy companies to return to a cash flow positive state we would like to show just how much debt is at stake To do that drawing inspiration from a tweet by J Pierpont Morgan we have conducted a quick CapIQ sort through all US energy companies both public and private that have at least million in annual revenue and whose EBITDA less CapEx was a negative number in the LTM period To be sure this gives listed companies the benefit of not only higher EBITDA in the early quarters when the drop of oil was not as severe but also of oil price hedges As such as the true negative cash flow going forward assuming no rebound in the price of oil for the foreseeable future will be far worse as the benefit of the base effect dissipates with every passing quarter and as oil price hedges which have so far cushioned the oil price blow are unwound There are roughly US companies that had mm in LTM revenue and that had negative FCF or EBITDA less CapEx The combined market cap of these companies is just shy of half a trillion dollars The combined Total Enterprise Value of these companies is billion The combined debt of these companies is billion None of these companies are bankrupt yet As a reminder putting as many of these companies out of business and thus slashing nonOPEC oil production as OPEC forecasted in its latest bulletin earlier today is the primary motive behind Saudi Arabias relentless pumping spree There is just one problem with the Saudi plan even assuming all of these companies file Chapter all that would happen is their debt would be wiped out with the existing creditors getting the equity keys and becoming the new owners of streamlined debtfree corporations This would means that the All In Cost Of Production would plunge as no debt payments would have to be satisfied with the free cash flow Meanwhile the entire existing EP infrastructure would still be in place and ready to pump as before This means that after the default and debtforequity deluge US shale would be able to pump even more at far lower breakeven costs forcing Saudi Arabia to overproduce for even longer ultimately shooting itself in the foot when its reserves run out Of course none of this is any comfort for those who have exposure to the prepetition debt which may explain why various regional Feds are suddenly so very defensive when it comes to US banks and other lenders who are on the hook when the default tsunami finally hits Mon Lumberjack Valero has performed quite well That said what really peeves me off is How SUNE TERP and GLBL keep skating You are assuming the Saudis are the ones pulling the strings to bankrupt these companies You know better Again you need to ask the FED this question along with the others in your previous article when Dallas Fed replied It is the FED and its owners who are trying to get hard assets by theft as usual Mon U eee aaa Mon Antifaschistische Heres the other pointpeople scratch their head driving around Houston well no the of it thats ghetto but the where the of the are building sq ft mansions along Memorial Drive etc the point isthe money to build those homes came from the Fed and the Banking Debt Bomb Bubblejust like Larry Ellisons Island Purchase Its all the damn Feds free money give awayand it will be be the taxpayers left to cleanup FINEI want these homes liquidated when it all goes up in smoke Mon nuubee Mon sun tzu Mon ahooogah we really really dont have a problem start with B and say half of that is genuinely bad B That in todays terms is NOT real money the fed could control P that without batting an eye They will to prevent the CDSs on the crap from going off Mon Yes We Can But Mon buzzsaw too bad they arent a tbtf bank because then they could get a bailout in fact as long as revenue covers bonuses the losses would be irrelevant sucks to be them Mon buzzsaw the poor bastards who actually produce shit arent worth anything in the new eCONoME Only girly handed paper pushers are important Mon Make_Mine_A_Double One of my competitors offered roughly the same productservice as mine but at a roughly discount to breakeven operating costs forget profit My competitor is a foreign corporation heavily indebted in USD loans and holder of massive asset overbuilding that has to be utilized under bank covenants So for him anything USD is tall clover and assets utilization is a bonus However all of this is being done at an overall loss a substantial one at that So the meme seems to be accure USD fuck the market upside since well worry abou that tomorrow Im scratching my balls wondering how the hell I am supposed to operate in a net negative enviroment since I do not have the luxury of no profit transactions Mon sschu Its called various things like mercantilism or dumping The seller is just concerned about covering their variable cost plus a little They are in survival mode The Japanese made this approach famous in the s they in effect exported their unemployment Mon Spitzer Mon PersonalRespons Mon still kicking Managment at your competitor is now structuring exit packages or retention packages that allows them to rob the place empty since they know they are no longer a viable business My company is doing the same thing all of a sudden they announced quarterly bonuses large bonuses when everyone knows we will be filing bankruptcy within the next months Mon gatorengineer You bid the subcontract to one of your competitors suppliers and have him take the contract in local currency and you take the risk I have a large subcontract with a canadian firm that they took in USD at about parrity years ago They are doing handstands and cartwheels right now Mon alphahammer One of my competitors offered roughly the same productservice as mine but at a roughly discount to breakeven operating costs forget profit My competitor is a foreign corporation A foreign company selling their products in the US at a discount to breakeven Hmm Thats called dumping my friend and you should be on the phone to regulators ASAP Your scenario is illegal under US and Intl law re dumping Mon Omen IV marginal cash operating cost plus interest payment same happened in in oil and gas as well as OCTG steel as all eventually went to BK the Saudi strategy is better than you think for one reason the shale curve is steep within months the decline is dramatic in the early s without horizontal then and now with horizontal with better pressure applied and combofluids the same curve with more up today so who is going to put up new money for drilling of expiry acreage when price are below bbl so even with BK marginal cost of assets plus operating costs and no acreage cost to amortize there will be few takers to drill for quite a while once million per year in US Canadian production rolls off the market will stabilize even with Iran coming on board Mon Bill of Rights Mon Catullus You mean companies go bankrupt and their equipment technology and people dont just disappear So crashing the price never works Most of these companies dont hedge production Then they lock in royalties Theyre all positive ebitda in a oil environment Oil needs to go to for this to shit the bed Mon moonmac Those who loan out money foolishly deserves to lose it and deadbeats should be labeled as such Instead our brilliant gubbermint bails out both the idiots and the bums USA USA USA Most participants in the energy derivatives market rely on a standard contract that was developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and is recognized in the courts The contract clearly specifies the rights each party has in the event of a default said Robert Pickel the associations chief executive As of late yesterday he added the markets appeared to be fairly resilient in the face of extremely negative developments regarding such a major player But at least one lawyer who specializes in swaps contracts indicated that it might be too soon to assess the full impact That lawyer Ann OHara in Lincoln Neb said that her clients anxiety about Enron had escalated sharply only in the last few days No one believed it would really happen she said It is not a surprise but it is a shock We dont really know who is out there exposed to Enrons credit she added Im telling my clients to prepare for the worst Chicago IL Washington DC David Almasi of the National Center for Public Policy Research made himself the most unpopular person the room at the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shareholder meeting in Chicago today after he asked company chairman and CEO W James McNerney about conflicts of interest between Boeings philanthropy and actions by senior public officials and raised the question of whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had unnecessarily exposed itself to the danger of being prosecuted for honest services fraud Almasi was following up on a April Washington Poststory by Rosalind Helderman who reported that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>made a contribution to the Clinton Foundation and a million donation important to thenSecretary of State Hillary Clinton in the same timeframe that Secretary Clinton made what she called a shameless pitch to Russias state airline on Boeings behalf Almasi asked Mr McNerney in part full question here The official purpose of our Companys donation to the Clinton Foundation was to build schools in Haiti Assuming that building schools in Haiti was a key goal of this Companys philanthropic programs in why was it so important to support this work specifically through the Clinton Foundation and not one of the many other reputable independent charities then working in Haiti By donating to the Clinton Foundation within months of receiving a huge favor from the Secretary of State did we not expose both our Company and the Secretary of State to the risk of being charged with honest services fraud There is at least one lobbyist in jail right this minute for giving public employees travel and meals worth far far less than He claims he didnt intend bribery that what he did was businessasusual But hes in jail now nonetheless <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should have been aware of all of this added Ridenour During the same time period as the
