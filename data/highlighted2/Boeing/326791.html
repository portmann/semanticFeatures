accounting is not unusual in the aircraft industry Learning curve effect leads to lower costs in the future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA saw its shares decline by more than twelve percent intraday after an SEC probe into the companys program accounting practices was announced I believe this provides a great buying opportunity for investors Boeings shares are down to which is just slightly above the companys week low and almost twenty percent below the share price at the beginning of the year The companys most recent selloff was based on news about an SEC probe into Boeings program accounting practices Program accounting is a legal practice which allows companies to distribute costs over several units which makes sense in some cases eg the aircraft industry Developing and testing new aircraft comes with huge upfront costs also the production costs for the first few aircraft are a lot higher than production costs a couple of years later when everyone in the company is used to the new product and operations have been trimmed for efficiency If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>used traditional accounting methodsunit accounting the first airplanes would come with huge losses whereas the airplanes of the same series which are produced a couple of years later would be very profitable By using program accounting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can distribute the higher costs at the beginning over the whole expected volume which smooths earnings numbers earlier on each aircraft is more profitable than with unit accounting later on each airplane is less profitable than with unit accounting The SEC is investigating Boeings use of the program accounting method for its and Dreamliner product series The image above shows the efficiency gains one can expect whilst moving along the learning curve the above example is for fighter aircraft but the principle is the same for other types of aircraft The first few units need up to four times as much man hours to produce as units and beyond which means that production costs for the first units are a lot higher as well Moving along the learning curve means lower labor costs but other costs will decrease as well as the learning curve not only applies to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>but also its suppliers which means the parts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>buys will get cheaper over the years as well Add in better capital efficiency lower required overhead costs as production matures and lower error frequency as employees are getting more experience and you have a lot of costs declining over the years Using program accounting for Boeings aircraft series thus makes sense generally speaking The SEC probe will try to find out whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been too optimistic regarding cost cutting possibilities thus assuming a learning curve which is steeper than it is in reality as well as the fact that Boeings sales forecasts might be too optimistic The Dreamliner program has deferred costs of about billion which is the highest of any <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aircraft series so far On the other hand Boeings estimate for sales is very high as well spreading billion over these airplanes means million in deferred costs per airplane If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>manages to cut production costs by million per unit for its Dreamliner series there will be no problem if Boeings assumptions about a rather steep learning curve with this type of aircraft is correct there will not be any writeoffs For Boeings valuation Im using the discounted cash flow method using a WACC of percent my assumptions include a riskfree rate of percent an equity risk premium of percent and Boeings beta of Using the finboxio valuation model I looked at three scenarios the middle scenario which means a fair value of about and upside of about twenty percent seems to be the most likely Due to the fact that even in the pessimistic scenario using a higher WACC and an FCF growth rate of just percent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would be undervalued right now I believe the companys shares look attractive right now Investors with a longterm horizon might use the recent share price weakness to enter a position in this company which offers a wide moat very large backlog strong cash flows high dividend and substantial share repurchases Boeings shares have come under pressure this year partially due to an SEC probe into the companys program accounting practices The Dreamliner program has huge deferred costs but with a large expected sales number of planes this comes in at roughly million per unit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should be able to cut costs by this much if its assumptions about the learning curve effect are right <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>looks undervalued at the current price and offers a lot of positives including a large backlog high cash flows and a high dividend which makes the companys shares attractive Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in BA over the next hours I wrote this article myself and
