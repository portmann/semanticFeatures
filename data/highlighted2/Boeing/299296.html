January TEHRAN Iran unveiled an expanded shopping list for more than European planes including superjumbos and dangled another big order in front of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>BAN at Tehrans first major postsanctions business gathering on Sunday In a sign of Tehrans determination to compete with established carriers across the Gulf Transport Minister Abbas Akhoondi said Irans emergence from isolation would restore a natural balance in the region and urged foreigners to invest I hold your hands in friendship he told an audience of airlines suppliers lessors and bankers at an aviation conference in Tehran World powers last week lifted crippling sanctions against Iran in return for Tehran complying with a deal to curb its nuclear ambitions The deal also released billions of dollars worth of frozen Iranian assets and opened the door for global companies that have been barred from doing business in Iran Akhoondi vowed to banish the middlemen who many say have profited from helping Iran evade sanctions by buying parts and even whole aircraft on the black market He told investors that anyone who approached them claiming to represent the government in negotiations would be lying A stampede of investors at the CAPA Iran Aviation Summit illustrated the potential for suppliers to Iran at a time when the industry faces concerns over the global economy It also paved the way for a potential battle between domestic and foreign carriers to serve Irans markets bolstered by tourists and investors touting for business Akhoondi told Reuters in an interview that Iran did not fear competition from foreign carriers and enjoyed competitive advantages because of its geography I think it is a very natural position for Iran he said The number of potential plane orders rose during the first day of the conference with a senior official telling delegates that Iran was closing on a deal for jets from Airbus compared with earlier estimates of aircraft Added to the growing list were European ATR turboprops Deputy Transport Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan told Reuters that Iran had provisionally agreed to buy eight Airbus A superjumbos to be delivered from It also intends to buy As Europes newest longdistance jetliner he said Another Iranian official said the talks which appear to have accelerated as President Hassan Rouhani prepares to visit Europe this week included about shorthaul As and as many as of its A widebody jets If confirmed a deal on that scale would be worth more than billion at list prices though Iran is sure to receive hefty discounts since its purchase includes a mixture of new jets and endoftherun models available for bargains financiers said Due to long waiting times for new jets Iran is also looking at buying four outofproduction longhaul As on the secondhand market which can be placed into service without delay Delegates said Sundays barrage of announcements appeared designed not only to underscore Irans economic potential but also to encourage US planemaker <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>whose executives were absent from the Tehran conference to enter formal negotiations Kashan told Reuters that Iran was ready to buy at least jets from the worlds largest planemaker <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said it was assessing the steps needed to deal with Iran which remains subject to a number of US restrictions Industry observers have said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and other US suppliers are partly worried about how to handle opposition to the Iran nuclear deal in Congress and from US allies in the Gulf Tehran has long said it will need to revamp an ageing fleet hit by a shortage of parts because of trade bans imposed by Washington and other Western powers But the sheer volume of commercial technical and legal detail took some of the foreign delegates by surprise Things are going faster than we expected said Bertrand Grabowski a managing director at Germanys DVB Bank adding Iran had set out a regulatory regime comparable to Europes Several airline bosses however warned that the growth plans depended on building new infrastructure and boosting training Akhoondi said Tehran plans to award a contract soon for the expansion of Tehrans international airport Thomson Reuters is the worlds largest
