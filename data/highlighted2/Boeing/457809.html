style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>recently announced a big order from a Chinese buyer and expects more orders from Asia and the Middle East Boeings nd Quarter earnings announcement is due shortly and investors might be attracted to the stock given its high dividend yield and low valuation We believe that a bet on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is ultimately a bet on the Global Economy and that investors should therefore exercise caution when buying the stock Farnborough and Second Quarter Earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA was in the news recently announcing at the Farnborough Air Show that it had received Billion worth of orders from an unnamed Chinese buyer most likely Xiamen Airlines for of its planes The aerospace and defense giant also expects a Billion order for planes from Donghai Airlines and possibly a to vehicle order from Qatar Airways Boeings busy Air Show schedule occurs against the backdrop of its looming earnings announcement in late July when the company is expected to report nd Quarter income of share on the back of Billion in revenue Dividend and Outlook For the most part has been a challenging year for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>the companys first quarter earnings missed analyst estimates by share and the stock is down by That performance is in contrast with the Dow Jones Industrial Average of which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is a component which recently hit a record close and is up by in A tepid global economy which resulted in fewer new airplane orders and Boeings own tepid results have driven the negative sentiment against the stock With Boeings stock down for the year dividend investors are looking at a annual dividend yield This means that a investment in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will generate passive income of a year Given Boeings high sensitivity to global macroeconomic trends and government spending it cant be qualified as a defensive play so much as a macro bet you buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>when the outlook for the world economy is strong and governments are flush with tax revenues to spend on military orders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>actually raised its dividend by nearly in adding to its run of doubledigit dividend raises that began in With a Working Capital ratio of to which is considerably higher than its peer groups reading <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has liquid resources to spare and therefore the capacity to continue paying and even raising dividends Indeed in its most recent earnings release <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>indicated that it expects approximately Billion in operating cash flow for more than enough to cover dividend payments of around million per quarter and chip away at the Billion remaining in its stock buyback program <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>doesnt have much debt carrying just under Billion Consequently it paid only million in interest during the last quarter or around of the amount it returned to investors as dividends The reason why Boeings DebttoEquity ratio is more than double its industrys is that similar to Dow components such as CocaCola NYSE KO McDonalds NYSE MCD and M NYSE MMM it has engaged in sizable stock repurchases over the years This in turn has reduced its equity base and made its DebttoEquity ratio look unattractive However with its sizable operating cash flow and strong liquidity Boeings debt is manageable and credit ratings agency Fitch recently affirmed Boeings A credit rating For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>expects to report earnings of between to share but analysts anticipate that its actual results will hew towards the lower end of this range Despite this lessthansunny outlook for Boeings current prospects analysts are forecasting that over the next five years Boeings revenues will rise by over a year better than the expected for its industry A positive view regarding the pace of global output and interest in Boeings newer offerings such as the MAX are behind this positive outlook Boeings stock is trading at a trailing PriceEarnings ratio of x and a forward PriceEarnings ratio of x Both these measures are lower than that for both the Dow and the SP suggesting that Boeings shares are undervalued Indeed Boeings trading ratio is also below that of its industry and that of the broader capital goods sector Dividend investors looking for other reasons to buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will also note that unlike a number of its fellow Dow Components which are trading close to their week highs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is trading in the middle of its week range the stock has clearly not benefited greatly from the markets recordsetting rally That said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares have rallied by since hitting its low in midFebruary when the markets were roiled by plummeting oil prices and fears of a global recession It also remains to be seen what impact Brexit will have on Boeings future prospects In the immediate aftermath of the Leave vote the UK government reaffirmed its order for Apache helicopters and actually signed a new contract for new P Maritime Patrol Aircraft However the longterm effects of Brexit are not yet apparent and is one headwind that will bear watching for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Another is China the headlinegrabbing deals <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>announced at Farnborough were from Chinese airlines but the mainlands economy is in a decidedly soft spot While advance orders from Chinese commercial carriers are a positive sign the fact remains that these orders can be cancelled and very much depend on a Chinese economic recovery that has yet to gain traction All things considered the outlook for Boeings shares is mixed On the one hand its shares are relatively undervalued and investors can expect a dividend that is among the highest of the Dow components On the other hand betting on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is betting that the global economy will be in a much better place five years from now We therefore recommend that investors take a cautious approach when investing with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>In our view the best strategy for the stock is to dollar costaverage and to mix that approach with heavy buying during market dips Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate
