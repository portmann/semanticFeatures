and had a look at current fleets and orders from the biggest Indian airlines The total fleet is or of these aircraft are narrow body airframes and or are wide body aircraft With a market share of measured in units Airbus is the market leader in India In terms of value both manufacturers probably have a share of around On the narrow body market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing
