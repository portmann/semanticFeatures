#A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>have held a virtual monopoly over US Air Force space launches SpaceX represents a huge threat to the ULA in the form of a much more competitive space launch alternative for the US Air Force Lockheed Martin and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>stand to lose billions in revenue if their monopoly over US Air Force space launches is broken Lockheed Martin NYSE LMT and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA have long held a monopoly over US Air Force space launch contracts which are worth billions of dollars every year Lockheed Martin and The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company who have partnered up to form a joint venture called The United Launch Alliance ULA have enjoyed the comfortable benefits of its exclusive relationship with the US Air Force Unfortunately for Lockheed Martin and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>this comfortable monopoly is successfully being challenged by Elon Musk run SpaceX SpaceXs rapid encroachment into the US Air Force space launch program could cause Lockheed Martin and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to lose billions in annual revenue If SpaceX is successful in breaking the monopoly which looks to be increasingly likely Lockheed Martin and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will have to compete with the ultrainnovative SpaceX for future contracts This of course is terrible news for Lockheed Martin and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>In fact the US Air Force recently confirmed that it should have SpaceX certified to compete for launches in just a short few months Naturally this comfortable monopoly enjoyed by Lockheed Martin and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has significantly dulled their innovativeness and motivation to reduce space launch costs This innovation divide between Lockheed MartinBoeing and SpaceX should have an enormous negative impact on Lockheed MartinBoeings businesses especially considering the fact that a considerable amount of these companies revenues come from their space related ventures SpaceX has survived and thrived due to the sheer will and innovative genius of Elon Musk and the SpaceX team The company successfully broke into the space launch industry after what has to have been one of the most brutal company beginnings ever Originally funded almost completely by Elon Musks own wealth SpaceX is a true example of survival of the fittest Given that SpaceX no longer has to worry about survival the companys innovative edge is clearly starting to show in costcomparisons between its launch vehicles and that of the ULAs The price differential of launchvehicle costs between Lockheed MartinBoeing and SpaceX is startling to say the least SpaceXs costs are not cheaper in the single digit percentages or even double digit percentages but magnitudes cheaper According to last years Senate hearing involving both SpaceX and the ULA SpaceXs average launches cost under M while the ULAs average launches cost approximately M While this costgap is certainly astonishing it is not entirely unexpected given the combination of SpaceXs innovativeness and the ULAs lack of competition While the introduction of competition will almost certainly cause the average launch cost of ULA vehicles to plummet it is still questionable whether its vehicles will be able to compete with those of SpaceXs In fact SpaceX is incredibly close to developing reusable rockets which could be devastating for Lockheed MartinBoeing as no amount of innovation and costreductions will enable these companies to compete with SpaceX The only way for the ULA to compete with SpaceX would be for the ULA to develop its own reusable rocket technology which is exceedingly unlikely in the nearmid term SpaceXs reusable rocket technology could be devastating for Lockheed Martin and Boeings ULA Here is a picture of SpaceXs reusable rocket technology in play Financial Impact For Lockheed MartinBoeing On a purely competitive basis it is basically a foregone conclusion that SpaceX would absolutely crush Lockheed MartinBoeing in terms of pure economics The only real barrier protecting Lockheed MartinBoeing from this influx of competition has been its solesource contracts with the US Air Force Unfortunately for Lockheed MartinBoeing this barrier is crumbling due to the barrage of negative pressattention aimed at the US Air Forces monopoly relationship with the ULA SpaceX has already made significant headway into breaking this monopoly relationship between the ULA and the US Air Force which could translate into billions of lost revenue for both Lockheed Martin and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>In fact the US Air Forces Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle EEVL contracts would cost the Pentagon approximately B over the next years with ULA as the sole launch provider If SpaceX were to break into this monopoly and take away a significant amount of business this could easily translate into tens of billions in lost revenue for Lockheed Martin and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>While the space launch business does not represent the majority of either Lockheed Martin or Boeings business the financial impact of SpaceXs disruptive influence is significant nonetheless SpaceXs disruptive influence will likely show up both in terms of immediate and future lost revenues If we were to assume that SpaceX will outinnovate Lockheed Martin and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>moving forward which is more than likely given the companys amazing track record then the ULA will almost certainly be crushed in a purely competitive environment So far ULA only has a financial edge over SpaceX although even this is rapidly changing as SpaceXs business is growing exponentially Just recently for instance SpaceX won a B contract with NASA to develop space taxis for astronauts although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>admittedly won its own B contract While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>also shared in the spoils SpaceXs NASA contract nonetheless showcases SpaceXs growing business and subsequently its balance sheet While Lockheed Martin still has upside due to the promise of its other businesses investors have to be mindful of SpaceXs potential disruptive impact Lockheed Martin in particular is still an attractive investment due to rising geopolitical threats think Wahhabist terrorism the rise of China Russias instability etc and the increasing technological nature of war for instance Lockheed Martins revolutionary laser both of which benefit Lockheed Martin immensely On the other hand the attractiveness of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as an investment is less clear given the companys recent stock price runup and its relatively higher proportion of space related businesses of which SpaceX could easily encroach into With that being said SpaceXs potentially disruptive impact should have a negative impact on both Lockheed Martin and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>which is something investors need to be wary about moving forward Source SpaceXs Threat To Lockheed
