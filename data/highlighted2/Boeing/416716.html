Deliveries decreased by units compared to last month Split between narrow and wide body deliveries was a split which also shows in the estimated market value of the deliveries Lower delivery volume is caused by lower delivery volume for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Dreamliners were delivered of which were <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s It can be concluded that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will have the upper hand in the Dreamliner deliveries which bodes well for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as the aircraft has higher profit margins and brings in more cash Delivery volume was well below the monthly average In order to reach its delivery target <span

expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to be facing a challenge to achieve its booktobill target In April I published an article in which I said that the order books of jet makers are not bubbles but should decline at some point In that article I shared my thoughts and expected order inflow to decline in a few years from now With oil prices having declined ever since chances are the order books will decline sooner than I expected at first With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>just barely meeting its target last year might be the year in which
