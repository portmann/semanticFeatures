How Deep Is That Hole That <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Dug For The Dreamliner The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha I expect deferred costs to reach bn by Q Program breakeven after deliveries is achievable One of the main things that is being eyeballed by investors and analysts is the deferred production cost on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA uses a clever accounting method that allows the company to pull forward profits Without the accounting method <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would most probably book high losses in the first few years of Dreamliner production This method works quite well for projects such as the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>but at one point the deferred costs should start decreasing For the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>this has not happened yet Breakeven on production costs was expected in after which the deferred costs would start declining somewhere in At some point <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said it did not expect deferred production costs to rise above bn In Q deferred production costs rose to bn a mln increased compared to last quarter In this article I will have a look at how costs per airframe have developed since and how they might develop in the future Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Deferred costs Source AeroAnalysisnet Figure shows quite well that deferred costs rose sharply since Q but at the same time it can be seen that from QQ and onwards the rate of costs growth started declining This can be seen as a first step on reaching breakeven on production The decelerated cost growth is better visualized in Figure Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>quarterly increase in deferred costs Source AeroAnalysis As can be seen in Figure deferred costs per quarter started declining since Q Compared to Q the growth rate of deferred costs was stable but the increase in deferred costs does not take into account the number of deliveries Figure Loss per produced <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Source AeroAnalysis Figure gives a clear view on the development of deferred production cost per unit It can clearly be seen that the costs have been declining and currently are around mln So in Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>lost million per produced <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>which is a improvement compared to the previous quarter and a improvement year over year In order to breakeven by the end of the year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>needs to cut costs per unit by or in total costs in the next quarter and completely cut costs in the fourth quarter Given Boeings progress in cutting costs I dont see this happening During the last quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>decreased the growth rate of costs by mln per half year which is equivalent to per quarter Using a reduction in growth rate per quarter deferred costs will grow to bn in Q and hit breakeven around that same time If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>further invests in the production process breakeven might even occur earlier than Q but reaching breakeven by the end of the year really is a challenge By Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will have delivered approximately airframes and has accumulated almost bn in deferred costs If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>needs to break even on the program with its current backlog it needs to make mln profit per airframe As increasing profitability per airframe is a gradual process profit per airframe needs to be slightly higher to compensate for lower profit on the first few profitable airframes The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER currently at high discounts has a profit margin of but this used to be as high as A profit margin on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would mean a mln profit per aircraft whereas mln is needed to breakeven This indicates that breaking even on the program with the current backlog does make sense According to my calculations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could return profits on the entire program within the first deliveries which is a figure that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>already estimated years ago and are now being confirmed by my own calculations With demand for medium and small widebody aircraft topping airframes in the coming years the future looks bright for the Dreamliner Reaching breakeven by yearend without investing in the production process is a major challenge Using a reduction in growth rate for the deferred costs I expect breakeven somewhere after deliveries and a deferred production cost close to bn <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could see profit on the program within deliveries The hole that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>dug for the Dreamliner is deep but increases in efficiency production rates and strong demand should give the Dreamliner strength to fly out of that hole Source So How Deep Is That Hole That <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Dug For The Dreamliner Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks
