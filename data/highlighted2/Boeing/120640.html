Reuters <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co said on Friday it will take a million aftertax charge in its secondquarter results to deal with problems in the fuel system on the KCA aerial refueling tanker it is developing for the US Air Force The Chicagobased company said the charge which amounts to cents per share would result in lower earnings for the full year It said added funds were needed to cover higher costs for development certification and initial production of the tanker aircraft while keeping the billion aircraft program on track for initial deliveries of tankers by August This is the second charge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has taken on the KC tanker one of its biggest defense development efforts bringing the total aftertax charges to just over million with the pretax bill reaching nearly billion The worlds biggest commercial planemaker which is also a major defense contractor beat European rival Airbus to win the contract in capping a nearly decadelong saga that saw two senior former <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>executives serve prison terms for violating federal ethics rules <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had long rejected US Air Force estimates that it would cost the company over billion more than expected to develop and test the refueling planes but unexpected problems over the past year changed the situation analysts said Brigadier General Duke Richardson who runs the program for the Air Force said he remained optimistic that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would meet its delivery targets and that the first fully integrated KC tanker would fly in September as planned While we have more heavy lifting coming up we believe it is achievable and do not see any technical showstoppers he said in a statement <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>must absorb the additional costs of development of the program since US government costs are capped at billion under a fixedprice contract The companys shares were down percent at in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said it would adjust its earnings per share outlook when it reports results on July but said its outlook for revenue and cash flow would remain unchanged The tanker investment will have a cash impact this year but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will make up for it in other ways to maintain its fullyear cash outlook said company spokesman Bernard Choi Ken Herbert an analyst at Canaccord Genuity Inc who rates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>a buy with a price target said the charge was not a surprise and investors were relieved that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>did not announce any further charges or problems with its commercial airliner program Losses on the continue to rise though the pace is slowing as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>improves the production system Loren Thompson an analyst with the Virginiabased Lexington Institute said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>knowingly underestimated its KC development costs to prevent Airbus from winning the deal but the losses were larger than the company initially expected Dennis Muilenburg Boeings former defense chief who took over as chief executive on July said the longerterm outlook for the program remained upbeat and it should turn a profit once the development phase is completed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said the extra spending was needed to fix the tankers integrated fuel system which delivers fuel to the aircraft itself and is also used for refueling other aircraft in midair after problems emerged during testing It said testing of nonfuel system components is percent complete and it is making progress on its overall ground and flight test program <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has forecast a longterm billion market for refueling planes Airbus beat <span
