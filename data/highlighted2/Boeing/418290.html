LEAPA on largest MAX <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>looking at pair of midmarket jets with seats Decision could usher in technology for next generation of jets PARISNEW YORK May <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is considering a plan to put a larger engine on its biggest narrowbody airliner in an effort to blunt the runaway success of a rival Airbus jet that outsells it by four to one industry sources said The US planemaker would substitute a modified version of the larger and more powerful LEAPA engine used on Airbuss Aneo rather than the LEAPB used on the MAX they said That would enable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to add range while lengthening the seat jet to fit or more extra passengers and gain a capacity advantage over the seat Aneo the sources said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>disputes its rivals claims about the strength of demand in this particular section of the market where Airbus has the most advantage But leapfrogging Airbuss Aneo offering with more seats would hedge Boeings position as many airlines opt for bigger planes However the new plane nicknamed MAX by some in the industry would bring significant headaches Adding the larger engine would mean raising and possibly repositioning the landing gear and recertifying parts costing an estimated billion according to industry experts Boeings MAX family uses the smaller LEAP engine because the planes fuselage sits lower to the ground and must therefore have a smaller engine fan Having a different engine on the largest could weaken the advantage of commonality with the smaller LEAP engine used on the rest of the MAX fleet but reflects a growing pragmatism in the face of lost sales It doesnt matter if they are not consistent said Adam Pilarski senior vice president at US consultancy Avitas They are getting killed The maker of the LEAP engines CFM which is coowned by General Electric and Frances Safran declined to comment A GE spokesman said there was no contractual impediment to using a larger engine for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>planes Recent orders by Vietnam startup airline VietJet illustrate the AirbusBoeing fight for narrowbody sales At last Novembers Dubai Airshow Airbus celebrated the sale of As to VietJet while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>officials watched from the sidelines But last week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>pulled off what industry observers saw as a coup by signing an billion order for MAXs with the same airline in the presence of President Barack Obama Boeings plans to boost the size of the largest MAX are one option being considered to defend its franchise as it also tries to carve out a space in the middle of the market between the workhorse narrowbody and big widebody jets like the Dreamliner Stung by Airbuss gains in orders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is pondering a mixed bag of tactical and strategic moves that if fully made could give it a head start in the development of the next generation of jets for production from about Narrowbody mediumhaul jets like the and A family dominate the market by volume with Airbus forecasting deliveries worth trillion over the next years While both have sold thousands of the jets to airlines eager to cut fuel costs Boeings share of the market for such jets has fallen to percent compared with a usual split Market sources say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has shown increasing willingness to compete aggressively for Airbus customers in order to claw back market share as was evident in the VietJet deal We expect to see lower pricing from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>on the MAX Stuart Hatcher of valuation firm IBA told a briefing Boeings tactical tinkering with the also includes tweaking a smaller model to suit two key buyers And the companys aim extends to a strategic middle of the market jet partly to replace its popular Industry sources say that project involves not one jet but two They would have twin aisles and carry and people respectively equating to what analysts see as two distinct slices of potential demand The smaller base model would have a range of about nautical miles dropping to about for the larger variant Airbus has dismissed the idea which would partially overlap with its Aneo It argues that the history of the market is littered with small twinaisle jets that sold poorly including its own A But it is holding in reserve a plan to retaliate with another A makeover using new wings to boost performance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>declined comment on either tactical plans to defend the or the longerterm midmarket studies At billion or more it has said the latter is a difficult business case Were in continuous discussions with our customers about the market Well make the right decisions at the right time a spokesman said While Boeings midmarket study is grabbing most industry attention behind it lies a longerterm bid to turn the tables on Airbus in the broader market for smaller jets where both make most cash according to industry analysts Although differing in size and appearance a midmarket jet would spawn new technology and production methods that could be
