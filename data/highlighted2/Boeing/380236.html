Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in the underdog in a battle that already seems to be won by Bombardier C Series optimized for the seat market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA and Bombardier OTCQXBDRAF are in a battle to win the McDonnell Douglas MD replacement order from Delta Air Lines NYSE DAL Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is the worlds biggest jet maker the company seems to be the underdog in this battle Delta currently operates MDs so the replacement for this fleet type will be a multibillion order and a big win for any jet maker In this article I will have a look at what both jet makers actually have to offer What can be seen when comparing each of the aircraft with the aircraft that they have to replace is that they differ quite a bit but the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>seems to be superior in range However it can be questioned how useful that superior range is The MD has the shortest range of all aircraft and does the job for Delta Air Lines so an improved range does not seem to be a requirement Comparing the seat figures the Bombardier CS has the advantage Since it is known what aircraft is being replaced and the routes the aircraft will be utilized on Delta Air Lines already has an idea on how many seats that aircraft should have In this case it is about seats The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can transport up to to in dense configuration So the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is too small while the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>with roughly seats is too big The CS with an extra pair of emergency doors can transport up to passengers Additionally the fuselage design of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is based on that of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>so it is quite old Any new design probably is better than the fuselage design not only affecting passenger comfort but also maintenance costs When it comes to maintenance costs the all new CS might have the upper hand using composite materials an onboard aircraft health management system and again a fresh design which removes some constraints allowing design teams to make a design that also has lowering maintenance costs This all results in the longer maintenance intervals thereby decreasing the direct maintenance costs When it comes to performance nothing can be said as of yet However one of the biggest advantages that the C Series has is the payload for which is designed the C Series aims for the seat market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>on the other hand is better positioned in the seat market seats is exactly what both jet makers seem to be targeting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>does that with the which is a shrink of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Bombardier does that with the CS which is a stretch From a structural point of view a shrink in general is less efficient than stretching So that would mean that next to a cleansheet design Bombardier has the shrinkstretch advantage So I expect the C Series to have a lower empty weight compared to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>In terms of drag the skin friction drag or profile drag will be approximately equal Since the liftinduced drag can be scaled down by the aspectratio of the wing the lift induced drag coefficient will be lower for the C Series Under the assumption that the empty weight and drag coefficient are lower for the C Series aircraft I do expect the C Series to be superior in terms of fuel economics but I have no data available to verify this The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is not a very popular aircraft these days and the only way to sell them is by giving huge discounts United Airlines NYSE UAL acquired <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s with discounts in excess of This quite clearly shows how unpopular the aircraft is and also shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is aware of the competitive threat the CS poses Although I do not think the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is a bad aircraft it is hard for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to compete with an all new design that is better optimized for the mission Delta requires the aircraft for All that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>really can offer in this battle is steep discounts steeper than what Bombardier can possibly offer but that is about it The operational advantages go to the C Series an aircraft that probably to date has not received the recognition it deserves While writing this article the news that Bombardier and Delta Air Lines are nearing a deal that might be finalized and announced in late April was released This fully supports my view of Bombardier having the upper hand almost completely ruling out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I wrote this article myself
