Engine issues on the Aneo will not create waves Issues on PW engines might give the impression the turbofan is not ready for service entry A few days ago I wrote an article covering the engine problems on the Airbus OTCPKEADSF Aneo after a rather smooth process towards service entry In this article I will have a look at what this might imply for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA MAX Figure Order division MAX and Aneo Source wwwAeroAnalysisnet The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX was launched almost days after the Airbus Aneo which gave the Aneo a head start In the years after the Aneo continued outselling the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX It is likely that a combination of higher discounts engine options a more modern concept and a better aircraft to operate the MoM segment are key to the Airbus Aneo outselling the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX Currently the split between the Aneo and MAX is roughly One of the big advantages of the Aneo is the possibility to select a turbofan A customer can either choose for CFMs LEAP engine or Pratt Whitneys NYSE UTX PW G engine For operators that already operate for instance CFM engines or PW engines this can play a role in engine selection The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX only comes with the CFM LEAP turbofans under its wings giving the airline no freedom to select an engine This gives the Aneo a slight advantage Next to that Pratt Whitney and CFM are likely to constantly compete this should either result in attractive contracts for Aneo operators or accelerated improvement in the engines fuel efficiency both of which will benefit the operator Due to the absence of an engine option on the MAX MAX operators will not benefit from this advantage other than that over time improvements from the CFM LEAPA for the Airbus Aneo could be carried over to the CFM LEAPB for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX Engine issues give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>a stick to beat with I view the possibility to select an engine as a huge advantage for the Airbus Aneo However in the months prior to service entry the PW engines have been coping with setbacks In the months prior to the first delivery damage to the PW engines occurred during test flights in hotweather conditions engineering problems on the Aneo power plants were detected software bugs surfaced and thermal deformation was found in the PW engines All of these issues occurred on the PW geared turbofans which might feed the thought that the engine is not yet ready for reliable commercial operation While I do not expect that this will create waves I do think that this will make selling the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX a bit easier for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could point customers to the fact that they focus on getting the MAX on the market with reliable engine rather than having engines out of which one is having teething problems On the other hand it can also say that the problems that Airbus is facing now would already have been dealt with before service entry if it was a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aircraft Another route <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could take is by questioning the geared turbofan technology using the current issues as a reason for not using geared turbofans on the MAX This would be similar to what Airbus did when it stated it saw the problems with lithium batteries coming and therefore opted out of using it for its Airbus A While I do not expect the current engine issues on the Airbus Aneo to create waves the issues do give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>an easier task in marketing the aircraft to customers With a order split in favor of the Airbus Aneo the current issues could narrow that lead a bit since most narrow body operators still have to decide what next generation narrow body aircraft to order
