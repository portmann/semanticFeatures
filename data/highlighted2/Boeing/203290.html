the next years There is greater utilization of composite materials in modern commercial aircraft over of the weight of the aircraft in new Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>planes The current combined backlog of Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is planes a record level Overview of the Market for Advanced Composites A composite material as the name implies is made by combining two different materials possessing different properties together in order to create a material with specific characteristics that are not achievable by any one substance alone A common example of a composite material would be carbon fibre thin fibres of carbon atoms combined with a polymer resin such as epoxy to create a material with a very high strengthtoweight ratio Using various manufacturing techniques the material properties of a composite can be customized to suit specific requirements depending on the application As the understanding of composite materials has advanced the potential applications for this type of material has grown significantly The figure below shows the global demand for carbon fibrereinforced plastics CFRP from to the forecasted compounded annual growth rate CAGR is The majority of this growth is coming from the aerospace and defence industry Recent advances in technology as well as regulatory standards have allowed composite materials to become much more widely used in the construction of aircraft structures Within this sector the greatest market is in the commercial aircraft segment With the push to make aircraft more efficient and to increase payload capacity airframers such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA Airbus OTCPKEADSY and Bombardier OTCPKBDRAF OTCPKBDRAF are increasingly looking for ways to incorporate composite materials into their designs The trend towards greater utilization of composite materials is clearly illustrated by the <span

AXWB The figure below taken from an Airbus presentation does a nice job of depicting the recent rate at which the use of composites in commercial aircraft has grown Hexcel Corporation NYSE HXL is a leading advanced composites company that is well placed within the industry to take advantage of this trend It is an international company with a presence in the Americas AsiaPacific Europe and Russia with half of its sales coming from the US There operations are divided into three main markets Space Defense Focuses on military aircraft satellites and space launch vehicles Industrial Markets This segment covers the automotive industry wind turbines and recreational products among others The commercial aerospace market represents of revenue growing from in This is illustrated in the below table taken from the K report For each of these markets the company separates its products into two segments Composite Materials and Engineered Products The Annual report describes these as The Composite Materials segment is comprised of our carbon fiber specialty reinforcements resins prepregs and other fiberreinforced matrix materials and honeycomb core product lines The Engineered Products segment is comprised of lightweight high strength composite structures molded components engineered core and honeycomb products with added functionality Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>the two largest commercial aircraft manufacturers are the largest customers of Hexcel together representing of Commercial Aerospace Revenues Thus the success of Hexcel is directly intertwined with the longterm ability of Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to continue selling planes As things stand this is a good place to be positioned The growth in the commercial aircraft market moving forward is expected to be strong Deloitte in its latest Global Aerospace and Defense Industry Outlook forecasts that annual production levels for commercial aircraft will increase by over the coming decade The current combined backlog of Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as of December is planes a record number and roughly years worth of production time Additionally each new generation of aircraft increases its utilization of composite materials The combination of these factors creates a strong tailwind for the advanced composite industry and Hexcel is well positioned to capture this future growth We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the personal
