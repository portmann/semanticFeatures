Seeking Alpha President Obama recently signed into law a billion spending bill for the military of which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should benefit The stock appears to be fairly valued right now based on next years earnings estimates and earnings growth expectations with great nearterm earnings growth prospects The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSE BA is one of the worlds major aerospace firms The company operates in three principal segments commercial airplanes military aircraft and missiles and space and communications On October BA reported its thirdquarter earnings of per share which beat analyst estimates by In the past year the companys stock was up and beat the SP which has gained in the same time frame I recently bought the stock in the speculation portion of my portfolio but havent evaluated it here on Seeking Alpha in over a year With President Obama signing a new defense bill into law I feel that it is important to evaluate it on a fundamental financial and technical basis to see if its worth adding additional shares to my portfolio The company currently trades at a trailing month PE ratio of which is fairly priced but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past On that note the oneyear forwardlooking PE ratio of is currently fairly priced for the future in terms of the right here right now The oneyear PEG ratio which measures the ratio of the price youre currently paying for the trailing month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time I like looking at a oneyear horizon tells me that the company is fairly priced based on a year EPS growth rate of The company has great nearterm future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of Below is a table of how the fundamentals fared each time Ive written about the stock On a financial basis the things I look for are the dividend payouts return on assets equity and investment The company pays a dividend of with a payout ratio of of trailing month earnings while sporting return on assets equity and investment values of and respectively which are all respectable values The really high return on equity value is an important financial metric for purposes of comparing the profitability which is generated with the money shareholders have invested in the company to that of other companies in the same industry for comparison purposes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has the third highest ROE in the aerospacedefense products services industry out of companies As you can see from the table below the ROE has increased significantly over the past year and if youd like to know why I recently wrote an article about the situation The really high return on investment value is an important financial metric because it evaluates the efficiency of an investment that a company makes and if an investment doesnt have a positive ROI then the investment should not be made for comparison purposes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has the second highest ROI in the aerospacedefense products services industry out of companies Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safe play I believe the yield of this company is good enough alone for me to take shelter in for the time being The company has been increasing its dividends for the past four years Below is a table of how the financials fared each time Ive written about the stock Looking first at the relative strength index chart RSI at the top I see the stock is dropping from near overbought territory with a current value of relative to the rest of the market I will look at the moving average convergencedivergence MACD chart next I see that the black line is below the red line with the divergence bars decreasing in height which tells me bearish momentum is in the name As for the stock price itself Im looking at to act as resistance and the day simple moving average currently to act as support for a riskreward ratio which plays out to be to Fundamentally I believe the company to be fairly valued now on next years earnings estimates and on earnings growth expectations with great nearterm earnings growth expectations Financially the company pays a decent dividend and has great returns on equity and investments On a technical basis the riskreward ratio shows me there is more reward than risk right now I actually initiated my position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>earlier this week and wont be surprised if I bought my initial position near the current top in the name But Im never looking to initiate a full position in the name immediately and will not until it gets to below at least I never like to dive full bore into a name I always buy in increments To boot Ill be getting paid a dividend yield to wait I swapped out of General Electric NYSE GE for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>during the portfolio changeout earlier this week because I had a huge gain in GE and felt that it might lag the rest of the market for the coming three months So hopefully I got out near the top in GE and hopefully <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>beats it for the coming quarter For now here is a chart to compare how GE and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>have done against each other and the SP since I swapped the names Though the chart shows a loss in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I am actually down on the name because I bought it towards the middle of the day on November Disclaimer
