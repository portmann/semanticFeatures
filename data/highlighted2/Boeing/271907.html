class='textDiv'>Implications For FedEx As Amazon Launches A Transport And Logistics Operation FedEx Corporation NYSEFDX Seeking Alpha Amazon is making a big push into order fulfillment ground transport last mile delivery and now air transport all threatening FedEx There are many vulnerabilities that exist at FedEx that a disruptor such as Amazon could take advantage of There is still time for FedEx to get things in order and become a much stronger competitor if it gets moving now With many signs pointing to Amazon NASDAQ AMZN launching a service to compete with FedEx NYSE FDX and UPS NYSE UPS compromising sort centers a ground trucking fleet home delivery fleet and now a fleet of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aircraft there are many implications ahead for FedEx Amazon will not be able to launch an operation to compete with FedEx and UPS overnight but it starts the timer leaving FedEx with a limited time now to get itself into shape to compete with a potentially disruptive offering or possibly follow the paths of many other companies who failed to innovate and compete Before going into all the doom and gloom that COULD result from an Amazon transport and logistics service I go into the areas of strength for FedEx and areas it will likely continue to excel in for years to come International services are something FedEx is well known for The breadth of the FedEx network through FedEx itself and an extensive array of partnerships allows a parcel to be sent between virtually any two points in the world Any service from Amazon will have a very difficult time replicating this world class network and at least initially will have no need to as the Amazon service will focus on domestic US service In addition limited use of Amazon outside the USA will also likely hinder its growth in many foreign markets unless Amazon can build a service that is used extensively by third parties rather than mostly for itself FedEx Office and the thousands of retail locations worldwide that have partnerships with FedEx are a huge asset for the company These provide reliable global shipping to many customers looking to make shipments worldwide This retail network is something that any competitor will have a hard time replicating FedEx Same Day City is the companys answer to the increasing demand for same day deliveries The service is currently being launched across the USA and could easily be expanded internationally in the future The service will compete with many couriers along with Uber Pending UBER in some cases It will likely be a big area of growth for ecommerce as customers living in large metro areas begin to expect such a service more and more Something FedEx could do to make this service more compelling would be to open fulfillment centers in cities nationwide and store inventory for ecommerce customers there It could then deliver these products same day in many markets A failure to do this will likely see Amazon move into this space big time and become much more successful as it can offer fulfilment along with speedy delivery for many ecommerce companies in most major areas Despite many strengths at FedEx there are many areas of the company that are under threat from any disruptor such as Amazon FedEx Express is a large part of the business potentially under threat from Amazon The Express division mainly operates a large fleet of aircraft that enable FedEx to offer speedy deliveries from many cities worldwide The business was built however with deliveries of medical supplies critical documents high value consumer products and such in mind as opposed to what it has grown into with ecommerce and delivering pasta diapers books and everything else Amazon has sent its way As a result I see the business not positioned optimally to succeed in this area The business is built to consolidate shipments at the end of the day move them onto plane one that goes to one of their hubs arrive at the hub around midnight and then transition onto another plane for the final leg of the journey to the end destination arriving in the early morning This model works for delivering many shipments that arrive to the company at the end of the work day from hospitals corporations etc However with a constant stream of online orders through ecommerce it might make more sense for FedEx to fly multiple flights back and forth throughout the day on certain city pairs dealing with these parcels as they arrive rather than consolidating them until the end of the day This current operation leads to average aircraft utilization of hours at FedEx something a disruptor could easily take advantage of and something that leads to high costs Despite the threat from Amazon it is worth noting the threat from them is only likely to occur in the USA in the near term Amazon will have a much harder time launching such an operation in markets such as Europe where Amazon is not as popular and FedEx is very strong and Asia where Amazon has little presence In addition Amazon would be required to negotiate with many countries and would be unlikely to receive permission from authorities to operate domestic flights as a foreign company The Amazon operation however could inspire other logistics companies and possibly ecommerce companies such as Alibaba NYSE BABA to set up similar operations in other countries if the Amazon venture is a success FedEx Supply Chain is another area that could see disruption from Amazon and an area Amazon has already moved into in a big way Amazon will now take third party sellers products store them in their warehouse and handle fulfillment and shipping of them The catch however is that the products need to be items sold on Amazoncom With US fulfillment centers Amazon could be a compelling competitor if it offered its fulfillment center services to third parties without requiring them to be sold on Amazoncom While Amazon can be compelling for supply chain solutions within the USA it will take a long time before it can become a true global competitor to FedEx in this regard FedEx supply chain solutions at their world port in Memphis gives customers access to almost every market on the planet while Amazon fulfillment is generally domestic FedEx Smartpost is another part of the company under threat from Amazon Amazon recently purchased thousands of truck trailers to shuttle its products between post offices and its warehouses In addition its last mile Amazon Flex delivery service combined with its trucking network could become a threat to FedEx ground over time if Amazon opens its services up to third parties The fact Amazon managed to capture of Black Friday sales this year shows its dominance in the ecommerce space and it certainly has the resources and investor base tolerant to take on incumbents such as FedEx and UPS in transportation and logistics Losing of ecommerce shipping could quickly turn into a much larger loss for FedEx and UPS UPS if Amazon is able to create a compelling transportation and logistics product that it offers to third parties One big problem at FedEx is inefficiency in some areas and the lack of collaboration amongst the many divisions that exist at the company is a good example of this FedEx Ground Express and Smartpost all operate separate warehouses fleets and have separate management FedEx should seriously consider merging operations of these companies together much more if it wants to remove a critical vulnerability that a disruptor such as Amazon could take advantage of While it is possible Amazon may never open its transportation and logistics services up to third parties FedEx should start planning as if it will The sort of operation FedEx has is not something that can be replicated overnight Such an operation will take years to build up and if FedEx wants to stay on top of the game it will need to start taking a hard look at its operation pretty soon as failure to do
