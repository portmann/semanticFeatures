(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Before going into all the doom and gloom that <b>COULD</b> result from an Amazon transport and logistics service , I go into the areas of strength for FedEx and areas it will likely continue to excel in for years to come .  (Uncertainty) </span>International services are something FedEx is well known for.The breadth of the FedEx network through FedEx itself and an extensive array of partnerships allows a parcel to be sent between virtually any two points in the world.Any service from Amazon will have a very difficult time replicating this world class network and at least initially will have no need to as the Amazon service will focus on domestic U.S service.In addition, limited use of Amazon outside the USA will also likely hinder its growth in many foreign markets unless Amazon can build a service that is used extensively by third parties, rather than mostly for itself.FedEx Office and the thousands of retail locations worldwide that have partnerships with FedEx are a huge asset for the company.These provide reliable global shipping to many customers looking to make shipments worldwide.This retail network is something that any competitor will have a hard time replicating.FedEx Same Day City is the company's answer to the increasing demand for same day deliveries.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The service is currently being launched across the USA and <b>could</b> easily be expanded internationally in the future .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The service will compete with many couriers , along with Uber ( <b>Pending</b> : UBER ) in some cases .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It will likely be a big area of growth for ecommerce as customers living in large metro areas begin to expect such a service <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Something FedEx <b>could</b> do to make this service <i>more</i> compelling would be to open fulfillment centers in cities nationwide and store inventory for ecommerce customers there .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>could</b> then deliver these products same day in many markets .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A failure to do this will likely see Amazon move into this space big time and become much <i>more</i> successful as it can offer fulfilment along with speedy delivery for many ecommerce companies in most major areas .  (Surprise) </span>Despite many strengths at FedEx there are many areas of the company that are under threat from any disruptor such as Amazon.FedEx Express is a large part of the business potentially under threat from Amazon.The Express division mainly operates a large fleet of aircraft that enable FedEx to offer speedy deliveries from many cities worldwide.The business was built however with deliveries of medical supplies, critical documents, high value consumer products and such in mind as opposed to what it has grown into with ecommerce and delivering pasta, diapers, books and everything else Amazon has sent its way.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As a result I see the business not positioned <b>optimally</b> to succeed in this area .  (Uncertainty) </span>The business is built to consolidate shipments at the end of the day, move them onto plane one that goes to one of their hubs, arrive at the hub around midnight, and then transition onto another plane for the final leg of the journey to the end destination, arriving in the early morning.This model works for delivering many shipments that arrive to the company at the end of the work day from hospitals, corporations, etc.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However with a constant stream of online orders through ecommerce it <b>might</b> make <i>more</i> sense for FedEx to fly multiple flights back and forth throughout the day on certain city pairs , dealing with these parcels as they arrive rather than consolidating them until the end of the day .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This current operation leads to average aircraft utilization of 3.3 hours at FedEx , something a disruptor <b>could</b> easily take advantage of and something that leads to high costs .  (Uncertainty) </span>Despite the threat from Amazon it is worth noting the threat from them is only likely to occur in the USA in the near term.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Amazon will have a much <i>harder</i> time launching such an operation in markets such as Europe where Amazon is not as popular and FedEx is very strong and Asia where Amazon has little presence .  (Surprise) </span>In addition Amazon would be required to negotiate with many countries and would be unlikely to receive permission from authorities to operate domestic flights as a foreign company.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The Amazon operation however could inspire other logistics companies and <b>possibly</b> ecommerce companies such as Alibaba ( NYSE : BABA ) to set up similar operations in other countries if the Amazon venture is a success .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>FedEx Supply Chain is another area that <b>could</b> see disruption from Amazon and an area Amazon has already moved into in a big way .  (Uncertainty) </span>Amazon will now take third party sellers' products, store them in their warehouse and handle fulfillment and shipping of them.The catch however is that the products need to be items sold on Amazon.com.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With 92 U.S fulfillment centers Amazon <b>could</b> be a compelling competitor if it offered its fulfillment center services to third parties without requiring them to be sold on Amazon.com .  (Uncertainty) </span>While Amazon can be compelling for supply chain solutions within the USA it will take a long time before it can become a true global competitor to FedEx in this regard.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>FedEx supply chain solutions at their world port in Memphis gives customers access to <b>almost</b> every market on the planet while Amazon fulfillment is generally domestic .  (Uncertainty) </span>FedEx Smartpost is another part of the company under threat from Amazon.Amazon recently purchased "thousands" of truck trailers to shuttle its products between post offices and its warehouses.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In addition its last mile Amazon Flex delivery service combined with its trucking network <b>could</b> become a threat to FedEx ground over time if Amazon opens its services up to third parties .  (Uncertainty) </span>The fact Amazon managed to capture 1/3 of Black Friday sales this year shows its dominance in the ecommerce space and it certainly has the resources and investor base tolerant to take on incumbents such as FedEx and UPS in transportation and logistics.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Losing 1/3 of ecommerce shipping <b>could</b> quickly turn into a much <i>larger</i> loss for FedEx and UPS ( UPS ) if Amazon is able to create a compelling transportation and logistics product that it offers to third parties .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>One big problem at FedEx is inefficiency in some areas and the lack of collaboration amongst the many divisions that exist at the company is a good example of this.FedEx Ground, Express and Smartpost all operate separate warehouses, fleets and have separate management.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>FedEx should seriously consider merging operations of these companies together much <i>more</i> if it wants to remove a critical vulnerability that a disruptor such as Amazon <b>could</b> take advantage of .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While it is possible Amazon <b>may</b> never open its transportation and logistics services up to third parties , FedEx should start planning as if it will .  (Uncertainty) </span>The sort of operation FedEx has is not something that can be replicated overnight.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Such an operation will take years to build up and if FedEx wants to stay on top of the game it will need to start taking a hard look at its operation pretty soon as failure to do so <b>could</b> see the company miss the boat and react too late to a potential disruptor .
