article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article BA continues to see operating margins move up as SGA leverage grows The companys gross margins are relatively weak right now but I believe new products will drive them higher Any gross margin growth will flow directly to operating margins as SGA remains in check setting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>up very well for the future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA is a stock Ive been very bullish on in the recent past as Ive thought the companys market leader position as well as a cheap stock with huge capital returns was a great setup So far the stock hasnt done much other than bounce around but BA continues to get cheaper in my view as the companys fundamentals continue to improve despite the fact that the price of the stock hasnt reflected that Specifically the companys operating margins have shown some growth in recent years and it is that movement that has allowed BA to produce rapidly rising profits and return lots of money to shareholders In this article Ill take a look at how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has achieved this success and if it can continue into the future Well begin with a look at the companys spread between its gross margins and its SGA costs These two numbers contain both the entire pool of money available for profit gross margins and the single biggest line item of costs outside of cost of goods sold SGA By taking the spread of these two numbers we get a raw unfiltered view of operating margins free from accounting gimmicks or earnings management Boeings data for the past ten years and TTM is below We can see a couple of things on this chart that I think are of importance to this discussion First BAs operating margins have moved up over time While there has certainly been some bouncing around BAs operating margins in general have moved up over the past decade This has helped BA see EPS rise at a rate in excess of the companys revenue growth and has boosted FCF affording BA the opportunity to make the tremendous capital distributions it has in the past few years Second we can see that BAs operating margins are very volatile and have moved around significantly in the past few years This is a little unusual for a company with the scale of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>but it is actually for a valid reason lets take a look at the components of the companys operating margin to see the way BA has derived its operating margins in the past decade or so This chart shows the same data as above but instead of netting the two numbers Ive shown them both here The reason is because by breaking down the components of operating margins and assessing each individually we can get a sense of the direction of BAs longer term margins We can see here that BAs gross margins are all over the place varying wildly from one year to the next for much of this period But the reason is because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>like most any other industrial is highly subject to where it is in the economic cycle and its own product cycles Things like launching new commercial aircraft for instance means it takes lots of time to recoup costs and get to a point where gross margins are positive let alone contributing to margin growth The launch obviously did not go as planned and that kind of thing eats into pricing power demand and ultimately gross margins The good news is that these things tend to go in cycles and this chart shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>may be near the bottom of its current cycle if thats true BA should be setup for some gross margin growth in the coming years as it monetizes new products Time will tell and this is not a slam dunk but BA is setup for success here The other very interesting note from this chart is that BAs SGA costs continue to fall fairly rapidly as a percentage of revenue BA has always been a lean operator and in recent years it has done an amazing job of doing more with less as the SGA cost line in the chart continues to go from upper left to bottom right This discipline has been the sole source of any operating margin growth in recent years as gross margins have been flat for much of the last decade BAs focus on cost controls has paid off in a big way as SGA now accounts for just of revenue an extraordinary achievement to be sure Looking ahead BA is certainly set up well for significant operating margin growth in the coming years SGA costs continue to fall as BA sees higher revenue producing leverage on its cost base That is a very favorable condition to have and BA is the poster child for keeping SGA under control In addition it seems BA has seen the bottom of this gross margin cycle as new products and higher volumes should contribute higher gross margins in the future But to be fair <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>doesnt need higher gross margins to see higher operating margins because its cost discipline is so extraordinary Any growth in gross margins will flow right to operating margins and that should be very exciting to shareholders BA is setup well with new products and great cost discipline to see materially higher operating margins in the future Tagged Investing Ideas Industrial Goods </div></body></html>
