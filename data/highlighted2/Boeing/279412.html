Things like launching new commercial aircraft - for instance - means it takes lots of time to recoup costs and get to a point where gross margins are positive, let alone contributing to margin growth.The 787 launch obviously did not go as planned and that kind of thing eats into pricing power, demand, and ultimately gross margins.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The good news is that these things tend to go in cycles and this chart shows that <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> <b>may</b> be near the bottom of its current cycle ; if that 's true , BA should be setup for some gross margin growth in the coming years as it monetizes new products . (Boeing: Uncertainty) </span>Time will tell and this is not a slam dunk but BA is setup for success here.The other very interesting note from this chart is that BA's SG&A costs continue to fall fairly rapidly as a percentage of revenue.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>BA has always been a lean operator and in recent years , it has done an <b>amazing</b> job of doing <i>more</i> with <i>less</i> as the SG&A cost line in the chart continues to go from upper left to bottom right .  (Surprise) </span>This discipline has been the sole source of any operating margin growth in recent years as gross margins have been flat for much of the last decade.BA's focus on cost controls has paid off in a big way as SG&A now accounts for just 4% of revenue, an extraordinary achievement to be sure.Looking ahead, BA is certainly set up well for significant operating margin growth in the coming years.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>SG&A costs continue to fall as BA sees <i>higher</i> revenue producing leverage on its cost base .  (Surprise) </span>That is a very favorable condition to have and BA is the poster child for keeping SG&A under control.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In addition , it <b>seems</b> BA has seen the bottom of this gross margin cycle as new products and <i>higher</i> volumes should contribute <i>higher</i> gross margins in the future .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But to be fair , <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> does n't need <i>higher</i> gross margins to see <i>higher</i> operating margins because its cost discipline is so extraordinary . (Boeing: Surprise) </span>Any growth in gross margins will flow right to operating margins and that should be very exciting to shareholders.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>BA is setup well with new products and great cost discipline to see materially <i>higher</i> operating margins in the future .
