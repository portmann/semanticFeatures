Cointrin airport in Geneva Switzerland May FARNBOROUGH England The aerospace industry is preparing to celebrate major milestones at the Farnborough Airshow next week as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>turns and Canadas Bombardier marks the entry into service of a new jet designed to challenge the duopoly of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus The July event which alternates with the Paris Airshow as the industrys premier showcase will see new jets displayed including the worlds most expensive warplane the Lockheed Martin F but is not expected to produce the flood of civil jetliner orders seen in previous years After a record multiyear sales bonanza for efficient new models sellers remain on the road drumming up more business for the show But analysts say many airlines are reluctant to make decisions as doubts over the economy disrupt the traditional selfconfidence and big money usually displayed at such events The issue is how do you as a manufacturer survive the ill winds blowing from the outside world said Richard Aboulafia vicepresident at Virginiabased consultants Teal Group Despite the uncertainties including Britains shock decision last month to leave the European Union jetmakers are expected to confirm bullish year outlooks They face some doubts over key Asian demand though there could be surprise orders from one or two of the regions lowcost players GDP and traffic growth are pretty positive but there are unknowns said Eric Bernardini of consultancy AlixPartners If Chinas slowdown spreads to the rest of Asia the neighboring countries suffer and then traffic in Asia could slow and that could lead to deliveries being delayed or halted to some Asian companies Already there have been signs of some order deferrals but Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>have plenty of cushion in their backlogs There are particularly concerns over a possible glut in widebody aircraft later this decade while smaller planes are still in demand and are expected to dominate orders at Farnborough While the latest generation of widebody jets showcased advances in carbonfibre airframe construction the focus of innovation in small ones is led by the engine makers Airbus so far leads in a fierce market battle triggered by the latest engine upgrades but delays in engine deliveries from Pratt Whitney UTXN have left some incomplete jets stranded on the ground in Toulouse The delays mean the Aneo will have to sit out the Farnborough Airshow and will not be parked among rival models that for the first time include the rival <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX Compounding its woes Airbus was struggling on the eve of the show even to obtain permission for its backup plan to fly a pair of the hotselling jets over the Farnborough gathering following a tightening of formation display rules that also affects Britains Red Arrows Hinting at further order announcements though an Airbus spokesman said the Aneo would still be all over the show By contrast <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>plans to fly its rival model but faces potentially costly economic questions over the design of the MAX family which has been outsold by the Aneo Delegates will be watching for any updates on plans to beef up the smallest version of the MAX and add a larger new version called the MAX Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>generally split the market for narrowbody jets which generate most of the industrys revenue and without which they could not afford to invest in bigger planes That lifeline is increasingly being challenged by new producing nations including Canada China and Russia Canadian manufacturer Bombardier CSeries will go into service on Friday as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>celebrates its centenary but the plane has failed to make a dent so far in sales of the two industry giants Doubts are meanwhile increasing over the future of the worlds biggest jetliner the Airbus A while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is trying to prop up a struggling fighter jet business Still US and European weapons announcements could play a bigger role at this years show given the expected drop in commercial orders and higher spending in eastern Europe in the wake of Russias annexation of Crimea from Ukraine The show follows a NATO summit held in Warsaw Poland where allies are laying out plans to reinforce NATOs eastern flank plans that are fuelling arms sales across the region Although the show usually doesnt generate a lot of military headlines <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>hopes to reel in two large UK helicopter and maritime surveillance orders while Lockheed Martin is hoping to finalize one of the Pentagons largest single contracts ever a deal for F that could be worth billion The F made an international debut at the Royal International Air Tattoo in western England on Friday after missing a scheduled appearance two years ago due to engine trouble and is expected to demonstrate its angular radarevading profile in a display at Farnborough next week Reuters News Agency Brand Attribution Guidelines Delivery Options Reuters is the news and media division of Thomson Reuters Thomson Reuters is the worlds largest
