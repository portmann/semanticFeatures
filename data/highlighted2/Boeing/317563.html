(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Supposedly, OPEC members are ready to come to an agreement on production cuts.Does that mean they're actually ready?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Or were they watching the S&P 500 chart and knew that at 1,810 they needed to step in with something to try to fend off another turn <i>further</i> into the global deflationary vortex ?  (Surprise) </span>OPEC has taken on some god-like figure for the oil bulls.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Despite little evidence that it is willing to cut , or that cuts will meaningfully alter the supply/demand picture , a well-placed OPEC tweet can still sends oil and equities sharply <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The cynical part of me <b>suggests</b> that Seeking Alpha should write code to automatically repost the story '' Oil Ca n't Hold Gains '' every 12-24 hours after oil rallies <i>more</i> than 3 % .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's always timely and <b>almost</b> never wrong .  (Uncertainty) </span>If oil rallies on some meaningful new piece of information, consider me interested.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But I do n't give any credence to OPEC <b>rumors</b> at this point .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If they do cut , the effect would be <b>almost</b> all psychological rather than meaningfully changing oil economics .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We got some comments for yesterday 's Briefing , <b>suggesting</b> there 's no reason oil and gold should inherently trade together .  (Uncertainty) </span>I disagree.First up, a chart: First up, of course, the ratio of two prices to each other over 150 years isn't necessarily indicative of anything.The world has changed beyond recognition during that span.However, the general extreme levels have held.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>An ounce of gold ( NYSEARCA : GLD ) always buys at least five barrels of oil , but it never buys <i>more</i> than 40 .  (Surprise) </span>This has held through countless wars, hyperinflations, depressions, gold rushes, and huge new oil discoveries.Yes, fracking changed "everything" as far as US oil production goes.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But in the history of the world , is fracking <i>more</i> notable in terms of altering the oil landscape than , say , the discovery of the Middle Eastern fields in the early 1900s ?  (Surprise) </span>Or Spindletop in Texas in January 1901, for that matter?At the core of it, gold and oil are both anti-dollars.Their prices (in the very long run) tend to follow inflation, since the goods you need to extract oil and gold are subject to the same general ramp-up in costs.Whether you're building an open pit mine or an offshore drilling rig, the price of steel is going to play a massive role in your cost of production.Labor costs are another shared area.And cost of production ultimately determines price.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It takes <i>longer</i> than people expect , but producers ( or their creditors ) eventually <i>lower</i> supply once prices do n't support the current level of output .  (Surprise) </span>Gold miners (NYSEARCA: GDX ) drastically overbuilt supply with marginal projects in the decade-long run-up in gold prices.In early 2013, it became crushingly clear that the sector was overrun with malinvestment, and shares (until last month) had been in an unrelenting decline.Oil followed the same boom-bust cycle, driven by the same overbuilding, this time into fracking and questionable geopolitical jurisdictions overseas.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The price held a little <i>longer</i> than gold , but by late 2014 , it became <b>apparent</b> that oil was badly oversupplied , and the industry has been in straight collapse since then .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Gold miners <b>appeared</b> to bottom with a powerful capitulation move in late 2014 ( remember , this ETF traded in the $ 60s at the top of the cycle ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They tested the low and shot <i>higher</i> in early 2015 , leading to many `` new bull market '' calls .  (Surprise) </span>They then put in another solid bottom in July.This time, there was very little interest in gold miners.I called a buying opportunity in the sector in August, largely because so many of the old gold newsletter types had given up and retired, or moved to pitching bitcoins or other such alternatives.Once the hardcore bulls abandon a trade, there's not a lot of downside left.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But the shares stayed glued to $ 14 for six months , and then put in a final move <i>lower</i> in January to scare out the last <b>optimists</b> , before finally rallying .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Oil stocks are n't just going to bottom one day and turn on a dime <i>higher</i> , making you filthy rich .  (Surprise) </span>Look at that GDX chart closely - that's how grinding bear markets tend to bottom.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As for oil and gold , yes , I 'd be amenable to a short gold , long oil trade based on the <i>earlier</i> chart .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There 's little-to-no evidence that any other commodities are turning <i>higher</i> here , and gold is n't going to stage a one-man run <i>higher</i> while everything else deflates .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It did relatively well as a hedge in 2008 , but still went down , merely dropping <i>less</i> than other alternatives .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Gold is n't about to rip 40 % <i>higher</i> during a global deflationary bust .  (Surprise) </span>Remember that the Fed's zero interest rate approach was used by gold supporters as a key selling point during the 2011 run.This was going to supposedly cause a massive inflationary crack-up.Now that ZIRP has been shown to have created essentially zero inflation, we're hearing the same people tell us that negative interest rates are bullish on gold for the opposite reason.Now, with deflation and negative bank savings rates, investors will go to gold to dodge deflation.The mind boggles.To some gold supporters, the metal takes on a patent medicine-type quality.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It can cure whatever economic ailment that you may face , as long as you have some <b>faith</b> and do n't ask difficult questions .  (Uncertainty) </span>Certainly keep the word placebo well out of mind.None of this is to impugn gold.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I own a decent chunk of physical gold , and I <b>occasionally</b> buy mining stocks when they get reasonably cheap .  (Uncertainty) </span>My bull GDX call linked above was timed well.If you use gold as a trading vehicle or a long-term store of value, it serves its purpose well.But it isn't a fix for everything.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you 're buying it now , after a $ 200/oz move , as a `` <b>fear</b> hedge '' , prepare to lose money once the <b>fear</b> goes away .  (Uncertainty) </span>The disparity between oil and gold prices is simply massive now.$1,250/oz gold and $25 oil doesn't compute.One or both of those prices is wrong.($1,250/oz gold and $2/lb copper (NYSEARCA: JJC ) also doesn't make economic sense, for reasons beyond the scope of this post).I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.</div></body></html>
