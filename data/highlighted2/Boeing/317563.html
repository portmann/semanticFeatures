class='textDiv'><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Grounded A Frank Talk On Gold And Oil Bezeks Daily Briefing Seeking Alpha The markets were down again on Thursday But they werent quite as bad as you might think Is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>a sell on accounting concerns Were going out of order with todays Briefing Ive got to discuss <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA first and then well get in market recap and a straight talk on gold and oil <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares at one point posted their largestever oneday loss down double digits early in Thursdays trade before recuperating somewhat into the bell At the end of the day the stock was still down a rather sizable amount of turbulence for such a blue chip name At fault is what some have deemed to be aggressive accounting on Boeings part The SEC is investigating the companys accounting methods in regard to costs and expected sales of the and programs According to a Reuters report the company has billion in deferred costs for the production of the This is seen as being an unusually large cost to expense in this manner and perhaps attracted the SECs interest As for the stock is this a buying opportunity or a stay away situation My first rule of thumb is if the SEC investigates a stock is an instasell The SEC is not known for being a particularly aggressive regulator of publicly listed companies and if it gets around to taking action on something more often than not theres fire to the smoke That said the SEC doesnt usually launch inquiries about companies of Boeings size either If I already owned BA shares I would grant a rare exception to my rule and not sell immediately While the company may be forced to make a very large onetime writeoff and perhaps pay a fine this doesnt appear the sort of core system accounting issue that leads to an Enron or WorldComtype outcome However Im not a buyer of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>here When I was looking at United Technologies NYSE UTX I looked at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as one of its peer comps Obviously these are far from perfect peers I understand Compared to UTX or General Dynamics NYSE GD I dont really see the appeal to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>at the current price deck Its business is getting severely crimped by the strong dollar For a duopoly on the commercial side where your competitor prices in euros and you in dollars life isnt going well at the moment Additionally the lifespan of old planes rises as the price of oil continues to fall One of the main drivers of the airline place upgrade cycle is fuel savings new models generally are much more fuelefficient In a world of oil every drop of jet fuel is precious At oil the calculations suddenly look better for keeping your old s in service a few more years rather than scrapping them If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>were cheaper on a valuation basis you might try a dipbuy here But the stock isnt priced at a level where you can say Hey Ian I know its being investigated by the SEC but you have to buy it anyway If it drops another Im happy to reconsider Whyd we discuss <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>first Simple Due to the priceweighted nature of the Dow Jones NYSEARCA DIA index Dow components with high share prices have a massive impact on the Dow which in turn affects investor sentiment The current Dow Jones divisor is indicating that for every point a Dow component stock moves the Dow Jones index will change by points At the lows of the day <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>stock was down per share That means that the Dow as an index was down points thanks to one stock getting hit by an SEC inquiry When the index was down earlier in the day it was really down points from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>But once investors hear that big number and the media starts screaming crash then things can build on themselves Had <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>not faced an SEC inquiry Thursday would have been just another bad day in a bad month not something worthy of a total blowout in bonds and volatility NYSEARCA VXX As it is the SP NYSEARCA SPY held the January low and bounced back strongly The Nasdaq NASDAQ QQQ closed the day down just It wasnt a good day for bulls by any means but dont let Boeings specific issues miscalibrate your read on the whole market Following more OPEC rumors oil NYSEARCA USO rallied from steep losses on the day back into the green Supposedly OPEC members are ready to come to an agreement on production cuts Does that mean theyre actually ready Or were they watching the SP chart and knew that at they needed to step in with something to try to fend off another turn further into the global deflationary vortex OPEC has taken on some godlike figure for the oil bulls Despite little evidence that it is willing to cut or that cuts will meaningfully alter the supplydemand picture a wellplaced OPEC tweet can still sends oil and equities sharply higher The cynical part of me suggests that Seeking Alpha should write code to automatically repost the story Oil Cant Hold Gains every hours after oil rallies more than Its always timely and almost never wrong If oil rallies on some meaningful new piece of information consider me interested But I dont give any credence to OPEC rumors at this point If they do cut the effect would be almost all psychological rather than meaningfully changing oil economics We got some comments for yesterdays Briefing suggesting theres no reason oil and gold should inherently trade together I disagree First up a chart First up of course the ratio of two prices to each other over years isnt necessarily indicative of anything The world has changed beyond recognition during that span However the general extreme levels have held An ounce of gold NYSEARCA GLD always buys at least five barrels of oil but it never buys more than This has held through countless wars hyperinflations depressions gold rushes and huge new oil discoveries Yes fracking changed everything as far as US oil production goes But in the history of the world is fracking more notable in terms of altering the oil landscape than say the discovery of the Middle Eastern fields in the early s Or Spindletop in Texas in January for that matter At the core of it gold and oil are both antidollars Their prices in the very long run tend to follow inflation since the goods you need to extract oil and gold are subject to the same general rampup in costs Whether youre building an open pit mine or an offshore drilling rig the price of steel is going to play a massive role in your cost of production Labor costs are another shared area And cost of production ultimately determines price It takes longer than people expect but producers or their creditors eventually lower supply once prices dont support the current level of output Gold miners NYSEARCA GDX drastically overbuilt supply with marginal projects in the decadelong runup in gold prices In early it became crushingly clear that the sector was overrun with malinvestment and shares until last month had been in an unrelenting decline Oil followed the same boombust cycle driven by the same overbuilding this time into fracking and questionable geopolitical jurisdictions overseas The price held a little longer than gold but by late it became apparent that oil was badly oversupplied and the industry has been in straight collapse since then Gold miners appeared to bottom with a powerful capitulation move in late remember this ETF traded in the s at the top of the cycle They tested the low and shot higher in early leading to many new bull market calls They then put in another solid bottom in July This time there was very little interest in gold miners I called a buying opportunity in the sector in August largely because so many of the old gold newsletter types had given up and retired or moved to pitching bitcoins or other such alternatives Once the hardcore bulls abandon a trade theres not a lot of downside left But the shares stayed glued to for six months and then put in a final move lower in January to scare out the last optimists before finally rallying Oil stocks arent just going to bottom one day and turn on a dime higher making you filthy rich Look at that GDX chart closely thats how grinding bear markets tend to bottom As for oil and gold yes Id be amenable to a short gold long oil trade based on the earlier chart Theres littletono evidence that any other commodities are turning higher here and gold isnt going to stage a oneman run higher while everything else deflates It did relatively well as a hedge in but still went down merely dropping less than other alternatives Gold isnt about to rip higher during a global deflationary bust Remember that the Feds zero interest rate approach was used by gold supporters as a key selling point during the run This was going to supposedly cause a massive inflationary crackup Now that ZIRP has been shown to have created essentially zero inflation were hearing the same people tell us that negative interest rates are bullish on gold for the opposite reason Now with deflation and negative bank savings rates investors will go to gold to dodge deflation The mind boggles To some gold supporters the metal takes on a patent medicinetype quality It can cure whatever economic ailment that you may face as long as you have some faith and dont ask difficult questions Certainly keep the word placebo well out of mind None of this is to impugn gold I own a decent chunk of physical gold and I occasionally buy mining stocks when they get reasonably cheap My bull GDX call linked above was timed well If you use gold as a trading vehicle or a longterm store of value it serves its purpose well But it isnt a fix for everything If youre buying it now after a oz move as a fear hedge prepare to lose money once the fear goes away The disparity between oil and gold prices is simply massive now oz gold and oil doesnt compute One or both of those prices is wrong oz gold and lb copper NYSEARCA JJC also doesnt make economic sense for reasons beyond the scope of this post I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article </div></body></html>
