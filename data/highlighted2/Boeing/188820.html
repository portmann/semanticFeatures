Stone Fox Capital clicks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is poised to generate substantial free cash flows over the next couple of years The order book remains strong due to a massive backlog that will cause new orders to scale back Investors should use the decline in the stock to buy alongside the massive stock buyback afforded by the large cash flows Like most industrials and the market in general <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA is trading down due to weakness in China The stock peaked in February and is down from those highs Oddly though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is seeing plenty of orders from the likes of China and India questioning why the stock is even down at all Along with a strong backlog investors should consider owning this airplane manufacturer despite the market woes and weakness in China economic data The biggest news is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>got a deal for over aircraft from China The airplane manufacturer though has to build a plant in China for some of the functions to complete the airplanes Naturally this brings up concerns that China will use this deal as an attempt to gain more internal knowledge to manufacturer airplanes itself The deal includes three Chinese firms that will split the order Remember that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>estimates that China will need planes over the next years so this order is only a drop in that bucket The biggest longterm issue being whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>splits those orders with European competitor Airbus or if China uses these inroads into manufacturing its own airplanes As well the company got a billion order from India to purchase Apache and Chinook helicopters Sure the orders numbers arent keeping up with the levels from previous years but the backlog is so enormous that it impacts the ability to fulfill new orders in a timely manner At the end of Q the backlog sat at commercial airplane orders for billion Despite record deliveries <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>only delivered commercial airplanes for Q At that rate the company will take quarters or roughly years to fulfill the current backlog without adding any new orders Based on the delivery schedule and the enormous backlog investors shouldnt expect orders to outpace deliveries in the coming years Airlines needing planes are going to find other options than purchasing a plane that wont be delivered until According to internal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>order numbers the airline manufacturer only had orders this year through September The company though only delivered planes through August of the year suggesting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will reach to deliveries at this point in time The China orders wont place <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>on a pace to match the order levels of the last couple of years but the market should already know that the only goal at this point is growing the production and delivery pace Considering it is clear <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has no order issue the question with the stock is a matter of valuation With the stock trading at the valuation is now down to billion According to analysts at Sterne Agee <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is forecast to generate free cash flow of billion billion billion and billion during the to time period The total amounts to billion in the four year period The estimates seem solid considering the company generated operating cash flow of billion during Q alone The company turned around and spent billion on stock buybacks and billion on dividends After capital expenditures cash and debt levels were similar to the Q levels In essence the billion returned to shareholders during Q is virtually repeatable each quarter With a market cap of only billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can reduce the quarterly buybacks and still keep a net payout yield dividend yield plus net buyback yield above At that level <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>compares very favorably to other industrials including Northrop Grumman NYSE NOC and Caterpillar NYSE CAT The stock probably has lower risk than Caterpillar that faces headwinds from China while the growth of service economy in China likely provides a tailwind for the likes of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Northrop Grumman <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>remains a perfect example of investors focusing on the wrong metrics At a backlog over seven years long investors need to shift focus to free cash flows The recent decline in the stock provides an ideal time to own the stock with yields soaring and the outlook unchanged We
