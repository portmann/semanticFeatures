accounting on the Dreamliner however differs from previous programs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA shares tumbled as the company is facing a SEC probe regarding its accounting method on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>programs In this article I will have a look at why Boeings program accounting for the Dreamliner program is different from accounting on other programs First of all it is important to understand what program accounting is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>utilized accounting methods in the past Until it used the unit accounting method which means that the company attributes costs for producing a unit to that same unit From and onwards <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>used program accounting which means that the company no longer attributes costs related to a unit to that unit but divides it over the entire accounting block This way the company can push some of the costs into the future and this obviously sketches a rosy picture In essence this accounting method is not bad keeping in mind that the first units are always costlier Incurring the costs as they appear puts pressure on earnings in the first few years while the program runs over multiple years If deferred costs keep rising the company might be forced to increase the accounting block and take a charge Additionally in the case of a bubble in the order book which more and more investors seem to be afraid of expected number of deliveries could fall short of the number in the accounting block So basically as long as the market looks bright and the deferred costs dont increase drastically investors will be more than happy with the program accounting method Accounting on the Dreamliner program What has to be noted is that program accounting is not new although a lot investors seem to be treating it like it is was introduced on the Dreamliner program What is new is the scale on which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been using program accounting on the Dreamliner program On previous programs the accounting block had a standard size of units which later on was altered if needed The first units are critical as lot of progress in cutting costs can be made there but these are also the units with the highest burn rate For the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>used an initial accounting block of units This block was later altered to units as deferred costs piled up With this bigger accounting block <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>basically claims it is able to estimate average costs and profit for deliveries which is over years of production One of the things the SEC probe will be centered around is this accounting block to see how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is able to estimate average costs and earnings for a block of this size Not only the size of the accounting block differs from that on other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>programs also the deferred costs differ in scale Whereas the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had deferred costs of bn or bn inflation adjusted figure and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program now has deferred costs of bn the Dreamliner deferred costs are pushing bn in total deferred costs So the deferred costs for the Dreamliner program are times higher than that of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>while the accounting block is not times that big This means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a steep learning curve in mind However given the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>kept adjusting their deferred costs guidance upwards over the past few years it can be questioned whether the company is succeeding in cutting costs at a fast enough rate Combining the size of the block the uncertainty the block size brings and about bn in deferred costs it is not weird that the SEC will be investigating Boeings accounting method The main thing the SEC will probably be looking at is whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>at this point already could know whether they will be able to recover the bn in deferred costs within the current accounting block If the company has knowledge that it will not be able to recoup the deferred costs within the accounting block it should notify shareholders about this as soon as possible Program accounting on the Dreamliner differs in deferred costs block size and time As the company altered its deferred costs guidance over the past few years it can be questioned whether the company is reaching its internal targets on the program Program accounting has always been a dubious trick to most investors but as long as it returns strong results investors are accepting it It is not until the accounting method is being investigated or a charge is being taken that investors send shares lower I myself think that it will be a major challenge for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to recoup all of the deferred costs within the accounting block On the other side I also think that the recent drop was overdone especially since a lot of investors are not quite familiar with the accounting method other than calling it pulling nonexistent profits forward in time In the end the program accounting method has to make sense at some point <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>management is aware of this and the company is also aware of the consequences untimely notification of any disruptions in recouping the costs might have I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not
