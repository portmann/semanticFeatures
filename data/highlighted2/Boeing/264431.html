class='textDiv'>Boeings Dividend Boost Another Compelling Catalyst To Consider Going Long The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>just bumped its dividend by about The companys first nine months of its fiscal are impressive Valuations are reasonable perhaps even more than reasonable if it finishes the year on a strong note <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA just upped the ante by announcing that it will be buying back up to billion of its own shares while simultaneously boosting its dividend by The companys stellar results so far this year add to the case for owning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>here Valuations are reasonable as well especially in an overall market trading north of times earnings The Aerospace giant has managed to grow sales by for the first three quarters of its fiscal Thats relatively impressive considering many other megacap multinationals have struggled to grow their toplines this year A very large backlog also gives some clarity into the future of the companys growth and the future looks bright I think the recent dividend bump reaffirms managements shared view of bright future prospects as well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>provided guidance for revenues in the billion billion range when it last reported at the end of October with operating cash expected to be in the billion range Its also guiding towards billion in capital expenditures so free cash flow should come in at around billion That equates to free cash flow of roughly of sales which is inline with recent trends Analyzing historical free cash flow trends and earnings quality Id argue that converting of sales into free cash flow isnt exactly exceptional but probably average at best Boeings a company that operates in a relatively capital intensive industry so this shouldnt come as a surprise Chart created by Joseph Harry using data from Morningstar Going back years we can see that the company has actually improved its ability to squeeze out more free cash flow from its growing sales over the last few years quite a bit Its still not as abundant in free cash flow when compared to prefinancial crisis levels however Earnings quality is also adequate Not only did operating income exceed net income last year but so did free cash flow Going back five years this has been a consistent trend and I expect it to continue going forward as well Chart created by Joseph Harry using data from Morningstar While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>might not appear to be an aboveaverage operation at first glance when judging it by its free cash flow Id like to examine it from another angle to illustrate why Id argue that its still a widemoat franchise Looking at Boeings return on equity first it clearly looks erratic over the last five years Chart created by Joseph Harry using data from Morningstar Asset turnover has remained relatively constant over the last five years while margins have ticked up to around These two factors dont really explain the dramatic drop in ROE over the years though Id chalk it up to financial leverage Boeings average financial leverage declined from almost in to in fiscal In other words return on equity is still highly magnified by financial leverage but not as much as it was in the past Margins have actually improved so Id argue that the trend in ROE is actually towards improvement despite initial appearances <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Capital likely helps explain the high ratio <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Capital is a subsidiary that provides assetbased leasing and lending services and it comprised of the companys overall debt as of its most recent quarter This debt isnt core debt and is attributable to profitable financing activities Due to the high amount of financial leverage and also the distorting affects of Boeings recent buyback sprees ROE probably isnt the best metric to look at in my opinion Id instead argue in favor of return on invested capital We can see that the companys ROIC numbers are above average over the last five years and they likely easily exceed its cost of capital Economic profits like this usually indicate an aboveaverage widemoat company Shares trade at around times Boeings guidance for s GAAP earnings and around to times what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>considers core earnings Not exactly a steal but likely reasonable I especially think this is true now that the company has announced an extremely impressive capital return plan for shareholders Shares trade at only times expected earnings as well and if the company continues on its current trajectory I think the value case for shares now as a longterm investment can easily be made <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>also boasts a strong balance sheet with roughly billion in cash and only about billion in core debt when stripping out debt from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Capital and corresponding intercompany loans The fastgrowing dividend will account for roughly to of expected earnings so thats wellcovered too <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is a special business and despite its capital intensivenature it continues to generate excess returns and spread the wealth with shareholders It also spends a lot on RD each year its guiding towards about billion for fiscal which continues to reinforce the barriers to entry that make it very hard for new competitors to enter its market to compete I think that nows a good time to start layering in for the long term especially if the company continues to post stellar results The recently announced dividend bump should attract a lot of attention and could act as a catalyst for more investor interest so I wouldnt be surprised to see shares continue to outperform the overall market going forward either We only use your contact details to reply
