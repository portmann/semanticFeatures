plans to use newer and more standardised manufacturing techniques for its new X jetliner paving the way for significant savings as it gradually feeds the changes back into existing assembly lines a senior executive said The approach will draw increasingly on lessons learned from outside the aerospace industry and comes as the focus of the intense rivalry between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus AIRPA shifts toward production strategies after a record boom in orders I think the X will be our first opportunity to show the ideas that we have to date said Walter Odisho Boeings vice president of manufacturing and safety referring to the worlds largest twinengined jet that is due to enter service in However we also have the capability to affect the other programs that we have in place In many cases were looking to standardize our approach he told Reuters Odisho was speaking in his first interview since joining <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in December from Toyota T where he oversaw manufacturing at the carmakers billion plant in Kentucky While standardised production is common in the auto industry it is rarer in aerospace where volumes are lower and airlines demand more customization but where output is rising fast Odisho said planemakers need to make production more repeatable and predictable He declined to estimate cost savings from the shift toward Advanced Manufacturing an innovative set of production tools that can include robotics but called them significant The idea of achieving significant savings in a single action is a fallacy Well take the opportunities and when you add them all up together I think they will amount to quite significant improvements Odisho said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has long relied on Toyotainspired lean production methods to improve efficiency but Odisho has been hired to help push car industry thinking deeper into its manufacturing plants That matches an approach taken at Airbus where car industry executives in senior positions are more evident IDnLNTC If you look at aerospace with market demand rising we need to start thinking differently and move efficiencies from the auto industry into this arena Odisho said Last month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>started automating the assembly of wing panels and is introducing robots on the IDnLNWGY I think we are beginning the journey Odisho said There are areas such as drilling where we have a lot of repetitive motion It is not just about automation however Odisho observes the factory like a choreographer with an eye on the overall shape of the performance Think of it as a robot Because robots are automated they can go through many types of motion that are wasteful But in order to utilize robots correctly we need to be thoughtful about the movements that their arms make he said If we can apply the same thinking to the factory then we can affect the process to a high degree he said For example Odisho is urging a fresh look at the flow of parts If we can develop a system where we have direct deliveries to our lines and in an orientation which our operators will use to simply secure instead of handling parts we have tremendous opportunities he said Improving the sequencing of parts reduces inventory and eases cashflow a recent focus for investors And it means less space is needed to store them lowering overheads Boeings planemaking chief Ray Conner has challenged engineers to think about build quality when designing aircraft so they can be produced more affordably Odisho says a cleansheet design for a stcentury aircraft plant would weave a single thread from the drawing board to the parts cart on the factory floor I would look at material flow I would look at processes I would look at the design of the airplane with people in mind how the work would be performed I would design the airplane with specific areas of automation in mind Odisho said Could the buffer of several days for holding parts in aircraft plants ever hit autoindustry levels of as low as two hours Ultimately I think we will see that day Odisho said Thomson
