class='textDiv'>Airbuss Trillion Backlog Why Bigger Isnt Always Better Airbus Group SE OTCMKTSEADSF Seeking Alpha Investors continue to be amazed by Airbus Groups tremendous backlog which now stands at more than orders However a huge backlog may actually be harmful for both Airbus and its arch rival <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The two companies need to focus on delivering these planes and increasing their production rates rather than just piling on new orders which at last count will take more than a decade to work through Over the past weeks the Airbus Group SE OTCPKEADSF OTCPKEADSY has seen its share price climb by more than as the company saw its backlog balloon to a record orders as of st October The European aircraft manufacturing giant is constantly battling its American rival <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA in a contest many deem as the greatest duopoly to have graced the world markets After a patch volatility in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>stock specifically over the past months there are many investors who choose to side with Airbus stock citing its mammoth orders backlog as a justifiable factor to stand behind the company This is where I have to disagree with most investors because I cant help but notice that the company is severely underperforming despite what it shows in its balance sheets and heres why In their month earnings disclosure Airbus reported a jump in profits year over year to billion for the month period ended on th September leaving an EPS of What made this all really impressive to the average investor was that the Netherlandsbased company boasted a trillion backlog which showed no signs of slowing down as new orders kept piling on On the other hand Boeings backlog of approximately orders is overshadowed by Airbus figure In other words both these companies have enough work to keep them busy for another decade at their current production rates What bothers me is that Airbus earnings disclosure so far this year is not an accurate representation of the companys operating performance Earlier this year the European aircraft builder sold its stake in Dassault Aviation the French fighter jet manufacturer for approximately billion Through this transaction alone the company managed to recognize a net capital gain of million which it incorporated into its income statement for the year and which I believe skews the market perception of Airbus stock When we factor out this million capital gain we get a true picture of Airbus operations which paints a gloomy picture for the European industrial giant The fact is that Airbus has not only managed to deliver far fewer planes than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>but even with its capital gains incorporated in its net earnings it still has worse profit margin than its American counterpart Deliveries are where aircraft manufacturers actually realize the majority of their earnings from a deal More importantly a huge backlog is not necessarily a beneficial factor for either company since adverse macroeconomic conditions can bring about setbacks in deliveries which may significantly erode net earnings Even if demand for planes slows down Airbus is at a greater disadvantage than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>because of stricter labor laws and unions in Europe which will hamper any downsizing or cost reduction programs Of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>itself isnt immune to the fury of its own labor unions which was especially evident earlier this year when the Chicagobased company agreed to open a plant in China only to have the head of its largest union vowing step up confrontation over the new Chinese plants if it meant cutting jobs back home in Washington Things did eventually calm down once Boeings chief executive assured workers that Chinese facility would not bring about any related job cuts in the US While both companies continue to pile on orders only one of them is seriously focusing towards improving its production rate Unfortunately its not Airbus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is on track to deliver planes by the end of this year having sped up its production process at the Seattle factory where the company automated the process to develop wings for the which reduces manufacturing time by This new automated process will turn out to be a blessing for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and its foray into the highly competitive single aisle plane market with its series Up till now Airbus A Family is the worlds bestselling single aisle product line with over orders since the launch and more than aircrafts delivered to various operators worldwide But like I said deliveries matter as much as the orders backlog as uncertain macroeconomic conditions can turn this boon into a bane over time Production rate to increase to planes a month by end of Fiscal The graph above illustrates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus single aisle plane production rates at their current and forecasted rates according to the companies themselves For the benefit of understanding the outcome Ive simply taken into account the most optimistic yet achievable numbers for the forecasts At the same time this chart excludes any new orders the two companies might take up post So at current forecasted rates five years from now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will have cleared its orders and some more In the same timeframe Airbus will have only reduced its A backlog by a mere This huge remaining backlog of planes by the end of is going to be a burden on Airbus shoulders if the company fails to materialize any significant hike in delivery rates Both companies will obviously take on new orders in the coming years especially considering the fact that China is going to be massive source of demand for single aisled planes Whichever company manages to scale up their production rates will also end up reaping the benefits of economies of scale which when applied to the colossal aircraft manufacturing industry turns out to be worth billions of dollars As of st October Airbus delivered planes this year to different customers while Boeings deliveries as October stand at This race needs to be reevaluated by long term investors who consider getting into aerospace stocks focusing more on deliveries and operational
