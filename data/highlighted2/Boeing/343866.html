been raised about why the aircraft went ahead with its attempts to land when another jet heading for the same airport a short while earlier had diverted elsewhere because of the bad weather The crashed jet operated by Dubaibased budget carrier Flydubai came down in the early hours of Saturday at RostovonDon airport in southern Russia on its second attempt to land after flying from Dubai The Dubai government said on Twitter that Flydubai would resume flights from RostovonDon on Tuesday Russian Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov said other flights to and from the city had resumed The airport was closed for a time after the crash The planes flight data recorder survived largely intact but the cockpit voice recorder which should shed light on the pilots final conversations was badly damaged leading officials to say initially it could take weeks to restore it Memory has already been retrieved from the black boxes its being worked on a spokesman of the Interstate Aviation Committee IAC which is investigating the crash told Reuters The decoding of the two black boxes may take between several weeks and several months he said There is so far no suggestion of an attack on the aircraft Russian media say the two main theories under consideration by investigators are possible pilot error or a technical failure Flydubais CEO Ghaith alGhaith said on Saturday it was too early to determine why the plane which was just over five years old crashed Writing by Andrew Osborn and Dmitry Solovyov additional reporting by Rama Venkat Raman in Bengaluru Editing by Christian Lowe and
