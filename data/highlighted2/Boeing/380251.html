Look At Boeings Commercial Orders And Deliveries In March The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>recovered from a weak February month Deliveries were higher than the month required average As part of the annual order and delivery battle between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA and Airbus OTCPKEADSF OTCPKEADSY I provide a monthly overview and analysis The February report can be read here In this article I will have a look at the orders and deliveries in March Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>deliveries up until April Source AeroAnalysisnet In February <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing

Pegasus Airlines ordered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NGs An Unidentified customer ordered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F aircraft this customer probably is AirBridge Cargo that had a commitment for aircraft An Unidentified customer ordered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ERS and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>airframes it is likely that United Airlines NYSE UAL is this customer The United States Navy ordered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>A airframes Eastern Air Lines Group ordered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX aircraft FedEx ordered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F likely part of the mega order for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Fs that was announced last year Compared to March order inflow rose During Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>received orders versus orders in the first months of orders are helping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>close the production gap for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>but at the same time orders for the Dreamliner were canceled It is likely that United Airlines swapped Dreamliners slots for slots of the heavily discounted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>deliveries up until March Source AeroAnalysis For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>guided slightly lower reflecting lower production rate on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program and the transition towards the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX In March <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>delivered aircraft valued at bn Deliveries increased by units compared to last month Split between narrow and widebody deliveries was a split which also shows in the estimated market value of the deliveries Higher delivery volume is caused by deliveries for the being units higher than estimated using the production rates additionally also the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>saw higher than the required average deliveries Dreamliners were delivered of which were <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s It can be concluded that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will have the upper hand in the Dreamliner deliveries which bodes well for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as the aircraft has higher profit margins and brings in more cash Delivery volume was well above the monthly average In order to reach its delivery target <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will need deliveries per month for the remaining months this year Just like in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is targeting a booktobill ratio In March <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>booked orders and delivered air frames resulting in a booktobill ratio of Yeartodate the booktobill ratio is a strong improvement from the weak February month As order inflow tends to be soft in the first months of the year is quite a good figure but there still is a lot to do for Boeings marketing team Deliveries were slightly higher than expected In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>achieved its booktobill target at the very last moment Despite lower anticipated deliveries in I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to be facing a challenge to achieve its booktobill target In April I published an article in which I said that the order books of jet makers are not bubbles but should decline at some point In that article I shared my thoughts and expected order inflow to decline in a few years from now With oil prices having declined ever since chances are the order books will decline sooner than I expected at first With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>just barely meeting its target last year might be the year in which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will not achieve its booktobill ratio Compared to last month I am slightly more positive about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>reaching its desired to ratio but it will be a challenge I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving
