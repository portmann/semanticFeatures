The disclosure concerns some of the aircraft, which should have been delivered between 2019 and 2022.The deliveries have been postponed by 3 to 4 years.The last firm order is now scheduled for 2025.Because the price and structure of these orders should remain unchanged, the total final savings should remain as previously estimated (between $3.8 and $6.4 billion).However, these savings will be observable later than previously expected.Although some major US airlines (most prominently AAL and UAL) are currently trading at very low multiples, their stocks are far from no-brainers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Major legacy carriers have a long-standing history of high cyclicality , minimal pricing power , non-existent long-term profits , inclination to suffer from <b>terrorist</b> attacks and solvency problems .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although the reduction of the number of major US airlines to four <b>might</b> increase their pricing power and increase the long-term margins , we have no proof that this effect will be significant .  (Uncertainty) </span>The current investment rationale behind adding AAL or UAL to the portfolio is basically buying a lousy business very cheaply when measured by the P/E ratio based on last year's net income.I do not fancy this approach.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Moreover , I am <b>afraid</b> that we are now already at the peak of the industry cycle , or even behind the peak ( but still far from the bottom ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>The industry has reached the peak because of the current record load factors and low oil prices.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , the low oil price environment <b>might</b> eventually turn out to be a curse for the industry as it encourages undisciplined capacity growth .  (Uncertainty) </span>Since the decline in oil price in 2014, the most essential airline fundamentals have been continuously deteriorating.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The recent data <b>suggest</b> that fare prices are still decreasing , and therefore PRASM and margins of the major US airlines are eroding .  (Uncertainty) </span>Similar trends have eventually led to tremendous trouble for this industry in the not very distant past.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Source : LUV 's Investor Day presentation Despite this , I <b>believe</b> that LUV is best positioned for long-term performance among the top four US carriers .  (Uncertainty) </span>LUV's current competitive advantage lies in its low debt, superior management, further potential for growth and reasonable fleet composition (including cheap acquisitions of new aircraft).LUV is therefore the major US carrier, which is best positioned to endure the difficulties of this industry.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , due to the mentioned industry-wide situation , I do not <b>believe</b> the right time to buy LUV is right now .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , I do not think that LUV 's current price is attractive enough considering the industry <b>risks</b> ( as it trades at a P/E of 11.7 ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Because of the same reason , I do not <b>believe</b> that pairing a long position in LUV with a short position in an airline ETF such as the US Global Jets ETF ( NYSEARCA : JETS ) is currently interesting either .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This pair trade would mitigate the industry <b>risk</b> , but at the same time , it would be a bet on the worsening of airline fundamentals because LUV has the lowest leverage and highest margins among the major US airlines .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If an investor expects continuing negative development in the airline industry , he will be <i>better</i> off simply shorting the JETS ETF .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I think that now is simply not the right time to have any long position in the major US airlines.Source: LUV's Investor Day presentation However, I must emphasize that the right time will come sooner or later.My strategy is to buy LUV when either of two situations eventually occurs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The first <b>possibility</b> is that the worsening of airline fundamentals will continue because of adding capacity and declining margins until the low-margin carriers find themselves breaking even or even in loss .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A significant rise in oil price , slowdown of the general economy or even security threats <b>might</b> also greatly contribute to this result .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given that LUV is the financially strongest major US airline , it will be able to handle <b>almost</b> any industry downturn .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At the same time , adverse industry conditions should lead to a reasonable stock price and little <b>likelihood</b> of further capacity increases or fare price declines .  (Uncertainty) </span>The alternative entry point would arise if the US airlines stopped adding capacity and increased pricing before their profits significantly erode.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Many investors argue that this will happen because the US airlines have learnt a lesson from the past and the industry is now <i>more</i> consolidated .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Still , I am <b>afraid</b> that this will not be the case and the fundamentals will start improving only after significant erosion of the currently record margins .  (Uncertainty) </span>In the next several months, investors should closely monitor the releases of the new data, which are fundamental for the industry (especially capacity growth, PRASM, passenger yields and load factors).Until they start improving, it is not the right time to buy LUV yet.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Author payment: $35 + $0.01/page view.Authors of PRO articles receive a minimum guaranteed payment of $150-500.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Become a contributor Tagged : Investing Ideas , Long Ideas , Services , Regional Airlines , Editors ' Picks , <b>Hidden</b> Asset , High Quality Business Model , PRO , Value  (Uncertainty) </span></div></body></html>
