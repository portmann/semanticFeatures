class='textDiv'>Southwest Airlines The Benefits Of Buying New Aircraft With Largest Discounts Southwest Airlines Co NYSELUV Seeking Alpha LUVs current backlog implies an average purchase discount of compared to the manufacturers list prices which is materially more than in case of AAL DAL and UAL LUVs cheap orders from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should translate into total savings worth billion compared to the other three major US airlines These aboveaverage discounts should eventually increase the annual net income by between and million compared to its peers depending on the realization of LUVs purchase options Southwest Airlines NYSE LUV has a rather long history of trading at premium compared to the other major US airlines The present situation is similar as LUVs current PE ratio materially exceeds the PE ratios of its main competitors For example American Airlines NASDAQ AAL now trade at times earnings Delta Air Lines NYSE DAL at and United Continental NYSE UAL at The comparison of additional multiples such as EVEBITDA or PB within this group would yield corresponding results When justifying this premium most analysts and investors mention LUVs superior growth prospects lower leverage remarkable historical performance or exceptional resilience during the past airline crises relatively to the other major US carriers Nevertheless I am convinced that few investors have thoroughly analyzed LUVs aircraft acquisition strategy and especially the associated pricing In order to obtain aircraft airlines can resort to two options purchases or leasing Despite being very popular in emerging markets aircraft leasing is less favored by the domestic legacy carriers Out of aircraft operated by AAL DAL LUV and UAL in the first quarter of only were leased and the remaining portion of the fleet was owned by the carriers It must be noted that owning this number of depreciating aircraft is not cheap In fact when looking at the Q results of the four leading US carriers it turns out that depreciation equaled to of all operating expenses and aircraft maintenance added another Although small changes of these percentages might not seem significant investors need to realize that the industrys net margin in Q was well above longterm average typical for the major US airlines For instance the same margin averaged a mere between and Because major legacy carriers operate in an inherently lowmargin and highleverage business with little pricing power even relatively small but longterm decreases of operating expense can have a material effect on the longterm stock price Purchasing aircraft is a complex and nontransparent business Although aircraft manufacturers publish standardized list prices for each model on a yearly basis the actual transaction rates tend to be considerably lower According to insiders the usual realized prices are equal to approximately of the official list figures In my opinion the main reason why manufacturers artificially inflate the official numbers is that purchase deposits are primarily determined as a fixed fraction of the list prices Increasing official rates hence improves manufacturers cash flows Despite being worth around in general the discounts do materially differ depending on the specific order The main reasons behind this variance are the value of the whole order the type of the purchased aircraft and the time of the order earlier orders can usually secure larger discounts However determining the exact extent of the discounts is a challenging task for investors Major airlines and aircraft manufacturers only disclose the nominal values of announced orders derived from the official rates However the real purchase prices and discounts can sometimes be estimated All major US carriers disclose their order books as of the end of each year and of them also disclose the value of all future aircraft purchase commitments UAL is the only exception as it does not explicitly disclose aircraft purchase commitments it only publishes capital purchase obligations which include spare engines and information technology as well The following table summarizes the order books of these airlines and the standard list prices Combining these two pieces of information I have calculated the values of these orders as measured by the official list rates Then I have estimated the future book value of the ordered aircraft by using the total contractual aircraft commitments as stated in the last annual report In case of UAL I have assumed that capital purchase obligations are solely composed of aircraft purchase commitments as I have been unable to find any further breakdown of this figure According to this calculation the average discounts to the list prices are in case of AAL in case of DAL and in case of LUV It is rather difficult to interpret the implied UALs discount of The capital purchase obligations disclosed by UAL probably also include significant commitments related to spare engines and information technology thus increasing the estimated book value of future aircraft purchases and decreasing the expected discount UALs estimated discount seems to be unrealistically low given that the size of its backlog and the types of ordered aircraft are comparable to the other three major US carriers However the analysis becomes more interesting when we contemplate the implied superior discounts of LUV This company pursues a strategy which is unique among the leading US airlines its fleet and order book include solely one type of aircraft <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA In fact the order book only consisted of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>orders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX orders and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX orders as of the end of Q Moreover the company had options to acquire additional <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aircraft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX aircraft Obviously the orders of new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX are most significant From the international perspective LUV is currently among the three leading purchasers of the new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX family along with Lion Air and most recently Ryanair NASDAQ RYAAY All of them have ordered approximately <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX aircraft Other airlines or aircraft leasing companies with largest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX orders have committed to acquire only around of these aircraft such as American Airlines United Airlines Air Lease AerCap or Viajet Furthermore LUV has excellent business relationships with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as it has purchased a huge number of aircraft from this manufacturer during the past few decades In addition to the huge size of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX order LUV also ordered the new model as the first major airline in The first actual delivery of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX ever will be to LUV in the first half of Because of ordering the new aircraft very early and in massive numbers LUV has very probably received a significant discount and this discount has been larger than in case of its main US competitors Since almost of the LUVs firm orders consist of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX the discount on these aircraft is the decisive driver behind the overall order book discount However we can assume that LUV has also managed to negotiate favorable terms on the remaining orders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s because of LUVs outstanding business relationships with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and its longstanding track record of buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s The savings from the cheap acquisition of the new aircraft have not materialized in any of LUVs financial statements yet The obvious reason is that these transactions delivering the aircraft have yet to happen I believe that the most sensible means of estimating the total savings from the cheap purchase is predicting the difference between the total amount to be paid by LUV for its order book and its standard market value The amount to be paid by LUV can be found in its annual report it is the sum of aircraft purchase commitments So as to determine the current market value of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX I will use the estimation published by Avitas an aircraft valuation and consulting firm Avitas states that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX sells for million per one aircraft which implies discount to the official list price at million I will assume that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX is currently offered on the market with a discount as well For the remaining <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s I will presume a standard market discount Source Author using LUVs annual report These assumptions imply total savings of billion compared to the other competitors However if LUV exercises all of its delivery options to buy additional <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX s LUV could save up to billion These savings will appear in the income statement when LUVs depreciation expense is lower than one of its peers especially DAL AAL and UAL I will assume that LUV will use straightline depreciation for a period of years and with residual value worth which is usual for this industry Under these propositions LUVs depreciation expense will be relatively lower by million when compared to airlines buying the aircraft for the market price depending on the extent of utilized options Assuming a corporate tax rate this will translate into additional net income of million per year Investors will be able to see the full effects of the discounts after the delivery of the whole current order book All of the firmly ordered aircraft should be delivered by and the last options expire in When the new aircraft are delivered other factors should improve the companys financials as well According to experts the new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX will be more fuel efficient than its predecessor In LUV incurred fuel expenses worth billion fuel savings derived from the delivery of the allnew <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX should therefore save an additional million per year assuming the oil prices from depending on the number of used options This number might obviously rise in case of increasing oil price However it must be understood that the other US airlines will also have delivered a large number of fuelefficient aircraft by the end of Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>states that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX delivers lower operating costs than their main competitor which is the Airbus OTCPKEADSY neo family this claim is dubious considering the historical experience with the validity of such claims made by aircraft manufacturers If all carriers achieve comparable operating savings customers will be the main winners in the longer term as airlines are notoriously known for their insufficient pricing power If each airline manages to decrease its operating expenses all carriers will lower fare prices sooner or later thus decreasing their revenue and net income However LUVs savings from cheap aircraft purchases should be permanent as they actually represent a competitive advantage over its US competitors LUV has recently announced postponing deliveries of Boeings MAXs The disclosure concerns some of the aircraft which should have been delivered between and The deliveries have been postponed by to years The last firm order is now scheduled for Because the price and structure of these orders should remain unchanged the total final savings should remain as previously estimated between and billion However these savings will be observable later than previously expected Although some major US airlines most prominently AAL and UAL are currently trading at very low multiples their stocks are far from nobrainers Major legacy carriers have a longstanding history of high cyclicality minimal pricing power nonexistent longterm profits inclination to suffer from terrorist attacks and solvency problems Although the reduction of the number of major US airlines to four might increase their pricing power and increase the longterm margins we have no proof that this effect will be significant The current investment rationale behind adding AAL or UAL to the portfolio is basically buying a lousy business very cheaply when measured by the PE ratio based on last years net income I do not fancy this approach Moreover I am afraid that we are now already at the peak of the industry cycle or even behind the peak but still far from the bottom The industry has reached the peak because of the current record load factors and low oil prices However the low oil price environment might eventually turn out to be a curse for the industry as it encourages undisciplined capacity growth Since the decline in oil price in the most essential airline fundamentals have been continuously deteriorating The recent data suggest that fare prices are still decreasing and therefore PRASM and margins of the major US airlines are eroding Similar trends have eventually led to tremendous trouble for this industry in the not very distant past Source LUVs Investor Day presentation Despite this I believe that LUV is best positioned for longterm performance among the top four US carriers LUVs current competitive advantage lies in its low debt superior management further potential for growth and reasonable fleet composition including cheap acquisitions of new aircraft LUV is therefore the major US carrier which is best positioned to endure the difficulties of this industry However due to the mentioned industrywide situation I do not believe the right time to buy LUV is right now Furthermore I do not think that LUVs current price is attractive enough considering the industry risks as it trades at a PE of Because of the same reason I do not believe that pairing a long position in LUV with a short position in an airline ETF such as the US Global Jets ETF NYSEARCA JETS is currently interesting either This pair trade would mitigate the industry risk but at the same time it would be a bet on the worsening of airline fundamentals because LUV has the lowest leverage and highest margins among the major US airlines If an investor expects continuing negative development in the airline industry he will be better off simply shorting the JETS ETF I think that now is simply not the right time to have any long position in the major US airlines Source LUVs Investor Day presentation However I must emphasize that the right time will come sooner or later My strategy is to buy LUV when either of two situations eventually occurs The first possibility is that the worsening of airline fundamentals will continue because of adding capacity and declining margins until the lowmargin carriers find themselves breaking even or even in loss A significant rise in oil price slowdown of the general economy or even security threats might also greatly contribute to this result Given that LUV is the financially strongest major US airline it will be able to handle almost any industry downturn At the same time adverse industry conditions should lead to a reasonable stock price and little likelihood of further capacity increases or fare price declines The alternative entry point would arise if the US airlines stopped adding capacity and increased pricing before their profits significantly erode Many investors argue that this will happen because the US airlines have learnt a lesson from the past and the industry is now more consolidated Still I am afraid that this will not be the case and the fundamentals will start improving only after significant erosion of the currently record margins In the next several months investors should closely monitor the releases of the new data which are fundamental for the industry especially capacity growth PRASM passenger yields and load factors Until they start improving it is not the right time to buy LUV yet Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my
