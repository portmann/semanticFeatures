should eyeball the economic growth in China but should not fear the low growth Despite lower growth rate of the Chinese economy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>foresees robust demand One of the countries that has captured the economic headlines for weeks now is China The Chinese economy shows signs of decelerating growth and the government seems not to be able to turn things around and the fact that the Chinese government which always is in full control sparked fear among investors and resulted in a predicted major selloff over the last weeks Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>assembly line in Renton Source airchivecom <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA presented its year market outlook for China on the th of August while China captured the headlines day after day Various news portals including one linked by Seeking Alpha reported that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>increased its market outlook for Chinese aircraft demand on the th of August AeroAnalysis familiar with Boeings market outlook begs to differ from what is written by various news outlets First of all what has to be noted is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>did increase its outlook in June What happened in August was an annual presentation of the results for the Chinese market just like it did for the Indian market but BA merely presented the results and reaffirmed the outlook during that presentation The presentation with the bullish outlook for the Chinese aircraft market reached news headlines due to the fact that the Chinese stock market was seeing strong declines at that very same moment Secondly it should be noted that the company already foresaw a decelerating growth for the Chinese economy Some passages from the China market outlook also show this Although a net beneficiary of low oil prices China is experiencing slower growth though at more sustainable levels as its economy matures Over the next two decades fast growth in Chinas domestic market will make it the largest domestic market in the world and traffic within Asia is set to become the largest travel market China is gradually reducing its rate of growth as it rebalances toward a more consumptionoriented economy From the passages it becomes evident that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>actually already took into account low oil prices and slower GDP growth yet the jet maker forecasts strong demand from the Chinese market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>forecasts a GDP growth per annum and forecasts demand for aircraft valued at bn <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>expects the Chinese airline fleet to grow by per annum while cargo activities will grow by per year and passenger activities will grow by per year For investors it is a bullish sign for the long term that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>forecasts demand for over airframes while also taking into account slower economic growth All in all I do see Boeings market forecast as a bullish sign despite concerns about shortterm growth in China Contrary to what is reported by some news portals <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>only reaffirmed the market outlook published in June BA incorporated a slower growth on the Chinese market in its market outlook With the expected lower growth rate the company still values the Chinese aircraft market at nearly trillion On the short term there will be some concerns about the Chinese economy but given Boeings history of providing accurate market outlooks I think the longterm outlook is bright For investors the lower stock prices do offer a nice opportunity to buy in some shares for the long term The fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>increased its annual guidance in June and reaffirmed its longterm guidance in August shows confidence in the market as a whole and does bode well for investors Disclosure I amwe are long BA MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I
