NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Fluctuation of order backlog is healthy Both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA and Airbus OTCPK OTCPKEADSF OTCPK OTCPKEADSY have their order books standing at record highs The filled order books reflect the high demand for fuel efficient aircraft as well as new aircraft needed to support growth Figure Current Market Outlook provided by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Source boeingcom Figure shows there will be need for approximately airframes of which can be supplied by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus During <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus delivered airframes leaving airframes In Q airframes were delivered which leaves airframes Taking into account the current backlog for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and for Airbus the remaining orders to be divided are about airframes Assuming that order inflow will be split equally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>still can expect orders for aircraft in the coming years This means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can expect orders per year on average well below current delivery levels As can be seen from the figure there are still a lot of orders to be divided between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus So to meet demand Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can expect significant order inflow but I dont expect the order inflow to be continuously robust as it has been in the last years In the coming years the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will be ramping up production rates which means that as long as order inflow remains higher than production the order book will grow I expect that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will be able to have their order books rise at moderate levels in the coming years On the other hand order inflow is rather cyclic instead of showing continuous increase in orders This has to do with older aircraft that need to be phased out oil prices growth of the market supported by economic growth and new aircraft entering the market The current orders books are supported by Replacement orders Older aircraft such as the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and to some extent the Airbus Aceo need to be replaced The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and the Airbus Aneo are some suitable aircraft to replace these older aircraft Additionally the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>needs replacement the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus A can fill in that spot Oil prices Most orders that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus received were placed during the time that oil was still trading at high levels Currently oil is trading near a price of per barrel So currently the urge for airlines to buy fuel efficient aircraft faded a bit but it has to be noted that oil prices have been on the rise again and the purchase of aircraft is a long term investment This means that airlines have to look at the long term forecast for oil prices to decide to buy new airframes or not Although oil prices have crashed I expect oil prices to rise in the coming years again aided by higher demand for oil as economic recovery continues and picks up pace in the Eurozone as well Figure Forecast oil price per barrel Source knoemacom Growth With the economies all over the world recovering again demand for air travel will rise To meet market demand airlines will have to grow for which new aircraft are required The order books look healthy to me as all orders are placed to replace and support growth I dont think the current filled order books are a bubble but are based on robust need for replacement and to support growth In my view at some point the attractiveness to continue placing orders for aircraft will fade This has the following reasons Availability of delivery slots With current order books it will take years between order placement and delivery For airlines it might be wise to postpone making a financial commitment for airframes order that will stretch in the length of many years It is not beneficial for any airline to place orders and having to wait years if not more to take delivery Up to this point airlines were willing to wait because oil prices were high in that case costs can be reduced by purchasing fuel efficient aircraft as soon as possible and the airline market recovered from the recessions of economies around the world this triggered airlines to start growing the fleet again to meet demand additionally fleet renewal programs that were initially postpone due to tough economic times gained traction In the past years new aircraft have entered the market or are about to enter the market A few examples are the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X Airbus A Airbus Aneo and Airbus Aneo This created a high order inflow in the past years and although demand remains high I think a lot of airlines will not place a follow up order until the aircraft are delivered and have proven themselves A lot of orders are a combination of firm orders and purchase rights for additional airframes A lot of times these purchase rights are being firmed up after an airlines has started taking delivery of the airframes initially ordered Taking into account the points above I think that order inflow will decline at some point Ordering aircraft would become more attractive again once delivery slots are moved forward in time which can be done by increasing production rates I think that order books will remain more or less steady or show moderate growth in the coming years and after that decline due to higher delivery outflow and slightly lower order inflow Once order books show moderate decline again and production rates remain high airlines will probably order airframes again if demand for air travel remains high because airlines can take delivery of airframes rather quickly when production rates are high and order books are not as filled as they currently are <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>already has been increasing production rates for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and it is likely that Airbus will follow soon Growing order books dont say a lot about success but say more about demand The current order books signal a strong demand A declining order book signals that order inflow is smaller than the number of deliveries and at some point production rates need to be cut or order inflow needs to pick up pace again A steady order book with or without moderate growth signals strong demand as well as balanced production rates Currently I think order books will still show moderate growth for the coming years but with about airframes to be ordered over years airframes per year I do expect that production rates to decline at some point This then again will make ordering airframes more attractive The manufacturer that is able to deliver to the customer fastest already has a big advantage in winning an order A good example of this is the deal between Delta NYSE DAL and Airbus where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was not able to offer attractive delivery slots to Delta Air Lines due to the robust order backlog for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Robust order books show high demand for aircraft In the coming years I expect order books to show moderate growth In the years after I expect order books to decline This is not a bad sign as it reduces the time between order placement and delivery of an airframe making ordering aircraft attractive again The company that has biggest order back log is not necessarily the best A better measure to compare value for investors are the delivery rates and operating margins Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks associated
