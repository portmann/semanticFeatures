class='textDiv'>Why I Bought <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>After The Recent Pullback The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Disclosure I amwe are long BA MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Post earnings I added to my <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>position at Boeings weighting is growing within my portfolio and I am very comfortable with this aerospace is an industry that I like long term I discuss highlights from the Q earnings report and conference call and take a look back at the companys financial performance In a recent article I named <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA as one of my favorite picks for I am personally long the stock having bought lots of shares at and most recently at during the postearnings decline My cost average for the overall position is currently meaning that Im down on my shares This loss wouldnt be so bad if it werent for my recent purchase at however after the companys dividend increase in December I felt compelled to add to my position I viewed this as a bullish sign from management Apparently I read the signal wrong Either way over the long term I feel comfortable with exposure to BA and I will continue to lower my cost average should the shares sell off further In this piece I will work through the Q report and conference call using this as well as past performance data to fortify my bullish thesis in the face of presentday negative sentiment Well start with the Q data though I admit that I think far too often investors put far too much weight on one report losing sight of the bigger picture To me BAs near decline post earnings has been an overreaction The stock was already trading down double digits from its high setback in February Now it is down over from that high of a decline that should catch the attention of both value and contrarian investors First and foremost will be Boeings th year of business Any company that can survive and thrive in the competitive market place for a century deserves respect core EPS guidance was This was a significant disappoint which sparked the selloff due to the prior expectation of revenue guidance was also a disappointment though not as much of one of a percentage basis billion versus a consensus of billion Operating cash flow for came in at billion BA expects roughly billion for RD spending for is expected to be billion is expected to be a peak year in terms of capex specifically with regard to production automation and these costs are expected to taper off going into and beyond Commercial airplane revenue was a record billion in a increase yy The company expects commercial revenues to be billion in The company guided for commercial deliveries of which is below s total of In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>captured orders or a roughly ratio with deliveries completed The companys current backlog sits at billion or roughly planes years of production at presentday production rates In it was very generous returning cash to shareholders BA repurchased million shares for billion and paid billion in dividends Ive already mentioned the dividend increase management approved in I expect the dividend to continue to rise though not necessarily at the same pace BAs year DGR is I expect future increases to be more in line with this lowdouble digit trend The companys payout ratio in was Assuming managements EPS guidance is correct even taking the bottom end into consideration the companys current dividend represents a payout ratio To me the threshold is an important one I like to see the companies I own paying out less than of earnings in the form of dividends though so long as this ratio doesnt rise above I dont get too worried When speaking of shareholder returns its also worth mentioning that management increased the buyback authorization to billion in The company expects to complete this buyback over the next years Over the last years BA has reduced its share count roughly buying back million shares and has increased its dividend by To make matters even better for investors interested in capital returns in the CC QA session CFO Gregory Smith said this And were committed to returning cash to shareholders in the fashion that youve seen over the last couple of years going forward At the end of Q BA had billion in cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet The companys progress with the KC is moving along with a refueling flight with an F accomplished This contract will mean a lot for BAs future military revenues Investors should continue to track further progress here The company highlighted the fact that commercial air traffic increased by for the year above the year average signaling to BA and hopefully investors that the air industry as a whole continues to be healthy Global air freight growth wasnt quite so robust at Though BA management is bullish on the market due to an expected plane replacement cycle starting up due to the fact that roughly air freighters will be years old by This bodes well for the which is struggling a bit at present With regard to the its current production schedule and its future management had this to say the is a niche market its an important niche market and one that we think is sustainable So all of the decisions weve made factor in both the nearterm economics as well as this longerterm replacement cycle The International Air Traffic Association IATA targets commercial growth and freight growth in Air traffic growth in China is expected to increase at an even faster rate with growth in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>expects Chinas middle class to continue to grow and fly and therefore management believes the country will need over new aircraft over the next years The company expects that the air industry as a whole will require another over the next years meaning there is a lot of opportunity for BA one of the major players in the space Narrow body competition with Airbus OTCPKEADSY has been a major concern for investors of late Management highlighted the fact that since the introduction of the MAX orders have been roughly in comparison to Airbuss narrow body options Before the MAX there was a discrepancy there with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>falling behind its major competitor In the CC management was quoted as saying And as noted again we were the market leader in total deliveries again this year So when we think about market share its important to think about both deliveries and future orders And as weve had the MAX in the marketplace and competing based on feedback from our customers we see that the MAX is providing a value proposition beyond our competitors aircraft BA believes its winning with the MAX which is why management feels confident focusing on production pushing the total up to month for As you can see although the stock sold off drastically following this report it wasnt all bad Long term I still like BAs prospects moving forward Also which so much emphasis put on and I wanted to take a look backwards and see how these years compared to recent performance So what I did was look back at BAs annual reports and compile basic financial information dating back to As you will see below the company remains in a strong uptrend If guidance holds true there will be a bit of a lull in growth but consider this to be a blue chip company and Id need to see more than a couple of relatively flat years for me to really believe the tide is turning and the business has lost its luster The macroenvironment has been a concern of mine for some time now enough of a concern that Ive sold shares and liquidated several positions in a defensive attempt to raise cash So when looking at BAs decline in price and considering whether or not to add shares which Ive already done and whether or not I should add more which Im still considering this yield is hard to ignore the macro picture plays a role in my decision making Late in the CC an analyst asked management if they would be willing to speak of their apparently bullish view of their company moving forward and explain their reasoning Management agreed with CEO Dennis Muilenburg saying Yeah we will And I think your read in that is correct in that were bullish about our prospects but were also paying attention to whats happening in the macro environment around us If you take a look at GDP projections of about growth over the nearterm and midterm again thats a balanced view Thats different in different parts of the world as you well know But on balance thats a respectable level for our industry The key differentiator is we continue to see passenger growth globally increasing at about to a year It is outpacing GDP And even in places like China where obviously its been getting a lot of attention on economic growth prospects even during the fourth quarter of just as a reference point as GDP in China fell back to a little under airplane and passenger traffic growth increased So passenger growth continues to outpace GDP That is a strong trend Its a longterm trend And then thats part of what paints a bit more of a bullish view in terms of our growth prospects You see that reflected in our planned production rate increases I was happy to see a CEO frankly address the question Obviously management isnt going to paint an ugly bearish picture of their own company however it seems as though those in charge at BA genuinely believe their position moving forward is one of strength I agree Ive been so attracted to aerospace investing due to two of my favorite investable macro trends urbanization and globalization So many of the megatrends that we hear about today seem somewhat hard to predict with some being relatively farfetched But I believe these two are easily predict and Ive bought into them completely I came across this UN Urbanization report back in and have been a believer in the trend and the role that air travel will play in the world moving forward ever since To me <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>United Technology NYSE UTX and Honeywell NYSE HON all stand to benefit from this trend I dont own shares of either of the latter though both are on my watch list right now I think picking up shares of companies with such strong longterm tail winds is a great idea for longterm investors especially when those shares are beaten down because of shortterm news Sure BAs guidance isnt as rosy as many would have hoped for but no matter who you are youre going to have a hard time convincing me that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>isnt a great company to buy and hold for decades Now with that said if youre bearish I ask that you try Im always hoping to learn and I think readers all benefit from diverse discussions You wont hurt my feelings I promise I look forward to any and all responses Best wishes all Tagged Dividends Income Industrial Goods </div></body></html>
