Generations of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>show the strength of the concept Business case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>strengthens when oil prices rise In a previous article I had a look at the order inflow for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA and some of the conclusions that I drew were Order inflow for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER declined strongly in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F orders supported order inflow but it can be questioned for how long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will be able to find customers in this challenging market landscape In the previous article I solely looked at the impact the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X had on order inflow for the current <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>family and although the impact is obvious it is important to note and address the several other factors that complicate matters and make the situation for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>somewhat unique Before addressing the factors that complicate things for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>it is important to give a bit of background information about the aircraft Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Diagram Source wwwAeroAnalysisnet The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is the result of competitors such as Airbus OTCPKEADSF OTCPKEADSY that was working on the A and A working on new aircraft while airlines pressured <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to come up with a clean sheet design rather than coming up with a stretch of the existing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>airframe By the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>base model entered commercial service In the years after a stretched <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER and an extended range version <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>were introduced completing the first generation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>family The second generation family included a stretch of the a Long Range version of the and a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F While the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER remained popular Airbus came up with the Airbus A which would directly compete with Boeings This forced <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to come up with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X but not before implementing a last performance improvement package on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>In a time frame of years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>came up with generations of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>families which not only shows the competitive market environment but also the strength of the concept One of the elements that determines the success of an aircraft is its efficiency With higher fuel prices which are directly related to oil prices the efficiency of an aircraft becomes more important Weight number of seats aerodynamics and propulsive efficiency directly impact the efficiency of an aircraft Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>orders versus inflation corrected oil price Source AeroAnalysis Figure shows order inflow on the left axis and the average inflation adjusted oil price per barrel What can be seen is that in general higher oil prices cause spikes in the order inflow It seems that the business case for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>becomes stronger as oil prices head north of the mark In the years oil prices were above but a worldwide economic crisis made fleet expansion unnecessary In the past years the average ranged between and Currently the average is below while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has also launched the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X Current low oil prices make replacement of older aircraft on the short term unnecessary while the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X is the better option for the longterm fleet planning of airlines These two elements already lead to declining order inflow As mentioned before the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was launched to meet the needs of airlines and to be able to compete with the developments of Airbus and McDonnell Douglas In years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>came up with generations of s and a total of models including freighter This on one hand shows the strength of the concept but also the fierce competition The most serious threat probably came from Airbus that presented the Airbus A but could not compete with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Eventually Airbus came up with the Airbus A which can pose more of a threat to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and was also a reason for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to come up with the X Figure Order inflow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Classic versus Airbus A Source AeroAnalysis Comparing the order inflow of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Classic versus the Airbus A it can be seen that with the exception of a few years the Airbus A outsold the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>From up until <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>received orders while Airbus sold A units So for every <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>sold Airbus was able to sell As It is not weird for an all new airplane to outsell an existing concept but it does show that competition has eaten or might have eaten away orders from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>A lot of my readers but also analysts are quite fast in addressing the production gap as an isolated problem but it is important to look beyond that taking into account other factors such as oil prices downturns of economies geopolitical tensions industry crises and competition All of these elements make the entire puzzle more complex for any manufacturer or management and complicate the decision making processes rather than adjusting production rates up or down based on backlog and projected backlog This article took into account oil economy and competition and based on those elements the following conclusions can be drawn The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>seems to be stronger as oil prices rise above The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>experienced the crisis in the airline industry sparked by the attacks The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>experienced the downturn of the global economy The Airbus A was brought on the market to compete with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and was able to outsell the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Taking into account these elements I think it is more than fair to say that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>did not do as bad as most think In Part of this series I will deal with an additional set of variables that complicate the puzzle even more but should give a more realistic and accurate image If you would like to receive updates for my upcoming articles please click the Follow text at the top of this page next to my
