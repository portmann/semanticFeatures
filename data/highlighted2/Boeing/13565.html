The Stock Of The Worlds Largest Aircraft Manufacturer Overvalued The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Based on current PE ratio <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares are valued quite high Based on PEG ratio shares seem to be undervalued <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA shares have risen almost since the low in Year to date the stock climbed With order books at record highs and the stock trading near an alltime high as well more and more people are wondering whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares are overvalued Based on high production rates and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>that should go cash positive soon I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares still have a lot of upward potential In order to determine whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares are overvalued or not I will use a few measures One way to measure Boeings stock performance is by looking at the rise of the stock price in a given time frame and compare it to other companies and indices Figure shows the rise of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>since January along with the rise of Lockheed Martin NYSE LMT the Dow Jones SPDR SP Aerospace Defense ETF NYSEARCA XAR United Technologies Corp NYSE UTX and General Electric NYSE GE <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Lockheed Martin are aerospace giants The XAR ETF is an Aerospace Defense ETF United Technologies Corp and General Electric are conglomerates that have a high affinity with the aerospace industry Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>performance relative to industry and Dow Jones Source YCharts What can be seen is that the conglomerates that have a high affinity with the aerospace industry are more or less following the Dow Jones while the Aerospace industry rose twice as fast <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>rose while the XAR ETF trades higher Lockheed Martin is even trading higher So within the aerospace industry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is not showing a steeper rise than its industry peers If there is something overvalued then it is the aerospace industry as a whole but it should be taken into account that the aerospace and defense industry has been one of the last industries to profit from the economic recovery Order books are filled and with a bright prospect the current and future outperformance that accelerated in seems justified to me Additionally it should be noted that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>up until January was trading at a level just higher than the Dow and only recently has been matching the performance of the XAR ETF So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has risen faster than the Dow Jones and is currently matching the rise of the XAR ETF which climbed almost twice as fast as the Dow Jones Index Taking into account the strong financial performance as well as the bright longterm outlook I dont think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is trading at levels that are not justified by its financial performance or its growth prospect Based on the price multiple PE ratio it can be determined whether a stock is overvalued Figure PE ratio development for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Lockheed Martin Source YCharts As the figure shows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is currently trading at a PE ratio of compared to for Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin shares rose sharper since but the lower PE ratio indicates that the higher share prices for Lockheed Martin were more related to higher earnings than it is for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Currently the Dow Jones has a trailing PE ratio of If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>were to have the same PE ratio as the Dow Jones its fair value would be However each industry tends to have its own price multiple which makes a comparison to the Dow Jones hard to justify The Aerospace Defense industry has a slightly higher PE of This figure shows a fair value This means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been trading at fair value for the majority of and currently is trading above its fair value When adopting the rule of thumb that a PE ratio between indicates a high valued stock unless the stock has a high growth potential it can be said that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is valued quite high But it also has to be noted that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been trading at a PE ratio of in the second half of that is common for the aerospace industry and its PE ratio increased after the January earnings report Additionally the PEratio dropped from in January to almost in which is caused by lower stock prices but also by higher earnings Figure PE ratio development versus EPS for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Source YCharts Figure shows that the PE ratio fell as earnings decreased as well This indicates that lower earnings have an immediate effect on the stock price Solely looking at the PE ratio <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>seems to be overvalued but this high PEratio has been caused by the earnings report in January in which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was very positive about the future and its future growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a forward PE of which is more reasonable for an aerospace company and shows that investors have calculated in the bright prospect that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>sketched for its investors One drawback is that the PEratio does not take into account future growth which somehow has to be calculated in the stock price as well Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is a company that should be seeing some strong growth in the coming years the PEG ratio might be a better measure Figure PEG ratio development versus EPS for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Source YCharts The PEG ratios are currently well below indicating that the stock is undervalued If the stock were to trade at fair value it would have a PE ratio of This PE ratio seems high but incorporates future earnings growth Doing some quick math the fair value according to the PEG ratio seems to be somewhere around using the TTM ratio and using forward PEG ratio This means that currently at the time of writing the stock is trading at the stock has upward potential The PEGratio supports the price target of that Sterne Agee put on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares Based on the forward PE ratio <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is not overvalued Based on the PEG ratio the stock has upward potential With higher production rates in the coming years and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>that should go cash positive soon higher stock prices are justified The only threat that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>stock is facing is if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>does not meet its target for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to go cash positive but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is convinced the airframe will go cash positive soon Source Is The Stock Of The Worlds Largest Aircraft Manufacturer Overvalued
