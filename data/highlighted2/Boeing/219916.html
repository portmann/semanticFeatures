Amortized tooling costs shifts ahead breakeven point <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could eventually recoup all costs according to calculations but it will be a challenge In one of my previous articles I had a look at the deferred costs on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA program and concluded that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is currently losing mln per airframe but that I do expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to breakeven in within deliveries A reader however pointed out that I did not include the amortized tooling costs which adds another bn to the total costs In this article I will add the amortized tooling costs and I will also have a look at the financial prospect when the development costs are added to the equation What has to be noted is that amortized tooling does not impact the cost per aircraft since the tooling costs have been more or less stable in comparison to the deferred costs However adding amortized tooling costs does shift the breakeven point ahead Figure Costs on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Program Source AeroAnalysisnet As can be seen in Figure total costs excluding development costs are bn almost bn higher than the deferred costs If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>were to recoup the costs for amortized tooling and deferred costs with its current backlog it needs to make an average profit of mln on the coming airframes that will be delivered Applying a profit margin I estimated Boeings profit in a best case scenario to be mln Given the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has to ramp up profit per production the same way it had to cut costs it can be ruled out that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can recoup the costs with its current backlog <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>used an accounting block of aircraft that means that the jet maker can estimate the production costs of these airframes quite accurately If we apply the accounting block of aircraft to the total costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>needs to make a mln profit per airframe on average This figure seems to be more achievable to me Adding development costs is not something a jet maker would normally do some programs would never draw profit if development costs were added to the program costs To have a view on the prospect for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>on the longer term it is interesting to add development costs anyways I estimatedguesstimated the development costs to be bn In this case I will not spread out the costs over the accounting block of aircraft but over the total units that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can sell if it captures half of the market This figure would be little over aircraft if we reduce this number by the number of Dreamliners <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>needs to recoup the deferred and amortized costs we are left with airframes This means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>needs about million on average to recover its development costs Breakingeven on deferred and amortization costs within the accounting block is a major challenge and depends on how fast <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can ramp up profits Adding development costs means that on average million needs to be recovered per airframe after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has covered the deferred costs This should be more than doable for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>All in all there is still a lot of work for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to be done but the longterm outlook remains bright even if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has to recoup for the billions in developments costs on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell
