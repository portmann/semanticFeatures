Commercial Aircraft represented some 68% of revenues, with Defense, Space & Security a further 31%.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Looking forward , the sustainability of such high production rates is <b>dependent</b> on high levels ( 4-5 % ) of aircrafts being retired which is unlikely given the much <i>lower</i> jet-fuel prices .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Fuel efficiency is <i>less</i> of a positive factor in favor of new aircrafts under such a low fuel price environment .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I would expect BA 's 2016 revenues to be some 5 % <i>lower</i> at around $ 91 billion as the oversupply in wide-bodied aircraft continues to take effect .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Customer Prepayments , have been exceptionally strong since 2010 , a factor unlikely to continue Looking at BA 's cash flows since 2010 , I <b>believe</b> that the company 's cash flows have benefited to the tune of around $ 5 billion per annum ( and some $ 7 billion in 2014 ) due to customer prepayments on aircraft orders .  (Uncertainty) </span>Such prepayments represent advances (deposits) as well as progress payments which provide BA with positive cash flow prior to delivering the aircraft.Looking at the 2015 accounts however, this benefit shrank to only around $400 million and should increase slightly to around $1 billion in 2016.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This still represents a sharp slowdown from previous years and highlights how this benefit has been ` stolen ' from future years and thus a ` catch-up ' period is <b>probably</b> inevitable .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For example , current unearned revenue in 2010 was approximately $ 12 billion and has jumped to <b>almost</b> $ 25 billion in 2015 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In addition to the prepayment ` catch-up ' issue I mention above , other factors such as <i>tougher</i> backlog pricing and <i>higher</i> pension and cash tax payments are likely to impact BA .  (Surprise) </span>These factors will negatively impact cash flows keeping the share price subdued.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Using my key <b>assumptions</b> mentioned above and utilizing the finbox.io DCF model attached , I arrive at a fair value share price target of $ 101 per share .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I would <b>suggest</b> staying on the sidelines until prices <i>further</i> drop .
