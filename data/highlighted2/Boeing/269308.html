Seeking Alpha Stone Fox Capital Stone Fox Capital clicks Delta Air Lines continues to tell anybody that will listen the purchase prices for used s Along with a downgrade <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is down sharply on the news The recommendation is for investors to continue focusing on the order book for narrowbody planes and ignore the noise generated by a customer looking for cheaper planes In an interesting news twist Asias largest carrier agreed to purchase <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA airplanes yet the market appeared more interested in the cost of one used plane The news bits continued a spate over the last several months regarding a glut in the airplane market and specifically the widebody jets See my original research on the issue here The suggestion that the market is oversupplied with aircraft is naturally a negative for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>With the stock flat to down this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>approved another largescale buyback and dividend hike to take advantage of the massive order book Is this story anything other than an airline looking for a discount on planes For some reason Delta Air Lines NYSE DAL took to apparently every media outlet that would listen to gloat over purchasing a airplane for only million The following tweet capped off the promotion of this feat The news follows the Q earnings call in October were Deltas CEO went on the offensive to proclaim a bubble in the s that were approaching years old Richard Anderson proclaimed the ability to buy planes at a fraction of the original cost at a suggested price of million The original news was bizarre because it is rare for an business man to proclaim to the world of this great deal that might attract a bidding war Even more interesting is the apparent fact that nobody else wants the widebody planes that arent in high demand these days due to a market shift towards narrowbody airplanes The news though smacks of inconsistent with market demands with China Southern Airlines ordering <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>jets at a listed value of billion The airline though purchased several versions of the narrowbody With the expected travel growth in China the country is forecast to need to add considerably to fleets Common sense suggests that new planes would trump one old plane Wells Fargo though downgraded the stock sending Boeings stock down over for the day As my research highlighted in the previous article the is only a small portion of the unfilled backlog The narrowbody that is the focus of the largest Chinese airline accounts for the vast majority of the orders on the books At the end of September <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had unfilled orders that included only orders for the model in question As of the end of November the unfilled orders were stable at The unfilled orders were down to only or roughly of backlog number Naturally the widebody has a listed price of nearly triple the very popular narrowbody but any glut in old widebody planes is unlikely to impact the backlog and production schedules of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The more telling story is that Delta placed a recent order for planes that includes ERs For an airline suggesting that gluts exist in the industry Delta sure is buying a lot more newer planes than old ones Slide of the Investor Day presentation holds the likely truth to the story In essence Delta is attempting to use the weakness in the used commercial aircraft market to gain better economics from the recent and future deals with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The key takeaway remains that Delta is trying to work the market for all the discounts possible With a virtual duopoly for aircraft needed by commercial airlines the fears of a glut probably provide the best opportunity to grab a discount At the end of day though analysts continue to ratchet up the EPS estimates at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>for The forecast is now up to per share placing the stock at a value of x those estimates The stock isnt overly cheap but the giant backlog and large stock buybacks provides plenty of support for higher earnings in the future We only
