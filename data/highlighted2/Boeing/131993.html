BA reported earnings last week and the results were excellent But the stock continues to languish and I think it is because investors are too focused on the short term Ive been a bull on aerospace giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA for some time now as I like the stocks longterm fundamentals and the renewed focus on capital returns by the management team make it all the more enticing Most recently I detailed how I thought the stock was cheap at Obviously weve moved down marginally since that time but we also received the companys Q earnings report last week In light of what has happened since I last visited <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Ill use this article to take a fresh look at the companys fundamentals and its valuation To do this Ill use a DCFtype model you can read more about here The model uses several inputs including earnings estimates which Ive borrowed from Yahoo dividends which Ive set to grow at annually and a discount rate which Ive set at the year Treasury rate plus a risk premium of We can see the model is quite bullish producing a fair value of That would indicate that BA is cheap on a fundamental basis but lets take a look at the underlying business to see what we can learn In short Boeings Q was really quite good The company posted a wide beat on the top and bottom lines on underlying strength in its business Not only did the Commercial Airplanes business soar but the company managed to buy back roughly of the float during the quarter I detailed Boeings terrific free cash flow in relation to its dividend and buyback earlier this year and that strength is shining through in a big way through a reduced float Boeings order backlog is also still strong at nearly half a trillion dollars although it did slip during the quarter Despite the slip in the backlog I have zero concerns for Boeings longterm demand picture as it continues to ink huge deals like FedEx NYSE FDX as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is still widely respected in the aviation world there is no lack of demand for Boeings products and if anything Boeings capacity is holding it back <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>issued soft guidance during its Q report but that was because of a cent charge in relation to its KC tanker program The planes fuel system needs an overhaul and that is costing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>dearly but that is something that happens in an extraordinarily complicated business like building airplanes This is a onetime charge and it is part of the deal with owning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>so I dont even really care The tanker is on schedule for delivery and that is all that matters this is a hiccup It has happened before and it will happen again If you strip out the noise of the tanker charge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>actually increased its guidance for this year and that means the stock is a little cheaper than it was on a core earnings basis Onetime charges should be ignored if they are truly onetime charges and the fuel system hiccup is something that should be ignored <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>continues to post terrific FCF and that allows it to not only pay a robust dividend but buy back lots of stock The company repurchased billion worth of shares in Q and still has billion left on its authorization Thats good for nearly of the current float and when you combine a large share reduction like that with strong fundamentals you get a stock that is very cheap Turning to the chart I see a couple of things that make me thing BA is near a shortterm bottom First the stock is approaching a rising DMA That should provide some support as we are only a couple of ticks away If we get a few days of selling that leaves the stock markedly below the DMA that would be a sign of trouble but for now it looks like it should support the stock Likewise there is strong longerterm support in the area as BA topped out there three times in the last two years Since then the stock broke out of its trading range and that area the top of the former trading range should act as support In conjunction with the rising DMA I see a lot of really strong support in the area Finally the shortterm channel weve seen as the stock has fallen from its highs to its current levels looks like a bull flag to me If you look at the longerterm chart the breakout from the former trading range that occurred earlier this year is the pole of the flag and that would indicate that BA is pausing while it gathers strength for the next leg up I firmly believe the flag I see here is a continuation pattern and since the trend is up that bodes well for the stock I like BA very much here The combination of strong fundamentals huge capital returns strong FCF and a very favorable chart setup means BA looks like a great long candidate here In fact Ive gotten long BA here as I love the fundamental story and the fact that the stock is so cheap at only times forward earnings The chart setup is just icing on the cake and it all means that I think well see BA higher in the next couple of quarters Source The Market Is Missing The LongTerm Story On <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Disclosure I amwe are
