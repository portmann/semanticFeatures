<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER is a suitable replacement for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Higher seat counts on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER increase revenue and lower per seat costs The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA I has been a slow seller and the reason for this in my opinion is not because the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I is a bad airframe The real reason is because the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER in typical as well as denser seating configurations can perfectly replace the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>This makes the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I redundant Air Canada OTCPKACDVF perfectly demonstrates this with their dense seating configuration for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER In this article I will look at how the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER performs relative to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>for Air Canada For the analysis I will analyze a flight from Vancouver to London which is a nautical miles flight Air Canada operates the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER in class configuration but the premium economy can be seen as a dignified economy class The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ERs in service with Air Canada can transport up to passengers For the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I no typical class seating configurations are available Using scaling methods seat counts are obtained an evaluated Landing fee London Heathrow For the landing fee a combination of maximum take off weight noise print as well as NOx emission determines the total landing fee Since no data for the emission was available this has been left out of the fee calculation The following results are obtained for the first configuration Fuel costs are based on a jet fuel price of per gallon The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I generated more revenue but has higher fuel costs and a slightly higher landing fee This results in a lower profit for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER The per seat efficiency figures for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>however are superior driven by lower fuel consumption and a slightly higher revenue per seat It has to be noted that current <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I operators are operating the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I at fairly low seat counts Using a more conservative seat count the advantage shifts entirely towards the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER The revenue is higher for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER combining this with lower fuel costs results in a higher profit Per seat the revenue is about equal while fuel consumption is about or lower While the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I has a higher revenue and profit potential the airplane has no market By operating the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER with seats the airline clearly portrays the potential of the airframe in higher density seating Airlines that need the capacity will buy an Airbus A which offers greater flexibility in seating configuration and higher luxury standard which allows for higher ticket prices Airlines that need a replacement for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will be more interested in operating the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER which has a similar seat count Additionally airlines can increase the number of seats to increase revenue and decrease costs per seat With the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X entering service in years the life for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as a passenger jet is very limited The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should not give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>a bad taste since the cargo version of the jet should be a success once the market recovers at higher pace again Additionally the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I was more of a reckless and bad attempt to compete with Airbus superjumbo Although the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I is a failure the concept has brought <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>a lot of orders The cannibalization of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>by the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will not have a major impact on Boeings numbers other than the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program profitability hinging on success of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F which is facing a difficult
