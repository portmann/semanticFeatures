We don't own a lot of companies that pay dividends this month, but April has historically been very good to us in terms of the amount of income we receive from our holdings.In fact, this month has been our second best month ever in terms of dividends received.Our dividend growth for the month is up 9.31% and 47.06% compared to the same time period in 2015 and 2014, respectively.The dividend growth has slowed slightly, but that was expected.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Previous month 's year-over-year dividend growth was astronomical and <b>could</b> n't be sustained forever .  (Uncertainty) </span>For the year, dividend growth is up 28.48% and 74.36% when compared to 2015 and 2014.Companies that paid us dividends for the month of March are: Coke, Altria, Philip Morris, Realty Income, General Electric, Cisco and JPMorgan.Many of the companies in the portfolio have had a rough earnings season.This has caused many companies to have sharp drops in share price.This has provided buying opportunities and we were able to add to our Microsoft position.Since the company still has long term growth ahead of it as well provides a steadily increasing source of income, the price decline gave us a chance to add a quality company at a reasonable valuation.Having a price target helps take the emotion out of large price drop.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Dividend growth continues to power <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise) </span>This is important because these dividends will provide the income needed to cover our expenses in retirement.April was our second best month ever.The snowball effect of a steadily rising income stream shows that we are on the right path towards retirement.Disclosure: I am/we are long ABBV, AFL, COP, CVX, GILD, GIS, JPM, KO, XOM, MA, MMM, MO, MSFT, PG, PM, T, TGT, V, VTR, AAPL, BA, CSCO,  CVS, GE, JNJ, LUV, O, PEP, SBUX, VS.
