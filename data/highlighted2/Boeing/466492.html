This takes JIT to a new level.There are many small firms like this that will revolutionize the supply chain.The Achille's Heel for the aerospace is the supply chain.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Firms like Norsk are fabulous opportunities for <i>bigger</i> firms to acquire - the same for venture capitalists .  (Surprise) </span>And there a number of them.Another firm that has the potential to revolutionize the industry is WheelTug.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This firm has developed a method to add electrical power to the nose wheel of an aircraft - that means no <i>more</i> airport tugs are needed .  (Surprise) </span>Why is this good?Because airlines waste an inordinate amount of time coming and going from gates and waiting for the few tugs they have - especially when banks of flights come into hubs.An airline minute is worth anywhere between $100 to $150.A typical pushback takes up to 12 minutes.With Wheeltug this can be reduced by 40%.Take five minutes per aircraft over six flights per day and the airline has saved up to $4,500 in one day.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now imagine what American ( NASDAQ : AAL ) , Delta ( NYSE : DAL ) , United ( NYSE : UAL ) or Southwest ( NYSE : LUV ) <b>could</b> save over their fleets in a year .
