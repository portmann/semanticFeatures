class='textDiv'>After Farnborough Seeking Alpha To be honest there was a lot of action Judging by the trade press the recent Farnborough air show was quiet and unexciting As an attendee I can assure you that despite torrential rain that shut the event down on Monday afternoon and then the rain Tuesday and Wednesday there was a lot going on The highly visible deals aircraft orders were indeed less prominent this year compared to Paris last year or the previous Farnborough show But the news that emerged was very important Air Asia ordered Aneos This was described as necessary because of growing airport congestion in Asia where the smaller A was not able to move enough people per flight One might overlook an order for aircraft But at the message is being shouted Airport congestion is real and growing This news links to the decision by Airbus OTCPKEADSF to slow its A production due to slow orders If airport congestion is a thing then the need for larger aircraft like the A is real Despite slow sales now Airbus needs to keep the A line going just like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA has kept the line ticking over The market demand will catch up and the A is far from dead The news that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has modified its MAX is important By keeping the MAX wing and making the MAX a bit smaller to be called the MAX is very clever <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is focused on standardizing its production This drives down costs by pushing economies of scale The is a best seller and the MAX its successor also is selling better than any other MAX model By focusing on the core MAX and tweaking it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>essentially will get three models out of one MAX MAX and MAX This provides <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>with an ability to blanket the Airbus Aneo offering It should allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to thrash Airbus on pricing as it will probably have lower production costs Furthermore by revitalizing the MAX <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has admitted the seat market is important This is a nod to the threat from Bombardiers OTCQXBDRBF CSeries Bombardier fans should be pleased rather than feel nervous Besides these two important items the other crucial news from the show was best encapsulated by GEs NYSE GE David Joyce He noted that attendees should stop worrying about orders The industry is in the midst of delivering new aircraft over the next decade that will replace years of equipment Think about that for a moment It is a very important insight The follow on to this is to focus on what was happening in the halls at the show Not on the runway In the halls were a host of companies that were showing off clever ways to help drive down production costs and speed production Additive manufacturing is a killer app many of the firms coming along offering this are unknown and unlisted Small firms like Norsk Titanium are attracting attention Using titanium wire the firm can build up any part overnight Yes overnight I was shown a bracket that holds a galley wall If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>were to order this part by am today the part can be delivered by am tomorrow This takes JIT to a new level There are many small firms like this that will revolutionize the supply chain The Achilles Heel for the aerospace is the supply chain Firms like Norsk are fabulous opportunities for bigger firms to acquire the same for venture capitalists And there a number of them Another firm that has the potential to revolutionize the industry is WheelTug This firm has developed a method to add electrical power to the nose wheel of an aircraft that means no more airport tugs are needed Why is this good Because airlines waste an inordinate amount of time coming and going from gates and waiting for the few tugs they have especially when banks of flights come into hubs An airline minute is worth anywhere between to A typical pushback takes up to minutes With Wheeltug this can be reduced by Take five minutes per aircraft over six flights per day and the airline has saved up to in one day Now imagine what American NASDAQ AAL Delta NYSE DAL United NYSE UAL or Southwest NYSE LUV could save over their fleets in a year Throw in others like JetBlue NASDAQ JBLU and the host of other airlines and the numbers take on the proverbial hockey stick shape We are talking about billions of dollars So while the news from the show made for less exciting headlines there was plenty of very impressive stuff going on Commercial aerospace remains a remarkably healthy and exciting industry to follow We are likely to continue getting interesting news even as orders slow down Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and
