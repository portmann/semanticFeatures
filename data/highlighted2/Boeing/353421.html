( NYSE : PFE ) -LSB- 3 -RSB- ; Caterpillar Inc. -LSB- 4 -RSB- ; International Business Machines ( NYSE : IBM ) -LSB- 5 -RSB- ; Cisco Systems -LSB- 6 -RSB- ; Exxon Mobil Corp ( NYSE : XOM ) -LSB- 7 -RSB- ; Merck ( NYSE : MRK ) -LSB- 8 -RSB- Procter & Gamble -LSB- 9 -RSB- ; <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> ( NYSE : BA ) -LSB- 10 -RSB- . For March (as in January & February ) one slot changed the balance of the two lists.IndexArb put Procter & Gamble [9](NYSE: PG ) in the top ten.However Yahoo had the technology sector representative, Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC ) [10] in tenth to complete the dual, January IndexArb/Yahoo, top ten Dow dividend dog lists.Relative strength by yield for the top ten Dow industrial index stocks was graphed below.Ten periods of historic projected annual dividend history from $10,000 invested as $1k in each of the ten highest yielding stocks and the total single share price of those ten stocks created the data points for each period shown in blue for dividend and green for price.Actionable Conclusions: Dow Top Dogs Charged Through March per Both (1) IndexArb, and (2) Yahoo! IndexArb Dow dogs charged with projected annual dividend from $10k invested falling 5% after February.At the same time their single share price soared 6.6% to make the charge.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Yahoo also projected a charging scenario as their Dow dog line-up , showed a 5.4 % <i>lower</i> annual dividend from $ 10k invested as $ 1K in each of the top ten , while the aggregate single share price for those ten rose 7 % between March 1 and March 28 .  (Surprise) </span>The differences between the IndexArb and the Yahoo chart peaks and valleys over time have been caused by the movement of high price stocks with large dividends in and out of the top ten.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For example , in November the <b>variation</b> circled around a dogfight for ninth and tenth places .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Variations</b> in share price and annual dividends for General Electric Company at about $ 30 / $ 1 held price and Coca Cola Co. at $ 42 / $ 1.40 led to far <i>lower</i> prices on the IndexArb list .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The Yahoo list, however, was pumped with Wal-Mart Stores at $60 /$2 and McDonald's $114/$3.56.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So , the Yahoo price results were <i>higher</i> with dividends <i>lower</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In January , however , PG put it 's $ 50 <i>higher</i> share price in the tenth slot per IndexArb , while lowly INTC occupied the tenth position in the Yahoo scheme to make the price peak for IndexArb .  (Surprise) </span>Actionable Conclusion (3): Dow Dogs Are Overbought The Dow dogs overbought condition (in which aggregate single share price of the ten exceeded projected annual dividend from $1k invested in each of the ten) widened in January on the IndexArb chart while Yahoo Finance's graph narrowed the gap.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>wider</i> gap on the IndexArb graph was due to Procter & Gamble <i>higher</i> price and dividend in the mix instead of Intel place on the Yahoo chart .  (Surprise) </span>The January gap was estimated at $295 or 71.5% for IndexArb but $253 or 63% per Yahoo Finance.At the end of February both graphs widened: $327 or 80.75% on IndexArb but $284 or 71.3% per Yahoo Finance.March moved the IndexArb Dow gap to $396 or 102% while Yahoo had the Dow gap at $353 or 94%.Thus, the gap between these gaps continued to widen with the IndexArb charts in the lead.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The result is a <i>lower</i> average cost per dollar of annual dividend on IndexArb of $ 26.26 while the Yahoo list average cost per dollar of annual dividend was $ 26.81 .  (Surprise) </span>This gap between high share price and low dividend per $1k invested shows an overbought condition.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Meaning , no matter which chart you read , these are low <b>risk</b> and low opportunity Dow dogs .  (Uncertainty) </span>Until the Dow dividend from $10k invested as $1k in each of the top ten stocks exceeds the aggregate single share price of those stocks, market pressure continuing on the Dow augurs to shrink the gap.Actionable Conclusions: (4): Wall St. Wizards Forecast A 6.52% Average Upside & (5) A 6.58% Average Net Gain from All 30 Dow Dogs Through March 2017 All thirty dogs from the Dow 30 Industrials were graphed below to show relative strengths by dividend and price as of March 28, 2016 and those projected by analyst mean price target estimates to the same date in 2017.A hypothetical $1000 investment in each equity was divided by the current share price to find the number of shares purchased.The shares number was then multiplied by projected annual per share dividend amounts to find the dividend return.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Thereafter the analyst mean target price was used to gauge the stock price upsides and net gains including dividends <i>less</i> broker fees as of 2017 .  (Surprise) </span>Historic prices and actual dividends paid from $30,000 invested as $1k in each of the stocks and the aggregate single share prices of those thirty stocks divided by 3 created data points for 2016.Projections based on estimated increases in dividend amounts from $1000 invested in the thirty Dow stocks and aggregate one year analyst target share prices from Yahoo Finance divided by 3 created the 2017 data points green for price and blue for dividend.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Analysts reported by Yahoo projected an 11 % <i>lower</i> dividend from $ 10K invested as $ 1k in each dog of this group while aggregate single share price was projected to increase <b>nearly</b> 13.6 % in the coming year .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With price still projected <i>higher</i> than dividend , the analysts <b>predicted</b> Dow dogs extending their overbought condition one year out .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>(Personally, I think the Dow dogs are still due for a 25% to 30% market correction.)The number of analysts contributing to the mean target price estimate for each stock was noted in the next to the last column on the chart.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Three to nine analysts have historically provided the <i>more</i> accurate estimates .
