<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in December only to watch shares get crushed earlier this year The stock has since rebounded but does performance justify the price I recently decided to buy The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSE BA and got in back in December This was as the company raised its dividend and expanded its buyback Both very positive for shareholders But now that we are a quarter plus of the way through we need to consider where the stock is going There was some temporary weakness earlier in the year here as the stock dipped to under However it has since rebounded back comfortably over But is there more to be concern on the horizon To answer the question we need to review the companys performance but also discuss where the company is heading First off the just reported first quarter was decent The numbers beat estimates on the top line handily but missed on the bottom line The company reported revenue of billion in the quarter surpassing estimates by billion and rising yearoveryear Core earnings per share for the quarter were down yearoveryear to versus last year This was a miss of against analyst estimates But what went into these figures To address this lets take a look at some of the sector highlights to get a feel for the performance The Commercial Airplanes segment saw firstquarter revenue dip slightly to billion on lower delivery volume while operating margins was This is more than double Qs margins of The reason is that in Q there was the million pretax charge on the program and a million pretax charge on the KC program In total the program has won nearly firm orders for the MAX since launch And during the quarter the first flight of the MAX was achieved Commercial Airplanes booked net orders during the quarter Backlog remains strong with nearly airplanes valued at billion In the companys Defense Space Security segment revenue was a strong billion with an operating margin of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Military Aircraft performed exceptionally with firstquarter revenue increasing to billion primarily as a result of higher volumes particularly for F and C deliveries The company saw some strong contracts in the quarter as well The Network Space Systems division saw revenue of billion and its operating margin was The Global Services Support Division saw revenue increase to billion due to higher volume in Aircraft Modernization and Sustainment as well as training systems Further its operating margin increased to on strong performance Like with the Commercial Airplanes segment there is a significant backlog Backlog in this segment was billion of which represents orders from international customers Commenting on the quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>President and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg stated Higher yearoveryear deliveries of military aircraft and continued solid operating performance on core production programs drove revenue growth and strong cash flow for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in the first quarter This performance enabled our ongoing investments in new product innovation and in our people and the return of significant cash to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends Overall we are pleased with our performance trends and our outlook for the year remains positive On the tanker program we are making the investments necessary to meet our customer commitments deliver the initial production aircraft on schedule and transition the program into full production Our teams are focused intensely on delivering on our existing commitments including the production rampup associated with our large and diverse backlog accelerating progress on quality safety and productivity improvements company wide returning greater value to shareholders through profitable growth and investing in the future as we enter our second century in business I thought the performance this quarter strong despite the bottom line miss Further the company reaffirmed its outlook Revenue guidance is between and billion including commercial deliveries of between and Operating cash flow is expected to be approximately billion Core earnings per share guidance for is seen coming in at and which is higher than While the revenue guidance is lower than what was brought in during I will point out that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>revises guidance throughout the year and this is subject to change The outlook isnt poor but reflects the nature of the business What we care about is the longterm and thats where I am focused The company is very shareholder friendly During the quarter the company repurchased million shares for billion leaving billion remaining under the current repurchase authorization Further <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>also paid billion in dividends in the quarter reflecting an approximately increase in dividends per share compared to last year Should the stock pullback do some buying Note from the author Christopher F Davis has been a leading contributor with
