NYSEBA Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>uses per seat figures because it has a significantly higher capacity Total block fuel burn differs by maximum In part of this article I had a look at the impact the shortfall of the CMF LEAPB engines have on the fuel burn figures for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA MAX and concluded that the shortfall put <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in a very difficult position Not only because a shortfall might cost the manufacturer money but also because it will narrow a possible gap with the Airbus OTCPKEADSF OTCPKEADSY Aneo in Airbus advantage In this article I look at the shortfall on the Airbus Aneo and see how it compares to the Airbus Aceo as well as the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX Whereas the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX engines are coping with a shortfall the Airbus Aneo engines are coping with a shortfall of Figure Impact Airbus A on efficiencies compared to the Airbus A Source DhierinPerkash Bechai The Airbus Aneo features a higher weight due to the heavier engines and has increased aerodynamic and propulsive efficiency and should be able to carry passengers more For a nautical mile mission the Airbus Aneo has lower fuel consumption on per seat basis this translates to lower fuel costs compared to the Airbus Aceo When taking into account the shortfall the advantage on a nautical mile mission shrinks to for the trip fuel and for the fuel costs per seat Airbus claimed lower fuel cost my model indeed goes towards an advantage of on longer trips Figure Impact on fuel efficiency including shortfall compared to the Airbus A over a wider range Source DhierinPerkash Bechai The figure shows that the impact is not as severe as it is with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX which has a bigger shortfall It can be concluded that both manufacturers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus seem to be claiming very rosy figures for their aircraft Again looking at the claims made by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and comparing those to my model The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX will be more fuel efficient per seat compared to the A My model shows a advantage without performance shortfall with performance shortfall the advantage decreases to The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX will be more fuel efficient per seat compared to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>My model shows an advantage without performance shortfall with performance shortfall the advantage decreases to So the results are not very accurate and sketch a picture that is too rosy The Airbus Aneo will be more fuel efficient per seat compared to the Airbus A The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX will be more fuel efficient per seat compared to the Airbus Aneo There are some slides where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>claims an advantage as well My model shows a advantage without performance shortfall with performance shortfall for both airframes the advantage shrinks to Figure Impact on fuel efficiency including shortfall over a wider range Source DhierinPerkash Bechai The figure quite clearly shows that with the shortfall the gap between the Airbus Aneo and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX narrows quite a bit With the Airbus Aneo and ceo already selling better than the NG and the MAX <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>finds itself in a very difficult spot The shortfall for the Airbus Aneo should be compensated for quite easily with an improvement package Additionally the Aneo can be powered by Pratt and Whitney turbofans So if the shortfall persists customers can choose to use the PW engines instead of the CFM engines The Pratt and Whitney engines should be running slightly better than specified Having engine suppliers for an airframe can spark a competition that leads to higher efficiencies The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX has engine supplier so it does not have the advantage of competing engine suppliers Figure Impact on fuel efficiency including shortfall over a wider range Source DhierinPerkash Bechai One of the things that does not bode well for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>either is that Airbus is upping their seat counts as well The SpaceFlex cabin allows up to additional revenue generating seats <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>claims that seats is what the market wants if Airbus squeezes in an extra row of seats it has seats with a minimal decrease in comfort This narrows the advantage for the MAX to Now what has to be noted is the reason why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is using the per seat figures The reason is because the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a significantly higher seat count which yields high percentage advantage when looking at the per seat figures When looking at total block fuel burn the difference is less than a percent for short flights and grows to a little less than on longer flights The shortfall will limit the range of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX which will be problematic since the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX already has a lower range capability compared to the Airbus Aneo The lower range eventually can lower the accessible market for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The Airbus A having a wider cabin has much more to offer in terms of passenger comfort Additionally the Airbus A can be loaded with LD containers which allows for quicker loading The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX is one last squeeze out of the concept but it is not going to win market share from Airbus The base of the design are just too old to effectively compete with the Airbus A which is a design from the s while the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is designed in the s and based on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>that was designed a decade before that Editors
