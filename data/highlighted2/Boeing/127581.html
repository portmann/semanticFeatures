class='textDiv'>Facebook A Note Of Caution Facebook NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Facebook actually generates a fairly healthy operating yield and has some wonderful growth ahead of it Unfortunately that isnt news and the shares are already priced for perfection Thats always a dangerous sign We conduct a comparative analysis between Facebook and the seven other businesses you could buy for its market capitalization Facebook costs more and offers less than other freely available investments We consider it axiomatic that at the wrong price even a wonderful company can be a terrible investment At some point no matter what the growth characteristics of the underlying business the stock that supposedly represents the fortunes of that business will be guaranteed to lose money We want to examine shares of Facebook NASDAQ FB with these principles in mind Well try to work out whether it has more upside than downside from these levels Well do that by looking at the financials of the company Well talk briefly about the optimism surrounding the name and well conclude with a what else could you buy analysis The first thing we want to do with any business is review its operating history We want to work out how much profit the company is making after tax relative to the amount of capital invested to generate that profit Working this out provides us an earnings yield which we can then compare to the earnings yields of other businesses Facebook has generated a relatively healthy earnings yield of just shy of over the most recent four quarters which we consider impressive in light of the capital invested here Now obviously this is a backward looking analysis The point isnt to offer a history lesson about the recent performance of this company The point of these sorts of analyses is to perform a gap analysis Presumably an investor knows for themselves what sort of operational yield they require They should know how much money a business should spin off before they consider investing in it In our case we require a operating yield on a business with these risks assuming the risk free rate is about The value of this backward looking exercise for us is to see by how much a given company must grow before its investment worthy Since the operating yield at Facebook is below that hurdle though still quite respectable we have to say the companys not quite there yet In addition to the underlying business we need to review the behavior of the surrogate for the business the stock Specifically we concern ourselves a great deal with the optimism surrounding a name because optimistic forecasts can be terrible for investors The reason for this is that they set up the conditions for limited upside and massive downside If the market is overly optimistic about a name great expectations are already baked in to the price If those expectations are met ie if Facebook executes near perfectly then the shares may not move much higher as expectations would simply have been met If as is more likely the company stumbles at some point as all companies dotheyre run by humans and therefore not perfect many investors will switch polarity and start to question their optimistic worldview This typically leads to predictable results for the share price No one can know if Facebook will execute perfectly and were amused by people who make bold statements about what will transpire We can however spot when others are pricing shares for perfection This is one of those times Specifically at the moment the PE at Facebook is and the forward PE is a still expensive Holding all else equal then the market is forecasting Facebook to grow its earnings at a CAGR of This is a very optimistic forecast for two reasons First the optimism may not be warranted in light of the continued popularity of Youtube as a video platform As video content creators ourselves with a decent sized subscriber base we can personally attest to the fact that we arent making plans to build content for Facebook anytime soon Second the optimism seems misplaced in light of the most recent trends in Facebooks revenue and earnings We owe a huge debt of gratitude to a seasoned stockbroker who shared a relative value presentation with us in the Spring of It was a single powerpoint slide divided in two On one side were three companies AOLCOM Yahoo and Ebay On the other side were Kodak Sears CAT Kmart Nike American Airlines <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Aetna Barnes and Noble Alcoa and Marriott You could buy the technology high fliers for billion or you could buy the more traditional businesses many of which have been lackluster since but many of which have done very well for billion The point was that relative valuation matters We sold our expensive stuff that day and have never really looked back As weve said many times on this forum and elsewhere to the detriment of our social lives investing is at heart a relativistic process Investors need to decide whether to buy a government bond or a REIT Or whether they should buy a retail outlet or a high flying growth company The opportunity costs are always present If we buy X we forego Y Its with this in mind that we want to do a comparative analysis between Facebook and other companies Were going to pick an industry that we believe has high growth prospects and exceedingly high barriers to entry railroads and the Bank of Montreal We chose railroads because they have excellent growth characteristics also Over the past years the average rail has grown earnings at a CAGR of just shy of With continued demographic improvements in the United States some double digit rate of growth is expected to continue Thus we believe a comparison between Facebook and Class I rail is more of an apples to apples comparison really a growth to growth comparison than they might at first appear At the moment the market capitalization of Facebook is billion For comparative purposes the chart below outlines the market caps of the six publicly traded Class I railroads and the Bank of Montreal Source Gurufocus Company financials When we compare what investors are getting for their Facebook market capitalization to what else they could do with that money we see some interesting disconnects For example The average PE excluding Facebook is of that of Facebook The average yield is as opposed to Facebooks zero Average return on equity is about greater with the rails and the bank than at Facebook The debt levels at the rails and the bank are much higher than Facebooks highlighting that the one relatively bright spot at Facebook is its capital structure Earnings growth at Facebook is about twice that of the average growth rate of the old world companies over the past year The question lingers about how much longer this growth can be sustained If an investor buys Facebook they receive billion of net income If they buy the other companies they received billion of net income times greater If an investor buys Facebook they receive about billion of free cash flow If they buy the basked of other businesses they receive about billion of free cash flow This is startling to us in light of the high capital expenditures needed in railroads Thus the group of rails for which there are insurmountable barriers to entry and for which there are attractive growth prospects trade for a lower multiple and have much higher net income returns Given the relativistic nature of investing someone who wants to maximize their returns the ultimate source of sustainable shareholder wealth and minimize their risks should sell Facebook and buy every Class I railroad Facebook is actually generating a fairly decent operating yield The underlying business is sound and is going to continue on some robust growth path with occasional inevitable missteps The problem is that this isnt news and this growth has already been baked into the price Thus if the company executes well the upside may very well be muted If the company makes an understandable slip up shares will react predictably and negatively Also when reviewing other growth investments its obvious that much more could be had for much less The shares may continue to rise in price but this should in no way suggest that the investment has gotten any better or any less likely to disappoint over a longer time horizon If you own Facebook we recommend selling at these levels and buying higher returning less expensive names If you were considering buying Facebook we recommend avoiding it Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any
