(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The point was that relative valuation matters.We sold our expensive stuff that day and have never really looked back.As we've said many times on this forum (and elsewhere, to the detriment of our social lives), investing is at heart a relativistic process.Investors need to decide whether to buy a government bond or a REIT.Or whether they should buy a retail outlet or a high flying growth company.The opportunity costs are always present.If we buy X, we forego Y. It's with this in mind that we want to do a comparative analysis between Facebook and other companies.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We 're going to pick an industry that we <b>believe</b> has high growth prospects and exceedingly high barriers to entry : railroads and the Bank of Montreal .  (Uncertainty) </span>We chose railroads because they have excellent growth characteristics also.Over the past 10 years, the average rail has grown earnings at a CAGR of just shy of 15%.With continued demographic improvements in the United States, some double digit rate of growth is expected to continue.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Thus , we believe a comparison between Facebook and Class I rail is <i>more</i> of an `` apples to apples '' comparison ( really a `` growth to growth '' comparison ) than they might at first <b>appear</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>At the moment, the market capitalization of Facebook is ~$276 billion.For comparative purposes, the chart below outlines the market caps of the six publicly traded Class I railroads and the Bank of Montreal.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Source : Gurufocus , Company financials When we compare what investors are getting for their Facebook market capitalization to what else they <b>could</b> do with that money , we see some interesting disconnects .  (Uncertainty) </span>For example: The average PE (excluding Facebook) is ~18% of that of Facebook.The average yield is 2.18%, as opposed to Facebook's zero.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Average return on equity is about 74 % <i>greater</i> with the rails and the bank than at Facebook .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The debt levels at the rails and the bank are much <i>higher</i> than Facebook 's , highlighting that the one relatively bright spot at Facebook is its capital structure .  (Surprise) </span>Earnings growth at Facebook is about twice that of the average growth rate of the "old world" companies over the past year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The question lingers about how much <i>longer</i> this growth can be sustained .  (Surprise) </span>If an investor buys Facebook, they receive $2.94 billion of net income.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If they buy the other companies , they received ~ $ 17.4 billion of net income ( ~ 6 times <i>greater</i> ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>If an investor buys Facebook, they receive about $3.6 billion of free cash flow.If they buy the basked of other businesses, they receive about $12.835 billion of free cash flow.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is <b>startling</b> to us in light of the high capital expenditures needed in railroads .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Thus , the group of rails ( for which there are insurmountable barriers to entry ) and for which there are attractive growth prospects , trade for a <i>lower</i> multiple and have much <i>higher</i> net income returns .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given the relativistic nature of investing , someone who wants to maximize their returns ( the ultimate source of sustainable shareholder wealth ) and minimize their <b>risks</b> should sell Facebook and buy every Class I railroad .  (Uncertainty) </span>Facebook is actually generating a fairly decent operating yield.The underlying business is sound and is going to continue on some robust growth path (with occasional, inevitable missteps).The problem is that this isn't news and this growth has already been baked into the price.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Thus , if the company executes well , the upside <b>may</b> very well be muted .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the company makes an understandable slip up , shares will react <b>predictably</b> and negatively .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Also , when reviewing other growth investments , it 's obvious that much <i>more</i> <b>could</b> be had for much <i>less</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The shares may continue to rise in price , but this should in no way <b>suggest</b> that the investment has gotten any <i>better</i> , or any <i>less</i> likely to <b>disappoint</b> over a <i>longer</i> time horizon .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If you own Facebook , we recommend selling at these levels and buying <i>higher</i> returning , <i>less</i> expensive names .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you were considering buying Facebook , we recommend avoiding it .
