industrial stocks according to a winning ranking system Explanation and backtesting of the ValueSheet ranking system Description and a buy recommendation for the secondranked stock of the system Spirit AeroSystems A Ranking system sorts stocks from best to worst based on a set of weighted factors Portfolio has a ranking system which allows the user to create complex formulas according to many different criteria They also have highly useful several groups of prebuilt ranking systems I used one of them the ValueSheet in this article The ValueSheet ranking system is quite complex and it is taking into account many factors like valuation ratios growth rates profitability ratios financial strength asset utilization technical rank industry rank and industry leadership as shown in Portfolios chart below In order to find out how such a ranking formula would have performed during the last years I ran a backtest which is available by the Portfolios screener For the backtest I took all the stocks in the Portfolios database The backtest results are shown in the chart below For the backtest I divided the companies into twenty groups according to their ranking The chart clearly shows that the average annual return has a very significant positive correlation to the ValueSheet rank The highest ranked group with the ranking score of which is shown by the light blue column in the chart has given by far the best return an average annual return of about while the average annual return of the SP index during the same period was about the red column at the left part of the
