style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is seen strong demand as a result of population growth in Asia especially While the tanker issue hit EPS fairly hard it looks like a temporary issue While there are few certainties in global macroeconomics there is one demographic trend on which we can pretty much count in Asia especially it is likely that population growth will continue This benefits a large number of industries including transportation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA has shown its ability to effectively capitalize on this demographic trend and is selling lots of airplanes to customers across the continent Combined with quite reasonable multiples the stock looks like it offers a lot of value at the moment especially to investors looking for exposure to Asian population growth A brief look at Boeings press releases over the last few months shows where demand for its airplanes is coming from Countries like Korea Thailand and China especially are all scaling up purchases of airplanes with the fuelefficient especially seeing very strong demand on domestic as well as international routes According to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Chinese demand alone could top trillion This strong demand is translating into healthy and sustainable top line growth for the American plane maker Between and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>saw revenue increase by around and net income rise by nearly Whereas other big US industrial firms like Caterpillar are currently struggling with slowing demand as a result of weakness in commodity markets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>seems to be so far unaffected by the Chinese slowdown For its latest report backlogs remained solid at around billion on commercial orders although the figure was down a bit compared to the beginning of the quarter Revenue continued to march higher up to a record high of billion and beating the analyst consensus Meanwhile last quarters negative million free cash flow was bent into a positive billion However not all was rosy in terms of bottom line performance Q GAAP EPS and adjusted EPS fell by and respectively for the period largely as a result of a million or per share charge related to the KC tanker After edging out Europes Airbus for the contract the program ran into considerably higher than expected costs as things like wiring and fuel systems proved problematic for the new air force tanker This led <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to also adjust its guidance for the year down now expecting to make between and per share versus a previous range of to per share Operating margin is now seen at around versus a previous Still this looks like a temporary problem and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>still intends to make about billion off the new tanker from US air force demand around billion from international demand At the moment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>trades at times trailing earnings considerably lower than the industry average as well as the sector average according to Reuters It also sits fairly comfortably between its year PE high of and the low of The pricetosales paints a similar picture fairly low at and certainly lower than a industry average Meanwhile the forward PE of looks enticing indeed While the PEG ratio of is slightly higher than I would like to see it it is again below that of competitors while the stock generally offers a decent dividend yield currently at at a payout ratio In summary <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>looks fairly inexpensive at the moment compared to the continued growth we can expect as a result of population growth in Asia <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is benefiting from an expanding population in Asia especially which is driving demand for transportation China alone might be good for trillion in business The companys model especially is being snapped up at a solid rate and we can expect this trend to continue as population growth in many parts of the continent ticks higher Although the bottom line took a hit as a result of charges related to the companys new tanker program this seems like a temporary issue and the stocks valuation leaves more room for upside on multiple
