</span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has reported first quarter fiscal results that missed on top line expectations but beat on the bottom line <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares have sold off by a small margin as a result The companys growth is however good when viewed against its recent historical performance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA is one of the latest companies to report results during the current earnings season Like many companies in the SP that have reported their first quarter results <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was a mixed bag as well The worlds largest aerospace company reported revenue of billion representing an encouraging yearonyear growth which nonetheless failed to meet analysts expectations of billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>however was able to handily beat on bottom line expectations by posting net income of billion or EPS of representing a healthy growth of and topping analysts expectations for EPS by revenue growth for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is actually a good result when you consider that just a year ago top line growth had plunged to as low as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>results continued being a tale of two diametrically opposed segments as usual with the companys commercial airplane segment performing well by growing both revenue and earnings while the defense segment recorded deep slides on both counts due to the ongoing defense budget cuts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said that its good overall results were mainly driven by a surge in new aircraft deliveriesBoeing fulfilled orders for airliners during the quarter compared to during last years comparable quarter Major airlines have been increasing their aircraft orders as they continue to realize record profits helped by strong fuel savings occasioned by the prevailing low oil prices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>investors seemed rather undecided on what to make of the results and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>stock slid after the earnings call The shares are nevertheless still up yeartodate compared to the SP which is up a mere There are a few reasons however that persuade me to believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is set to deliver even more impressive results in the coming quarters namely Even though oil prices have risen by more than bbl over the last days this appears to be just another sympathy rebound and they are facing severe resistance around their current bbl level meaning a full recovery might take much longer Boeings lossmaking flagship program booked another large loss of million but is expected to narrow down its losses and eventually turn cashpositive in Boeings order backlog swelled to billion from billion last quarter which gives the company enough business to last more than years at current production rates with twothirds of deliveries coming from its profitable jets during the quarter The gradually lessening impact of the companys underperforming defense segment One of the biggest reasons most major airlines are doing so well and in turn ordering more airplanes can be chalked up to oil prices which have remained depressed for what seems like an eternity now There is a recent article that I published on Seeking Alpha wherein I made the argument that oil prices are likely to fully recover with time I however did not offer any concrete timelines of when a full recovery is possible By a full recovery I mean prices at or above the year precrisis average of around bbl Oil prices have shot up by nearly over the last days and are currently hovering around bbl but facing severe resistance at that level Unless the oil markets throw us a curve ball maybe in the form of a surge in Iranian oil exports which is does not seem very likely at the moment then my estimates are that we are not likely to see a full recovery before months are over Some analysts are even skeptical that we shall ever see a full recovery before five years are over Oil expenses account for about of the operating expenses of many major airlines With prices cut in half the savings can be huge indeed and these mostly trickle to these companies bottom lines Even with oil prices around bbl an average airline with an unhedged fuel position would still be able to enjoy cost savings of around compared to what it would pay with oil around bblbbl with an almost similar margin expansion All those extra billions that would have otherwise been spent paying for oil are now available for buying more of Boeings fuelefficient airliners which is good business for the company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been investing a lot of money in widebody airplanes such as its This seems like a strategic decision because the company estimates that close to a quarter of the airplanes to be delivered over the next two decades will be widebodied planes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>enjoys a significant advantage over archrival Airbus in the widebody segment where it expects to dominate the market due to its better widebody airplane portfolio But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been booking huge losses in its program with losses clocking in at million during the last quarter This is perhaps because the company has been amortizing its huge development costs over several years The company however said during its latest earnings call that losses from the segment will contract considerably during the remaining quarters of the year with the segment finally turning cash positive in Even at breakeven point that would mean a healthy bump on Boeings net income assuming it holds steady at last quarters reading In other words we can expect to see a significant growth in the companys net income as the quarters roll on Boeings order backlog has continued to swell and currently sits just shy of half a trillion dollarsworth of business Those are enough orders to keep the companys production plants busy for not less than years at current production run rates The good thing is that a lot of those new orders are for its popular workhorse which is already solidly profitable Boeings defense segment has acted as major drag on the companys top and bottom line growth for a long time During the quarter the companys commercial aircraft segment managed to grow revenue and earnings by and respectively In contrast Boeings defense segment recorded a revenue growth of and earnings growth of This is a trend that has been ongoing for quite a few years and does not seem about to reverse The good thing however is that Boeings commercial aircraft segment is twice as large as the defense segment contributing two thirds of revenue and profit The decline in the defense segment appears to have hit a plateau and might continue at the current rate going forward Assuming that the scenario unfolds this way the segment will fall below of the companys revenue in about years at which level its negative effect on overall growth will be much less felt than the current situation Investors seem to have been alarmed a bit by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>failing to meet top line expectations But the companys results are actually good when viewed against its recent history and are moving in the right direction Most of the tailwinds that have been fueling this growth remain intact which provides the company with good growth runways for the coming quarters and years
