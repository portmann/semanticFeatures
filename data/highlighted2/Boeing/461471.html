Alpha Boeings Commercial Airplanes department has higher revenues Using the unitcost method the Airbus Commercial Airplanes department is running more efficiently As a writer of aerospace articles focusing on the duopoly between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA and Airbus OTCPKEADSF I often hear how one company is selling planes at huge discounts at losses while the other jet maker is using some suspicious accounting method People slightly familiar with the duopoly and financial statements know which statement can be connected to the which jet maker From Airbus it is often said that they aggressively discount their aircraft to win market share About <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>it is often said that the company uses orthodox accounting methods to increase profits In this article I will focus on the profit and revenues per delivered commercial aircraft to see which company brings its shareholder more profit and which jet maker is operating more efficiently To get an idea of which company manages to book more profits on its commercial aircraft department I will use a fairly simple approach I will look at the revenues profits over the past years the number of deliveries and the per airframe figures Additionally I will look at the figures from the financial statements of each jet maker Figure Annual Revenue Airbus Commercial Aircraft Source wwwAeroAnalysisnet Figure shows that revenue of the commercial aircraft department has increased from B in to B in This is equivalent to an annual growth rate of The accumulated revenues over the past years total B Figure Annual Profits Airbus Commercial Aircraft Source AeroAnalysisnet Figure shows that profit of the commercial aircraft department has increased from B in to B in This is equivalent to an annual growth rate of The accumulated profits over the past years is B One thing that can be calculated from the revenue and profit figures is the margin The margin increased from in to in Measured over the past years the margin figure was Using these figures we can see how the revenues and profits per airframe developed over the past few years Table Revenue and profit per airframe for Airbus What can be seen is that the revenue per airframe has increased from million to in This increase in per airframe revenue is caused by a change in delivery mix for the Airbus A which is increasingly focused on the Airbus A A similar thing occurred on the Airbus A program where Airbus increased deliveries of the bigger A model Additionally the Airbus A entered service which positively impacted revenue per airframe Over the past years the average revenue per airframe has been million Profit per airframe jumped from million in to Prospectively Airbus has applied an accounting method similar to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>for the early As that are delivered to customers Without this change in accounting method the profit per airframe would have fallen to million in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>reports its profit according to the program accounting method The company however does also provide the unit accounting results which is useful if you want to make an applestoapples comparison Figure Annual Revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Commercial Aircraft Source AeroAnalysisnet Figure shows that revenue of the commercial aircraft department has increased from B in to B in This is equivalent to an annual growth rate of The accumulated revenues over the past years is B Figure Annual Profits <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Commercial Aircraft Source AeroAnalysisnet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>uses the program accounting method which heavily skews the results Although I think it is fair to use program accounting I will be using the unitcost accounting figures primarily For convenience I will be mentioning the program accounting figures as well Using the unitcost accounting figures profit has swung from a negative B to a positive B Using the program accounting method profit has swung from B to B peaking at B Using the unitcost accounting figures the margin increased from in to in These figures were and respectively for the program accounting method Measured over the past years the margin figure was Using these figures we can see how the revenues and profits per airframe developed over the past few years Table Revenue and profit per airframe for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>What can be seen is that the revenue per airframe increased from million to million reflecting a bigger share for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in the delivery mix At the same time the highly dilutive impact of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>production can be seen as it completed dragged <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>profits per airframe into the negative for the past few years In terms of total revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a firm lead Over the past years it realized a revenue of B versus B for Airbus which is higher or almost million per airframe In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>booked a revenue of B compared to B for Airbus So in terms of revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is still having a lead However with an announced cut on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program and a rate increase on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program to compensate for the lower revenue Airbus is likely to close the gap a bit in the coming years as it ramps up A production rates and Airbus A production matures For the comparison of the profit figures I think it is fair to use the unitcost method At the same time it needs to be noted that Airbus is using an accounting method similar to Boeings program accounting for the first Airbus A deliveries Profit booked by Airbus over the last years equals B If we subtract the Airbus A accounting we get a profit of B or million per airframe Boeings unit cost accounting method gives a loss of B or million per delivered airframe So in terms of absolute profit and profit per airframe Airbus has been leading over the past few years In Airbus booked a profit of B reduced by the Airbus A accounting this is B <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>booked a profit of B On a per unit basis this is equivalent to million for Airbus and million for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>What can be concluded is that the actual profit figures for are pretty close but Airbus needs less airframes to realize this profit The margin for the past years for Airbus was versus for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>In this was for Airbus and for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>What can be concluded is that Airbus indeed has a lower revenue per airframe but this also has to do with the jet makers production being focused on narrow body aircraft I consider the role of competitive pricing to win market share to be less reflected in the companys financial statements than some believe On the other hand it can be confirmed that Airbus has a more profitable commercial aircraft department What needs to be noted is that although some might not like Boeings accounting method it brings much more stability to the companys share price performance Airbus accounting method forces the company to take charges when the company is experiencing difficulties due to its relatively small block size <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>on the other hand gives itself more space to recoup costs While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is lagging in terms of profit I think its unitcost results have shown that the company is heading in the right direction Additionally the introduction of new production methods that require less manpower should help the jet maker in improving its margins If executed wisely both jet makers should be able to expand margins However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could be facing a big charge on the longer term while Airbus could be facing several charges if maturing process of the Airbus A slows down If you would like to receive updates for my upcoming articles please click the Follow text at the top of this page next to my
