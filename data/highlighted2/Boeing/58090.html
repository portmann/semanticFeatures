I don't buy that argument because of the reaffirmed cash flow guidance that I just mentioned and because cash flows are notoriously lumpy.The theory is that BA pulled some positive FCF into Q4 but even if it did, who cares?Who cares how FCF is distributed throughout the year?The only thing that matters is that BA is producing cash, and while I agree that management needs to deliver FCF in Q2, it's not a reason to dump the stock.Apart from all of the noise surrounding Q1, BA is still a terrific dividend growth story.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company has <b>nearly</b> doubled its payout in just the last two years , the product of two massive consecutive raises on an already decent payout .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>BA has made capital returns a priority at this point and given that it is still paying out a very low percentage of its FCF , it <b>could</b> continue to make double digit raises for a long time .  (Uncertainty) </span>That in itself is a very nice reason to own the stock, irrespective of the messy quarter.In addition to that, I really like the way the chart is setting up for a long position.I mentioned BA was in a tight trading range in 2014 with the top at $135; after BA broke over that line, it shot straight up to $157.That powerful move reset the stock's former range as a support, so now I think it would take a lot to see BA dip below $135.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That 's just a few dollars <i>lower</i> from here , so I feel like the margin of safety is great right now for a long position .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And at only 15.2 times forward earnings with 12 % + <b>predicted</b> EPS growth annually , there are few stocks in the market today that are <i>cheaper</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>BA has a very nice blend of fundamental strength, a favorable chart setup, a large and growing yield, and a cheap valuation.In fact, there really isn't much I don't like right now for BA.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Q2 will be very interesting to see if the RBC analyst was right or not , but for now , I trust management will right the ship .  (Uncertainty) </span>After all, with the current order backlog at five years' worth of revenue, how bad can things really be?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Source : <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> Just Keeps On Delivering Disclosure : The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned , but <b>may</b> initiate a long position in BA over the next 72 hours .
