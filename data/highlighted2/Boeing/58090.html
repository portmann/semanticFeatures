sharply since the middle of April but has rebounded in recent days The company continues to see excitement from the analyst community which keeps upgrading its EPS growth forecast I think BA will continue to see higher EPS and that its times forward earnings multiple is far too low <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA has been on a wild ride in the past few months Since the year began the stock has risen from below to more than and has since sold off to trade for as I write this The erratic action is something shareholders have certainly lamented but the fact remains that BA remains solidly higher after breaking out from its rather tight range formed in Based on the conflicting signals from the chart a strong breakout but a robust selloff Ill take a look at BAs fundamentals and valuation to see if the stock is still cheap To do this Ill use a DCFtype model you can read more about here The model uses several inputs including earnings estimates which Ive borrowed from Yahoo dividends which Ive estimated to grow at annually and a discount rate which Ive set at the year Treasury rate plus a risk premium of The estimated fair value of BAs shares given the models inputs is about or higher than where the shares trade today Thats a very wide margin so lets take a look at the company a bit more closely to see if that is a reasonable target Last time I visited <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>the stock was trading for within the incredibly tight range BA formed during At the time I quoted strength in orders and BAs cheap valuation as reasons to be long That call worked out as BA shot up to early in but since that time BA has experienced a pretty nasty selloff Whats interesting is that since that time EPS estimates have shot up for BA and caused the present value of its future earnings stream to inflate BAs mediumterm growth rate for EPS is now expected to be about up from just over back in December At the time I mentioned EPS estimates had been moving up and that trend has continued strongly for the past six months BAs fundamental strength has been exciting analysts and that is part of the reason why the stock had such a strong start to the year BA reported earnings a few weeks ago and it was greeted by investors with a resounding thud The stock began selling off from the day of earnings and hasnt looked back Revenue was light of the target by but EPS came in with a very strong beat Its true that margins slipped for some lines of business but revenue generation was strong throughout the company Boosting revenue by is terrific and should be applauded despite the margins While I wouldnt call it a great quarter it was fine and it seems the selloff that has resulted is a little harsh The company reaffirmed its fullyear guidance so management must believe the business will pick up momentum as we move throughout the rest of the year I always trust management guidance until I have a strong reason not to because one of the biggest mistakes a management team can make is to put targets out there for themselves and then miss them I have to think that the reaffirmed guidance is a strong sign that management is confident One thing Ill also mention is that RBCs analyst said Boeings cash generation for the quarter is very disconcerting and a reason for the stock to selloff I dont buy that argument because of the reaffirmed cash flow guidance that I just mentioned and because cash flows are notoriously lumpy The theory is that BA pulled some positive FCF into Q but even if it did who cares Who cares how FCF is distributed throughout the year The only thing that matters is that BA is producing cash and while I agree that management needs to deliver FCF in Q its not a reason to dump the stock Apart from all of the noise surrounding Q BA is still a terrific dividend growth story The company has nearly doubled its payout in just the last two years the product of two massive consecutive raises on an already decent payout BA has made capital returns a priority at this point and given that it is still paying out a very low percentage of its FCF it could continue to make double digit raises for a long time That in itself is a very nice reason to own the stock irrespective of the messy quarter In addition to that I really like the way the chart is setting up for a long position I mentioned BA was in a tight trading range in with the top at after BA broke over that line it shot straight up to That powerful move reset the stocks former range as a support so now I think it would take a lot to see BA dip below Thats just a few dollars lower from here so I feel like the margin of safety is great right now for a long position And at only times forward earnings with predicted EPS growth annually there are few stocks in the market today that are cheaper BA has a very nice blend of fundamental strength a favorable chart setup a large and growing yield and a cheap valuation In fact there really isnt much I dont like right now for BA Q will be very interesting to see if the RBC analyst was right or not but for now I trust management will right the ship After all with the current order backlog at five years worth of revenue how bad can things really be Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Just Keeps On Delivering Disclosure
