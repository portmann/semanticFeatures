NYSEBA Seeking Alpha As anticipated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>posted a strong cash flow As I expected earnings were strong despite the charge on the tanker program <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA reported Q earnings before the opening bell on nd of July The company booked strong results despite the KC Tanker charge weighing on earnings It was the first presentation of results under lead of Dennis Muilenberg <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a history of beating analyst estimates and managed to top analyst estimates yet again Boeings history of topping the consensus can partly be attributed to the fact that the companys guidance is very conservative Any other company probably would see shares tumbling on a light guidance but this does not count for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as investors and analysts already are aware of Boeings history of giving a conservative guidance Boeings EPS came in quite strong topping the estimate of by or I normally do not attach a lot of value to EPS as a measure of Boeings success but given the fact that the company was forced to acknowledge a charge on the KC tanker and still managed to top estimates I do think the Q EPS shows Boeings strength Figure Revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Q Source AeroAnalysis Whereas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>missed estimates on revenue during the first quarter it beat estimates by in the second quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>stocks headed higher premarket as the company beat estimates but beating estimates was not the only reason for the stock to head higher Revenue increased by on higher deliveries Earnings were lower reflecting the charge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had to take on the KC tanker program The operating margin decreased by pts The operating cash flow came in strong with an increase yearoveryear while the free cash flow almost doubled <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>taught its investors to pay more attention to the free cash flow and managed to deliver a satisfying cash flow in this quarter Figure Relative results <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Q Source AeroAnalysis One of the things that moves <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>share prices up or down is the cash flow Last quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>showed a very disappointing free cash flow but back then I already noted that the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>reaffirmed its guidance was a strong sign <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aims for an operating cash flow in excess of bn Figure shows the free cash flow and operating cash flow with the minimum average requirement to meet the annual target Figure Cash flow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Q Source AeroAnalysis As can be seen in Figure the cash flow increased significantly for the operating as well as the free cash flow In order to meet the target of an operating cash flow in excess of bn <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>needs at least bn in cash flow per quarter Given the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>mostly posts strong results and cash flow in the last quarter of the year I expect that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will be able to meet its cash flow target Whereas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>reaffirmed its guidance in the Q presentation of financial results it adjusted the full year guidance during the Q presentation to reflect strong performance and incorporate the impact of the charge on the tanker program <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>foresees a revenue of bn and still expects an operating cash flow in excess of bn The EPS updated guidance GAAP and nonGAAP have been decreased by while margins for the Commercial department are lowered by pts and pts for the Defense and Space unit As expected quarter results were strong despite the half billion dollars charge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was forced to take As I previously anticipated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>posted a strong cash flow The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>still has a dilutive impact on earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is still on track to meet its cash flow targets Source Strong Q Results For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>But KC Tanker
