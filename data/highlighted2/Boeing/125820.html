Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F is the main workhorse on the cargo market Order from FedEx gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>work for another years On the st of July FedEx Express a fully owned subsidiary of FedEx Corp NYSE FDX ordered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F aircraft Two years ago I wrote an article in which I looked at the fleet renewal for cargo airlines In the article I marked <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA and FedEx Express as the winners <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a lot to offer on the cargo market while FedEx already started renewing their fleet prior to demand for air cargo increasing again In the article I also stated that FedEx would likely order the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Eventually FedEx preferred the capacity and fuel efficiency of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>over the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>despite the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>being a cheaper alternative From until the st of July FedEx ordered only F airframes leaving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>waiting for an almost certain mega order Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F Render Source boeingcom The first rumors about a mega order from FedEx arose at the beginning of July The initial rumor was that FedEx might also order up to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F aircraft next to ordering <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F This deal would have a catalogue value of bn In the days after another rumor arose namely that it would order at least <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F aircraft with a value of bn Eventually <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>received an order for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Fs with purchase rights for another If the purchase rights will be fully exercised the order is worth over bn at list prices and approximately bn after discounts Besides the value of the order <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will be particularly pleased with the order for the following reasons The order shows customer preference for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F is helping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in expanding market share on the air cargo market The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F is being used as replacement for older Airbus OTCPK EADSF freighters while the Airbus AF was being outsold at a ratio before the FedEx order and now is being outsold at a ratio The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F is beating todays competition and replacing yesterdays aircraft None of the top freighter airlines operate the Airbus AF Including orders and replacement I estimated that Boeings share will rise to and market share for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F will rise to Additionally it has to be noted that FedEx Express might need another orders to replace all of the older aircraft So it is very likely that FedEx will use its purchase rights for another aircraft The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>backlog started shrinking prior to the FedEx order with just years of production left Adding the orders placed by FedEx to the orders in backlog <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>now has the production line filled for almost years at a production rate of aircraft per month If FedEx exercises the purchase rights for an additional airframes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has its production slots filled up all the way until Q The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F is replacing older Airbus and McDonnell Douglas aircraft The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F is outselling the Airbus AF at a ratio <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>potentially has its production line for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>filled up until The order placed by FedEx is merely to replace old fleet members additional orders can be expected to grow fleets to cope with increasing demand The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F is aiding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in expanding its market share on the freighter market With the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is positioned very well on the
