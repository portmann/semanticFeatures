have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in BA over the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>sold off heavily after Q results despite beating estimates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA reported fourth quarter and full year results which beat estimates this week yet the companys shares sold off heavily due to lower than expected guidance numbers I believe this selloff in addition to the share price weakness we have seen over the last months provides a great buying opportunity for this income stock with a defensive profile <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>reported fourth quarter revenues of billion beating estimates slightly which means a yoy decline of three and a half percent Earnings per share came in at which beat estimates by or more than twenty percent Full year revenues came in at billion which is a company record whilst full year earnings per share totaled Boeings backlog at the end of the year stood at billion net orders for the year totaled billion Theoretically speaking <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could keep revenues at the current level for five years without any new orders over that time frame One of the best things about Boeings fourth quarter and FY was the companys vast cash generation During the fourth quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>generated operating cash flows of billion operating cash flows for the full year totaled billion This gives the company a price to cash flow ratio of just and it shows the companys growing ability to generate huge cash flows the fourth quarters annualized cash flow would total billion an even bigger amount than the full year number which was up six percent over the prior year Boeings cash uses include capital expenditures which totaled million in the fourth quarter and billion in This leaves billion as free cash flow for the fourth quarter and billion in free cash flow for the year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has returned billion to shareholders via share repurchases shrinking the share count by million shares or seven percent and also paid out dividends totaling billion This means Boeings shareholder returns came in at billion which was billion higher than the companys free cash flow number this amount has been financed by shrinking the companys cash position from billion to billion and issuing new debt long term debt stood at billion at the end of the quarter which was up million yoy but is still pretty low at less than one years operating cash flows I rate Boeings cash returns to shareholders as very attractive the dividend which was increased by twenty percent in December yields percent which is a lot higher than the broad markets average of percent Boeings share repurchases lead to a substantially shrinking share count which in turn means that each of Boeings shares represents a higher amount of the companys net income earnings per share are increasing Over the last two years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has bought back ten percent of the companys outstanding shares buyback activity has reached a high in As the share price is rather low right now as well as the valuation Boeings share repurchases are very effective at the current level With a buyback pace of billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is able to reduce the share count by eight and a half percent each year this alone is good enough for earnings per share growth of percent each year If Boeings share price remains this low for a couple of quarters or even years and the company keeps directing a huge portion of its cash flows towards share repurchases or uses some of the companys billion cash position the effects of a fast shrinking share count could be very beneficial for Boeings shareholders in the long term If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could reduce the share count by percent a year over the next five years assuming current buyback pace remains constant and share prices remain at the current level Boeings share count would decline by more than forty percent and even if Boeings net income does not increase at all through Boeings earnings per share would be up more than seventy percent This shows the huge potential effect of ongoing share repurchases at a time when share prices are low Another positive of Boeings share repurchases is the fact that the company doesnt have to pay dividends to those who sell their shares to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>By reducing the share count by million in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will save million in dividend payments in These savings can then be redeployed towards more share repurchases higher growth investments capex or bigger dividend increases Boeings valuation is rather low on a relative basis in comparison to the broad market as well as relative to how the company was valued in the past Boeings trailing PE ratio of is percent below the broad markets trailing PE multiple Two years ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was valued at times trailing earnings which shows the huge valuation decline the companys shares have seen Boeings forward earnings multiple o is very low as well and substantially below the two year average of around fifteen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>price to free cash flow ratio of gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>a free cash flow yield of percent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>theoretically is able to pay investors more than eight percent of their investment back each year after capital expenditures for future growth For Boeings cost of equity I used a risk free rate of two percent an equity risk premium of seven percent and Boeings beta of which gets us to a cost of equity of percent Using Boeings current dividend of a year we can calculate the companys fair value in a couple of scenarios <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would be fairly valued right now if the company would grow its dividend by four percent a year in the future With a dividend growth rate of five percent the company would be undervalued by roughly twenty percent right now with a dividend growth rate of six percent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would be undervalued by almost fifty percent right now I believe a dividend growth rate of four percent is very conservative but even in this case it wouldnt be a bad idea to buy the company right now when one assumes that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will grow its dividend by more than four percent a year in the future we get to the conclusion that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is undervalued right now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a low valuation despite two secular trends which will allow for long term growth In global passenger numbers grew percent the highest increase since In ten of the last eleven years global passengers increased the average growth rate over that time frame was percent With growth rates above that level in the last three years and yoy increases during these three years we can say that global passenger growth is accelerating In order to move these passengers airlines need more planes which in addition to the base demand for the replacement of existing planes should mean long term demand growth for Boeings products The US military spent billion on aircraft and related products in aircraft are thus the products with the largest invested amounts by far Not only the US military spending on aircraft is very high demand from other countries for US produced military aircraft is at a multi year high as well The amount of new orders for US produced military aircraft and related products hit a level last seen in September late last year This shows the worlds high demand for such investments and it is also a huge positive for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>With orders being very high right now we can assume that revenues for Boeings defense segment will be high in the future as well when these orders are produced and sold Since Boeings margin is slightly higher for defense products than for civil aircraft we can also assume that this military spending spree we see globally will result in growing margins for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>We can summarize that the long term outlook for Boeings civil aircraft segment is good due to global passenger volumes growth accelerating and demand for Boeings defense segment is high as well wit global orders at a decade high right now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>sold off after the Q earnings report despite earnings and revenue beats and improvements in cash generation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>continues to return a lot of cash to its owners yet the company trades at a low valuation right now both relative to the broad market and to the companys historic valuation With long term trends in favor of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I believe the company looks attractively priced right now for income investors as well as those looking for capital appreciation with a long term view Tagged Dividends Income
