with NIRP Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Submitted by David Stockman via Contra Corner blog This week the great tree of Apple finally stopped growing toward the skyDuring its latestquarter in factiPad sales were down Mac volumecame in lower and even the iPhone barely breached the flat line In allApples mighty machine of double digit growth posted a revenue gain of just over prior year while itsnet income was essentially flat The real news however was that management is nowprojecting an actual yydecline in sales during the current quarter Dont get me wrong Apple has been the most awesomefount of productinvention global production and supply chain proficiencylogisticsand marketing innovationand consumer brand value creation in modern historyperhaps ever Its productsespecially the smart phonedid fundamentallytransform the daily life of the worldApples installed base of one billion devices is a livingtestimonial to its fanatical focus onbringing to theconsumer a trulytransformativedigital ageexperience Yet it all happened in wellless than yearsIndeed whilethe tech world was booming in the s APPL was struggling Between and revenue grew at only per annum and earnings did not increase by one thin dime Thats right Apples net income stalled out at million peryear for a decade and one halfor at a level equal to two days profits during the quarter just reported That wasnt much to write home about under any circumstance but wasespecially wimpy compared to Microsoft where sales and net income grew at a CAGR during that period orCiscowhere sales and earnings soared by annually for years running And that brings us to the lunatic valuation of the FANGS which was also on display again this week and why XPE multiples are always and everywherea deformed artifact of central bank drivenBubble Finance not the emission of an honest capital market The fact is the greatest technologybased businesses of modern times accomplished its dramatic growth spurt in just over quarters between and That wasafter the iPhone incepted and the iPadworked up a serious head of steam NowApple is pancaking or worse and it is hardto believe thatgimmick products likeApple Watch or Oculus can fill the hole from the fastfading iPad and the stalling iPhoneNo harm done of course and its entirely possible the APPL will have another modest growth run But heres the thing Apple essentially proves you cant capitalize anything atX except in extremely rare casesbecause of theterminal growth rate barrier That is after a few years of red hot growth almost every largecompanys organic growth rate bends toward the single digit path of GDP In this respect Microsoft and Cisco surelyprove the rule After their blistering s growth the were valued at X and X reported earnings respectively at the tech bubble peak in But the terminal year growth rates implied in those towering multiples were not to beeven for two of the most inventive companies of the digital age During the last fifteen years Microsofts net income has grown at a annualrate and Ciscos at Technology shifts competition and global macroeconomic trendstogether conspired to bend their red hot growth trajectories toward the flat line As can be seen above between December and the end of Microsofts market cap declined from billion to billion meaning it shed billion of valuation as its PE contracted from X to X its market cap currently is slightly higher at billion Likewise Ciscos market cap plunged from billion to billion Thus despite years of respectable growth itwas forced to shed billion of market cap while its PE multiple ended up resembling Ross Perots famous sucking sound to the south plunging from X at the tech bubble peak to X at the end of Since these two companies are among the best long term performers and profit generators of all time they speak powerfully to the terminal yeargrowth barrierIn effect when investorscapitalize a growth companys hot years at a triple digit PE they are drastically overvaluing its terminal year potential And virtually without exception they spend the post growth streak years in PE compression and market cap shrinkage At best these high flyersturn out to be long term growers or at worst shooting stars likeLucent or Dell where of the peak market cap gets wiped out by the passage of time and events Considerthe year growth rate of five important andsurviving growth iconsof modern times Apples quartercentury net incomeCAGR ending in the year just reported is That for Cisco is Microsoft Intel and Berkshire Hathaway Yet today every one of these companies trade at market caps well below their boom year peakseven after giving consideration to the balance sheet deterioration resulting from debtfinanced stock buybacks Specifically relative to its peak market cap Cisco is current down by Intel by Microsoft by Apple by and Berkshire Hathaway by So theres the skunk in the woodpile What is going on under the heading of growth company valuation is just pure speculation in the casino There is absolutely nothingrational oreconomically efficientabout the X PEs The latter get attached to the casinostrading sardines of the month or yearwhich get temporarilydesignated asgrowth stars History virtually proves that you cant go wrong selling the high flyers if you have the patience and capital depth to wait out the serial bubble cycles of the worlds outofcontrol central banks In that respect this week brought another raft of just that kind of opportunity Yes Amazon disappointed the absurdly precise and ultra aggressive growthtargets of Wall Street analysts and traders But so what Its PE ratiowas marked down from X to X meaning its still a screamingsale Back up the trucks After all when you spend years creating a monstrous machine that isresolutely and maniacally focussedon spending every dime of revenue on global empire building it will never generatea measureable profit or return on capital Well at least notmore than theanemic pretax return it posted for Thus itis only a matter of time before unforeseen external events such as an ordinary business cycle downturn to say nothing of the impending global deflation trigger a drastic rerating and PE compression Then the fast money and robo machines will dump the stock hand over fist asusualand long beforethe inattentive home gamers wake up to find themselves the victim ofanother epic slaughter Likewise Facebook purportedly surprised to the upside and is now trading at close to X But heres the thing If you wish to believe that FB really has billion carbon unitbasedmonthly users you might also want to check into some Floridaswampland Otherwise recognize that the social media sphere is crawling with siliconbasedfake users and mercenary bots and that their contamination of Facebookspreposteroususer stats is undoubtedlybeyond reckoning Yes FB occasionally purges the worst incursions but surely Justin Beibers million fake fans was only a drop in the bucket Besides that it doesnt really matter what the mix of carbon vs silicon based units is in FBs massive user stats At the end of the day Facebook is essentially a digital billboard Its a place where mostly millennials idle their time in or out of their parents basement Whether they grow tired of Facebook or not remains to be seen but one thing is certain Namelyadvertising is slaved to GDP growth and always takes a hit when the business cycle turns south Indeed the pool of advertising dollars is relatively fixed at about billion in the US and billion worldwide and grows in the low single digit zip code after you take account ofthe severe cyclical fluctuations which always slam the ad spend For instance during the Great Recession the US advertising spend declined by and the worldwide spend dropped by And therein lies anotherskunk in the woodpile Due to its sharp cyclicality the ad spend is a distinctly lowgrowth pool of money And that pool of money is fiercely competed for by the various media venues Thus the US ad spend of billion in was only billion greater than the billion spend way back in So when you average out the cyclical fluctuations the trend growth in US ad spending has been about per annum Likewise the global ad spend increased from about billion in to billion in reflecting a growth rate of annually Yes there has been a rapid migration of dollars from TV newspapers and other traditional media to the digital space in recent years But the big shift there is already over The digital share of the US ad pool in factrose from in to an estimated last year But even industry optimists do not expect the digital share to gain more than a point or so per year going forward After all television newspapers magazines and radio and highway billboards are not going to disappear entirely Moreover roughly half of the digital share comes in the form of search advertising FB does not even participate in that sector where Google has upward of a market share Consequently there are not remotely enough advertising dollars in the world to permit the endless gaggle of social media space entrants to earn revenue and profits commensurate with their towering valuations and the sell sides hockey stick growth projections So once again we havethe delusion that the revenue growth that FB booked in its most recent quarter can be continued indefinitely when it will in fact by pulleddown to the GDP growth line in only a matter of time Accordingly now would be an excellent time to sell the stock and back up the trucks You cant capitalize a onetime shareshift inthe quasistaticad spending pie as if it represents a permanent rate of growth Indeed most especially not in a world heading into an extended period of deflation and static or even shrinking nominal GDP And do believe that this third and greatestcentral bank driven bubble of this century is well past its sellby date The central bankers are getting downright deranged as Kurodasan demonstrated on Friday Japan is an old age colony sinking into the PacificThe very last thing it needs is more inflation to erode the purchasing power of its massive and growing retired population and then totax their bank accounts with a negative interest rate to boot After what amounts to years of ZIRP and QE the grand Keynesian monetary experiment of the present era has been proven an utter failure in Japan which is now sliding into its th recession in seven years Why do they keep resorting to madcap expansion of central bank balance sheets and thereby the systematic falsification of financial asset prices Ostensibly the aimis to reverse a deadly run of consumer price deflation But heres Japans CPI over the last years That is not deflation In fact the mantra has no basis in economic logic or proof in financial history Its just a giant cover story that the worlds fraternity of central bankers have invented to justify there massive and constant monetary intrusion But here is the real reason why Japan went to NIRP The Nikkei was down from its June peak Thedesperate fools who run the BOJ panicked andvoted to stop the hissyfit Thats all there was to it The BOJs NIRP gambit may provide a few days of relief at best but then the implosion of the worlds monumental financial bubble will continue and even gather pace Why Because the central banks have shot their wad Two decades of madcap credit expansion have brought Japan and most of the rest of the world to a condition of peak debt which means that the central banks are now simply pushing on a credit string For the better part of seven years that foolish endeavor has generated massive unsustainable inflation of financial asset values It has fueled the lunacy of X growth company bubbles But as the global economy sinks into the deflationary recession that is inherent in a crackup boom it will become increasingly evident that they are powerless to alter the course of the real economy Eventually the prospect of recession that cant be cured by thecentral bank printing presseswill ignite sheer panic in the casino Then the monetary fools running them will be reviled to the ends of the earthBut not beforethe lunatic X valuations of the FANGs implode like those of all the high flyers which have gone before I agree but as usual this shit showwill continue to drag on Sat Fester Sat Wannabe_Oracle Theyre still attractive given that they have a ton of cash on hand I would anticipate them buying a very large company soon That is if they can close the deal before the floor of this hit how unhinges Sat WestVillageIdiot But how much is that cash really worth All of that money is parked overseas if I recall correctly If you have in a k account do you really have You have to figure there is a cost to actually get that money Apple has all of their tens of billions overseas The money has to be repatriated What would that cost They are playing a very dangerous game against thirsty governments How much could their game of chicken cost them Did anybody else notice that this article basically thanked Apple for inventing the smartphone WTF How do you take an author seriously that makes a mistake that big Sat kml however reality in this world is covered by FED magots Sat No Half Measure Sat RRRaskolnikov This is a very good article Thank you for writing it and pointing out that Apple mentioned an expected decline in revenue for next quarter Until now I have not seen anything written on Seeking Alpha about this I thought that I was the only one who thought Virtual Reality and iWatch are not going to be much of a succes or become something major I personally consider it a hype as like D printing I bought another LEAPs on Apple yesterday Sat khnum apple may have to have a brand restructure it is definately in the maturity stage of the product life cycle and whilst they believe they can justify their prices mainly due to the goodwill of the apple brand name there are fewer and fewer people with good jobs and good incomes price is becoming a factor and competitors like Samsung and HTC are getting a bettr look inin short they are too expensive Sat messystateofaffairs Of course the insider money is already secured and liquid and their agents ready to man the asset unloading ramps Sat MiniCooper He said no Its for parents and teachers he said Its not cool Twitter and WhatsApp yes is still used Meanwhile my older friends routinelyset maximum privacy settings and some stopped using Facebk completely I never used it Otherwise we emailtext Two decades of madcap credit expansion have brought Japan and most of the rest of the world to a condition of peak debt Perhaps Im in isolation here in recognition of Stockmans reoccurring meme of years in nearly every one of his articles but Im batting nonetheless Of course one could take this back to or even better August of but the FACT remains that the main ramp of cheap credit easy financing and Devilmaycare Federal deficits turned loose like the dogs of Hell had its genesis in the early s as any simple chart of housing prices bear out Why David insists on furthering this meme of two decades one can only assume that he is wont to distancing himself from the very era in which the current situation was borne out of and which in a capacity where policy left a permanent mark he was an active participant In our latest commentary we look at some of the key global indices and ask whether we are at the beginning of a potentially significant LT correction Cyclical vs secular Although most investors tend to focus on shortterm changes in direction it is occasionally useful to look at the market indices from a broader longterm perspective If one were to look at real inflationadjusted SP for example investors who would have bought SP at the height of dotcom bubble Aug would still be down today by In other words equity investors derived no real index return for years Is this unusual The answer is no If one takes LT market view there were at least four periods in the last years when investors derived no real index returns for decades to now On the other hand there were several periods of extended and strong bull market runs The key difference between these bull and bear market cycles is that LT secular bull markets start from exceptionally low valuations and are fed by accelerating growth rates and strong positive real interest rates in turn driving credit and confidence On the other hand LT secular bear markets start with high valuations and their progress is punctuated by erratic growth rates low real rates and high degree of asset volatilities It is never totally clear when secular trends change only hindsight demarcates the border but to mark transitions from Bear to Bull investors need to see previous real index lows being decisively breached with valuations declining to exceptionally low levels growth and real interest rates rising Conversely Bull to Bear transitions are marked by valuations rising to high levels against backdrop of weakening fundamentals Although within secular market there are cyclical phases that sometimes last for years they have difficulty exiting secular channel Which stage do investors inhabit today In our view SP is continuing to exhibit signs of LT secular bear Valuations remain high economic growth rates erratic and real interest rates low The strong cyclical Bull market run by SP between and was driven by combination of depreciation of US followed by massive expansion of the Feds balance sheet Since the end of QE late SP index has gone nowhere whilst US has been gradually appreciating thus depriving cyclical bull market of its oxygen Given divergent monetary policies unwillingness of Fed to consider QE and lack of global growth trade and liquidity the next cyclical Bull market phase would first require a much deeper bear market correction As described here this however runs contrary to the symbolic messaging of SP as one of what we define as six key signals that Fed monitors as it attempts to normalize monetary policy The dilemma is that on the one hand the Fed is determined to squeeze cost of capital higher and build dry powder of interest rates to enable it to stimulate if economies weaken However this threatens to send US higher and global liquidity lower and leaves SP exposed with high multiples eroding earnings flattening yield curve and no liquidity support Whilst current CB policies would preclude return to secular Bull as dislocation required to set stage for a secular phase is unacceptable another cyclical Bull requires either valuation correction or change in public policy settings such as QE or nationalization of credit via robust CB funded fiscal policies Absent these two outcomes the best that SP investors can expect is exceptionally low equity returns that would be unlikely to beat bonds Whilst the same trends are evident in other key DMs we prefer Japan and Euro due to different trajectories of their monetary policies Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site RANSQUAWK AUDIO CLOSED FOR THE WEEK THE DESK
