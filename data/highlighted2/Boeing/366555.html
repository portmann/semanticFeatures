style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>the largest customer is facing issues and the relationship with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is also changing Spirit AeroSystems Holdings NYSE SPR since my last Bullish note has worked well thanks to the operational improvement and restructuring thesis that was covered in the note working well but now the fundamentals are changing some may call deteriorating fast and investors might be served better by turning cautious The company has been a great restructuring story with most of the senior management changed and improved productivity metrics while top customers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA and Airbus OTCPKEADSF delivering a record number of aircraft Even now backlog almost billion represents almost seven years of sales visibility and there are recent reports of the company winning the contract on the Long Range Strike Bomber that Northrop Grumman NYSE NOC will be building for the US Air Force Overall most backwardlooking indicators including the cheap valuation based on historical earnings look impressive but with the comeback thesis played the catalysts for the next leg of growth seem difficult to comprehend The company may have come a long way but going forward issues faced by the biggest customer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and the growing uneasiness in the relationship with the biggest customer are things that are worth tracking closely and bound to create doubts thus capping the upside potential of the stock The incrementally positive reports related to the new military contract or the ramp of A with Airbus are good but still not big enough to move the business in a meaningful way at least not enough to ignore issues with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>As a spinoff of Boeings division the company is one of the largest independent nonOEM manufacturers of commercial aerostructures structural components such as fuselages propulsion systems and wing systems for commercial and military aircraft in the world and one of the largest independent suppliers of aerostructures to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus Three major product segments Fuselage Systems Propulsion Systems and Wing Systems have continued to be the same but the big promise was always to enable the business to bid for work with other plane makers but it still relies heavily on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The company has high exposure to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and the problems faced by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>may continue to stalk Spirit as well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>provided a disappointing guidance whether one looks at the delivery schedule margin or EPS One top of that the company is grappling with accounting investigations low oil and the general expectations of demand in a rising interest rate environment From a product standpoint total unit deliveries for BCA <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Commercial Airplanes are expected to be airplanes below the widely expected forecasts which works out to down from the number of shipsets delivered by Spirit to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in Besides a generally weak forecast <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>also announced production rate cuts to the B widely expected by most Street analysts but for Spirit which supplied shipsets of B in it is a negative nonetheless If history is any guide expecting a smooth transition to BX may be asking for too much especially considering the weak order book for s in general With a weak demand for widebody airplanes and shrinking opportunities to improve pricing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>may be under increased pressure Stable airline traffic growth improved earnings decent cash generation and benefits associated with operational improvements may not matter much if the market starts looking at the peak demand and cyclical downturn scenarios a sentiment that is bound to flow down to major suppliers like Spirit It is never encouraging to see hostility with suppliers or customers especially if the other party happens to be one of your biggest customers Recently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ended a licensing agreement with Spirit and taking away manufacturing of some spare parts used in aircraft repairs which Spirit shrugged off as financially limiting in nature But the development is noteworthy on many counts be it the high profitability that is usually associated with the spare parts business especially aircraft spares the fact that the program covers various components used in a variety of aircraft or the strategic importance of the business considering the help it might offer to Spirit with supplying their own repair operations with replacement parts Not to mention that this is probably one of the first times that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has taken back something from Spirit never an encouraging sign Financially cash flows should start to attract increased attention A lot of attention is given to the companys strong adjusted EBITDA of close to a billion dollars rightfully so given the improvement from just a couple of years ago but with the increase in capital expenditure which increased to million last year from million in and expected guidance cash flow from operations of million down from free cash flow might come under increased scrutiny MidFebruary the company announced the lowering of its free cash flow guidance which some believed to be related to the companys winning a contract on the Long Range StrikeBomber that Northrop Grumman will be building for the US Air Force But that is not the only development that may put pressure on the cash flows the weak outlook of the B pricing pressures the expected ramp of the A which usually has a significant impact on working capital and shrinking advance payments are all worth tracking closely At the time of the previous note the growth offered by the business was higher than peers with a potential to improve margins and now the growth expectations are higher than the biggest customers and margins highest in years The name may look cheap on earnings but then most cyclical businesses do at the peak of the business cycle when measured on the historical earnings basis The company continues to be active with a share buyback but the same has done little for the earnings improvement The balance sheet is decent and the market volatility may throw off acquisition opportunities but the valuation ie low price to earnings may restrict the use of stock as a currency As the stock starts trading more like a cyclical stock than a comeback story valuation multiples may also come under increased scrutiny Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within
