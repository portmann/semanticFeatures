(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Not to mention that this is <b>probably</b> one of the first times that <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> has taken back something from Spirit , never an encouraging sign .

(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Mid-February , the company announced the lowering of its free cash flow guidance , which some <b>believed</b> to be related to the company 's winning a contract on the Long Range Strike-Bomber that Northrop Grumman will be building for the U.S. Air Force .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But that is not the only development that <b>may</b> put pressure on the cash flows , the weak outlook of the B777 , pricing pressures , the expected ramp of the A350 , which usually has a significant impact on working capital , and shrinking advance payments are all worth tracking closely .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>At the time of the previous note , the growth offered by the business was <i>higher</i> than peers with a potential to improve margins and now the growth expectations are <i>higher</i> than the biggest customers and margins highest in years .
