curve <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can leverage its partnership program to cut costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should be able to bring down material costs The Dreamliner deferred costs are extensively covered in my articles In most articles I have a look at how deferred costs developed and how those compare to my expectations In other articles I check whether the ultimate goal is still achievable In the past I have refrained from sharing my own findings for deferred costs to completely flat out However following my article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Dreamliners Will It Be Enough I received a lot of comments on the things that I do or do not implement and have received some links towards other analyses Additionally some people sent me their own calculations Although I am a big fan of investors that do their own due diligence and gather knowledge from various sources I think some make rather big mistakes caused by unreliable interpretation of data andor flawed analyses by other parties Before I do my assessment on the breakeven point for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA I think it is important to address these common mistakes and flaws In the end a similar result might roll out but it is more important to understand how you got to the end result It is also important to understand that some methods are being used in the wrong way thereby sketching either a too grim or too rosy image In a previous article I treated the flawed use of data analysis to calculate the breakeven point for the program In this article I will deal with the learning curve and explain why this curve is important but not alldecisive One reason to be aware of the learning curve is because it better represents efforts in cost cutting than just linearly building off deferred costs and calculating the average required contribution to deferred cost reductions The learning curve basically is an exponential decay curve that is based on findings that cost reductions can be realized by repetition of certain tasks by repetition one becomes more proficient in performance a certain task The common learning curve for assembly of aerospace products is This means that every time cumulative production doubles the production costs come down by Figure Learning curve aerospace industry Source AeroAnalysisnet Whereas the traditional curve for the industry is a rough calculation showed that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>seems to be closer to a curve of indicating a decrease each time cumulative production doubles up until the th delivery The learning curve on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is strong but I think that the repetition element is not the holy grail towards Boeings effort in cutting costs This is also supported by the observation that Boeings curve is beating the industry average Two things that I see as more predominant in the effort to cut costs are increases in production rate supplier contracts and reviewing the use and reuse of material <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has increased the production rate to per month this year and is aiming for another increase by decadeend The combination of installing equipment and lessons learned for faster flow times allow for higher production meaning that the same line can produce more aircraft with the same number of labor costs or in other words Lower costs per aircraft This of course is related to the learning curve Boeings Partnership for Success program is probably key to pushing down costs On one side <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is actively involved with its partners to ensure success for both In reality Boeings view is that success for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>means success for its suppliers So if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is bleeding so will its suppliers On the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is actively pressuring suppliers to decrease sales prices Especially suppliers with higher margins are likely to be pressured to lower sales prices So in fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is using its partnership program as an effective leverage in its cost cutting process The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>makes use of some advanced technology in order to achieve Boeings promises on fuel burn improvements <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is actually meeting and exceeding its promises This of course gives improves its competitiveness On the other hand it also gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>the space to review the design and replace some part with less expensive ones <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>uses about million worth of titanium on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Titanium due to its high costs is one of the last options engineers consider but the material does have some better material properties compared to aluminum I do not expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to make big changes but it will certainly consider to use aluminum where it can Another way to reduce costs is by reuse of material For Titanium it is not uncommon that after tooling only a few percent of the material is being used in the product <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will likely be able to cut costs by efficiently using material Although learning by repetition is an important driver of cost reduction I think most of Boeings cost cutting on the production will come from leveraging its partnership program and efficient use of costly materials If you would like to receive updates for my upcoming articles please
