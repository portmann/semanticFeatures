Ramp up in cost efficiency will determine fate of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Looking at the average required postive cash flow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is facing a huge challange In an article published on the nd of March I had a look at Boeings NYSE BA financial performance regarding the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program The first goal for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was to reach a cash positive status on the Dreamliner production which has been reached in Q A next interesting thing to look at is whether the current accounting block of aircraft is big enough What has to be noted is that this is not an indication of breakeven point However if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>does not at least cover the deferred costs it means the program would be in a reachforward loss position In this case investors should be notified this did not happen and I do not think that currently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is nearing that position If we rule out the forward loss position there are scenarios <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ramps up profits in such a way that it draws total program profit before the end of the accounting block <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is able to ramp up profit in such a way that it will at least break even on the program after deliveries To be safe in this analysis scenario will be dealt with In this article I will have a look at how much cash <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>needs to make in order to at least reach the breakeven point Because this scenario can become more complicated when more and more details are added I will start off with a simple analysis that is based on the already realized results without looking at what is likely to happen In future pieces I will be adding more details but this article should be seen as building block Figure Total deferred costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Program versus deliveries Source wwwAeroAnalysisnet As can be seen there is a hole of about bn that the Dreamliner needs to climb out Up to and including Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>delivered airframes If we were to express the deferred costs on a unit basis it means that on average each <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>bled about mln in cash Figure Total deferred costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Program smooth versus deliveries Source AeroAnalysisnet In order to make the general trend better visible the data has been smoothed It looks like the deferred costs are about to bottom but are not quite there yet For simplicity I will gear my calculations as if the current bn in deferred costs is the bottom and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will draw the same profit over all remaining aircraft in the accounting block Figure Total deferred costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Program smooth and required profit versus deliveries Source AeroAnalysisnet Currently the accounting block is units Out of these airframes already have been delivered to customers This leaves airframes in the accounting block to recoup all costs If we translate this to a unit basis each Dreamliner that rolls out of the factory now has to draw a mln profit This is quite a task given that just like cutting costs ramping up profit is an incremental process This means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has to draw profits in excess of mln on later airframes to compensate for lower profits on earlier profitable deliveries It is difficult to verify numbers because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>does not open up about profitability revenue and manufacturing costs for its aircraft On the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER margins were around Using this figure this gives a positive cash flow between mln and mln Going for a more conservative this gives a positive cash flow of around slightly less than mln So in theory it is possible to cover all but in reality there lies an incredibly big challenge ahead for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>On paper it is possible for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to recoup the costs within the given accounting block However a lot depends on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>reaching a production rate of per month deliveries annually in mid and ramping up production by the end of the decade For investors the first milestone to eyeball is actually reaching the bottom of the hole that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>dug for the Dreamliner after that is up to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to show how fast it can ramp up profit on the earlier profitable deliveries A few things that will help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in vastly decreasing deferred costs are relatively high deliveries of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I
