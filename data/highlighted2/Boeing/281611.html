wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article I finally bought the stock last quarter and so now need to focus on expectations and catalysts I discuss recent performance but also a string of strong news in the last two weeks into the New Year The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSE BA used to be a stock that I found myself constantly reflecting on and saying why didnt I buy it THIS time On every meaningful pullback I considered a position but never got in Make no mistake this aerospace and defense bellwether has created serious wealth for investors It has provided capital appreciation and dividend growth and that is why I got in back in December This was as the company raised its dividend and expanded its buyback Both very positive for shareholders But now was we enter we need to consider where the stock is going The best way to do this I think is to have a look at recent performance as well as discuss any recent catalysts The most recent quarter for which there is data is the third quarter and this was a blowout for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The numbers simply crushed estimates The company reported revenue increased to billion on record commercial deliveries while core earnings per share for the quarter increased to as a result of massive success in most all segments of the company The revenues beat estimates by over billion and earnings beat by Of course we need to know a bit about segment performance to grasp this numbers including expectations moving forward The Commercial Airplanes segment saw thirdquarter revenue increase to billion on higher delivery volume and mix while operating margins were a strong Looking ahead for this segment the company began final assembly and achieved poweron of the first MAX airplane during Q In total the program has won nearly firm orders for the MAX since launch It is important to note that the companys X program is on schedule for first delivery in Commercial Airplanes booked net orders during the quarter In the companys Defense Space Security segment revenue was a strong billion with an operating margin of One of the key developments was that NASA extended Boeings international space station contract in the quarter The Global Services Support Division was the only weak point in the quarter Its revenue decreased to billion due to timing of airborne control deliveries but its operating margin increased to on strong performance so that is a plus While the revenue is disappointing for the longerterm the company was awarded a contract to develop and provide the nextgeneration communications system for the Australian Defense Force Then looking ahead I want to know how the company is doing with orders and special contracts In the last week there have been three real strong pieces of news First right before the Christmas holiday we learned that the company booked orders for commercial jets in the week before the holiday everyone for the companys suite of jets That is strong <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>at that point had booked deals for jets net through December nd Then a week later on New Years Eve we learned that FedEx NYSE FDX committed to purchasing another <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s This is key as the average selling price of each one is about million NICE This totals more than billion This is a huge move for FedEx as it already had of the s dating back to an order for made in still remain to be delivered by The new order wont start to be delivered until Finally just yesterday we learned that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>picked up another million contract with the Pentagon This contract involves upgrades and logistic support for the TC supersonic trainer aircraft and this work will be completed in about a decade This was key as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>beat out a competitor for this contract All in all it was a Happy New Year with this string of solid news So what is the take home I am very pleased with the performance from the last quarter It was strong That said we care about the longterm And we have had some great pieces of news on top of another dividend hike and expanded buyback FedEx is a committed partner and the Pentagon contract helps pad revenues The longterm is where I am focused I will revisit the name when Q earnings are released along with yearend results For the full year core earnings per share guidance is going to come in between and Operating cash flow should be approximately billion Finally revenues are to be between billion and billion on higher commercial airplane deliveries I expect the company to come in at the higher end of these ranges For expect the company to continue to chip away at its existing backlog and watch for continued orders to flow in Note from the author Christopher F Davis has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since
