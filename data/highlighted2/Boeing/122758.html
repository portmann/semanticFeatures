announce earnings on Wednesday and we believe the stock looks good prior what we believe will be a strong quarter for BA All things considered we believe BA is attractively valued The stock trades at x forward earnings on expectations of growth giving the stock a forward PEG While this isnt attractive on its own we believe BA is trading at discounted multiples relative to its peers BA is trading at x trailing sales versus Lockheed Martin NYSE LMT and Northup Grumman NYSE NOC which trade at x and x trailing sales respectively Many justify NOC and LMTs richer valuation by saying the two are focused in the highgrowth defense space while only of BAs business MRQ was defense however BA grew revenues MRQ while LMT saw topline slip and NOCs revenue grew a mere BA is also in a more solid financial position than both LTM and NOC with a much more favorable cashtodebt ratio LMT and NOC though do have higher ROAs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could also be a solid dividend portfolio investment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a forward dividend yield of and an annualized forward dividend rate of Considering longterm investors have doubled their money since this dividend yield is particularly attractive and offers investors a nice cushion in what has been a relatively flat stock in the past months LMT has a lower dividend yield but NOCs dividend yield is NOCs payout ratio though is which we believe is bordering dividendcut territory BA by contrast has a payout ratio so we believe dividend hikes could outpace income growth in the near future Using a Gordon Growth DDM with a forward dividend WACC discount rate and dividend perpetuity growth rate the fair value for BA is just over Operating cash flow took a hit in Q on a YoY basis While the company generated billion in operating cash flow last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>generated less than million in operating cash flow this year despite earnings increasing YoY This decrease was driven largely by a million difference in accounts payable from a year ago as well as a million difference in customer financing Because capital expenditures actually picked up year over year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was actually free cash flow negative in Q with million in FCF This is only slightly troubling for BA considering the company has billion in cash MRQ and has historically generated lots of FCF The current investments should promote FCF growth soon The company has solid expansion growth prospects in its defense and military segment along with continued strong growth prospects in its core commercial segment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is forecasting rising demand for commercial airline pilots and technicians on the order of more than new pilots and new technicians by and this news comes on top of commercial revenues growing MRQ Military revenues were down in Q but contractual backlogs were flat or up in all defense and military segments The combination of an attractive valuation good dividend yield strong FCF growth and solid revenue expansion constitute BA as a solid investment even just short of these alltime highs We are also projecting a revenue beat this week We are modeling for revenues of billion quarter above estimates of billion We believe Boeings commercial segment will do billion in sales for the quarter a YoY increase driven by a more favorable plane product mix <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>already reported that QFy deliveries were up YoY to and provided the breakdown as follows We can see that the plane delivery mix has shifted in favor of and this year and away from This is a favorable product mix for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>since the and are more expensive planes than the In QFy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>made roughly million per delivery In QFy that figure dropped to million due to a lower mix of We expect that this figure should be upped to million in QFy due to a higher mix of and than the year prior Multiplying this million by deliveries gives us roughly billion in commercial revenue In Q military aircraft contractual backlogs grew YoY network and space contractual backlogs grew YoY and global services and support contractual backlogs were flat Assuming these backlogs are spread equally then we are modeling for YoY revenue growth in military aircraft YoY revenue growth in network and space systems and flat YoY growth in global services and support These assumptions lead us to total defense and military revenue of billion for Q Assuming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Capital and Eliminations roughly offset one another per historical guidance we arrive at just over billion for the quarter We believe the company will beat on revenues this week and also believe BA is attractively valued heading into
