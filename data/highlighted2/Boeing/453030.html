class='textDiv'>null NEW YORK By Alwyn Scott and Tim Hepher NEW YORK <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co BAN is stepping up efforts to conserve cash cut costs in its supply chain and trim inventory of parts in its factories telling vendors it will take longer to pay bills <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and aerospace industry executives said Under the new terms <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is taking up to days to pay rather than days as in the past these people said The new payment schedules are being rolled out this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>also is reducing its factory inventory and is relying on suppliers to hold parts instead these people said The moves come at a time when investors are closely watching Boeings cash flow In a statement to Reuters <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>confirmed the changes in payment and inventory terms saying they were necessary to compete when airlines want more capable planes at lower prices To align with industry norms and remain competitive we are in the process of adjusting the payment terms of our large suppliers spokeswoman Jessica Kowal said in the statement In most if not all cases our new payment terms are in line with their payment schedules to their own suppliers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>which is marking years in business this summer and its European rival Airbus AIRPA earn lower average profit margins on the airliners they engineer and sell than many of the companies that supply components for the planes The companys operating profit margin averaged percent over the last decade Airbuss figure was percent United Technologies Aerospace Systems UTXN comparable margin was about percent according to Thomson Reuters data Its in Boeings DNA to build the best airplanes Kent Fisher vice president of supplier management said in an interview But what we and suppliers have to recognize is that we have to shift that dynamic and focus on reducing the cost to build the airplanes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg has told investors he wants to lift Boeings profit margin to the midteens by Under a program called Partnering for Success launched in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>suppliers cut prices percent Now executives at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>suppliers say Muilenburg is pushing a renewed round of cost cutting I was in a meeting with Dennis where he was quite specific about needing to get continued cost reduction from the suppliers said Dave Gitlin president of United Technologies Aerospace Systems one of the worlds largest aircraft parts makers Gitlin said UTC did not agree to delayed payment terms because it was focused on its own cash flow But as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>searches for savings he said its accurate to say that everything is part of the discussion I think theyre looking under every rock Major <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>supplier Mitsubishi Heavy Industries T said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is seeking a new round of lower prices and changes in payment terms I cannot say the number but I would like to satisfy as much as possible the required cost reduction level from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Shunichi Miyanaga chief executive of MHI said in an interview On the question of longer payment periods first reported by aviation publication Leeham News he added we have not decided Not all of Boeings efforts require price reductions Some suppliers find cost savings by reengineering components a process <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>calls value engineering <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>saved billion a year in and through these efforts up from million in Kowal said Theyre very aggressive Tom Gentile chief executive of Spirit AeroSystems Holdings SPRN said in an interview about price reductions But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is as hard on themselves as they are on anyone else he added On a recent tour of Boeings factories in Washington state he said workers were under pressure to install new tools reduce production time and reduce inventory Payment terms could be included in a longterm agreement Spirit is negotiating with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Gentile said There are a lot of levers to pull he said But many suppliers have already accepted the changes At a midsized machining shop in Washington state that makes parts for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>payment terms shifted this spring We went a whole month with no receivables from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said the owner who asked not to be named because of concern about damaging relations with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>When payments resumed about percent of the companys annual revenue remained unpaid he said adding that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>now pays in days not and pays twice a month not weekly Were having to change the way we manage our cash flow and change the way we pay our suppliers the owner said It is preventing us from buying equipment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said small suppliers in the United States are exempt from the new payment terms and that it is trying to accommodate suppliers overseas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>did not implement any policy change or action that would have delayed or missed a contractual payment to large or small suppliers in April Kowal said Other suppliers also reported changes in Boeings terms along with further price reductions said Christian Schiller a managing director at investment bank Cascadia Capital in Seattle who works with midsized suppliers The effort has been dubbed Partnering for Success Notwithstanding all the concessions people made on PFS Schiller said theres a whole new wave now of all sorts of other concessions Reuters News Agency Brand Attribution Guidelines Delivery Options Reuters is the news and
