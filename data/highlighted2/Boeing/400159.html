class='textDiv'>NonConsensus Thinking On Trade Seeking Alpha The significance of intrafirm trade is often overlooked Direct investment shapes the global economy in a way that few incorporate into their analysis investment or policies This Great Graphic was posted by Eric Nelson the managing editor of the Chamber of Commerces Above the Fold Publication It shows many of the different components of the singleaisle airplane and where they are sourced There is a complex supply chain that stretches from Australia through Asia eg Japan South Korea and China through Europe France Sweden the UK and Italy It extends into Canada and several US states as well Some of the foreignsourced components come from Boeings own facilities abroad like the moveable trailing edge of the wings which are built by its factory in Australia or the landing gear doors from Canada The intrafirm trade illustrates the complexity of the situation Perhaps in the th century when our current framework for understanding trade emerged a company in one country would export its goods to a foreign entity However this has changed Intrafirm trade appears may account for around a third of US exports and of US imports The thcentury approach was to focus on the movement of goods across national frontiers In the st century that is not sufficient to inform trade policy or understand the global linkages Ownership of those goods moving across borders is important on various levels Should that wing component made by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in Australia and shipped to the US be considered an import Or is what is really going on is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a virtual factory and it simply moved the component from one side of the factory floor to the other Imagine a trade policy that ignored the role of intrafirm trade A tariff for example on imports from Australia for example could hurt some US domestic producers Until last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was committed to assembling all their planes in the United States Then two things happened and neither involved the fluctuation of the dollar First Congress had chosen not to renew the ExIm Banks charter Partly because Boeings planes are more technologyintensive they are typically more expensive than its competitors though cheaper reportedly over the lifetime of the plane The ExIm Bank had facilitated through cheap credit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>sales Some critics in fact called the ExIm Bank Boeings Bank The second thing that happened was China President Xi led a trade delegation to the US and went on a shopping spree It agreed to buy of Boeings plane which is one of the largest orders ever It is not clear from the accounts how much was quid pro quo but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>agreed to construct some of the planes in China under a joint venture In addition to the complexity of supply chains and the role of intrafirm trade another issue that is raised here is about direct investment Direct investment is about ownership It is building or buying production andor distribution centers abroad Direct investment has different characteristics from portfolio investment Buying bonds and stocks in a foreign country is important and the internationalization of savings is an important feature of the our modern world However the extent of direct investment is also important Like the planes that will be constructed and sold in China many if not most of the Japanese brand cars on US roads today are built in the US At least one Japanese carmaker exports cars from California The importance of the stock of foreign direct investment goes unrecognized in most narratives about trade One dramatic implication is that the US does not serve foreign demand by exporting though the US is the worlds third largest exporter behind China and Germany Rather US companies service foreign demand by building locally and selling locally The sales by the foreign affiliates of US companies sell more than x more goods than are exported from the US According to MOF data Japanese companies made the switch in the lates so that the sale of its affiliates also outstrip exports What follows from this is that the location of those affiliates are not primarily in lowwage countries That is a myth Over half the employment of US businesses abroad are in high wage economies in Canada Europe Japan and Australia The employment in South America and Africa are also concentrated in the relatively high wage regions Why US producers want to be close to their customers The impact of the complex supply chains intrafirm trade and the significance of direct investment on labor markets is beyond the scope of this post However a nuanced approach looks necessary as there appears to be both competitive and complimentary linkages It seems that lowskilled workers abroad do compete with lowskilled workers at domestic affiliates However employment of highskilled workers abroad compliments as in leads to more high skilled domestic employment Disclosure Iwe have no
