In addition to the complexity of supply chains and the role of intrafirm trade, another issue that is raised here is about direct investment.Direct investment is about ownership.It is building or buying production and/or distribution centers abroad.Direct investment has different characteristics from portfolio investment.Buying bonds and stocks in a foreign country is important, and the internationalization of savings is an important feature of the our modern world.However, the extent of direct investment is also important.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Like the planes that will be constructed and sold in China , many , if not most , of the Japanese brand cars on US roads today , are built in the US .  (Uncertainty) </span>At least one Japanese carmaker exports cars from California.The importance of the stock of foreign direct investment goes unrecognized in most narratives about trade.One dramatic implication is that the US does not serve foreign demand by exporting, though the US is the world's third largest exporter (behind China and Germany).Rather US companies service foreign demand by building locally and selling locally.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The sales by the foreign affiliates of US companies sell <i>more</i> than 4x <i>more</i> goods than are exported from the US .  (Surprise) </span>According to MOF data, Japanese companies made the switch in the late-1990s, so that the sale of its affiliates also outstrip exports.What follows from this is that the location of those affiliates are not primarily in low-wage countries.That is a myth.Over half, the employment of US businesses abroad are in high wage economies in Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia.The employment in South America and Africa are also concentrated in the relatively high wage regions.Why?US producers want to be close to their customers.The impact of the complex supply chains, intrafirm trade, and the significance of direct investment on labor markets is beyond the scope of this post.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , a nuanced approach looks necessary as there <b>appears</b> to be both competitive and complimentary linkages .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>seems</b> that low-skilled workers abroad do compete with low-skilled workers at domestic affiliates .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , employment of high-skilled workers abroad compliments ( as in leads to <i>more</i> ) high skilled domestic employment .
