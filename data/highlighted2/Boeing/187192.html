class='textDiv'>Chinas Orders To Help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Soar In The Years To Come The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha China signed a billion deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>for an order of jetliners The lucrative deal was met with much skepticism as many believe the American airplane manufacturer was ruining its own future The deal saw workers back home in Washington getting uneasy about any possible job cuts related to the new plant BA has vowed to set up in China Last week Seattle was visited by Chinese President Xi Jinping in what was to be an official state visit to the US during which he signed a massive billion deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA for an order of jetliners Despite the seemingly lucrative nature of the deal there was a good deal of criticism floating around once the deal was confirmed and some even believe that China is fools gold especially for large companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>So I believe looking into some of these major criticisms will really help us understand Boeings long term prospects as well evaluate any short term happenings Lets look at the deal first <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>announced the finalization of orders for billion worth of airplanes at list prices which include the following widebody jets to be bought by Chinese airlines neither have been names singleaisle s to be bought by the same group of airlines more s for leasing companies ICBC Financial Leasing Co and CDB Leasing Co What you need to know is that many of these planes are not all new orders and many have been entered into the companys order book under previously announced firm orders Secondly and what is brewing trouble back home is that the deal also includes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>opening up airplane completion and delivery centers in China for the very first time The head of the largest union at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>pledged to step up a confrontation over the new Chinese plant if it meant cutting jobs in Washington However after a meeting with the companys Chief Executive Dennis Muilenberg he was reassured that the China facility would finish and paint narrowbody s planes built at its Renton Washington Factory while there would also be no related jobs lost in the United States Unfortunately as elections are coming up you can expect certain politicians to use this as an example to fuel the fire A plant in China was long overdue for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>especially with the backlog battle it has been playing with Airbus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>currently has planes stuck in backlog of which nearly are s Getting rid of this backlog is no easy task and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>repeatedly points out how it plans to increase production to airplanes per month in planes per month in and a further secret plan after that which should take the production output to planes per month The company showed its commitment to increasing output by introducing a new automated process which reduces manufacturing time by while at the same time taking less than half the floor space What makes matters far more interesting is that this production efficiency is slowly but surely paying off since by the end of August this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had made deliveries in comparison to Airbus Deliveries are where these airplane manufacturing companies tend to realize the bulk of the revenues from these orders Even though the proposed plants in China are going to focus on the finishing of the airplanes it marks an important step for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and the largest country in the world as it signifies the start of a long term commitment Analysts at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>have reiterated their strong belief that China will need new planes over the next two decades at a total cost of approximately trillion and I wont go into the details of whether such a forecast is valid and reliable since I have discussed it in my previous articles quite a fair bit However there are those who believe the deal came with string attached They specifically talk about this partnership with the Aviation Industry Corporation of China AVIC with whom they are going to open the completion centers since Chinas ambitions of developing a homegrown airplane are well known The Comac C is to be the flagship plane of the Chinese commercial airline industry but constant delays have made it abundantly clear that it is a still a work in progress So Boeings long term commitment to China is more than just a business deal its also a training session for the Chinese aviation industry Regardless of the intentions of the Chinese trillion is a lot of money to go between or companies and given that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a very strong set up and a history of successful jets it is more than likely that the Renton Washington based company will walk away with a sizable share However in good measure we cannot rule out the introduction of the Comac C which will signal the initiation of Chinas ultimate goal of breaking Airbus and Boeings Duopoly So why would <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>willingly try to sink its own ship Well Airbus already has a plant in Tianjin and as far as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is concerned the die has already been cast so they might as well still compete with their European rivals for the largest market in the world So you might be wondering why the company stock is suffering despite such promising prospects and why cant we see any short term gains from it Well the fact is there is no decision on actual timing and locations of deliveries as of yet which ultimately means that there wont be any nearterm impact on Boeings numbers Couple that with the fact that the American airline manufacturer is still going through withdrawal symptoms from the death of the ExIm Bank and you have a stock which is currently suffering But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>still represents a healthy investment opportunity with its strong dividend history The shares have underperformed the SP by during the past week but BA has outperformed the index in weeks by The company stock currently trades at We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do
