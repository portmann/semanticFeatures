respected colleagues insist to me that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>stock is going to take a nose dive You may recall I wrote about my decision to buy The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSE BA and got in back in December This was as the company raised its dividend and expanded its buyback but now months later where do we stand Well the stock is up which is good but we need to consider where the stock is going Is it going to crash and burn Some of my most respected colleagues insist to me that it will Even pointing to this mornings results as evidence or declining revenues cuts to military spending etc To have an understanding of where it is going we have to review the companys performance but also discuss where the company is heading <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>just reported its second quarter Do not fear but the company had a big loss in the quarter However this loss was more than anticipated thanks to certain charges Analysts were all over it and their consensus was crushed The numbers beat estimates on the top line handily but missed on the bottom line The company reported revenue of billion in the quarter surpassing estimates by million and rising year over year Core earnings per share for the quarter were pitiful year over year compared to last year But this was a beat of against analyst estimates Why the loss Remember the company took a charge for its reclassification and took charges in the program as well as the KC tanker program These charges combined for a hit of per share However the company was operationally strong To address this lets take a look at some of the sector highlights to get a feel for the performance The Commercial Airplanes segment saw second quarter revenue rise to billion on higher delivery volume while operating margin was reflecting aforementioned charges During the quarter the program hit deliveries of planes per month while the MAX saw the first two airplanes completed In total the program has won nearly firm orders for the MAX since launch Commercial Airplanes booked net orders during the quarter Backlog remains strong with nearly airplanes valued at billion In the companys Defense Space Security segment revenue was a strong billion with an operating margin of This was down from over last quarter reflecting aforementioned charges but I have to point out these margins were still up yearoveryear compared to the in Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Military Aircraft revenues were down with secondquarter revenue increasing to billion primarily as a result of planned reductions in C and Chinook deliveries The company saw some strong contracts in the quarter as well The Network Space Systems division saw revenue of billion and its operating margin was The Global Services Support Division saw revenue increase to billion due to higher volume in Aircraft Modernization and Sustainment Further its operating margin increased to on strong performance Like with the Commercial Airplanes segment there is a significant backlog Backlog in this segment was billion of which represents orders from international customers Commenting on the quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>President and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg stated The underlying operating performance of the company remains solid with our commercial and defense teams again delivering strong revenues and operating cash flow Actions taken during the quarter that impacted our earnings were the right proactive steps to reduce risk and strengthen our position for the future Our strong cash generation also supported our ongoing commitment to invest in product innovation and in our people and return substantial cash to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends As we look forward to the second half of the year we anticipate continued strong operating performance across our production and services programs on generally healthy demand for our broad portfolio of marketleading offerings Our commercial airplane development programs remain on track and we have successfully completed the flight testing required for customer approval of key KC production milestones Overall our teams remain intensely focused on improving productivity and quality building out our large and diverse backlog investing in future growth and delivering increasing value to all of our stakeholders I thought the performance this quarter was operationally very strong despite the large losses associated with the charges taken in the quarter Looking ahead Revenue guidance is between and billion including commercial deliveries of between and total Due to the charges taken earnings have been revised much lower Core earnings per share guidance for is seen coming in at to down from to I will point out that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>revises guidance throughout the year and this is subject to change The outlook isnt poor but reflects the nature of the business What we care about is the longterm and thats where I am focused At current price levels I am holding I would look to add on under should a large pullback occur Note from the author Christopher F Davis has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early If you like his material and want to see
