Labor union officials say they could postpone a vote seeking to organize workers at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Cos factory here in South Carolina if their campaign fails to gain enough traction against fierce opposition from the company and local politicians Organizers for the International Association of Machinists IAM are going doortodoor this week to gauge backing for the April vote and to make their case that union representation in the North Charleston plant would mean better pay and less taxing work schedules By withdrawing the petition for a vote the union could under labor regulations reschedule the ballot after six months but if it went through with the vote and lost it couldnt hold another one for at least months saidIAM spokesman Frank Larkin The union said it could make the decision about whether to postpone anytime before the vote It wouldnt be surrender said IAM organizer Mike Evans who is currently based in North Charleston The campaign would continue The possibility of a postponement highlights the difficulty the union faces in getting support from the North Charleston production and maintenance workers it is trying to organize The IAM enjoys strong support at Boeings massive facilities near Seattle in Washington state which are unionized andhascalled two strikes in the last decade But the union is finding it hard to get its message across in South Carolina a state with the secondlowest union membership in the country <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is firing back with ads on television radio and in newspapers warning that the IAM could cost workers highpaying jobs and benefits In an Internetera twist <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has also placed antiunion messages on the Pandora internet music service Blue shirts with No Union printed on the back are common around the North Charleston factory where Boeings Dreamlineris built Prounion workers are less open though the IAM is supplying workers with black prounion shirts hats buttons and fliers Workplace showings of support are difficult to quantify because some may be reluctant to show support in the workplace said the IAMs Larkin Boeings antiunion messages have been amplified by local business leaders and politicians including South Carolina Republican Governor Nikki Haley That has resonated with some workers With the union we dont know if well have health insurance said one <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>assembly worker who was among a group of workers wearing the antiunion shirts at a restaurant near the plant He spoke on condition of anonymity Union members are just percent of the workforce in South Carolina only just behindNorth Carolinawithpercent By contrast Washington state ispercent unionized South Carolinaalso is a righttowork statemeaning employees cant be forced to join a union or pay union dues even when covered by a unionnegotiated contract The battle over organizing the plantmarks a potentialturning point in the long power struggle between the aircraft giants management and its largest union For the IAM which represents about <span
