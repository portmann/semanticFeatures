The reason Amazon is a good investment today is that they are encroaching on every aspect of business related to their own and then some.They are building branding and emotional sentiment plus user stickiness by offering media content both in-house produced (now viewing in a theatre near you), plus licensed by way of music, movies and games.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They are making hardware for you to use their software with , and creating app ecosystems for buying from them <i>easier</i> and using their content in <i>more</i> places , whether it be the failed fire phone , an array of cheap tablets deliberately sold at a loss , or the new Echo speaker or popular kindle e readers .  (Surprise) </span>Amazon is not just e-commerce, in competition with Target or Walmart (NYSE: WMT ), or even Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ).Amazon is also competing with UPS, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), Barnes and Noble (NYSE: BKS ), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and even companies like Uber (Private: UBER ) and Lyft (Private: LYFT ).To truly understand all the areas Amazon will be competing in (and potentially dominating) is awe inspiring.The fact that they have a growing loyal subscription user base and software empire (Oh yeah, did I mention their immensely profitable Amazon Web Services segment?)is just icing on the cake.To conclude my comments on Amazon for now, although a lot of the excitement is priced in, I think it is clear the best is yet to come with them just establishing dominance in some highly profitable industries now.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They have huge opportunities to subsidize their expansion using their 3rd party sellers commission , cloud infrastructure commission , profit on in-house goods from others , shipping , fulfillment services and much <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Especially as they automate their factories and delivery processes to increase profit and really turn on the spout so to speak , Amazon is going to <b>possibly</b> surpass Alphabet and Apple <i>sooner</i> than many realize in market cap .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Although Tesla and companies like Solar City and SpacEx, all of which happen to be under guidance of Elon Musk are also vertically integrated and increasingly so, they are attempting to disrupt very powerful, old industries full of incumbents such as the utility and energy industry and as I mentioned above, the US automotive industry.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As a result , they really have to pour money on the operation and hit the ground running in order to not be crushed , and that is why they are such <b>risky</b> bets compared to Amazon .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , I <b>believe</b> these companies are poised to succeed in the changing dynamics of the world as governments mandate <i>more</i> environmentally conscious actions and people begin to care <i>more</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the coming world of increased automation and decreased margins , those who control <i>more</i> components of the supply chain and have first-mover advantages in big data collection for deep learning ( such as Alexa , Siri , Tesla Auto Pilot , Google Maps and Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) ) are poised to win .  (Surprise) </span>So just who should you bet on for the world of automated manufacturing and delivery, customer service, and every mundane task imaginable?I would put my money in Amazon if they do a stock split because I see no signs of their immense growth slowing down and they have yet to earnestly get a return on all their ventures.The same way Alphabet has Google ad revenue as their cash cow to fund some interesting ventures, Amazon has AWS and their e-commerce service.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They are even starting to make some of their own products to sell , plus getting involved <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> with the delivery of the components .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Tesla is in a much <i>more</i> capital intensive industry , but also one with a much <i>higher</i> ASP .  (Surprise) </span>Like Amazon, they are poised to be a key player in the coming shift in the way we make and buy our goods.One thing to keep in mind is the CEO's of both companies, Musk and Jeff Bezos, own rocket and space exploration companies ( Blue Origin and Space Exploration Technologies, or SpacEx).Both have also recently accomplished feats previously unheard of , and are well on the way to really expanding the reach of humanity.I am already long Tesla, but I see room to grow into the future as Tesla really proves itself out to the market with multiple years of offering multiple products and really gains some experience (And yes, profits).If Tesla goes anywhere below 200 I would rate it a strong buy.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think that SolarCity is the <b>riskiest</b> of the plays , but that they are a buy anytime before their panel manufacturing plant comes online when they really should be able to drop their cost per kwh installation price and increase profits ( plus realize a return on their massive ongoing investment ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>The stock has recently taken a beating and recovered nicely, but is still nowhere near all time highs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With the recent bankruptcy of Sunedison ( OTCPK : SUNEQ ) the solar market has been experiencing some skepticism but I <b>believe</b> this is temporary .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One thing to keep in mind with SCTY and TSLA however , are that both companies are very synergistic , with Tesla supplying stationary battery for solar panel system storage for SolarCity , plus being a huge buyer of solar panels for their GigaFactory and ( I <b>assume</b> once the SolarCity plant goes live ) to finish outfitting the Supercharger network .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Tesla has already shown itself to be an extremely unconventional automaker , choosing to in-source unique parts rather than compromise on design , such as the seats in the Model X. Tesla is vertically integrating with suppliers like Panasonic to have <i>more</i> control over the battery technology they utilize , whether it be thermal management and regulation packs , the cell chemistry themselves , or some other battery form factor related decision .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To increase control over costs and de-risk supply chain issues they are looking to find <i>more</i> suppliers , as well as creating joint ventures at the Gigafactory with everyone from prospective Lithium mining companies to other battery technology suppliers like LG and Samsung .  (Surprise) </span>Tesla also vertically integrated on the consumer end, choosing to maintain control over their service and sales centers.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This allows them to see problems on their vehicles <i>sooner</i> , maintaining a dialogue with the `` front lines '' of sales and repairmen .  (Surprise) </span>This also allows them to control the customer experience to a finer degree.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even on the road Tesla maintains its relationship with the customer by providing Super and Destination charger networks if the adapters for the standard ( and <i>slower</i> ) charging networks are not enough for you .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Tesla has also begun direct leasing services , making them even <i>more</i> similar to a dealership , which is basically just an independently owned financing , marketing and servicing outlet for most manufacturer 's .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If Tesla chooses to implement a Mobility Service offering similar to Uber or BMW 's , then they will control much <i>more</i> of the things required to run the company than Lyft or another transport company <b>might</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Even Google and Apple, if they make a full venture into the car space, are likely to outsource or partner for the manufacturing of the actual vehicles.A good analogy for how Tesla focuses on vertical integration and approaches the supply chain and manufacturing comes from the recent 2016 Annual Shareholders Meeting .Musk and J.B. Straubel talked about a 3x Gigafactory potential output (above the initial 50GW planned for) that was accomplished from an engineering approach on the entire building.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In essence , they said that `` Designing the machine that designs the machine makes the same amount of effort of improvement have orders of magnitude <i>more</i> effect . ''  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They also referenced the same quote 2 <i>more</i> times , one in regards to general manufacturing , and one in regards to raw material extraction ( Lithium specifically ) .  (Surprise) </span>Compared to vehicle's from the other automakers, like GM's Chevy Bolt (NYSE: GM ), which really should be the LG Chevy Bolt due to the sourcing, Tesla contrasts starkly.As a separate example of how Musk approaches vertical integration, with his Falcon rockets at Spacex, he made the first US based engine capable of bringing astronauts to the space station while competitors like ULA are stuck using Russian-sourced engines, not exactly ideal with changing political climates.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas</div></body></html>
