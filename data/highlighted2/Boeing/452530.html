This gives Emirates good leverage with both manufacturers and experience with both manufacturers products makes it easy for the airline to easily go with either manufacturer.Emirates would likely want to preserve this going forward.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Therefore if Emirates sees the <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> 777-10X as the likely future replacement for all its A380 's , then there is a good chance they <b>may</b> pick the A350 over the <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> 787 in their current RFP for a small single regional widebody aircraft . (Boeing: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite this , an order for the 777X , one of <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> 's most profitable aircraft over an order for the <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> 787 which is still struggling to make money is <b>probably</b> preferable . (Boeing: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In conclusion , the <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> 777-300ER killed the <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> 747-400 , offering an aircraft that had similar capacity with much <i>lower</i> fuel consumption , maintenance costs and overall operating costs . (Boeing: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I predict a <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> 777-10X <b>could</b> do the same to the Airbus A380 . (Boeing: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Airlines have been waiting for a VLA aircraft that can easily fit in their fleets for some time without the complexities and risk of the A380 and I believe the <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> 777-10X <b>could</b> be that aircraft .
