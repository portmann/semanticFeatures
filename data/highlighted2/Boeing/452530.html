NYSEBA Seeking Alpha A <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X stretch would offer a compelling alternative to the Airbus A There are many barriers preventing many airlines from operating the A more so than issues with the potential market for VLA aircraft Airbus will have a hard time making the A competitive or coming up with an aircraft that can compete against the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X potentially giving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>a near monopoly Blooombergs latest report suggests that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA is studying a further stretch of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X This appears to be very positive and lucrative news something <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>investors should continue to watch The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X would be a stretch of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X the largest upcoming version of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X would seat around passengers and as a result be the first twin engine aircraft to encroach on jumbo jet size The A for comparison seats around in a similar class setup <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been in talks with Emirates the worlds largest operator of the Airbus A among others according to Bloomberg Possible launch of the aircraft could happen at this years Farnborough Airshow scheduled for July I believe there has always been a strong case for a VLA aircraft Very Large Aircraft There are more and more megacities popping up around the world and at the same time airport capacity is becoming harder and harder to come by at these major hubs from London Heathrow to Shanghai Pudong As a result the A was brought to life and billed as an aircraft that could solve these capacity constraints Today both the latest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and the Airbus A are considered VLA aircraft however I do not believe they are what airlines were looking for and I do believe the X is what they may be looking for instead There are many airline routes in the world that could justify an A due to their demand but airlines do not fly one on A good example is back when information leaked and I wrote a report on Seeking Alpha about United Airlines NYSE UAL having talks with Airbus about buying the A Despite Airbus willing to sell the aircraft to United for very little or give them a very attractive deal there are a lot of issues with the aircraft The aircraft has little commonality with other popular Airbus products and for a small fleet of or so aircraft that United may have needed it would need an abundance of modifications to maintenance infrastructure while the airports United flies to would need modifications to handle the aircraft The engines are outdated and due to the uncertain resale value and low popularity of the aircraft getting financing could be difficult or expensive for airlines The FAA category VI that the aircraft sits in due to its wingspan is also a problem meaning any airport that wishes to handle it needs to undergo expensive modifications Airports like Mexico City have to close down other taxiways and so on when the A is on the ground creating disruption Finally the unprofitably of the A program has made Airbus reluctant to invest further in it and do anything to improve the aircraft The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X would solve these problems Over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aircraft have been built and are in operation with airlines around the world The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X therefore would allow those airlines to easily introduce a plane with the capacity of the A into their fleets without the complexities of a whole new aircraft type As the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X operates with engines versus on the A its maintenance costs are going to be inherently lower Financing will be easier as banks have a strong track record of resale value and more confidence in the future resale value of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>versus extreme uncertainty for the A Thanks to its folding wingtips airlines would be able to fly it to any airport worldwide that can handle a FAA Category V aircraft opening up many more possible routes The lower weight and lack of specialized handling required at airports would lower the airport fees charged to airlines who operate the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X An airline like United who needs a VLA for certain routes but does not need the complexity of a small sub fleet could easily operate a large number of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X aircraft and then or so larger X aircraft for those particular routes without introducing additional complexities or costs into their operation In addition to the Airbus A aircraft that have been ordered andor delivered the Airbus Global Market Forecast predicts the following demand for Very Large Aircraft by region Img Airbus Projected Aircraft Deliveries By Aircraft Size In total Airbus predicts demand for VLA aircraft for the period In addition however it predicts demand for aircraft in the seat segment a category the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X will fall into Even if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>only captured half of this market which seems unlikely since Airbus does not have a strong competing product then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could capture over billion in revenue from this segment alone assuming a million list price for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X Meanwhile Airbus will likely have to do something if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>does launch the X however its options look slim and unattractive The only way Airbus could redesign the A to come close to competing with a X would be to either stretch it substantially or reengine it with the latest technology such as geared turbofan technology Doing a reengine would be ideal but Airbus appears to have explored that proposal at the request of Emirates and not received enough interest to warrant going ahead Stretching the aircraft could also work to differentiate it from the latest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X model and compete better however this places the A in a whole new niche an even smaller market than the current A market is A launch of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X would likely receive orders from Emirates who may even use the aircraft to replace its entire A fleet if Airbus does not pursue a reengined or updated version One downside for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>however is that a win from Emirates may also be a loss Emirates likes to utilize both Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>for its fleet needs This gives Emirates good leverage with both manufacturers and experience with both manufacturers products makes it easy for the airline to easily go with either manufacturer Emirates would likely want to preserve this going forward Therefore if Emirates sees the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X as the likely future replacement for all its As then there is a good chance they may pick the A over the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in their current RFP for a small single regional widebody aircraft Despite this an order for the X one of Boeings most profitable aircraft over an order for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>which is still struggling to make money is probably preferable In conclusion the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER killed the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>offering an aircraft that had similar capacity with much lower fuel consumption maintenance costs and overall operating costs I predict a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X could do the same to the Airbus A Airlines have been waiting for a VLA aircraft that can easily fit in their fleets for some time without the complexities and risk of the A and I believe the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X could be that aircraft Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to
