class='textDiv'>The Beauty Of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>According To Michael Porters Forces The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is a wellpositioned company given Porters forces The company is trading at an attractive valuation The dividend is very attractive to income investors with the potential for capital appreciation At a pub in downtown Toronto just weeks ago a friend of mine approaching age asked another guy at the table What do they teach in business school when it comes to determining good vs bad business In my day almost years ago it was this Michael Porter forces analysis Answer years later its still Porters forces Hes not fashionable but his teachings are a benchmark to evaluating good vs bad businesses As far back as I can remember the airline industry was notoriously the worst industry to operate in given Porters forces Consumers could now easily compare prices on the internet there were several unions to deal with and there were only so many suppliers of large planes The airlines were at the mercy of companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA Lets take a look and see if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is actually a good business to hold according to Porters forces which are Although I am by no means an expert in the airline industry I will still share my breakdown of Porters forces as they apply to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Please feel free to comment below Currently the airline industry is heavily regulated and the production or creation of a new airplane would be incredibly lengthy and costly Although Bombardier OTCQXBDRAF which has made smaller aircraft for quite some time has tried to break into the bigger market we can see how theyve been faring Bombardier has recently accepted money from the Quebec provincial government hoping to stabilize their liquidity and solvency headwinds The stock of Bombardier has been trading in the CDN range for several months now Also the new planes Bombardier is offering are not seat aircraft This business still belongs to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus OTCPKEADSF OTCPKEADSY There are a few alternatives to taking a hour flight aboard a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aircraft By taking a smaller aircraft there will be a need to stop and refuel potentially more than once or of course it is possible to take a boat instead of hopping on board a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>or Airbus plane Effectively the substitutes may exist but they certainly are not great In the current market structure there are a number of airlines which need to purchase these very large aircraft for flight over the ocean Given that there are only suppliers this round goes to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus and not to the airlines Although there may be a number of used aircraft available this is probably not a longterm solution but only a shortterm BandAid Although the suppliers may be able to have some influence in the process no company is a perfect investment Although the suppliers may have some power the airplane manufacturers are working with them and inevitably have a close relationship due to the specializations of their product demands Although they may have to pay up for certain things a number of the components would be designed and produced in house allowing for the controlling of costs Given there are only competitors in this industry there is a low intensity for competition Ordering a cup of coffee is another thing Pretty much anyone can brew a pot of joe Would you trust just anyone to manufacture a plane for you Again I am far from an expert on the airline industry but as an investor I am fairly comfortable purchasing shares in this company It seems some of the best and potentially the worst companies according to Porters forces are found in the airline industry I am not a big fan of purchasing shares in an airline I am a huge fan of purchasing shares in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>a plane manufacturer one of two in the large plane segment Purchasing stock however is not just about finding a good vs bad company but also about value What am I getting vs what am I paying for Lets take a look Below you will find a straight up PE range for the past several years and then the dividend yield and payout ratios As we can see from the numbers above the PE range in any given year is approximately to Given this very reasonable range and yearoveryear consistency the current price of approximately translates to earnings of per share maximum to per share minimum Obviously we dont base earnings on the share price but instead do the opposite earnings totaled and using Value Lines projections of for I feel comfortable using multiplied by leading us to a stock price of on the low side and at a times multiple on the high side equates to At a current price of approximately this seems like an excellent purchase The next table breaks out the dividend yield and payout ratios Although the payout ratio is looking to be in line with that of the dividend has increased to per share meaning a current yield of Historically the payout ratio was around and yield between at the low share price to around at the high share price Had the dividend payout ratio been of earnings the yield would have been to Although this would seem like a very low yield the market has clearly adjusted to the higher payout ratio accepting the increase in the yield while giving up some capital appreciation Further in the past years the share repurchases have reduced the share count from approximately million shares to million shares as of the end of This is a huge reduction of float all the while maintaining the positive yet small amount of shareholders equity Given this the ROE multiplier is one of the highest Ive ever seen Currently the profit margin and asset turnover ratios have been consistent but the financial leverage has bounced around showing ROE above in Although very high leverage is not something that an investor wants to see it is much easier to accept in the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>given the commitment made when ordering a plane For each order there is a clear plan and timeline For the solvency to be in question it would take a greater calamity than weve seen in the past Special Note Weve seen a lot of calamities in the past years from everything to a financial meltdown to missing planes Like any other company or industry there are risks involved In the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>that specifically includes new government regulation among other things On a riskreward basis however I am very confident in adding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>into my portfolio as a core holding At a forward looking dividend yield of and aggressive share buyback <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is an ideal longterm holding for the patient As a great investor once said Time is the friend of a wonderful company and the enemy
