class='textDiv'>Bet With Buffett Buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Buffetts purchases of PCP is really a bet on aerospace and investors can bet alongside him by purchasing BA which is only x earnings BAs backlog provides several years of revenue visibility and increasing deliveries should support margins While defense will remain pressured margins have stabilized and the worst is probably in the rear view mirror Several weeks ago Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway NYSE BRKB announced it was buying Precision Castparts NYSE PCP for billion While PCP does provide some products for the oil and gas sector they key driver of its business is aerospace which accounts for about of its revenue While oil and gas has gotten a lot of the headlines Buffett is really betting on aerospace and he is paying handsomely to get it around x earnings and x EBITDA Even if we bumped up some of PCPs nonaerospace business to adjust for the weak activity in the energy sector Buffett is paying north of x earnings If you like Buffett and I feel optimistic about aerospaces fundamentals I would suggest you just buy industry leader <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA at a comparably cheap x earnings I expect the company to earn around this year after adjusting for onetime items <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is well positioned to benefit from the commercial aerospace upgrade cycle thanks to its leading product portfolio including the Dreamliner and upgraded Demand for these planes has been absolutely tremendous giving the company unprecedented and unparalleled revenue visibility Boeings backlog stood at an amazing billion at the end of Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can basically run its factories at full capacity through just on the orders it has booked to this point Now airlines can cancel orders but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is still seeing net orders as seen by last quarters billion in orders While I expect to see Boeings backlog to shrink a bit over the next months as the company executes on its backlog and sees deliveries exceed new orders all signs point to new orders remaining positive In all likelihood <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will be able to operate at capacity for seven years based on the backlog it has built and modest new orders Importantly Boeings key customers the airlines continue to report solid results and after the latest rounds of consolidation competition has become more manageable The rash of bankruptcies that clouded last decade is unlikely to repeat this decade Also unlike PCP <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is an indirect beneficiary of low oil prices Low oil prices are helping the airlines make even more money further diminishing bankruptcy risk as fuel is a major input cost Additionally while everyone is worrying about how fast China is growing the emerging markets are poised to grow over the medium term with more people entering the middle class every day Thinking beyond the volatility of the next few weeks this will only help the demand for aircraft Betting on aerospace is a bet on global growth which is a bet guys like Buffett have successfully implemented for years At the same time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been adding capacity at its facilities to churn out more planes and we are seeing the results of that effort Commercial deliveries are running above last year at planes As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>scales its Dreamliner program in the coming months and boosts output it should also see operating margins expand a bit which will make its backlog even more profitable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a lockedin revenue stream and as it builds scale it should push margins another bp higher boosting profits at a faster clip Now like PCP with oil <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been stuck with a weak business its defense unit which has struggled due to tight federal spending However most of the sequesters bite is already in results and a new President could bring about a new fiscal and defense policy particularly with Russia and China having assertive foreign policies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has worked to cut costs in this unit to bring it inline with lower defense spending and we are seeing the results of this effort Thus far in operating margins have risen even as revenue fell While I dont see this business being a source of growth the worst of the declines from a profit standpoint are likely in the rearview mirror Finally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a fantastic balance sheet and cash flow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should generate around billion in operating cash flow and billion in free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less capex <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been returning this cash to shareholders paying a million quarterly dividend and repurchasing billion in stock in Q The company has about billion remaining on its repurchase authorization which I expect to last to the end of implying a billion per quarter pace <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is essentially returning all of its free cash flow to shareholders which it can easily afford to do After all the company has billion in cash against billion in debt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should continue to return cash to shareholders and I would look for the company to raise its dividend yet again this December as has become the norm Over the past decades it has often been wise to bet with Warren Buffett With his purchase of PCP Buffett is betting on aerospace Now after its recent pullback BA is trading at a sizable discount to the PCP purchase price giving investors a chance to buy an industry leader at an attractive price With its large backlog and a healthy airline industry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has visible revenue and continued investment in its supply chain and capacity should help margins and plane deliveries If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>moves towards the x Buffett is paying for PCP normalizing for fluctuations in the oil business shares could move back past I would follow Buffetts lead by buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>down in the low s We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not
