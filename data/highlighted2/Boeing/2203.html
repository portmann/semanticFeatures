style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>In one of my previous articles I discussed the performance upgrade on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA which should aid <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in receiving some much needed orders My initial calculations assumed reduction in specific fuel consumption of and next to that I calculated that the aerodynamic efficiency of the airframe had to be increased by roughly to meet its goal of reducing total fuel burn by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>however shared more details about the performance upgrade and the performance upgrade is more extensive than I previously expected I will use this article to have a look at the most significant changes on the product and the impact it will have on fuel burn figures For the comparisons that I will make in this article I will use a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER operated in typical abreast configuration I will consider a nm mission with reserve fuel which corresponds to a flight from Dubai to New York As mentioned in my previous article GE announced a performance upgrade to its GEB engine which should result in a lower specific fuel consumption The lower specific fuel consumption is to be obtained by a reduction in drag in the engine and a more efficient highpressure compressor blisk According to my calculations the lower specific fuel consumption will result in a lower fuel burn This leaves about of fuel burn improvement to be achieved by other upgrades and tweaks One of the changes that I did not expect to be in the performance upgrade is the reduction in weight Weight reduction is achieved by using a lighter interior crown structure lighter insulation for the wiring lower density hydraulic fluid and removal of the tail skid which has been made redundant by changes to the fly bywire control rules The total weight reduction should be lbs or kg This means that the empty weight of the aircraft will reduce by which subsequently leads to a lower fuel burn The engine optimization and weight reduction will result in a lower fuel burn Which leaves the remaining of fuel burn reduction to be achieved by aerodynamic improvements The elimination of the tail skid reduces drag whereas a trailing edge device is attached to the aileron resulting in a higher wing efficiency Additionally slat enhancements flap fairing optimization and a new window design should reduce drag In order to achieve this improvement the aerodynamic efficiency should be about higher which is in line with my previous estimate of an increase in aerodynamic efficiency of Combining the propulsive and aerodynamic improvements as well as the weight reduction <span

efficiency changes on total fuel burn Source DhierinPerkash Bechai Figure shows that lower fuel burn will be driven by higher aerodynamic efficiency of the airframe followed by higher propulsive efficiency and lower weight <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will also be offering an optional improvement of the cabin saving weight and space This enables the addition of revenue generating seats in the cabin This should result in a lower fuel burn per seat and compared to the current <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER My calculations show a lower fuel burn per seat which is in line with Boeings aim Figure Relative fuel burn for the performance upgrade and full performance upgrade including options Source DhierinPerkash Bechai Figure shows that over a wider range the fuel burn is lower for the performance upgrade For the performance upgrade along with the added seats the fuel burn is lower but the generated revenue will be a few percent higher offsetting the slightly lower fuel burn advantage General Electric and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>are looking at the possibility to make the performance upgrade a retrofit which extends the viable life of current <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ERs in service Starting in Q the performance upgrade will be phased in on the production line The performance upgrade seems to be able to do what it promises Achieving a lower fuel burn The retrofit package will allow newer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ERs to have a longer viable life For airlines that operate older <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s it is also attractive to order a performance upgraded <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER Although the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER is more or less nearing its end the performance upgrade shows the airframes strength and should attract
