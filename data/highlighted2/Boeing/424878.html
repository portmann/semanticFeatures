April DUBLIN Iranair is discussing a historic aircraft purchase with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>potentially matching an order for over jets from Airbus but obstacles to both deals need to be resolved so that last years accord to lift sanctions can be honored its chairman said The Iranian flag carrier is also talking to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>about providing support for its ageing fleet following the deal between Tehran and six major powers to ease economic sanctions in return for curbs on Irans nuclear activities Meetings and negotiations are going on We hope that in the future we can reach an understanding with each other Iranair Chairman Farhad Parvaresh told Reuters in an interview The number and type of aircraft have to be discussed in the future but the first step is to have a mutual understanding Iranair agreed in January to buy jets worth billion at list prices from Airbus The deal was conditional on US export licenses because of the quantity of USbuilt parts Asked whether Iranair was looking at an even bigger deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>BAN Parvaresh said No not bigger than Airbus maybe close but this also depends on the situation Anyhow Iran is in need of at least aircraft for the next decade He said any such deal also depended of course on our government as well because we are a stateowned company After decades of estrangement <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>officials have visited Iran to pitch their wares to Iranair and some other carriers under a marketing license granted by the US government in February The US company would need another permit to strike a deal and then further export licenses similar to those required by Airbus due to the use of US technology to complete it Some industry sources expect a preliminary deal for at least <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>jets to be reached fairly soon Were following the licensing process outlined by the US government said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Middle East spokesman Fakher Daghestani Parvaresh said a lot of issues needed to be clarified in talks between Airbus AIRPA and Washington over export licenses for European planes under last years nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action JCPOA We are very hopeful and optimistic that the licenses will be released in the near futureBased on the JCPOA thereshould not be any big issues or excuses and they should clarify if there are any questions Even with those licenses Iranair faces what aviation sources still regard as awkward hurdles in financing any deals The airline is talking to banks and leasing firms who could step in to take all or part of the Airbus deal which must avoid the US financial system under remaining core sanctions Our deal with Airbus is in euros The financiers we are talking toare finding a solution to payAirbus in euros and then we would have to pay the financiers We are working on this he said adding these talks were progressing Parvaresh said some banks were willing to get involved but lacked sufficient capacity to tackle the whole package Everybody is willing to take or so aircraft which is not in our interest We would rather not have more than one or two financiers to make it easier and we have had very fruitful discussions with some financiers who want to work with Iran and especially Iranair Financial sources say some Middle East and Chinese leasing companies appear willing to facilitate plane sales to Iran But such deals would still need the backing of banks many of which worry about the fate of assets if sanctions are reimposed US Secretary of State John Kerry said in April Washington was not against foreign banks doing business with Iran under the deal between Iran and six powers collectively known as Tehran however has complained about not getting the full economic benefits of the deal Parvaresh said he hoped recent statements would reassure banks about doing business in aviation which would send an important signal to other sectors Some people are making propaganda that the JCPOA will not happen because the banking issues are not resolved This is a responsibility of the to resolve it as committed Iran is dangling the prospect of significant business for Western planemakers as it emerges from decades of sanctions The country has a fleet of aircraft of which are grounded due to the economy or missing parts Parvaresh said Of that total percent will need to be renewed in the next decade he said adding that growth could add even more jets to Irans shopping list News and Media Division of Thomson Reuters Thomson Reuters is the worlds largest international
