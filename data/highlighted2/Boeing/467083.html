Earlierannounced productionrate increase for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>compensates for lower revenue and profit on the program rate cut will have a B impact on revenue and BB on earnings Earlier this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA shares tanked quite a bit on a disappointing delivery forecast for The rate cut on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program added to the bad news Simultaneously <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>announced it will be increasing production rates on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program In this article I will explain why the rate decrease on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and the rate increase on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program are coupled To smooth the transition from the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Classic production to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has decreased its production rate from aircraft per year to per year in Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>states this rate cut is necessary for a smooth transition the fact is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>did not sell enough <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Classics to fill the production gap So in some ways the transition is not smooth at all The lower production of course has some impact on revenues and earnings Currently the list price for a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER is mln up mln from a year ago In a heavilydiscounted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER sold for about mln a discount <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said the higher list price for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has to do with higher associated costs for production parts materials and services I expect discounts for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER to have risen to roughly still selling for around million per aircraft The underlying profit margin likely contracted from to In terms of revenue a decrease of units annually means a decrease in revenue of B As for earnings it is quite hard to estimate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>cites higher costs as the main reason for this but it is unknown how much of those costs it really has to absorb So I will be using an estimate of and to estimate the loss in earnings On a unit basis the loss in earnings is between mln and mln So the total loss in earnings related to the cut will be between mln and mln for For the coming years I expect production to be lower by units compared to todays production rate According to my estimates this will lead to revenue being B lower and a negative impact of BB on earnings While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>announced it will be cutting rates on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program it increased production rates for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to per month from The company had already announced a rate increase to per month in and per month in For the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program there is no ramp up pattern available which makes mapping a production mix that will consist of types of aircraft rather difficult To simplify the calculations I have assumed that the rate increases will be used to increase the production rates for the MAX will be a combination of increases for the NG and MAX Additionally I have assumed that most aircraft will be MAX aircraft and Max aircraft The assumed profit margins are and What can be seen is that the increase in production rates for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>more than compensates for a lower revenue and profit on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program Over a timeframe of years the accumulates missed revenue on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>of B is fully offset by a B gain from production increases on the MAX program Even the most conservative margin assumption of will result in a net improvement of earnings of million to B Using the profit margin of the net improvement is B to B The most important thing to realize here is that although it is good to zoom in on aircraft programs separately and analyze them at all times you should also keep in mind the bigger picture In a previous article I concluded that high production rates on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>were not sustainable but did make sense when the highly dilutive impact of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program was taken into account A similar thing is happening now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is throttling back production on the troubled program and is boosting production to cover up any loss in revenue and profit The healthy backlog of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>even allows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to further grow revenues and profits by boosting production Additionally the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will be contributing to Boeings financial results as well If you would like to receive updates for my upcoming
