link or you will be banned from the site For years shorts would tear their hair out quarter after quarter when AMZN would continue to bleed cash with relentless abandon only to see the stock soar after earnings Now in what may be a perfect poetic symmetry following the quarter in which Amazons free cash flow soared to the highest in years printing at billion or more than triple the year ago period It wasnt just that one reason for the plunge may be that in the holiday season in which many had expected that AMZN would take away market share from an imploding retail sector revenue of billion a increase actually missed expectations of billion something AMZN has rarely done in the blockbuster for retail spending fourth quarter Another reason is that Wall Street finally got ahead of itself By a lot it was expecting AMZN to generate in EPS Instead AMZN missed this by a whopping with a final Q EPS of more than doubling the year ago net income on operating income of billion a nearly increase from a year ago which also missed expectations of a billion number On the spending side operating expenses increased to billion making some question if the companys core business profits will not be swept by Bezos many business growth ideas The CEOs biggest challenge is balancing Wall Streets thirst for profits against his own ambitions of using new technology such as unmanned drones and intelligent household gadgets Bezos is also eager to replicate his US success abroad including challenging Flipkart Online Services Pvt for Indias fastgrowing ecommerce industry According to Bloomberg the result was a surprise for investors who have become accustomed to Amazons ability to fuel sales by spending heavily on delivery infrastructure and new products The key question is whether the Seattlebased company can readjust its investments in the face of weaker than anticipated sales Still Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos appears determined to show that Amazon can keep bringing in more profit and sales he pulled back on spending last year to deliver a surprise jump in earnings and will be showing Amazons first Super Bowl commercial next week Amazon reached this new level of profitability in that we hadnt seen previously said Kerry Rice an analyst at Needham Co LLC If they dont keep that trend going in the right direction the stock goes down For now Amazon is not suffering too much in that regard Prime memberships rose a whopping offsetting fears that Amazons annuity cash flow stream may be throttled Curiously not even the silver lining was enough to save AMZN the companys cloud service Amazon Web Services generated sales of billion beating expectations of billion up from the billion a year ago and generating income of an impressive margin modestly shy of the billion in billion in retail profits across all of the companys other profit lines Finally not even AMZNs guidance was all that bad Net sales are expected to be between billion and billion or to grow between and compared with first quarter This compares with consensus expectations of billion Operating income is expected to be between million and million compared with million in first quarter Wall Street expects million So yes a good quarter but not good enough and one in which now that AMZN has entered profitability mode suddenly expectations exist that this profit growth can sustain and judging by the crash in AMZNs price that they wont Meanwhile AMZN continues to grow and grow and grow perhaps too much for its own good as the chart below shows while worldwide growth once again took a leg down the number of employees at AMZN has now grown to an epic up from only a year ago Thu NidStyles Thu HowdyDoody WTF else could one expect for not having to drive out to a store Thu FreeShitter Gee some folks already this tisk tisklol AMZN up nearly today on bullshit do I gotta sell my soul to the fucking devil to get this kind of insider info or what Thu gatorengineer Thu adr Wake me up when the fucking thing is down to where it belongs The stock was up in one week on the back of ABSOLUTELY NOTHING The past has been total bullshit But nobody cares Nobody investigates the accounting nobody audits the books Thu arby And it really doesnt matter because when he speaks the Feds listen He is essentially a Fed because these miracle companies dont just have money thrown at them without some type of pretense In the case of Amazon I am sure that Bezos time as a Wall Street IT guy was rather helpful He was also a hedge fund guy Only point here being is that we have seen a series of these miracles over the last years and they all have many common threads easy money from closeknit investors and relations I suppose thats nothing new but the nearmerging of government and private business is getting awfully questionable Thu L Bean Amazon is soviet in nature much like WalMart There outta be an index for all it reflects on the real state of The Folks Thu VW Nerd Amazon is suddenly unable to shrug off earnings Until now funds were willing to throw money at this company with a PE in excess of without batting an eye Now it matters Crazy Thu Pheonyte And the occasional regulatory TAX Palms must be greased Thu css Thu Donald J Trump Some folks got Amazoned today Im tired of hearing those phrases but it seemed appropriate The fuckers announced a music service to spike the share price right before announcing their quarter cause they knew it would tank it Thu khnum Thu holdbuysell Looking at the cash flow statement one sees B in cash flow from ops Thu NoWayJose Amazon had a chance to be profitable using massive warehouses a well thought out web site to display products and get customers to buy things they dont need and an efficient mailing system Instead they expand into one hour delivery with high overhead Walmart is closing these smaller closetothecustomer stores because of low profits and high costs Amazon is attempting a similar thing but is ADDING the overhead for delivery The model is doomed Thu Wild Theories Thu sun tzu Thu i_call_you_my_base Their stock tanked because they didnt stroke investors and pump their numbers They actually invested in the business and are trying for longerterm growth This simply shows how bullshit wall street and being public is Thu brada How do you tell people your the guy who bought it up at the close Thats kinda like saying hey I am insane Thu moonmac Thu JuliaS THE COMPANY HAS NEVER TURNED A PROFIT THEY ARE STILL BILLIONS IN THE HOLE FROM YEARS OF OPERATING LOSSES Just because they turned a minuscule profit during a few quarters in the past years doesnt mean the company is profitable or will ever be Hello LA LA LAND Id like a ticket to enter please because Im sick and tired of living in reality Thu RopeADope Stop thinking about Amazon like you would an oldschool American company Dont feel bad I fell into the same trap you did until I realized Amazon was not an American idea Thu gatorengineer MSFT is almost a bigger shit show right now PE to on huge revenue drop no new products on the horizon Wow Thu nidaar Thu RRRaskolnikov Sjees I just initiaded a long position I thought that because everyone is buying I will get rich by the end of the year Now more people need to buy PS Dont forget that the economy is bming to the bottom Chicago PMI Durable Goods Orders Nope everything is still fine Thu DeepFriedLizards People like I who live in rural Alaska love Amazon I just received XL dog cages for a pop a very good deal with free delivery Just the shipping alone would have cost me a cage from the same manufacturer I hope theyre in business forever Thu moonmac Clothing sizes are now made to fit little gay wad meth heads Id have to return of my pants and shirts if I shopped online Amazon cant compete with brick and mortar In this day and age its very easy to offer something for sale online package and ship it so why does Amazon need to be the middleman They have massive employee base that tinkers around improving their website but who needs that when information is so readily available online anyway Think about it Amazon spends a ton of money on things that dont add value for the consumer plain and simple Gee look their website offers reviews BFD Its only a matter of time before this gets sorted out in the free market In the meantime Amazon in my opinion is working nonstop to prevent small merchants from being in business with all kinds of dirty tricks Fedex UPS and USPS executives can likely tell some stories Another issue Most people have no idea that overseas there are counterfeits does Amazon want to curb their suppliers from shipping fake goods Doubt it Ive personally received counterfeit products via Amazon Order anything from Amazon and who knows its authenticity Check how easy it is to be a seller on Amazon so who knows who those people are Thu Magnum Einstein Let me explain it this way Imagine you want to buy a set of Sony Model XYZ Headphones They have great reviews You get the headphones and they are counterfeit and fulfilled by Amazon Does that mean everyone else who ordered those got a counterfeit Einstein I heard Rolex makes great watches Einstein Thu _ I find their stuff authentic Never had a problem and its usuallyu much cheaper then driving around sorting thru flooded aisles and finding the right style size etcnot to mention the dangers of parking lots these days even if you are not in SomaliLand Mpls The attack occurred Sunday evening in an apartment complex in the citys Cedar Riverside neighborhood also known as Little Mogadishu for its high concentration of Somali refugees imported from United Nations refugee camps in Africa Abdi allegedly followed the girl out of an elevator He asked for her name and offered his hand to her She shook his hand and Abdi refused to let go Police said he proceeded to rape the girl in the hallway of the apartment building Authorities used video surveillance footage to help track down the suspect who was arrested about hours later on Monday in St Paul The US government has resettled more than Somali refugees since the early s and shipped in another during the most recent fiscal year which ended Sept according to US State Department data Lucky taxpayers Corcoran continued We paid for his resettlement surely his welfare and now we will get to pay for his long imprisonment Thu Magnum Probably over of their products are authentic but its become a big flea market with what appears to be any Tom Dick or Harry able to sell at Amazon as a merchant Those merchants pay fees Online shopping is great but one can almost always find a better deal for the same item sold at Amazon from other merchants who dont have the overhead Do NOT follow this link or you
