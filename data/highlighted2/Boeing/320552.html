Alpha As of the February close <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares had lost since the beginning of the year due to fears of an SEC inquiry and slowing emerging market growth But Boeings fundamentals improved last year The company is growing and the commercial aircraft market is booming Future demand is expected to remain robust Its been a crazy start to the year for the markets which have been incredibly volatile so far in A number of market sectors are getting hit hard and the industrial sector is no different The latest example of a former highflier that is being grounded is aerospace and defense giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA As of its last closing price on February shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had lost more than of their value just since the beginning of this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is seeing a great deal of turbulence due to escalating fears of slowing demand for planes in emerging markets such as China and India Investors are increasingly concerned about the prospect of slowing economic growth in these underdeveloped nations In theory this would be a big drag on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>which is reaping most of its growth from emerging markets In addition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was recently hit by an SEC inquiry into its accounting methods pertaining to the and Dreamliner I believe Boeings selloff has created an excellent opportunity for income investors At its February close <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>yields which I view as an accidental highyield based on shortterm irrationality Thats why I took advantage of the rapid decline in the past few weeks and added shares to my portfolio <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has charted a different course for itself than many other companies in the aerospace and defense industry It is focusing on the commercial market rather than on defense Whereas most of Boeings industry peers have focused on the defense corner of the market Lockheed Martin NYSE LMT and General Dynamics NYSE GD generate and of their respective revenue from defense budgets and government defense spending <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>derives twothirds of its business from commercial markets The reason why I like this strategy is because the commercial aircraft market is booming Despite what the headlines imply demand for aircraft remains robust particularly in the emerging markets In fact the commercial airline order backlog for planes is at a record high Deliveries of commercial aircraft rose in representing the fourth consecutive record year Boeings own momentum continued last year as its commercial aircraft deliveries rose in to reach a company record and it forecasts strong demand from Asia to continue for many years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a robust backlog of nearly airplanes or about seven years of production The company grew revenue by last year which is admirable in a tough currency environment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>generated billion of free cash flow in up year over year Im also not overly concerned about the SEC probe The questions surround Boeings accounting of costs and expected sales of its Dreamliner and planes which is obviously a concern because those are Boeings most iconic planes But as various media outlets have reported this type of program accounting has been in use for decades Its entirely possible the SEC will not take any action and even if it does my opinion is that it is likely to result in fines or some other shortterm financial penalty which shouldnt impair the longterm prospects of the business The drop in Boeings stock price yeartodate is an excellent opportunity for investors and the company itself to buy shares at a great price In December the company announced a new billion stock buyback program The billion buyback replaces the existing billion program which had billion left This is a huge buyback which will accomplish even more at lower prices For example at per share the billion represented about of Boeings market capitalization At billion represents almost of the market capitalization And of course theres the dividend Along with its buyback announcement <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>also increased its dividend by The new dividend payout of per share amounts to a very strong yield based on Boeings February closing price Boeings stock hasnt yielded since the financial crisis which to me seems to indicate the selling is overdone Thats why I added <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to my portfolio during the recent sell off and am looking forward to many years of rising profits and dividends from my investment
