class='textDiv'>Here Is Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Did Not Go For A MAX Part The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha A <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX stretch would lack a strong competitive position A MAX stretch will be nowhere close to being a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>replacement In some of my articles I have dealt with the stretch of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA MAX or better said the shrink of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX If you are interested in knowing what exactly changed on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX I would advise you to read my article Stretch Or Shrink Here Is What Is New On The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX I also pointed out that history has shown that the smallest members of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus OTCPKEADSF A series have never been best sellers So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is coming up with a MAX shrink which will not bring the company significantly more sales So you might wonder why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is doing all this and maybe the better question you could ask is Why is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>coming up with a redesigned MAX while it needs an airplane to compete with the Airbus Aneo and AneoLR In Part I explained why the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX cannot compete with the Airbus Aneo In this part I will look at what a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X could look like and why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>did not launch it So in the previous article I concluded that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX is underpowered and it lacks capacity That will be the starting point for a simple design for the MAX As I pointed out in the previous article the MAX carries passengers versus passengers for the Airbus Aneo So a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X would need a stretch that accommodates extra seats or rows According to my model this would add between kg and kg to the aircrafts weight The stretch would add roughly meters to the fuselage As weight increases a natural thing to start thinking about in the designing process is the use of a bigger wing For a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX a span increase however would not be possible as it would change the gate category of the aircraft which currently is C A requirement for any stretch would be that the aircrafts gate designation would not change Aircraft with a C designation can have a maximum wing span of meters the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX already has a wing span of m So a bigger wing is not one of the possibilities The only thing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would likely change is the use of a stronger wing which adds roughly kg to the aircrafts weight So the next thing you would like to change is engine thrust The CFM LEAPB turbofans used on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX provide a thrust of kNkN The current MAX is already underpowered This means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>needs to opt for a more powerful turbofan this turbofan would be the CFM LEAPA which would add roughly kNkN in thrust This however has drawbacks The LEAPA is heavier and has a bigger diameter The first drawback means that the weight will increase by roughly kg The second drawback means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will need to increase the length of the gear strut to maintain sufficient ground clearance and the aerodynamic efficiency will decrease a bit So in order to maintain sufficient ground clearance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will need to increase the gear strut length combined with the higher overall weight this means that the weight of the landing gear will increase as well Since the weight of the landing gear system is closely related to the maximum takeoff weight of the aircraft the landing gear is quite a heavy component Strengthen and increasing the length of the gear strut will likely add kgkg to the weight If we compare the Airbus Aneo with seats to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX with seats we get the following results Figure Performance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX versus Airbus Aneo Source What can be seen is that a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX will only have a slight edge over the Airbus Aneo Up until a trip distance of nm the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX would have a per seat advantage of roughly On the longer trips the fuel burn for the Airbus Aneo will be lower The Airbus Aneo however can easily seat passengers An Airbus Aneo with seats will be performing better than a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX The purpose of this article series was to show how a MAX performs versus Airbus Aneo and how performance and what a stretch would look like The main conclusion is that a stretch as well as the MAX would be less efficient than an Airbus Aneo <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>chose to redesign the MAX because it could simply adopt the wing and gear from the MAX For a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would lose some commonality due to the use of a new turbofan and add a few billions in development costs for strengthening the landing gear The end product would still have a hard time competing with the Airbus Aneo and in no way would be an answer to the Airbus Aneo LR A stretch would only be marginally better than a seat Aneo On the longer trips the Airbus Aneo would even be more efficient Development costs of a few billion dollars would make the MAX quite pricey Additionally the Airbus A neo can easily serve as a seat aircraft That is a potential a MAX in the way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>looked at it simply does not have The MAX with seats would be a costly endeavor with very little competitiveness Besides the limited competitiveness of a stretch there are some other problems <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>currently is close to rolling out the MAX to commercial service which can enter service during the first half of The MAX would likely follow after that The MAX and MAX will follow in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would likely want to monitor performance of the MAX before stretching After that follows finalizing the design of the stretch and certification of the redesigned parts which adds to the costs In the jet maker will be launching the X So the product launch schedule for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>commercial aircraft is a crowded one Additionally the company is aiming to have a replacement ready by This means that development of this new aircraft family would already start in This gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>very little space to launch a MAX The jet maker could as well wait a few years and come up with an aircraft that will actually be able to compete with the Airbus Aneo rather than launching an expensive half answer now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>probably also foresees this and has chosen to make a quick and cheaper redesign of the MAX and save a few billion dollars that it could be using for an allnew aircraft If you would like to receive updates for my upcoming
