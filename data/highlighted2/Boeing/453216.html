Look At Boeings Commercial Orders And Deliveries In June The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha As part of the annual order and delivery battle between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA and Airbus OTCPKEADSF OTCPKEADSY I provide a monthly overview and analysis The May report can be read here In this article I will have a look at the orders and deliveries in June Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>deliveries up until June Source In May <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>booked orders June saw a lower order inflow which partly has to do with some order announcements being held off until the Farnborough Air Show that will start on the th of July <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>received orders wide body orders and narrow body orders FedEx NYSE FDX ordered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Freighters part of the mega order it placed with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>unidentified customers ordered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX BBJ each Okay Airways ordered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX part of a deal that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>announced in February The updated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>figures show that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been able to gather orders for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in the first days of July Disappointing in June is the loss of orders for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>At list prices the orders are valued bn but after discounts the market value is closer to bn Compared to June order inflow fell The months June and July however are months that you cannot compare Last year the biannual Paris Air Show took place in June This years biannual Farnborough International Airshow takes place in July So it is not possible to make a meaningful yearoveryear comparison this month During the first months of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>received orders versus orders in the first months of an decline This figure is also skewed by the Paris Air Show last year in June but also shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is doing quite well maintaining a strong order inflow Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>deliveries up until June Source AeroAnalysis For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>guided slightly lower reflecting lower production rate on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program and the transition towards the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX combined with a gap on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NG In June <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>delivered aircraft valued at bn Deliveries increased by units compared to last month Split between narrow and wide body deliveries was a split Freighters were delivered to FedEx Korean Air took delivery of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I Higher deliveries is caused by higher delivery volume for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Dreamliners were delivered of which were <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s It can be concluded that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will have the upper hand in the Dreamliner deliveries which bodes well for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as the aircraft has higher profit margins and brings in more cash Delivery volume was above the monthly average In order to reach its delivery target <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will need deliveries per month for the remaining months this year Just like in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is targeting a booktobill ratio In June <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>booked orders and delivered air frames resulting in a booktobill ratio of Yeartodate the booktobill ratio including cancellations is In todays customer spotlight we have Okay Airways Chinas first privately run airline Okay Airways is a Chinese lowcost carrier that primarily operates within China but does have destinations in Japan Thailand and South Korea The airline started commercial service in March and now has a fleet of aircraft <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Xian Ma In February the airline reached an agreement with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>for the purchase of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAXs and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAXs The deal was subject to approval from the Chinese government The aircraft that are listed by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in the order overview of June likely are the orders for the MAX This brings the total outstanding orders for Okay Airways to while the remaining aircraft that were part of the agreement still await approval Figure Wall Street Horizon WallStHorizon Create your own custom event calendar today The reported deliveries will have an impact on earnings that according to The Wall Street Horizon event calendar will be reported on the th of July before marketopen Order inflow was naturally weak prior to Farnborough International Air Show which is used as stage to announce big orders Deliveries were higher than expected Boeings booktobill ratio is there is some work to do for Boeings marketing team In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>achieved its booktobill target at the very last moment Despite lower anticipated deliveries in I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to be facing a challenge to achieve its booktobill target In April I published an article in which I stated that the order books of jet makers are not bubbles but should decline at some point In that article I shared my thoughts and expected order inflow to decline in a few years from now With oil prices having declined ever since chances are the order books will decline sooner than I expected at first With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>just barely meeting its target last year might be the year in which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will not achieve its booktobill ratio <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is currently on its desired booktobill ratio but Boeings marketing team still has to sell almost aircraft to reach its target However given that orders tend to increase from Q and onwards it can be said that things are looking OK for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>While I do not expect a whole lot of orders from this years Farnborough Airshow this years airshow will tell a lot about Boeings ability to reach its desired booktobill ratio If you would like to receive updates for my upcoming articles please click the Follow text at the top of this
