Delta CSeries Order Is A Win For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha The CSeries aircraft will have minimal impact on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>sales An order by Delta would be a substantial stamp of approval for the CSeries and likely would put an end to the insane discounts being offered by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to keep airlines from ordering the CSeries Despite concerns of a CS such an aircraft is far off and unlikely to arrive long before a replacement As Delta Air Lines NYSE DAL narrowbody aircraft order inches closer to being finalized and announced more and more news is being leaked regarding the status The most recent sources have indicated that an order for Airbus OTCPKEADSF A and Bombardier OTCQXBDRAF OTCQXBDRBF CSeries jets is in the works something that many have said would be bad for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA particularly a CSeries order I however believe quite the opposite and believe a loss for Bombardier would be a win for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Despite a slowdown in demand for large longrange jets such as the demand for singleisle planes has remained fairly stable so far Losing an order to Bombardier is not an endall or catastrophe for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and I believe investors are not seeing this For the United NYSE UAL order Goldman Sachs reported that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>cut the price of the aircraft to million per frame Goldman Sachs also believes these aircraft are being sold at a loss which is highly likely considering United purchased the aircraft for million each compared to their list price of million Selling at these sorts of losses seems absurd considering there are unfilled orders which at production levels of aircraft per year would take over years to fulfill An order by Delta would add a lot of momentum to the CSeries aircraft and would add a major stamp of approval for the aircraft that would carry much more weight than an order from any other airline as I described in my article here One positive is that such an event will likely end the insane discounts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was offering to keep airlines from ordering the CSeries product and ending the AirbusBoeing duopoly that was inevitably coming to an end anyway Img Average aircraft capacity over time The CSeries is a niche aircraft that does not even compete in all aspects with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>the smallest aircraft <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>makes The aircraft seats at most people when configured in a normal class configuration which is at the low end of the capacity Even launch customer Swiss Airlines has ordered the ANEO and ANEO aircraft equivalent to the alongside their CSeries order Table <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Outstanding Orders The demand for aircraft in the CSeries size category has significantly fallen in recent years as the average number of seats per aircraft has continuously risen A quick look at the order book shown in Table above for the Max shows that the variant has orders compared to for the larger Max and for the even larger Max variant Many aircraft orders today still go to airlines that are run by the respective countrys government Many deals involving aircraft for these airlines are negotiated with governments alongside <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>so technology aside the will win these orders as the deals are more about maintaining a good relationship with the United States than getting the absolute best product Despite the CSeries technical advantages the Canadian government will not hold the sway of the US government in these types of deals Despite what I mentioned above I do see why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is concerned with the CSeries gaining traction and one major reason is the proposed CS The Bombardier CS is what worries <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as once Bombardier gets a foothold with the CS the assumption has been that it may venture into a larger aircraft The wing of the CS was designed with a larger aircraft in mind adding further weight to this possibility A CS would seat around passengers at most and could be a major competitor in the much larger seat market Despite such a possibility a CS is likely to be very far off and may struggle more than many would assume Bombardier is in no position right now to imminently launch any new program with its current financial situation and will need many more orders for the existing CS and CS before it will have the resources and confidence to proceed with another variant Its Q turboprop along with regional jets are also due some attention before the company can even think about proceeding with a CS In addition Bombardier would have to improve its financial situation drastically and the Canadian government would be unable to give aid to Bombardier to develop the CS In the past European governments giving Airbus aid for the A and A projects were ruled illegal several years ago by the WTO So by the time Bombardier has the CSeries customer base has given the Q and regional jets some attention and has the financial ability to develop the CS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will likely be working on its replacement and the CS based on the older CS design will be much less competitive It seems absurd that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is losing money to maintain the duopoly with Airbus in the singleisle segment when there will be absolutely no stopping the COMAC the Chinese aerospace manufacturer from breaking the duopoly with its C Unlike the Bombardier CSeries the C actually targets the most lucrative segment of the single isle market In addition the aircraft is backed by the Chinese government and the government has ordered Chinese airlines to buy the aircraft to support it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has helped the C development by providing suppliers in China such as Xian Aircraft Cooperation with highly advanced tooling and equipment to make parts for its aircraft These suppliers also have contracts with competitors such as COMAC and have been given permission by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>under the terms of the export licence to use this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>tooling for COMAC products Whatever the reason for allowing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>tooling to be used for COMAC it seems insane to indirectly assist COMAC in succeeding while simultaneously expending significant resources to stop Bombardier which is much less of a competitor from succeeding Img Projected deliveries of aircraft by size An order for the CSeries from Delta will likely give the CSeries program muchneeded momentum and could finally end the BoeingAirbus duopoly in the seat single aisle market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>spending money to keep Bombardier out of a small segment of the market is silly when COMAC backed by the Chinese government is going to break up the duopoly anyway <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should use this opportunity to maintain its strong position in the seat market and develop a replacement that airlines have continuously been asking for In addition the company should focus on improving the for the long term and coming up with an eventual replacement This seems like it would be a better use of resources than fighting a losing battle that is losing money trying to maintain market share Having the CSeries finally validated with a major order by an airline like Delta should put an end to or at least reduce the sort of insane discounts airlines like United received something that should be good for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shareholders going forward Focusing on replacing the aircraft and making the more technologically competitive against the CSeries and the C seem like better things for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to do Playing the price game will not lead the company down a very positive path especially when it is doing so against the C in the future as COMAC could be willing to absorb large losses to get a foothold in the market I therefore believe that any selloff in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares as a result of a loss to Bombardier would be a good buying opportunity I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own
