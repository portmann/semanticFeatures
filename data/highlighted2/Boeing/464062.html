Seeking Alpha Smallest member of narrow body families historically have been the worst sellers Addition of revenue generating seats will not increase demand for the MAX During the Farnborough Airshow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA announced that it will be stretching the design of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>In this article I will explain why this will not make a big difference for the smallest member of the MAX family in terms of order inflow Additionally I will explain why not stretching the coming from the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was a mistake The commercial members of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Original series are the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and C The entered commercial service with Lufthansa in February and could carry passengers in class configuration The a stretch of the could carry between and passengers in class configuration and entered commercial service in April with United Airlines <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>sold a total of to commercial airlines s and s The smallest member of the OS only had a market share of The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Classic was the successor of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Original Series and consisted of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and The entered service with USAir in November and could carry passengers The a ft stretch of the could carry passengers and entered service in September with Piedmont Airlines The was a shrink of the and was developed on customer demand to replace the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>by an airplane with better fuel economics In February Southwest NYSE LUV became the first operator of the which could carry up to passengers What should be noted is that the was the smallest member of the Classic family and accounted for of the deliveries The the baseline model represented of the deliveries with the remaining for the The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NG was the biggest change to the family to make it competitive with the Airbus A The family consisted of variants The was the first model to enter commercial service and can carry up to passengers The a fuselage stretch of the entered service in and could carry up to passengers The entered service in but lacked competitive strength and was ultimately replaced by the ER which can carry up to passengers The a shrink of the entered service in and carried passengers This made it a direct replacement of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The was eventually eliminated as there was little to no demand for the airframe Table Deliveries and share division for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Next Generation What can be seen from Table is that the smallest member of the NG family had a share in the orders of only The base model had a share of almost the stretch has a share and the double stretch has a share of The MAX family is Boeings answer to the Airbus Aneo to retain market share The MAX and MAX are configured to carry more passengers while the MAX would initially seat as many passengers as the An important conclusion that can be drawn is that the smallest member of each generation always was the slowest seller In total the smallest members of all families combined hauled in only of the total orders The same counts for Airbus where its smallest member of the narrow body family hauled OTCPKEADSF in just of the total orders Observing the trend of small members being bad sellers it can be said that the addition of extra seats wont strengthen the MAX business case but that is something <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>already acknowledged <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said the move to add more seats on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX was driven by customer wishes AeroAnalysis however believes that this move has more to do with the existing and upcoming competition from Bombardiers OTCQXBDRAF CSeries The biggest mistake <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>actually made is that they did not stretch the from the start but chose for it to be a replacement In my view that is an irreversible mistake that plays <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>parts in its competitive battle with the Airbus A families If you would
