class='textDiv'>Dividend Growth Investors Might Want To Look At <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been more affected by the recent market downturn than other stocks After starting very well into and reaching a new high of in February Boeings NYSE BA share price fell back to levels that were last seen in January Of course this needs to be seen in the context of an overall declining market but the stock underperformed the major indices and stands essentially where it was months ago The good news is that this development makes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>worth considering again The stock has become more attractively valued based on a lower PE as well as a higher yield and offers a growing dividend Fundamentally not much has changed for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>BCA <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Commercial Airplanes has an impressive order backlog which will fuel growth for the foreseeable future and the number of aircraft deliveries is projected to climb from in to in and will grow further in the next few years The fundamental outlook for the commercial aircraft market remains positive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>forecasts demand for more than new planes without regional jets in its longterm outlook until Total revenues increased by in the first halfyear with BCA being up while BDS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Defense Space Security reported top line decline Earnings are projected to rise over the next years The company returns large amounts cash to shareholders through buybacks and growing dividends However Boeings recent figures do not look that bright Earnings from operations declined for both BCA and BDS and the margin contracted in the half year There are some issues which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has to deal with starting with the deferred production costs for the which still continue to climb This figure increased by M to B in Q In the latest earnings call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>expected a similar increase in Q before the program could finally become cash positive in Q and deferred production could start to decline at the end of the year Hopefully the outlook will finally become reality since this projection is not new and already last year Boeings management had expected cash flow breakeven by the end of Order income for BCA has slowed down recently and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>only received only new net orders until end of August on deliveries If this trend continues the company will obtain fewer orders than aircraft deliveries for the first time in years For comparison in and more than net orders were received With an existing order backlog of planes worth B theres not much to worry about yet but with a growing number of aircraft deliveries orders have to follow inevitably to utilize production and the past tells us that airlines tend to cancel orders quickly in times of a crisis Further more there is the KC tanker program where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had to recognize another charge of M M after tax which negatively impacted EPS in the second quarter by This has caused <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to lower the core EPS guidance between to Boeings product mix is another important topic which impacts the bottom line The transition from older aircraft which are highly profitable and generate lots of cash to new ones has to progress smoothly in order not to impact BCAs profitability For example <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>sees a dilutive impact from a higher number of and deliveries in the second quarter which is said to be partly responsible for the margin contraction The and stand for and of Boeings deliveries in The rising share of s as a result of the production increase to per month last year and further to airframes per month in will dilute Boeings margin even more unless production costs fall The transition to the new X in a few years is another important factor and selling as many as possible of the old version to ensure a smooth transition is crucial for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>So far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been quite successful with orders and commitments for the old that were received in the first half year Finally the first delivery of the MAX is expected in and initiates the transition from the NG to the new generation of the most successful commercial airplane in history Some positive news is the order for freighters from FedEx including the option for more which was received in June Although it will not have a major impact when looking at deliveries per year building more of this old model should be a very profitable business and it will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to increase the production rate from to per month in While Boeings stock trades at the same price as it did months ago the valuation has become more attractive as earnings per share grew and the dividend increased noticeably <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>guides toward core EPS in the range of to down from to as a result of the tanker charge and GAAP EPS between and down from and for this year This compares to core EPS of and GAAP EPS of in Based on todays analyst consensus of for and for next year the FY PE stands at and the FY PE at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>pays a quarterly dividend of or for the full year After the latest share price decline the yield now stands at This is the highest yield since and I expect another healthy raise with the first payment in Boeings dividend grew by in and in This dividend growth history in combination with a rather low payout ratio of only based on the expected diluted GAAP EPS bodes well for the next years BA Dividend Yield TTM data by YCharts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>also spends billions on share repurchases which automatically help to grow EPS In the second quarter the company bought back million shares for B In total B were returned to shareholders through dividends and repurchases from January to June The market currently does not favor BA which is down from its alltime high earlier in the year The worries about China leading to the question whether demand for new airplanes in the country and in other emerging markets will fall short of expectations and negatively impact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Should the stock market turmoil continue there is a fair chance that the stock might fall below which could be a very good opportunity to load up this stock at an attractive price and for a dividend yield including the outlook for more next year I still consider <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>a very attractive combination of a growth and an income stock despite the not entirely convincing business performance Trading in the range between and I believe that the stock is more attractively priced again and a clear buy if it falls below The fundamental outlook is intact for at least the next decade which makes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>a
