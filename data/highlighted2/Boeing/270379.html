These are lease costs only and exclude fuel, labor, and other costs.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even if you throw <i>more</i> jets in there and add up all the labor and fuel costs , we do not see this total cost coming anywhere close to eclipsing the $ 8.7 billion Amazon spent on shipping last year .  (Surprise) </span>The motivations extend beyond just saving on long-term shipping costs.Two Christmases ago, UPS's inability to keep up with Amazon's holiday orders led many Christmas gifts to arrive after December 25 .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This cost Amazon some money in the form of $ 20 gift cards , but <i>more</i> deeply , it affected Amazon 's reputation ( late Christmas gifts are never a good thing ) .  (Surprise) </span>A reputation hit at the hands of UPS likely inspired CEO Jeff Bezos to make creating an independent delivery system a priority.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As a result , Amazon <b>apparently</b> began running an air cargo trial out of Wilmington , Ohio .  (Uncertainty) </span>Now, Amazon has (or will soon have) trailer trucks, planes, drivers, and drones at its disposal.It is no secret that Amazon is leading the e-commerce shift , so losing the Amazon business will hurt UPS both now and in the long-term as Amazon retail continues to grow.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although we think it unlikely to happen any time soon , the threat of Amazon becoming a direct competitor with UPS for third-party e-commerce delivery is a <b>possibility</b> considering Amazon 's path with AWS .  (Uncertainty) </span>All things considered, Amazon leasing 20 planes is a big deal for UPS.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>UPS will lose Amazon business at some point in time , and we <b>believe</b> that a large portion of this loss will happen in 2016 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The current valuation does not account for this lost business and the potential longer-running threat that the gig economy and drones pose , so we reaffirm our short position on the stock and <b>believe</b> 2016 will present several headwinds .
