Alpha The end of the ExportImport Bank ends the long standing support it provided to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company Mocked as Boeings Bank the charters annual statements revealed that up to billion of its total guarantees for the year of were in Boeings favor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Commercial Airplanes CEO Ray Conner believes that the loss of the ExIm Bank puts the company at a huge competitive disadvantage As June ended so did the ExportImport Bank ExIm Bank and with it took the long standing support for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSE BA down with it Amid congressional infighting the charter which was started by President Franklin D Roosevelt to provide loans for overseas businesses that buy expensive US products expired Famously <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>gained significant benefit from the support it received from the ExIm Bank so much so that the Chicagobased company even lobbied hard for the continuation of the charter So how important was the ExportImport Bank for the American aircraft manufacturer The whole purpose of the ExIm Bank was to promote US exports and increase employment at home by providing financing to foreign customers for purchasing goods and services from US companies This in turn also provided American companies to compete with their international rivals who more than often received state support in their businesses Unfortunately after more than years of operations the charter slowly started to favor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>more and more and it came to the point where the ExIm Bank was mockingly called The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Bank A closer look at ExIm Banks annual statement reveals that out of the billion in grand total guarantees it had signed on for in the fiscal year of approximately billion or were in favor of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Not only does this show how biased the charter might have been but it also shows how dependent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was on it Its no surprise that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Commercial Airplanes CEO Ray Conner believes that the loss of the ExIm Bank puts the company at a huge competitive disadvantage Interestingly enough there are some companies which had been rallying for the ExIm Bank to stop its operations Companies like Delta Air Lines NYSE DAL cited the loan guarantees offered by the charter to foreign airlines as damaging to US airline prospects since it allowed the foreign companies to reduce their cost of capital in upgrading their fleet and thus charging more competitive ticket prices against domestic producers Now the closure of the ExIm Bank does not necessarily mean that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will immediately start seeing losses ExIm has said that it will stay open to continue servicing the billion in existing obligations with its operating budget approved through th September Moreover in a second quarter deliveries report published by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>it was clear that the American airplane manufacturer had surpassed its European rival Airbus OTCPKEADSY with deliveries made in the first half of while Airbus delivered commercial planes in the same period Boeings total deliveries for the first had showed that it had showed an improvement of yearoveryear Despite a troubling start it seems like the Max and Dreamliner models are gaining popularity amongst airlines internationally with a total of Max deliveries and Dreamliner deliveries made in the first half of this year This growth in commercial plane demand can be attributed to the improvement in passenger and freight traffic in emerging markets a scenario which has the potential to carry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>through this ExIm Bank ordeal with some ease However where Airbus does beat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is with its total new orders which stand at as compared to the Chicagobased companys Last months Paris Air Show was just another display of how close the race between these two companies as they both managed to impress potential customers Unfortunately the closure of the ExIm Bank will eventually have a significant impact on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and might see a different situation emerge in the commercial airplane manufacturing market which has been dominated by these two rivals for the past few decades Its a good thing that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is having a great year so far in terms of its operating performance which is also represented in its healthy stock price In the past weeks the company stock has gone up by more than to its current position of per share and on nd June the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>board approved a quarterly dividend of per share payable th September The latest quarters earnings surprised analysts by posting a better than expected EPS of Now since the current obligations of the ExIm Bank are still going to be financed we can expect the company to meet its expected annual revenue of billion to billion staying on course to deliver aircrafts this year As a closing note I would like to point out that the aptly labeled death of the ExIm Bank might not necessarily last There are more than companies including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>trying to revive the charter More importantly given the current economic condition of the US it seems like the Democrats and some likeminded Republicans might actually manage to revise the Banks closure Despite calls from the IMF to hold back till Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen has repeated that the central bank is likely to start raising interest rates this year Official figures published by the US Labor Department showed that US jobs growth and factory sales had slowed down as figures from April and May were also revised Despite being such an uncertain environment we do know that it is also a very delicate one as well Theres a chance that in the coming days if conditions continue to head the way they are then we might see the ExportImport Bank back in action But for the sake of analysis lets also assume that the charter is not revived and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has to move on without its help over the next few years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would slowly start losing its market share to Airbus and revenues would decline Along with its revenues the company will have to resort to bigger discounts which will ultimately eat into its profitability However it wont be an easy battle for Airbus either since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>boasts an impeccable reputation amongst its clients for the top notch service it provides before and after sales Overall the ExIm Banks demise is going to have a very noticeable negative impact on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>But investors should not offload BA stock any time soon The company stock still has some juice left in it and more importantly we need to wait and see what the future holds for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and whether the ExIm Bank will be restored And lets not forget that after years of support theres a good chance that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can flourish without the training wheels it had been wearing for decades Source The Impact Of ExIm Banks Death On The
