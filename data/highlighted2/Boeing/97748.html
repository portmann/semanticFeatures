</span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Rate cut is a sign of weakness of the current order book but longterm prospects remain bright Air cargo traffic is expected to have an annual growth rate of In one of my previous articles published in December I wrote about the announced rate cut for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA and concluded the following In almost three years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has cut the production rate for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>from two aircraft per month aircraft per year to one aircraft per month aircraft per year a drop The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>depends on the freighter market while the freighter market depends on global economic recovery If recovery is not fast enough and order books are thin <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is forced cut back rates as it did The cut itself should not have a major financial impact production rate are fairly low and the rate cut from to aircraft per month has been done incrementally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>currently has orders on file for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I of which have been delivered This leaves unfilled orders At current and announced production rates this means there still is over months of production for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I There have been rumors that Arik Air an African airline converted its order for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I airframes to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ERS However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>still has the order from Arik Air listed so it is unclear what happened to this order but it is likely that the order has been converted This means that there are unfilled orders left Russian airline Transaero has <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aircraft on order but it remains unclear whether the airlines will take delivery of these airframes In May it seemed Transaero would take delivery of their Airbus OTCPKEADSF A aircraft but in June Airbus confirmed that the airline is likely to defer those deliveries If Boeings I will suffer the same fate there are unfilled orders left So from the unfilled orders a maximum of orders might drop out of the order book Korean Air will start taking delivery of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I later this year which is a good sign for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>For the freighter variant of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>there are a total of orders of which have been delivered leaving unfilled orders At a production rate of aircraft per month this is equivalent to months of work Combining the unfilled orders for both variants and excluding the doubtful orders there is still at least of months of production in the order books Including the letter of intent for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F signed during this years Paris Air show there is still years of work The rate cut is necessary for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>if the company wants to benefit from the growth that is expected in the cargo market for the coming years The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I has a unique payloadrange capability which means that as soon as cargo air traffic growth gets near the expected annual rate of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can expect orders for their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Additionally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>sold over Fs and those aircraft will be replaced at some point in the next decades as well So the long term looks good for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and it is key to keep deliveries spread out over time to allow for order inflow to pick up pace Rate cut is a sign of weakness of the current order book but long term prospect remains bright Demand should materialize soon supported by growth in the air cargo market and replacement of the older <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F Boeings rate cut has minor financial impact but positions the company well to benefit from the upcoming boom in the cargo market Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities
