style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Deferral aligns the delivery schedule with growth schedules and requirement to replace aircraft Southwest Airlines NYSE LUV has announced it will be delaying the delivery of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX to preserve cash While the airline has delayed as much as of their outstanding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX order it still will be the launch customer for the aircraft In this article I will have a look at the delay and explain why I do not expect this to be a structural problem for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA Before having a look at the deferral of deliveries it is important to understand why an airline would even think about deferring delays The different forecasts provided by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus have one thing in common In the coming years the air travel market will boom once again So the question you might ask yourself is if the market is booming why would you even think about deferring The answer to that is actually pretty easy but it has does have some facets One of the reasons to defer deliveries could be overcapacity Ordering aircraft happens with a certain growth pattern in mind Overcapacity can occur when short term growth rates fall short of expectations while airlines maintain the predefined delivery schedule Figures from and the start of show that on average legacy carriers have increased their capacity more than they were able to realize growth in the number of carried passengers The capacity growth outpaced the traffic growth by roughly Capacity growth for Southwest has been in line with traffic growth in Q There are a lot of variables that can change by the time you have to take delivery of the airframe and I think that is what happened in the case of Southwest Figure Orders placed for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX by Southwest versus oil prices Source wwwAeroAnalysisnet In December Southwest ordered aircraft and became the launch customer for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX The company added orders and now has MAX and MAX aircraft on order The company secured early spots which is something you would do when there is an urge for having the airframes available as soon as possible Capacity expansion or cost reduction could be some reasons to try to secure early spots In the case of Southwest and other carriers the airframes were ordered when oil prices were high However since the purchase of the airframes the fuel prices have declined by roughly An airline does not only pay fuel costs but also has capital costs so there is a tradeoff that needs to be made here between capital costs and fuel costs Currently it is likely that the advantage of lower fuel costs does not outweigh the higher capital costs related to newer and more efficient aircraft AeroAnalysis estimated insurance costs to be million higher per airframe per year for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX on top of being already million more expensive compared to buying a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The saving in fuel costs are estimated to be million per year What becomes clear is that savings in fuel costs are not high enough to justify taking delivery of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX now The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s in the Southwest fleet are young so the MAX will be used as a replacement Comparing the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX the insurance costs for the MAX would be million higher annually while the aircraft is already million more expensive Additionally the fuel costs are higher as well What becomes clear is that with the current fuel prices the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX is not a very appealing airplane Especially for airlines that have a big number of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX aircraft on order and do have sufficient airframes in their fleet or cheaper alternatives on order deferral is a step that should not surprise anybody Figure Delivery schedule Southwest Airlines Source wwwinvestorssouthwestcom Southwest aims to grow its fleet by roughly annually through At the end of the carrier has aircraft in service A two percent increase implies a net addition of aircraft annually through By the airline will have roughly aircraft in service In the outer right column it can be seen that through including options deliveries were scheduled Sticking to the growth scheme this means that Southwest would have to phase out aircraft through In the first phase of the fleet revision the Classic s will be removed from service In the second phase that starts in the older <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will be removed from service The airline has now chosen to defer deliveries of MAX aircraft that were scheduled for delivery between and accelerate the delivery of the current generation aircraft The earlier retirement of the Classic aircraft should increase revenue and cut costs for the relatively old airframes In total Southwest had scheduled MAX deliveries for the timeframe This means that over of the aircraft that were scheduled for delivery have been delayed One thing that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>investors might ask themselves is Should I worry The answer is simple No The deferral by Southwest is related to a few things Low fuel prices make the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX an expensive the replacement compared to current generation aircraft Additionally Southwest has a certain fleet and capacity growth target in mind replacing the smaller <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>with the bigger MAX would certainly result in unwanted capacity growth A last reason for Southwest to defer deliveries until after is the economic viable life of the first <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>being reached in that year In short the deferral is a result of Southwest aligning their delivery schedule with the actual need to replace aging aircraft What can be said is that the decision to defer is a healthy one by Southwest to squeeze the maximum out of their current aircraft avoid higher capital costs and maintain healthy capital expenditures For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>this does not say anything about demand for the aircraft For some airlines the lower fuel prices directly have led to a lower urge to introduce fuel efficient aircraft But there are enough airlines that actually need the MAX aircraft to support their fleet expansion So for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>the deferral is not a bad thing and the company will not have any problems filling the slots that became available If you would like to receive updates
