charges resulted in a quarterly loss for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Underlying results excluding charges were strong during Q Prior to announcing its Q earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA announced it would be recognizing almost B in charges during the second quarter of Additionally the company reaffirmed its revenue and cash flow guidance So there really did not seem to be a lot to expect from Boeings earnings today We basically already knew that the charge would result in an earnings miss compared to estimates from last month and the most important metrics were already reaffirmed Figure Revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Q Earnings Source AeroAnalysisnet What can be seen is that yearoveryear revenue was flat In the second quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Commercial Airplanes saw revenue rising by or million partly offset by revenues for the Defense and Space unit being million or lower For the H revenue things are the other way around BDS revenues increased by while Commercial Airplanes revenues declined by This is also the pattern that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>revenues will likely follow this year slightly lower revenues with the BCA department seeing modest revenue declines and some revenue increases for the BDS department Operating cash flow was stable year over year at B Free cash flow contracted slightly by million Yeartodate operating cash flow increased to B a increase Free cash flow rose to B a increase So in terms of cash flow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is living up to expectations I also see this as a major reason for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares being up today So revenue and cash flow are actually looking good The ugly part in Boeings report is in its earnings but the company already communicated the charges it would be taking Figure EPS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Q Source AeroAnalysisnet What immediately becomes visible is the impact of the charge which left the company with a loss of per share or million for the second quarter Operating margin for the second quarter was <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Commercial Aircraft took B in pretax charges resulting in a net loss of million for the second quarter The charge erased almost all of the BCA earnings leaving a meager million in H earnings BDS earnings reflect the tanker charge of million but earnings were still strong at million For H the BDS earnings are million a increase compared to last year Even with the charge included the margins were better than last year This is caused by the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>recognized a charge in its Q earnings and continued improvement in cost reduction and efficiency increases So the charges have a highly dilutive impact on earnings However assuming that multibillion charges will not become a habit it is important to look at the adjusted EPS as well The adjusted EPS shows that the underlying results excluding the charges are perfect The company showed a EPS increase year over year while analysts seemed to be expecting the underlying result to be worse Including the charge the EPS consensus was a negative So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>reported betterthanexpected earnings due to its strong underlying results In its K filing that contained some details about the charges it would be taking <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>already said that revenue and operating cash flow guidance were reaffirmed So basically the only things that were likely to change were the RD expenses EPS and profit margins for the full year That is also what happened <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>decreased GAAP EPS forecast to from and Core EPS from to What can be seen is that the range shifted down by while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>recognized per share in charges This means that excluding charges <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>expects EPS to be approximately higher RD costs are expected to be B instead of B completely reflecting the pretax charge for two <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s being reclassified as RD costs Boeings earnings were impacted by the charges it had to take but cash flow and revenues were more than satisfactory Additionally the revision of the EPS guidance was probably not as bad as many including me had expected I think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>did a fine job in communicating with its investors when it announced it would be taking billions in charges Some of these charges were already expected by analysts which means that there were no big surprises when the charge was announced nor in its earnings report Additionally the underlying results exceeded expectations At the time of writing shares are trading higher quite impressive given the fact that the company just showed the impact of a multibillion charge on its earnings If you would like to receive updates for my upcoming articles please click the Follow text at the top of this page next to my
