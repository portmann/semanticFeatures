In 2015, this number was upped to ~38,000, signaling an increase in demand despite the oil price depression which started in 2014 and continues to this day.OEM backlogs have been on the increasing side, despite a sustained ramp-up in production.Lessors such as AerCap have also reported growing order placements for next-gen aircraft, as noted above.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , it <b>appears</b> that the investors are so myopically focused on the delay of the Astronics ' 777X order ( unsurprisingly , given that the delay was the primary reason for the y/y drop in bookings ) as a leading indicator of falling demand that they have missed out on other numerous positives .  (Uncertainty) </span>Per Astronics' investor presentation, the 777 has the largest content per plane at ~$235k, followed by the 737 at ~$100k, and 787 at ~$45k.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Per <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> 's management , the OEM plans to ramp up the production rates on these models very significantly in the near-term ( emphasis mine ) : Turning to individual BCA programs , given the 737 's robust backlog of <b>nearly</b> 4,400 firm orders and continued healthy global demand , we have decided to move ahead with an additional production rate increase in 2019 to 57 aircraft per month . (Boeing: Uncertainty) </span>As we announced previously, we plan to raise production from 42 a month now to 47 in 2017, followed by 52 a month in 2018... ...On the 777, we captured 101 orders over the last two years.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And <i>earlier</i> this month , we booked orders for another six from Air China , putting us off to a good start in 2016 .  (Surprise) </span>Our 777 backlog stands at 224 aircraft... ...On the 787 program, we captured 71 net orders for the year, which further shows the healthy market demand for this compelling wide body airplane.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The 787 's backlog of <b>nearly</b> 800 orders fully supports our planned production rate increases to 12 per month in 2016 and 14 per month later this decade .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We have now delivered 366 787s to date , including <i>more</i> than 70 Dash 9s ... '' Source : 4Q 2015 <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> Earnings Call Transcript Notably , these planned production rate increases <b>suggest</b> that all is well with aircraft demand and reinforces my belief that there will not be a drop in demand in the near-term . (Boeing: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Although management has historically lamented their stock trading at a discount to fair value, they have done little to support their views.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , their stance has drastically changed for the <i>better</i> as one analyst from an investment firm ( <b>presumably</b> a shareholder ) on the 4Q call called out management for its lack of action in order to maximize shareholder value : It 's actually <i>more</i> of a comment and it 's in support of the <i>earlier</i> caller who and shareholder who referenced the need or the desire to have the company stand up and do something with its balance sheet to help shareholders .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It seems for several quarters you 've talked about how really positive you are in the business outlook and it would be appropriate for you guys , I know you like to invest long term but the simple fact is , Astronics is trading like it 's a little basic metal bender right here on multiple basis and its anything but that and to not take advantage of that opportunity for your long-term shareholders and your current investors to me seems to be almost negligent and it 's very <b>frustrating</b> I think for shareholders to hear management say we do n't understand why the stock is down but then to do nothing other than throw words at it instead of doing what you should do which is throw capital at it to take advantage because you and I think , I think we both know that strategically Astronics is worth a multiple and not <b>probably</b> just two or a two and half or three times what the stock is currently trading at if someone were to want to acquire it or if they were want to recreate it .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And I think that doing something in the short run to step up and help shareholders and to take out those who do n't want to play in this stock and let us who want to play in it have a <i>greater</i> <b>confidence</b> and quite honestly not have to spent as much time explaining why we owe it to our clients would be very helpful . ''  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>appears</b> that the message has been heard loud and clear .  (Uncertainty) </span>The earnings call was held on February 17.Within one week, management announced a $50m share repurchase program .In my view, this is a testament that management is willing to listen to outside criticism and adjust their methods to ensure that shareholder value is maximized.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the press release , the CEO reiterated that he believes that shares are compelling at current levels - and it <b>appears</b> that he has put his ( as he is also quite a large shareholder ) money where his mouth is .  (Uncertainty) </span>I find it hard to imagine that the Company would not follow through with its share buyback program given management's explicit comments, a substantial cash balance, a mostly-unlevered balance sheet, and no major near-term expenditure requirements.Additionally, the above-linked March investor presentation also included some interesting information.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On slide 25 , management mentions that it is `` willing to flex up '' to take debt up to 2x-3x , suggesting that a levered share repurchase program <b>might</b> be in the works .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Assuming that the 2x-3x figure refers to net debt/EBITDA , raising debt in order to reach said figures would imply incremental cash of ~ $ 87m ( from current ~ 1.3 x to 2x , <b>assuming</b> ~ $ 120m in EBITDA ) to ~ $ 211m ( from current 1.3 x to 3x ) which would substantially boost earnings growth if allocated to share repurchases .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Regardless , a $ 50m share repurchase would add ~ 5.4 % to earnings growth , assuming a starting share count of ~ 25.6 m. Valuation is compelling at current prices , 18x earnings multiple suggests ~ 38 % upside - with undemanding assumptions Assuming management hits the mid-point of its own sales guidance ( i.e. $ 695m ) - which <b>appears</b> to be undemanding given my commentary in prior sections , shares of Astronics trade at a ~ 13x forward earnings ( 10 % net margins implying ~ $ 70m in net income , in-line with historicals ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>10% net margins are likely conservative given incremental net margins approaching ~35% primarily due to opex leverage (~$11m in incremental net income / ~$31m in incremental net sales in 2015) - which should continue given that much of the development has been done and now it is just a process of ramping up production.Management guides ~$90m in engineering & development expense in 2016, down from ~$100m in 2015 as its programs continue to ramp-up resulting in programs costs declining on a per-unit basis.~$70m in net income translates to ~4.4% earnings growth.Supplement this figure with the benefit from the announced share repurchase program, earnings growth would approach 10% pretty easily.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Additionally , note that 2016 earnings growth is likely subdued given that OEMs - in particular , <b><mark>Boeing</mark></b> , as discussed - are still in the process of ramping up their production rates , suggesting that earnings growth beyond 2016 <b>could</b> feasibly be <i>closer</i> to the mid-teens , driven by <i>higher</i> sales and <i>greater</i> gross margin/opex leverage . (Boeing: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In the medium-term , a ~ 10 % earnings growth profile which is likely to ramp up to the mid-teens in the next 2-3 years very comfortably supports a 18x forward earnings multiple - possibly <i>closer</i> to 20x as OEMs steps up on production - especially when one considers that a high-teens earnings multiple for Astronics is not exactly an heroic <b>assumption</b> , given that the multiple has averaged in the low-twenties for the Company , according to data provided by YCharts .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Such a high-teens multiple <b>suggests</b> ~ 38 % upside from current levels .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Shares of Astronics are attractive due to - an undemanding low-teens forward earnings multiple largely thanks to the market 's apparent overreaction to China-related <b>fears</b> , y/y drop in bookings due to Boeing-specific production issues , and low oil prices . (Boeing: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Stated simply , should the price/value disparity close , shares of Astronics see ~ 38 % upside from current levels - <b>possibly</b> <i>more</i> .
