China low oil prices and overall increased uncertainty China concerns are overblown despite the yy drop in bookings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>production cuts and revised guidance However treating bookings and guidance as holy grail could lead to misguided conclusions which is exactly the case here in my view Additionally low oil is actually a boon Despite some timing missteps in the supply chain this does not portend a fall in demand in the nearterm which the market seems to think it does At x forward earnings shares of Astronics are undervalued relative to the Companys earnings growth profile Assuming a conservative x earnings multiple suggests upside from current levels In recent months the market has become more jittery than usual and for good reason Macro concerns led by Chinas expected deterioration in its growth profile have been on top of investors minds Astronics NASDAQ ATRO Astronics ATRO or the Company appears to have been unfairly caught in the crossfire resulting in an indiscriminate selloff since last August Judging by the timing of the selloff I believe that market participants are focused on the Companys exposure to China which is overexaggerated in my view Regardless Astronics subsequent poor bookings number and revision in its guidance appear to have confirmed investors fears as it suggests a drawdown in bookings which typically foreshadows nearterm trouble However these fears seem overblown The essence of my argument can be boiled down to the following the market seems to think that ChinaAsia is a problem contract delays lower bookings and revised guidance is a red flag and low oil is a negative The market is overexaggerating on all three counts in my view Astronics currently trades at x forward earnings which is a pronounced discount to its fair value as its earnings growth profile supports a much higher valuation multiple in my view Conservatively assuming a x earnings multiple shares of Astronics see upside from current levels Notably only four analysts from boutiques shops currently cover the company which may explain some of the valuation multiple discrepancy visavis other more wellknown industry players As a quick reminder Astronics product offerings comprises of distribution motion systems lighting safety systems avionics products aircraft structures automated test systems amongst other things The Company sells these products mainly to the aerospace industries and to a lesser extent the defense electronics and semiconductor industries Management is currently focused on increasing product content on nextgen aircraft in order to solidify its foothold on numerous new platforms eg X Highpotential platforms include the and X Product content is currently k k k and k respectively X is still being negotiated and these numbers continue to grow as RD churns out incremental products The Company has also recently highlighted that it is not opposed to growing inorganically and is willing to lever its balance sheet to do so Their MA strategy would likely revolve around acquiring adjacent products to increase peraircraft product content the Armstrong acquisition in is a good example Given the Company expects to derive of its sales from aerospace this report will only focus on ATROs aerospace segment This report will also only focus on the OEM channel and the order environment for aircraft given that Astronics is already largely past the phase of getting its products approved on an aircraft model aerospace is quite analogous to pharmabiotech where after your product gets approved the discussion largely turns to channel checks and demand environment Shares of Astronics begun selling off last August which coincided with the China scare where analysts and investors became hugely concerned that a pronounced slowdown in the Chinese economy would drag down global GDP growth Astronics sales to Asia a large portion of which is probably to China accounted for of sales in Against such a backdrop Chinarelated fears seem wellfounded They seem exceptionally wellfounded when one considers that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>estimates that of new aircraft deliveries will be sold to Asia Moreover Astronics sells to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>who then sells to Asian airlines suggesting significant indirect exposure to China on Astronics part ie Astronics US sales to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>are then sold by the OEM to Asia In addition Astronics also sells to other customers eg Panasonic Avionics which is of ATROs sales who themselves sell to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>which turns around and sells to Asia Stated simply the figure actually materially understates Astronics ChinaAsia exposure However we can begin to refute this leg of the bear case when one considers that GDP growth is not the main driver of increases in air travel at least for Asia This is primarily due to the fact that the Asian air travel market is not as saturated as the developed markets such as US and Europe In saturated markets such as those in the developed countries air travel more closely tracks GDP growth In contrast this is not the case for emerging markets such as China given that the low market penetration at least in China allows demand to be driven largely by saturating the market and less by GDP growth making Astronics less economicallysensitive to the country As proof here are Boeings comments on the issue emphasis mine We also continued to see strong growth in Chinese airline traffic In passenger traffic in China increased compared to GDP growth of a steady trend we have seen for the past five years Based on todays Chinese passenger travel we see the market as currently underserved by approximately aircraft With the middle class population forecast to grow annually through the market opportunity is significant Over the next years we see the Chinese market needing over new aircraft Source Boeings Q Earnings Call Transcript The important takeaway from Boeings management comments is as follows China is not a particularly saturated market evident from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>seeing the country being currently underserved by aircraft with the number amounting to over the next two decades The Companys InSeat Power Supply ISPS demonstrate the existence of strong market penetration trends Current market penetration is k seats k net seats were added in m in sales assuming midpoint ASPs out of an addressable market of m seats These seats are sold at ASPs ranging from to per management as seen below Source Astronics Investor Presentation Given the rapid rates of adoption this suggests that ATROs ISPS products are very wellreceived by the market Market penetration for its ISPS products should continue to grow given that OEMs do not like using many suppliers for a single component as it complicates the supply chain and requires significant due diligence on their part which is timeconsuming to determine whether to approve another supplier notwithstanding the required FAA certification which tends to be equally if not more timeconsuming As evidence most components of an aircraft is solesourced regardless of their size Transdigm is largely solesource of lowdollar components Rolls Royce and GE is solesource for jet engines While this does work against ATROs efforts to increase product content their history of increasing perplane content suggests that the Company is coping with this dynamic quite well Competition is not a huge issue given that the larger players GE and Rolls Royce for example are focused on developing highdollar content such as jet engines ATROs markets are simply too small to move the needle for these giants Smaller players tend to be familyowned businesses specializing in niche areas that Astronics does not compete in Moreover ATRO is not opposed to increase product content by growing inorganically as discussed above which somewhat nullifies this disadvantage Finally extrapolating a decrease in GDP growth in the country to conclude that air travel demand would suffer neglects to consider the fact that China and much of Asia for that matter is transitioning into a consumptionbased economy In Boeings market outlook the OEM notes that travel and transport tends to be the first discretionary items that are added to a consumers budget when a developing market economy transitions into a consumerdriven economy as quoted Emerging markets throughout the world have shown that air travel is one of the first discretionary expenditures to be added as consumers join the global middle class Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Market Outlook page Therefore slowing GDP growth in China might not necessarily spell doom for air travel demand and might even suggest acceleration Chinas resilient doubledigit growth in RPM last year certainly supports this theory Yearoveryear drop in bookings and revised guidance does not portend a drop in aircraft demand Bookings fell yy from m in to m in Despite m in bookings management is guiding to mm in sales suggesting a drawdown on bookings Note that the revenue guidance has been reduced from mm which could have confirmed investors fears that aircraft demand is experiencing a slowdown As a result bears are likely skeptical of whether the Company could hit its sales guidance A drawdown on bookings is typically an ominous sign for example it may foreshadow lower demand in the nearterm but in this case it does not in my view The reason for this is simple a major order has been delayed by a couple months and has still not been booked and therefore is not included in the bookings number Per management emphasis mine That demand that was anticipated by the customer in September October declined and we have spent the time since then renegotiating a smaller demand for which we believe is done at this point the negotiations but the order has not yet been received So we are kind of in the same spot now in terms of having what we believe is the pretty clear line of sight so what demand is going to be and yet we dont have the order So the schedule is such that we would expect an order to be coming in the next say four to eight weeks Source Astronics Q Earnings Call Transcript Interestingly an analyst raised the question on the Q call asking whether management should take that delayed order out of its sales guidance suggesting that Wall Street is likely concerned about a similar matter Clearly if Astronics gets that order the bookings number will be more inline with the guidance number However a simple timing problem is highly unlikely to be missed by the market After all in the context of aerospace supply chains order delays are frequent and investors are likely sophisticated enough to adjust for these delays Notably management identified the order delay coming from a customer that comprised of of the Companys sales in Checking this against the K it is pretty clear that customer is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The order is likely a X order as per slide of the recent investor presentation which classifies the X as a recent award being negotiated I will be focusing a lot of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in subsequent paragraphs The reason for my extreme emphasis on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>despite the sales exposure is because this exposure is significantly understated in my view Astronics largest customer is Panasonic Avionics at of sales Panasonic Avionics sells to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as well which means that Astronics has indirect exposure to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>through its relationship with Panasonic Avionics This dynamic is likely present with smaller customers of Astronics as well This situation is unsurprising given that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus split the aircraft market in halves between them if youre selling anything aerospacerelated youre likely to derive a significant portion of your sales from one of these giants they are the penultimate customer second to the airlineslessors that order from them Put simply the sales exposure severely understates the Companys actual exposure to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The larger concern and a major leg of the bear case here is whether the delay portends a drop in demand in my view Couple this delay with macrorelated concerns and it is not difficult to envision investors attributing timing issues to a worsening macro picture perhaps exacerbated by low oil prices and expecting more delays in the future However it appears that the timing delay is a production issue specific to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Per Boeings management emphasis mine Regarding the transition to the X we indicated last year that we did not anticipate the production rate on the program going below seven per month In solidifying our production plan over the past few months we can confirm that view with a timeline for shifting to a production rate of seven per month starting in to ensure a smooth transition to the X Source Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Earnings Call Transcript Essentially <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>experienced some production issues related to the rampup of the X and appears to be in the process of ironing out these issues which will allow the production rate on the X to recover to prior levels The takeaway from Boeings comments is important to note timing delays were not a result of a fall off in demand as the bear case seems to suggest but simply due to OEM issues I am well aware that delays might lead to further delays and then the situation just snowballs from there However such a scenario only occurs when the fundamentals isnt there to support the demand ie airlines are unprofitable This is certainly not the case given record airline profitability and high passenger load factors see infra The demand is there evident from increasing backlogs at OEMs see Boeings commentary in subsequent sections and rising order placement levels at aircraft lessors such as AerCap on a forwardlooking basis as seen below Source AerCap Bondholder Presentation February Per Boeings comments it seems that the delayed order for Astronics is highly likely to come through within the fiscal year given that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>intends to transition to a rate of seven X starting in Stated simply guidance is very achievable in my view Another leg of the bear argument seems to be predicated on this demand falling off as low oil prices persist as older planes become more economically viable which is true but not the whole story but channel checks by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and data from AerCap suggest that this is not the case emphasis mine Specifically related to oil notwithstanding a fuel price environment today that is well below the year average the value proposition for our airplanes remains a compelling one and we have seen airlines in the past efficiently adjust to similar market conditions In a period such as today with higher passenger demand and lower oil prices airlines buy new aircraft more for growth rather than replace older assets Furthermore based on discussions with our customers lower oil prices have not substantially changed their views on future fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules Source AerCap Bondholder Presentation February Instead it is clear that the bear argument regarding oil is misguided as airlines are capitalizing on low oil prices in order to grow their fleet The acceleration is also unlikely to lose steam given that passenger load factors are currently approaching a level that is far greater as compared to a decade ago suggesting that the demand for air travel continues to be very strong Even a style crisis would barely make a dent in demand for air travel as seen below Note The above chart does not include data RPK growth was inline with expectations Elevated passenger load factors are a huge incentive for airlines to continue spending in order to grow their fleet Airlines are flushed with cash primarily due to benefit provided by low oil prices and should be a very profitable year which reinforces my belief that the drop in bookings was a production issue specific to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>not a demand issue per <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>management emphasis mine While overall airplane demand remains healthy as always we will continue to keep a watchful eye on evolving market conditions to ensure that supply and demand are balanced According to IATA the airline industry is expected to have another record year in as earnings are projected to rise to billion fueled by lower oil prices strong passenger demand and airline efficiencies Source Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Earnings Call Transcript Big picture in Boeings annual market outlook for the OEM estimated that new aircraft would be needed over the next two decades In this number was upped to signaling an increase in demand despite the oil price depression which started in and continues to this day OEM backlogs have been on the increasing side despite a sustained rampup in production Lessors such as AerCap have also reported growing order placements for nextgen aircraft as noted above Furthermore it appears that the investors are so myopically focused on the delay of the Astronics X order unsurprisingly given that the delay was the primary reason for the yy drop in bookings as a leading indicator of falling demand that they have missed out on other numerous positives Per Astronics investor presentation the has the largest content per plane at k followed by the at k and at k Per Boeings management the OEM plans to ramp up the production rates on these models very significantly in the nearterm emphasis mine Turning to individual BCA programs given the s robust backlog of nearly firm orders and continued healthy global demand we have decided to move ahead with an additional production rate increase in to aircraft per month As we announced previously we plan to raise production from a month now to in followed by a month in On the we captured orders over the last two years And earlier this month we booked orders for another six from Air China putting us off to a good start in Our backlog stands at aircraft On the program we captured net orders for the year which further shows the healthy market demand for this compelling wide body airplane The s backlog of nearly orders fully supports our planned production rate increases to per month in and per month later this decade We have now delivered s to date including more than Dash s Source Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Earnings Call Transcript Notably these planned production rate increases suggest that all is well with aircraft demand and reinforces my belief that there will not be a drop in demand in the nearterm Although management has historically lamented their stock trading at a discount to fair value they have done little to support their views However their stance has drastically changed for the better as one analyst from an investment firm presumably a shareholder on the Q call called out management for its lack of action in order to maximize shareholder value Its actually more of a comment and its in support of the earlier caller who and shareholder who referenced the need or the desire to have the company stand up and do something with its balance sheet to help shareholders It seems for several quarters youve talked about how really positive you are in the business outlook and it would be appropriate for you guys I know you like to invest long term but the simple fact is Astronics is trading like its a little basic metal bender right here on multiple basis and its anything but that and to not take advantage of that opportunity for your longterm shareholders and your current investors to me seems to be almost negligent and its very frustrating I think for shareholders to hear management say we dont understand why the stock is down but then to do nothing other than throw words at it instead of doing what you should do which is throw capital at it to take advantage because you and I think I think we both know that strategically Astronics is worth a multiple and not probably just two or a two and half or three times what the stock is currently trading at if someone were to want to acquire it or if they were want to recreate it And I think that doing something in the short run to step up and help shareholders and to take out those who dont want to play in this stock and let us who want to play in it have a greater confidence and quite honestly not have to spent as much time explaining why we owe it to our clients would be very helpful It appears that the message has been heard loud and clear The earnings call was held on February Within one week management announced a m share repurchase program In my view this is a testament that management is willing to listen to outside criticism and adjust their methods to ensure that shareholder value is maximized In the press release the CEO reiterated that he believes that shares are compelling at current levels and it appears that he has put his as he is also quite a large shareholder money where his mouth is I find it hard to imagine that the Company would not follow through with its share buyback program given managements explicit comments a substantial cash balance a mostlyunlevered balance sheet and no major nearterm expenditure requirements Additionally the abovelinked March investor presentation also included some interesting information On slide management mentions that it is willing to flex up to take debt up to xx suggesting that a levered share repurchase program might be in the works Assuming that the xx figure refers to net debtEBITDA raising debt in order to reach said figures would imply incremental cash of m from current x to x assuming m in EBITDA to m from current x to x which would substantially boost earnings growth if allocated to share repurchases Regardless a m share repurchase would add to earnings growth assuming a starting share count of m Valuation is compelling at current prices x earnings multiple suggests upside with undemanding assumptions Assuming management hits the midpoint of its own sales guidance ie m which appears to be undemanding given my commentary in prior sections shares of Astronics trade at a x forward earnings net margins implying m in net income inline with historicals net margins are likely conservative given incremental net margins approaching primarily due to opex leverage m in incremental net income m in incremental net sales in which should continue given that much of the development has been done and now it is just a process of ramping up production Management guides m in engineering development expense in down from m in as its programs continue to rampup resulting in programs costs declining on a perunit basis m in net income translates to earnings growth Supplement this figure with the benefit from the announced share repurchase program earnings growth would approach pretty easily Additionally note that earnings growth is likely subdued given that OEMs in particular <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as discussed are still in the process of ramping up their production rates suggesting that earnings growth beyond could feasibly be closer to the midteens driven by higher sales and greater gross marginopex leverage In the mediumterm a earnings growth profile which is likely to ramp up to the midteens in the next years very comfortably supports a x forward earnings multiple possibly closer to x as OEMs steps up on production especially when one considers that a highteens earnings multiple for Astronics is not exactly an heroic assumption given that the multiple has averaged in the lowtwenties for the Company according to data provided by YCharts Such a highteens multiple suggests upside from current levels Shares of Astronics are attractive due to an undemanding lowteens forward earnings multiple largely thanks to the markets apparent overreaction to Chinarelated fears yy drop in bookings due to Boeingspecific production issues and low oil prices Stated simply should the pricevalue disparity close shares of Astronics see upside from current levels
