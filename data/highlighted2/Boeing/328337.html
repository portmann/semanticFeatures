Terminal in the Manhattan borough of New York February SAN FRANCISCO The legal showdown between Apple Inc AAPLOand US law enforcement over encryption no matter the outcome will likely accelerate tech company efforts to engineer safeguards against government intrusion tech industry executives say Already an emerging industry is marketing supersecure phones and mobile applications An Apple executive said the company will strengthen its encryption if it wins its court battle with the federal government which last week secured a court order requiring Apple engineers to help extract data from a phone associated with the mass shootings in San Bernardino The executive spoke on condition of anonymity An Apple spokesperson declined to comment publicly If Apple loses the court case the legal precedent could give the US government broad authority to order companies to assist in breaking into encrypted products But even a government victory could have unintended consequences for law enforcement potentially prompting a wave of investment by US tech companies in security systems that even their own engineers cant access said Jonathan Zittrain cofounder of Harvard Universitys Berkman Center for Internet Society A success for the government in this case may further spur Apple and others to develop devices that the makers arent privileged to crack he said The fastgrowing online storage provider Box has already made it a priority to give customers sole custody of data said Joel De la Garza chief information security officer at the company The intent is to make it impossible for the company to access its customers data even under a government order he said Our goal is to achieve a zeroknowledge state for the company he said where our customers have total control over their data Its unclear whether Apple can or would even want to make smartphones the company cant access Two Apple employees familiar with the companys security strategy said the company had no such plans One immediate beneficiary of the governments case against Apple is the niche industry based mostly overseas that has sprung up to design apps and phones to thwart snooping by governments business rivals and criminals In the more than two years since former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden revealed widespread spying via US companies a handful of companies have released secure phones with names such as BlackPhone RedPhone or Priv that trumpet security as a prime selling point Phones such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>CosBAN Black target government customers BlackberryBBTO markets the Priv an Android device to corporate clients seeking more security Others include Silent Circle with launched its Blackphone late last year and Turing Robotic Industries whose Turing Phone is due in April Many more apps such as Signal and Wickr encrypt calls or texts messages Those businesses could surge if the Apple fight drags on Thats going to happen said Chris Wysopal cofounder and chief technology officer of software security company Veracode People will go out of the country and there will be a market US law enforcement officials have long fought for new laws to maintain access to private information that is harder to capture as people move to digital devices from traditional phone lines which by law must be tappable Most recently the tech industry has fought off numerous efforts to get encryption legislation through Congress including an attempt last year that died after President Obama declined to support it FBI Director James Comey has been particularly outspoken in arguing that law enforcement efforts are hobbled by encryption which he calls a safe haven for terrorists The FBI did not respond to a request for comment on this story Other law enforcement officials have said the tech industry fears are exaggerated or in Apples case even a marketing ploy Apple Google Facebook and other companies also have accelerated efforts to implement encryption in the wake of Snowdens disclosures about US spying including a program called Prism that culled private data from some of the largest US tech companies The revelations prompted companies to fight the perception that they were arms of the government and dented the overseas sales of companies including Cisco CSCOOand IBMIBMN as countries such as China shunned US products Apples iPhones now have longer passcodes tied to underlying encryption making them far harder to hack Facebooks WhatsApp and others have adopted protocols under which they dont have the means to unlock user communications The fight between Apple and the government could give such security efforts a new urgency It could also undermine trust in automated software updates which have until now been viewed as one of the best ways to fix security flaws Because US prosecutors asked Apple to employ a software update as a means to break into the phone tied to the San Bernardino shootings users now worry that updates could compromise the security of their devices said Orion Hindawi chief executive of security firm Tanium You are going to see a lot of people who thought autoupdate was attractive backing away from that he said Thomson Reuters is the worlds largest international multimedia news agency providing investing news world news business news technology news
