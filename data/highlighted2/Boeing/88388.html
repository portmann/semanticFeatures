to a more sustainable pace of demand at the Paris air show with jetmakers increasingly focused on lifting production to meet their record backlog of sales US planemaker <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>BAN and European rival Airbus AIRPA unveiled a steady stream of deals on Tuesday day two of the aerospace industrys main annual gathering <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>announced the biggest firm order of the event so far with Dutch aircraft leasing company AerCap AERN buying MAX jets in a deal worth billion at list prices confirming a Reuters report Korean Airlines KS split a billion deal for narrowbody jets between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus also confirming what sources close to the matter had told Reuters However the number and size of the deals to date is below that of many recent trade shows when cheap borrowing costs and strong growth in passenger numbers encouraged airlines to splash out on new more fuelefficient planes The market is definitely slowing said Sash Tusa aerospace and defense analyst at UKs Agency Partners There are fewer orders this week than there have been at any air show in recent years Manufacturers are going to have to fight much harder for whats available Some moderation in demand had been widely anticipated Industry sources told Reuters on the eve of the show that barring any lastminute surprises Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>might struggle to announce orders between them compared with at the Farnborough event last year with which Paris takes turns There seems little prospect of a sharp deterioration in demand however Airbus raised its year forecast for jet sales on Monday citing the rapid expansion of airlines in Asia and the Middle East and echoing a similarly upbeat outlook from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>last week The biggest challenge facing planemakers now is to ramp up production to meet the record trillion of orders they have booked for the coming decade <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is already planning to increase output of its popular narrowbody jet to a month in from currently Its commercial airplanes chief Ray Conner said on Tuesday the company would be cautious about taking any decision to raise production toward a month a level mooted as possible for both Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>We are going to be very prudent in how we approach any rates above It feels like the demand is higher than that but that can be shortlived So we are going to see how things progress he told reporters The worst thing for any of us is to oversupply our intention is to not oversupply Conner also issued a warning to Airbus following reports the European group might apply for government loans to develop a revamped version of its A superjumbo Whether they go forward with that we will address as it comes along That would not be in line with what the WTO World Trade Organization has said he said The United States and Europe have been in a longrunning trade dispute over mutual accusations of aircraft subsidies with the row now evolving into one over whether each side has complied with WTO rulings In a bid to revive flagging sales of the A the worlds biggest passenger jet Airbus is in talks with customers about possibly adding new engines or making a version with about more seats Away from passenger jets Airbus said on Tuesday it would start a twoyear development phase for a new helicopter aimed at improving fuelefficiency and comfort for civilian customers in markets such as search and rescue and the energy sector Meanwhile Lockheed Martin LMTN said it would team up with Raytheon RTNN and Canadas Bombardier BBDbTO to develop a new surveillance and command and control aircraft for a future US Air Force competition Additional reporting by Sarah Young Victoria Bryan and Jessica Chen
