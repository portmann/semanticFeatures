strong beat and revenue slight miss are not the reasons for Boeings shares being down The cash flow is the sole reason for the stock being down <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA published Q financial results on nd of April before the opening bell In my view the results are mixed and have a negative undertone In this article I will explain why I am not really satisfied with the results but why I think this is a nice buying opportunity I will do so by looking at the analyst estimates forecast provided by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and analysis of the most important financial parameters <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has quite a good record of beating analyst estimates both on EPS and revenue However EPS and revenue are not the cause of major movement in the stock price The underlying results as well as news about the tanker program and cost and production efficiency on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>have a higher impact on the stock price In one of my previous articles I already pointed out that the Q outlook provided by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as well as the consensus were conservative The core EPS of beat the analyst consensus of by or The EPS beat is quite strong and also shows Boeings strong record of beating the consensus Boeings record on breaking the revenue estimates is slightly worse but still strong <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>reported a revenue of bn mln lower than the consensus So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>missed on revenue Figure Revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Q Source DhierinPerkash Bechai As can be seen above the beat on core EPS is quite strong but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>missed on revenue So the results are a bit mixed The results are mixed but this is not the only and primary reason for the lower share prices post earnings To see what really disappointed investors it is important to have a more thorough look at the other financial results Therefore I will have a look at the YoY YearoverYear change and forecast Figure Relative results <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Q Source DhierinPerkash Bechai Figure and Table show that all results except for cash flow showed growth supported by higher deliveries Operating cash flow however declined by The operating margin fell by points reflecting higher Dreamliner deliveries that have a dilutive impact Deferred production costs rose to bn showing declining growth in deferred production for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>All results look quite good except for the operating cash flow that fell by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>always used the cash flow as a key measure to show strength and is failing to deliver a strong operating cash flow Last quarter the stock jumped because of that very same cash flow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>seems to be having a bit of a lovehate relationship with cash flow In Q the free cash flow was an outflow of mln compared to an inflow of mln last year Timing is to blame for the poor cash flow but to show progress on making the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>production more cost efficient <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>always pointed at the cash flow and is now basically falling in the hole that it dug for itself Although the cash flow is disappointing I dont think there is reason to worry Figure Quarterly cash flow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Source DhierinPerkash Bechai Looking at the cash flow pattern Orange for the cash flow and blue for the quarteroverquarter growth quarterly cash flow grows as the year progresses The annual cash flow looks steady at a level of bn which is in line with Boeings guidance for that remained unchained <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been very conservative with its guidance the past few years The fact that it reaffirmed its guidance despite the disappointing cash flow shows that the coming quarters should be significantly better with quarterly cash flows in excess of bn Combining growing quarterly cash flow with the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>reaffirmed its outlook for operating cash flow to be in excess of bn and the annual cash flow pattern Figure there is a strong signal that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will deliver solid cash flow over the next quarters Boeings EPS strong beat and revenue slight miss are not the reasons for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares being down The cash flow is the sole reason for the stock being down Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>reported very disappointing cash flow I see chances here With the reaffirmed cash flow the cash flows in the remainder of the year should be robust with an average of bn Despite the disappointing results I think this is a nice moment to invest in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares Results in the remaining quarters are expected to be robust judging from Boeings reaffirmed guidance Also for the longer term this should be a nice entry point The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is getting closer to going cash positive on production Increases in production rates in the coming years will boost revenue and value for shareholders With higher production rates a maturing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>production and streamlining the Defense unit the operating margins should increase So the current pullback offers a nice opportunity for the short as well as the longer term investors to buy
