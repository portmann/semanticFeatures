style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>family is facing increased competition from Airbus A <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>might have to take a bn charge related to the accounting on the and program <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA shares have lost of their value yeartodate and with bad news compounding and a stock that is not really having any direction for a while one can ask whether Boeings bullish run has come to an end after all Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Stock performance per year and normalized Source wwwAeroAnalysisnet Figure shows Boeings annual return since The total return since January currently standing at January is is still appreciable but certainly falls behind expectations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had a strong run up in but after that stock performance was weak Since up until June the stock lost of its value while the Dow Jones gained So clearly investors are not favoring <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>at the moment and it can also be concluded that the jet maker is not really benefiting from the positive market sentiment either One might say that the challenges <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is facing are too big for that In this article I will have a look at the various challenges <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is facing What needs to be noted is that Boeings challenges are a combination of problems on their Commercial Airplanes segment which is Boeings core business the companys strategy macroeconomic factors and financing challenges One of the challenges <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is facing is on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>family The aircraft trails its counterpart the Airbus OTCPKEADSF Aneo in terms of orders which is partly caused by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>underestimating the Aneo at first and failing to launch a response timely The figures from Table speak for themselves <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>needed generations of the family to compete with the Airbus Aceo and was able to sell planes for every A Airbus sold or in other words <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>sold more NG and C aircraft For a first narrow body aircraft family it is hard to deny that Airbus has severely dented Boeings strong market position on the narrow body market in fact the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NG which was brought as response to the Airbus Aceo but did not even outsell the Airbus Aceo Airbus pursues an aggressive strategy to win market share by steeply discounting their airframes Additionally the jet maker launched the Airbus Aneo to further reduce Boeings market share To date Airbus sold neo airframes than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>sold MAX aircraft Even if you take into account the early launch of the Aneo it seems the Airbus Aneo is eating away market share from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Looking at the total figures Airbus sold more narrow body aircraft while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>used to outsell the Aceo by That is quite a turnaround What needs to be noticed is that in the end the shares are about The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NG has an order share of compared to the Airbus Aceo while the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX has a share of I expect this to rebalance more towards on the longer term For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>however it will become increasingly more difficult to effectively compete with Airbus due to the nature of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Family The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is based on older aircraft such as the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>meaning that there are some design constraints These constraints and reuse of existing concepts push costs down but make optimizing the fuselage increasingly more difficult This means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will have to come up with a new design in order to be able to compete with Airbus on the long term or the jet maker can only come up with a new generation of aircraft every time propulsive and aerodynamic technological development takes a leap Additionally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is having difficulties to compete with the Airbus Aceo and Aneo Airlines are pushing for bigger aircraft as demand for air travel increases but the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER does not cut it for most airlines For every <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER that was sold Airbus sold more than Airbus Aceo airframes The tendency towards bigger narrow body aircraft has continued since both jet makers launched their next generation aircraft but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was unable to make the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>MAX better fit for the job Another threat for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>but also to Airbus might be Bombardier OTCQXBDRAF Currently Bombardier does not really mix in the competition between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus on the narrow body market but this could change once the CSeries has gained traction and Bombardier will start looking at a CS which would put the aircraft directly in a gap in Boeings product line up Airbus aggressive strategy aims to rapidly win market share and in order to win share they first of all come up with a good product but also put an attractive pricing on it Boeings rhetoric has been that they are not interested in winning market share and thus are not forced to heavily discount their airframes Since demand for commercial aircraft is cyclic <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should care about market share More aircraft in operation means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could earn more money from service programs which can keep earnings high even when demand for aircraft spirals down The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is Boeings newest aircraft family that aims to push down fuel burn by as much as compared to its predecessor The aircraft has been plagued by delays and now years after service entry a SEC probe has been launched to investigate the accounting practice and feasibility of Boeings financial targets and projections for the program It is widely believed that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will not be able to recoup the deferred costs within the current accounting block meaning that the jet maker will either have to increase the accounting block or take a charge Charges for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and combined could reach bn Currently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is facing a production gap for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Classic <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is actively trying to reduce this gap it has done so by discounting the airframe but also lowered output in The long term prospect looks good for the X but currently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is having difficulties with selling the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Classic due to low oil prices relative late market success for the aircraft and slow recovery on the cargo market The slow recovery on the cargo market brings us to the next challenge The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was launched as an alternative to the Airbus A but never appealed to customers This meant that success of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>hinged on its freighter variant Order inflow for the freighters depends on recovery of the cargo market which so far has not been robust enough Simultaneously <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has almost run out of backlog and was forced to bring production to a minimum If recovery does not pick up pace shutting down the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program will be inevitable So far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has taken bn in charges for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Shutting down the program means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>loses an aircraft with unique carrying capability on the cargo market The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>F is a pain that could turn into a gain as recovery on the cargo market materializes One thing that is more of a concern of investors rather than a challenge for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is flattening order inflow In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>saw a decline in order inflow of compared to the previous year this sparked concerns about the order cycles coming to an end With backlogs at record highs I view lower order inflow as being natural since it does not make sense for airlines to commit to orders that will be delivered years from now In the end a booktobill ratio of is key to Boeings long term production planning Boeings production and testing of the US Air Force is not going smooth at all and the company went from being confident in meeting deadlines to delaying deliveries in a matter of weeks The US Air Force will seek compensation for the delays meaning that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is likely to take a charge on the program in its next earnings report One thing that is currently affecting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and might eventually give the company a competitive disadvantage is the fact that ExIm Bank is currently not granting loans in excess of million This gives some problems in finalizing orders especially for airlines that do not have the cash but are seeing higher demand for air travel in coming years One cause for concern is the companys stock policy In recent years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has returned billions of dollars to investors by the means of dividends and stock repurchases One can question the companys strategy since returning almost all of your free cash flow might not be the wisest thing to do in a cashintensive industry While moderate returns to shareholders are good the company could be better off using the money on the development of a new narrow body family In this article I had a look at the challenges <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is facing and what can be concluded is that currently there is a lot of downward pressure on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>At least for the coming years I do not see a lot of reasons for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>share prices to skyrocket once again Any positive news on the SEC probe will of course set <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares higher negative news will cause lower stock prices What is important to note is that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>challenges could affect Boeings long term competitiveness while I view the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program as a program that is experiencing a bumpy transition but without major long term implications The bullish run is over for now this is not a bad thing What is important is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>returns focus on long term success by improving its ability to keep developments in control and come up with new aircraft where Boeings position is being threatened For the moment I expect share prices to move sideways with very little reason to move either higher or lower If you would like to receive updates for my upcoming articles please click the Follow text at the
