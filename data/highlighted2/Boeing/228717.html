NYSEBA Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company BA produced an impressive Q with EPS growing by percent While the company showed impressive widebody sales for sales of narrowbody aircraft are lacking Additionally the Aneo and A models from Airbus may pose a competitive threat in catering to the longhaul sector In my opinion an investor would do well to wait for Q results before deciding on whether or not to initiate a position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>With strong financials and an impressive Q performance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSE BA will continue to remain a solid company for investors going forward Specifically while I expect that while the company will continue to generate positive earnings and cash flow uncertainty in the airline industry means that it could be a while before the market takes notice of the same In the past year we see that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is up by percent compared to a cumulative percent in the last two years In this article I use a SWOT analysis to compare both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus and demonstrate that while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>possesses significant strengths and opportunities in the airline industry concurrent weaknesses and threats make future performance somewhat uncertain and for this reason we may not see much in the way of share price growth for some time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>takes the lead in sales of higherpriced widebody planes Specifically between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>accounted for percent of widebody deliveries in Given that widebody planes have significantly higher margins the total dollar value of net sales for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>at billion was about percent higher than that of Airbus at billion Moreover sales of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>were far higher than expected at in which even exceeded the As delivered by Airbus Should <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>continue to dominate the widebody market then this means great news for profit margins going forward Sales of narrowsize aircraft have been comparatively low when compared to Airbus While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has been successful in bolstering sales of widebody planes sales of smaller planes remain poor when compared to Airbus For instance sales for the MAX were while Airbus sold of the A model In this context Airbus could well compensate for margins by bolstering sales volumes of shorthaul aircraft models Moreover there is speculation that Airbus could deploy the Aneo model on a range of longhaul flights which would give Airbus a firstmover advantage into the longhaul narrowbody market Should this become increasingly popular it may become too late for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to compete effectively The air cargo segment provides significant opportunity to bolster sales of the model Weak demand from the cargo market means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has decreased production of the model down to per month down from per month in However in June the plane maker got a boost in sales through a deal with Russian operator VolgaDnepr to supply aircraft to its cargo division <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>forecasts that world air cargo traffic will grow by an average of percent yearonyear over the next twenty years with percent of longhaul cargo traffic routes flowing on eastwest trade lanes In this context the is an ideal candidate for such purposes and indeed the has proven significantly more popular as a cargo rather than a passenger plane Demand for smallersize aircraft across shorthaul Asian routes along with introduction of the A Given the increasing popularity of shorthaul routes across Asia the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has struggled to maintain competitiveness in this area For instance while Malaysian lowcost airline AirAsia previously used to operate the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>the airline has since converted all its fleets to the Airbus A Moreover China Eastern is currently the largest operator of the A aircraft and placed an order worth billion for A Neo aircraft in Moreover the A threatens the dominance of widebody jets such as the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and on a wide range of longhaul routes and this could be particularly true in Asia with major carriers such as Singapore Airlines and China Eastern having made significant orders for the model With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>reporting a percent increase in EPS for Q the company clearly has been performing well and much of this is due to gains in profit margins from widebody airline sales However we have also seen that price has not moved significantly in response and on the basis of PE ratios x for BA versus x for the aerospace industry the company seems to be fairly valued Is it advisable to jump in at the current price It could be but given that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has seen lower sales in narrowbody aircraft compared to Airbus in conjunction with a potential threat from the A model and low demand in the air cargo market there is a risk that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could face some shortterm headwinds and the stock may be dead money for another couple of quarters In my opinion Q earnings will be a significant telling point as to whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can remain competitive through sales of widebody fleets and if this were the case then I believe this would mark a suitable entry point We only use your contact details to reply to your request
