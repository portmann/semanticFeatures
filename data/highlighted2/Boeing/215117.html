class='textDiv'>Its All Coming Together For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>announced rd quarter results which surpassed market expectations The stock price has surged this week and now trades at per share I remember about a year ago when one of the main concerns about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA was that it was trailing Airbuss OTCPKEADSF backlog and that this very factor could be a sign that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was losing the great race between the two companies positioned at the opposite sides of the pond Back then BA stock traded at about per share and the Dreamliner was still recovering from a number of highprofile battery malfunctions that left the companys pristine image tainted Even earlier this year the death of the ExIm Bank raised questions about the American airplane manufacturers ability to persevere without what many referred to as Boeings Bank And to top it all off the Chinese economy took a massive nosedive this year which raised questions about many companies future including that of Boeings But now that the dust has settled <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has proven itself to be a champion of perseverance Thats not to say that the company still does not have its fair share of problems but after going through all that it went through over the past year it goes to show how important strong fundamentals can be in a companys growth On st October the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company released its third quarter earnings for the fiscal year of and smashed expectations by posting earnings of billion or an EPS of in the quarter backed by revenues of billion Deliveries went up by this quarter as compared to the same quarter last year and the backlog has swelled to nearly commercial airplane orders Perhaps what intrigued investors even more was the companys strong operating cash flow which ballooned up to billion up from billion All these points contributed to the stock surging this past week helping share prices go from on Monday morning to its current price of per share That being said lets take a look at what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has to offer in the years to come and what are some of the issues it might face Both Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>form one of the greatest duopolies we have ever seen and its no wonder why everyone keeps bringing up their competition in any evaluation and rightfully so However opinions tend to lean towards which side of the Atlantic you live on Yes it is true that Airbus backlog is far larger than that of Boeings with aircraft by the end of September The European giant even recorded higher profits this year by posting a rise half year profits on a rise in revenues See a large portion of this gain was made from the sale of Airbuss stake in Dassault Aviation the French jet maker The whole sale gave them an EBIT boost of approximately million so if you adjust the figure against the half year profit figure you end up with a negative profit growth figure On the other hand Boeings revenues for the first months of fiscal are up by with net earnings up by no trickery just sales Though a word of caution to investors according to a report published last year by the IATA China US India Indonesia and Brazil are going to be the fastest growing markets in the next years in that order Why this is important stems from the fact that Airbus has an upper hand in the Asian Pacific region since the company generated nearly of its revenue last year from the segment Things took a juicy turn for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>last month when China signed a massive billion deal with the Chicagobased airplane manufacturer The lucrative deal was met with skepticism as people questioned the part of the deal which stated that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has to open airplane completion and delivery centers in China Not surprisingly workers back home were not happy to find out that their company was opening up a workshop in a country known for its cheap labor However things calmed down once <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>executives reassured their workforce that the plants being opened in China are not going to threaten their jobs since the Chinese facilities will only finish and paint the narrowbody planes built at its Renton Washington factory Then there are those who believe that China is going to capitalize on Boeings decision to open up a plant in the Mainland by learning whatever they can to help their Comac C endeavor To be fair that plane is supposed to be the Chinese commercial airline industrys flagship aircraft but the constant delays and Boeings strong market presence makes it a very unlikely threat Regardless of a third competitor showing up to combat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus the fact is that China will need approximately trillion worth of new planes in the next two decades and thats enough pie to go around A Strong Foundation for a Big Structure What sets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>apart from Airbus is its ability to realize its sales through delivery So far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has outpaced its European rival when it comes to deliveries making deliveries by the end of August this year as compared to Airbus deliveries Boeings deliveries are now expected to reach to planes this year as it managed to deliver commercial planes this quarter up from deliveries during the same quarter last year Thats why the company raised its fullyear EPS and revenue guidance to to and billion to billion respectively The American airplane manufacturer even has the record to prove that they will be able to sustain the growth in the years to come Its introduction of the automated process at the Seattle factory which develops parts for its model reduces manufacturing time by It seems more than likely that the company will be able to achieve its production rate target of planes a month by There were fears that the death of the ExIm Bank would dent Boeings ability to compete with its European counterparts however so far things seem to be tilting in Boeings favor Although it is too early to conclude how strong the ExIm Banks demise is going to affect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>can procure the same or greater number of orders in the coming year as it did in the year before then well know for sure how important the charter really was to the company As for the company stock itself over the past year the stock price has gone up by and pays a healthy dividend This quarter the company declared a dividend of per share a rise of yearoveryear taking the ninemonth dividend total up to per share During the past quarter the company repurchased million shares for billion leaving billion remaining in the current buyback program which will carry on for the next two years Overall the company returned nearly billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends BA currently trades at per share and I would give it an optimistic price target of I see no reason why a long term investor wouldnt want to add <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to their portfolio The stability it offers is nearly unparalleled Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities
