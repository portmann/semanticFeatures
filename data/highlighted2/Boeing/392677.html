class='textDiv'>The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>It Is Not As Easy As You Think Part The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha In a previous article I had a look at some of the factors that complicate matters for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA The full analysis can be found here These factors were In this article I will have a look at the other factors to add some more depth to the analysis These factors are The aim of this article series is to make investors aware of the challenging market the had to operate in and to show that management decisions are not just a matter of adjusting production and pricing up or down Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and ER deliveries Source wwwAeroAnalysisnet Next to growth one of the things that determines demand is the need to replace the airframe Currently the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER find a replacement in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>This means that the only members the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER can replace are the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER Figure shows one of the problems <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is facing with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER Airplanes usually are in service for years This basically means that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER have not reached their end of economical viable life yet Airlines such as Emirates have a more aggressive fleet retirement program but their average retirement age of years is well below the industry standard The oldest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER might need replacement by while production of the current generation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will likely end by This shows that the timing of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X coincides with the retirement of the oldest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ERs The oldest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>aircraft might need replacement by so these older airframes could actually be of help in Boeings task to fill up the order gap The question that remains is how many <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s have already been replaced and how many still need replacement In total <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s have been produced of which are still in service Cathay Pacific OTCPKCPCAY which operates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s is not planning on retiring any of their s until In case they decide to retire the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s earlier these will likely be replaced by the Airbus A So it seems there is nothing to win for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>there other than the high discount play it can do with any airline Emirates operates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s and is the largest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER operator The airline already started retiring its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s and its older <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ERs Emirates aggressive fleet retirement program could open up some opportunities for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>All Nippon Airways operates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s of which will be retired and while will be converted to international configuration It seems ANA does not require a replacement for the aircraft that are to be retired Japan Airlines OTCPKJAPSY also has <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s on order but with the Airbus A it seems the airline already has a replacement on order Singapore Airlines OTCPKSINGY also operates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s but has enough aircraft on order to replace the airframe The same counts for Thai Airways Table Retirement plan <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Table gives a quick overview on how various airlines have things planned out for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>It seems there is very little for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to win here Likewise for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>replacement aircraft already have been ordered Some airlines also are not planning on removing the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus A from their fleet yet So most of the current <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s and Airbus A in service dont need replacement yet while a lot of airlines already have replacement aircraft on order Figure Orders and Deliveries <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Classic Source AeroAnalysis Figure shows that in most years the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Classic deliveries exceeded the order inflow This already is a sign that in the long term production rates might not be sustainable Figure Backlog growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Classic Source AeroAnalysis Now looking at the backlog growth per year and the accumulated background since it can be seen that every few years there was a spike in order inflow However this spike has remained absent in recent years Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has increased the output from aircraft per month to to However as can be seen in the chart these production rates were not sustainable One can question why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would increase output to these levels in the first place The answer to this question lies within Boeings financial performance The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>which entered service in had a dilutive impact on financial results In order to counter this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>decided in an early stage to increase output which would simultaneously lead to a higher efficiency on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program In Part I looked at the influence of oil prices industry crises economic downturns and competition on the order inflow for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>In Part I had a look at the influence of aircraft age as a driver for orders and concluded that most airplanes have not reach their end of economically viable life yet The ones that have reached that age are either not yet being replaced with the eye on capital efficiency and low oil prices or find their replacement in the Airbus A In that light one could say that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X is late Indeed as a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>replacement the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X is late However the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X is a vastly different aircraft compared to the In my view the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X is not late the problem <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is facing is that it had a production rate that was not sustainable The jet maker increased production rate in order to boost the financial performance and partly cover up the highly dilutive impact the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>had on earnings The rate increase was in no way related to any backlog growth for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>All with all I do not think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>management made a mistake here that can directly be related to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X The main problem in my view is the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>program on which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>made a lot of mistakes and the company needed the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>success to cover that up <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>chose to increase production to boost performance If this would not have happened <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares would likely not be trading anywhere near the current levels and the companys share buyback and dividend hikes would be nowhere close to the current levels If you would like to receive updates for my upcoming writings please click the Follow text at the top of this page next to my profile I wrote this article myself
