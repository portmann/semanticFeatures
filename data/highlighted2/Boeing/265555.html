when asset classes finally adjust to underlying demand with the commodity markets having operated based on Central Bank Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Almost exactly a year ago the media world was abuzz when as we reported then a picture posted by Ansar alDin Front an Islamic extremist brigade and which promptly went viral showed a Ford F truck with a Mark Plumbing decal on the door and a militant standing in the bed firing the antiaircraft gun And while most moved on quickly from this story for one person the picture had a dramatic and scarring effect the owner of said Mark Plumbing company a Texan by the name of Mark Oberholtzer who as many know by now is suing a Texas Ford dealership Charlie Thomas Gord for more than million in financial losses and damages to his companys reputation as a result of this pickup truck which he once owned ending up with Islamic militants fighting in Syrias civil war As CNN summarizes all Mark Oberholtzer wanted to do was upgrade his ride What he got instead was a world of trouble from half a world away By the end of the day Marks office Marks business phone and Marks personal cell had received over phone calls from around the nation Oberholtzers lawyer wrote in the lawsuit filed December in Harris County Texas These phone calls were in large part harassing and contained countless threats of violence property harm injury and even death Oberholtzer said this wouldnt have happened if the dealership had just removed the decals before the truck was resold as he had demanded thus serving as the basis for his lawsuit attached below But while we commiserate with Mr Oberholzer and wish him prompt restitution of damages as a result of unnecessary harassment a far more important question is just how did Marks Ford F Super Duty end up in under the control of the Islamic State The answer would be critical as it will provide a factual tracable answer how it is that ISIS is if not funded we know already revealed a critical part of that story then supplied with equipment and perhaps weapons This is what the plaintiff states in his lawsuit According to a CARFAX Vehicle History Report see Exhibit B the vehicle was listed as a dealer vehicle sold at a Texas auto auction on November On December the vehicle was exported from Houston Texas and imported to Mersin Turkey Presenting Mersin Turkey a stones throw from the infamous port of Ceyhan and about a hundred miles from the territory of the Islamic State On October Mark Oberholtzer entered into a transaction with Charlie Thomas Ford in which he tradedin his old Ford F pickup truck for a newer Ford F pickup truck Promptly thereafter the vehicle was listed as a dealer vehicle sold at a Texas auto auction on November Less than a month later on December the vehicle was exported from Houston Texas and imported to Mersin Turkey Less than a year later it was in the documented possession of the Islamic State So once again the missing link supplying ISIS emerges as none other than Turkey Meet The Man Who Funds ISIS Bilal Erdogan The Son Of Turkeys President Russia Presents Detailed Evidence Of ISISTurkey Oil Trade And while NATOmember Turkey supplying ISIS with funding supplies weapons or equipment is hardly groundbreaking news the Ford clue poses new and important questions such as who is the Turkish party that ordered and paid for the Ford trucks transfer to Turkey and subsequently received compensation from the Islamic State in the subsequent resale which is the US party which transacts with Turkish counterparts who ultimately ship US products to Islamic State fighters is the US party aware that its Turkish counterparty has dealings with ISIS what is the role of the US government in all of this because it would be surprising that an administration that has sworn it would crack down on all outside assistance to the Islamic State would be unaware that made in the USA trucks ended up in the Islamic State by way of its faitful NATO ally Turkey how many other such vehicles sold in the US and exported to Turkey have made their way to the Islamic State We are confident that it will be relatively easy for any aspiring reporter to track down the USbased exporter of the Ford truck and thus recipient of Turkish funds just as it will be facile to uncover who was the Turkish buyer who signed the receipt invoice in Mersin Turkey What may be more difficult to uncover is whether the governments of the US and Turkey respectively were or are appraised about transactions such as this one and if not then why not We hope to be able to answer as many of the above as possible in the very near future Tue Boris Alatovkrap Tue Gambit I wish the American People had access to LTC Vladimir Putins CIA dossier like I had during my time with DIA in the early s All the US propaganda about Putin is total BS Putin was not your typical KGB type and was constantly criticized for refusing to join The Communist Party and for being an Russian Orthodox Christian In fact prior to enrolling in Military College he spent almost a year studying for the Priesthood as his whole family were devout Russian Orthodox Christians If he hadnt been one of the best assassins KGB CounterIntelligence had confirmed Western agents he would have never even made the rank of LTC The fact he was never a Communist or in the KGB hierarchy was why Gorbachev named him to Lead The KGB during the conversion from The KGB to The FSB in Tue nuubee That may all be true but exactly how long has he been the leader of Russia Was he elected to that position repeatedly All that said I still have far far far more values in common with Putin than I do with the Chinese communist party or anyone in the middle east Tue Miles Ahead Well since you asked as a matter of fact he was repeatedly And he hardly fits the description of demagogue More like the opposite of Tue The Pope Tue froze Lets see if even Fox news runs this I doubt it I doubt any Main Streamers will Just tells you that they are in the pocket Tue I MISS KUDLOW in the next few weeks the government will be buying back my dodge ram its under mandatory recall i guess mine will be over there as well soon enough Tue Manthong Yknow an steel pipe wrench would make a formidable hand weapon in the hands of an islamist hopped up on Captagon it would go well with the truck too Tue knukles New Truck built by a company we didnt bail out I bought a new Ford F TriFlex Fuel Truck Go figure it runs on either hydrogen gasoline or E I returned it to the dealer yesterday because I couldnt get the radio to work The service technician explained that the radio was voice activated Nelson the technician said to the radio The radio replied Ricky or Willie Willie he continued and On The Road Again came from the speakers Then he said Ray Charles and in an instant Georgia On My Mind replaced Willie Nelson I drove away happy and for the next few days every time Id say Beethoven Id get beautiful classical music and if I said Beatles Id get one of their awesome songs Yesterday some guy ran a red light and nearly creamed my new Ford truck but I swerved in time to avoid him I yelled Ass Hole Immediately the radio responded with Ladies and gentlemen the President of the United States Damn I love this Ford truck But is that a new kind of sewer router they have on the back of that truck in the picture Tue SMG Tue BlindMonkey Hey I uparrowed you Some asshole obviously didnt like you giving props to Vlad BTW speaking of truck decals reminds me of when I had a Jeep Wrangler green cyl but put the Sahara logo and pinstripes decals on to make it look like the upmarket cyl model Didnt remove it upon trade in to the Toyota dealer in Atlanta and the salesman well decided to cut corners imagine that Tue Squidpuppets a Until and unless the West ceases divide and conquer interventionism it is ridiculous for us to tar any other nation with the undemocratic brush because for any nation to try representative democracy is to expose its own jugular to the CIA Tue AGuy Tue Macon Richardson Was he elected to that position WAS HE ELECTED TO THAT POSITION Look around you All the weaseldicks in American politics and European politics were elected to their positions Obviously being elected is a sure sign youre a jerk a dolt an oaf a fool and a pluperfect villain Hes a demagogue HES A DEMAGOGUE What American politician isnt a demagogue Get it straight Nutbag No one cares what your opinion is because your obtuseness forfeits the right to have an opinion You are what Id call a typical voter Tue beemasters NahThen we wouldnt know where the trucks that ISIS had came from It was sweet that he didnt remove it or the truth would have remained hidden Tue TuPhat The dealership asked him not to remove the decal just to be sure he wouldnt scratch the paint They promised to do it themselves prior to resale Thats according to ABC news channel Houston Dont ever trust a car dealer Tue sapioplex Olberholtzer was quoted as saying that the dealer instructed him to not remove the decals that they would remove them for fear of damaging the paint Tue hollywood gorilla I almost clicked on thetawny kitaen link But I already know she is drunk and on a handful of Vicodin in Newport Beach somewherez Tue beemasters The bigger question is Of all nearer places from which they could have imported trucks WHY the US Who was facilitating it The CIA Tue beemasters The first thing an intelligence agency would have done when they see such a photo should have been to follow the breadcrumbs question and possibly charge those involvedbut of course if you wouldnt do that if you are to implicate yourself Cmon CIA FBI Homelandplease own up Who had instructed you to look the other way We need namesNOW waterboarding Tue NoDebt If the CIA didnt buy and ship it themselves directly just running it through ally Turkey to get it in theatre quickly Tue FreeMoney We know ISIS has the truck We dont know exactly how they got the truck Maybe they bought it maybe it was gifted to them maybe they stole it We do know someone bought it at an auction and then shipped it to turkey I would think a person in Turkey would have less expensive options for a used F x type truck Mercedes Fiat Volvo are all made much closer to turkey than Houston TX It doesnt make sense to buy and ship somthing with out local dealer support or locally available spare parts Smells like month old fish Tue KirkNCC I wouldnt bitch to Angies List about the bad job he did on my pipes with that hardware in the back Ford commericials use to end with Have you driven a Ford lately Tue Deathrips But today I just realized that Jihad and Mein Kampf literally mean the same thing Tue Miles Ahead Tue Miles Ahead I think you mean ideology Anyway theres no support to the fallacy that Hitler supported Genocide He was actually working with the Zionists to repatriate all Jews out of Germany to wherever Could be called ethnic cleansing perhaps But then there goes your argument about Jihad Jihad struggle is just an arabic word Theres not a wee bit of implication for ethnic cleansing or genocide Also there were Jewish troops senior decorated even in the Wehrmacht Look it up Cant have that and genocide together Difficult most Germans and all Islamists Your arguments are shallow Move along BTW Jihad was started by the USA son As a rallying cry for fighters to help out against the Soviets in Afghanistan Nothing related at all to Genocide again The connotations can be varied You do know by the way that Arabs use Arabic words dont you So if they want to say struggle they sure aint going to say kampf Or lutte Tue xr Tue The Pope WAIT I thought the correct story was that the jews actually made lampshades out of themselves You know just like the witches back in the day used to build bridges out of themselves Tue Miles Ahead lol Im dying No it was pillows They were turned into pillows for German wives And paper weights shruken heads Now which is it did they starve themselves as you say or did they get gassed with an insecticide
