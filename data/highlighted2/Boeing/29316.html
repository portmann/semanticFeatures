workhorse of modern air travel could be close to running out of runway Last year there were zero orders placed by commercial airlines for new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>s or Airbus As reflecting a fundamental shift in the industry toward smaller twinengine planes Smaller planes cost less to fly than the stately fourengine jumbos which can carry as many as passengers The slump in sales of the jets has raised questions over how long manufacturers can sustain production It has also fueled internal debate in both companies over the future of the planes sources said The outcome of those discussions will affect the value of existing fleets and thousands of production jobs at the plane makers and their many parts suppliers Sales forces at Airbus Group NV AIRPA and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Co BAN are fighting for potential orders plane by plane as they seek to keep production going beyond the end of the decade said other aviation market sources The aircraft makers are offering discounts of at least percent from catalog prices of around million for a jumbo jet those sources said Airbus has said it is also considering a revamp to make its superjumbo more attractive to buyers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in September plans to slow the pace of production of its latest model to an average of planes a month from currentlyAt that rate the orders it already has in hand will only keep the production line going for years The crunch though will come earlier because it can take up to two years from ordering the first part to finishing a jet and no one wants to start the process if it is unclear whether the plane will be completed and delivered to a customer I can see demand for the in small numbers but you have got to ask if they can keep the production line open if they dont get some new orders said Tony Whitty chief executive of UKbased aircraft remarketing firm Cabot Aviation which trades manages and leases jets You also wonder at what price they are selling Use of the has dropped steadily over the last two decades reflecting the rise of twoengine jets that have come close to matching its rangeOver the same period production of large twinengined jets like the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has risen sevenfold Last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>booked new orders for the and now has a backlog of orders Airbus is more upbeat than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>about the prospects for jumbo jets but both now agree it has become a niche category Airlines still need jumbo jets but only for certain polar flights where a twoengine jet may be less safe than a fourengine jumbo because of the lack of places for an emergency landing and busy routes where landing slots are scarce The risk is most visible for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>where investors could face a billion accounting charge if production is shut down according to company disclosures <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>recently received a highprofile boost with a provisional order for two new jets to serve as Air Force One for the US President but the s future depends a lot more on sales of the muchless glamorous windowless freightmodel That has a unique hinged nose and can carry very large equipment such as oil drilling rigs So far this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has sold three Atlas Air Worldwide AAWWO recently said it plans to order more for its cargo fleet but wouldnt say when or how many The worlds biggest freight customer Cargolux CLUXUL also says it likes the plane but has a pending order for only three A sustained upturn in air freight traffic could secure the a longer future International freight traffic rose percent last year but volume has only just recovered from a collapse in during the financial crisis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>reckons some older freighters will need to be replaced stretching demand for the through the s the program vice president Bruce Dickinson said in an interview We know there is a longterm market for this airplane and some of the unique things it can do Dickinson said from his office overlooking the production line at the giant Everett plant near Seattle But Boeings effort to sell new s is overshadowed by the many older s available for lease which have suddenly been made more attractive because of a big slide in fuel prices since the middle of last year Leasing companies say there is scant interest in new s when freighters are baking in desert parking lots The older planes can be leased for as little as a month compared with up to million in monthly lease payments for a new freighter experts say Thats a pretty big difference said Gueric Dechavanne vice president at Collateral Verifications a Connecticutbased aircraft appraisal firm Some companies have extended leases for three to four years said Aengus Kelly chief executive of leasing company AerCap AERN Its a challenge to lease a freighter Kelly told Reuters Its definitely a challenge to sell them Airbuss A is a newer plane its first flight was almost exactly years ago and has become a mainstay of Middle East carriers that offer opulent suites to first class passengers But the drop in demand is prompting Airbus to weigh whether to revamp the plane with new engines or carry on with the existing model Airbus has orders for the planes in hand or more than five years of production But it acknowledges that not all of those jets will be delivered leaving it with barely three years of guaranteed output Given the long lead timesAirbus must bring in more orders soon to avoid having to taper production We are always looking at product improvements but there is so much untapped potential in the existing aircraft said Airbus marketinghead Chris Emerson Airbus could announce an A revamp as early as the Dubai Airshow in November but must first find a way to assure investors it can recover several billion dollars of development costs sources said Analysts say on option could be to apply for more European government loans though that risks exacerbating trade tensions with the United States Top customer Emirates is offering to double its planned purchase of As if Airbus carries out the improvements which the Dubai carriers Chief Executive Tim Clark tells Reuters will be extremely good for the airlines bottom line Thomson Reuters is the worlds largest
