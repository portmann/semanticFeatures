style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>currently is trading at fair value Reasonable price targets for are between and Price targets higher than are not realistic for the moment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA shares have lost of their value yeartodate In this article I will look whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares are fairly valued in my view or what would be a fairer value Additionally I will explain why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares might currently not be trading near their fair value Looking at the year chart for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>a few things can be seen In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>saw its stock prices skyrocketing After that the stock lost in followed by a gain in It is needless to say that investors have not been able to choose a clear direction since the explosive growth in Comparing the yeartodate performance of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to that of the Dow Jones the aerospace sector NYSEARCA XAR and sector peers such as Lockheed Martin NYSE LMT and Northrop Grumman NYSE NOC it can be seen that Boeings performance is exceptionally weak While the Dow Jones won <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>lost and belongs to the bottom half of the Dow Jones from a performance point of view The XAR the aerospace defense ETF won and is outperforming the Dow Jones slightly Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman outperformed the Dow Jones and XAR gaining and respectively BA PE Ratio NYSE TTM data by YCharts Looking at the pricetoearnings it can be seen that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is currently trading at a twelvemonth trailing price multiple of Lockheed and Northrop Grumman are trading at price multiples of and A price multiple of would imply a fair value of or upside for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares This is also the value <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was trading at in better days However given Boeings challenges I think that price multiples of or are not justified for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>From the companies in the Aerospace Defense Industry only General Dynamics NYSE GD and Textron NYSE TXT have a lower price multiple The average price multiple is around so sector performance for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would imply a fair value of Currently I do not see any reason that justifies the assumption of sector performance valuation for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Taking into account full year earnings forecasted at and a PE multiple of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could be trading at by the time it reports its full year results One of the things that investors like a lot is earnings growth What they like even more is valuing that growth in the current share prices For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>expects earnings to come in between and per share or a forward multiple of The forward PEratio for the aerospace industry is This means that taking into account future earnings and the sector forward price multiple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>should be trading between and The consensus EPS estimate of would imply a share price of or Another way to value growth is with the PEGratio or the pricetoearningstogrowth ratio <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>reported earnings of per share in This means that the company anticipates earnings growth of per share in If we calculate the PEGratio using the year growth rate we obtain PEGratios of What this tells us is that the stock looks slightly overvalued but it is not worrying Using the consensus estimate of the PEGratio is This also signals a slight overpricing For the coming years an annual growth of is expected If we translate this to a PEGratio we get a ratio of Determining a real fair value based on price multiples and growth is difficult not only because of the various methods that can be applied but also because of the different earnings estimates Additionally some of the stock price is driven by hopes on dividend increases or stock repurchases This also means that every investor based on their investing style will be willing to pay a different price for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shares Using the PEGratios I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is valued nicely Given the current expected earnings growth for either this year or for the next years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is valued fairly Looking at price multiples a reasonable price target would be around indicating upside to be achieved by the time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>reports full year results In a bullish market would be a good price target Given the current expected growth price targets north of are not realistic at this point Now what you might ask yourself is why I marked <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as a play with an undesirable riskreward ratio This has everything to do with the dynamic landscape <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is facing which currently is not making <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>very attractive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is facing a potential charge related to accounting practices on the Dreamliner and program that might eat away almost years of profits Additionally fears on economic slowdowns and low oil prices are not things Boeings business fares well on Once oil prices are heading higher again and there are no problems with Boeings accounting practices and forecasts higher stock prices are justified For the investors that are willing to take the risk you can now buy shares for a fair price and if the accounting problems turn out to be minor you will be rewarded with a solid ride upwards Describing Boeings current situation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>currently is trading at fair value and does offer some upside looking at the consensus estimate but at an unattractive riskreward ratio Once the challenging landscape normalizes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>shareholders will benefit from the strong expected earnings growth If you would like to receive updates
