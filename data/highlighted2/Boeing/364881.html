Prior to the Delta order it had next to no interest from any airlines, however following the Delta stamp of approval, the aircraft value soared 17% and lease rates climbed 22%.Robert Agnew, an aviation consultant described Delta as "kind of the market maker."For Bombardier shareholders, a Delta order has the potential to seriously turn the struggling CSeries program around and give it a major stamp of approval.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>may</b> also involve converting the static Republic Airways ( OTCPK : RJETQ ) CSeries order over to Delta .
