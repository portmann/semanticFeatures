How Deep Is The Hole That <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Dug For The Dreamliner The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Deferred costs likely to rise to bn Q Deferred costs were in line with expectations With a bright market forecast there should be no problem for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to return program profits on the long term In a previous article I had a look at how deferred costs for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA program developed I concluded that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is still losing million per airframe but breaking even on the program within the first deliveries seemed achievable Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is currently heavily discounting the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and will reduce production rate for the current generation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>it is important for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to make the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>production profitable Figure A <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>during a flight display on the Paris Air Show Source youtubecom Breakeven on production costs was expected in after which the deferred costs would start declining somewhere in At some point <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>said it did not expect deferred production costs to rise above bn In Q deferred production costs rose to bn a mln increased compared to last quarter In this article I will have a look at how costs per airframe have developed since and how they might develop in the future Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Deferred costs Source AeroAnalysisnet Figure shows quite well that deferred costs rose sharply since Q but at the same time it can be seen that from QQ and onwards the rate of cost growth started declining This can be seen as a first step on reaching breakeven on production Previously AeroAnalysis estimated deferred costs to rise to bn in Q the figure reported by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is bn So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>did a slightly better job cutting costs than was anticipated The decelerated cost growth is better visualized in Figure Figure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>quarterly increase in deferred costs Source AeroAnalysis As can be seen in Figure deferred costs per quarter started declining since Q Compared to Q the growth rate of deferred costs declined quite a bit To get a better view it is key to relate the increase in deferred costs to the number of deliveries in a particular quarter Figure Loss per produced <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Source AeroAnalysis Figure gives a clear view on the development of deferred production cost per unit It can clearly be seen that the costs have been declining and currently are around mln So in Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>lost million per produced <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>which is a improvement compared to the previous quarter and a improvement year over year Using a conservative reduction in growth rate per quarter deferred costs will grow to bn in Q and hit breakeven around the same time By Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will have delivered approximately airframes and has accumulated almost bn in deferred costs If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>needs to break even on the program with its expected backlog of orders it needs to make mln profit per airframe As increasing profitability per airframe is a gradual process profit per airframe needs to be slightly higher to compensate for lower profit on the first few profitable airframes So the mln is an average The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER currently at high discounts has a profit margin of but this used to be as high as A profit margin on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would mean a mln profit per aircraft whereas mln in profits per airframe is needed to breakeven This indicates that breaking even on the program with the current backlog does make sense but it has to be noted that a lot depends on how fast <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will be able to increase profit on the production of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>According to my calculations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>could return profits on the entire program within the first deliveries which is a figure that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>already estimated years ago and are now being confirmed by my own calculations With demand for medium and small wide body aircraft topping airframes in the coming years the future looks bright for the Dreamliner Reaching breakeven by yearend without investing in the production process is a major challenge Using a reduction in growth rate for the deferred costs I expect breakeven somewhere after deliveries and a deferred production cost close to bn Depending on how fast <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will be able to increase profit the jet make could see profit on the program within deliveries The hole that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>dug for the Dreamliner is deep but increases in efficiency production rates and strong demand should give the Dreamliner strength to fly out of that hole The strong cost reduction in Q is a good sign for <span
