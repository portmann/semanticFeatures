class='textDiv'>Emirates Putting Pressure On <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>For Possible Order The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha According to Mr Clark <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>does not have the required take off thrust performance for take off in Dubai Emirates probably is looking for an engine with a higher thrust rating Airbus has the A on offer an order of airframes of this type was canceled by Emirates last year Tim Clark CEO of Emirates recently commented on a possible order for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA or the Airbus OTCPKEADSF OTCPKEADSY A The possible order is being eyeballed heavily as it can be seen as a huge win for either manufacturer Prior to launching a campaign to evaluate the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and the Airbus A Emirates canceled its order for Airbus A aircraft in June The cancellation marked the biggest order loss in the history of Airbus Emirates ordered the airframes in November at that time the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>was not yet launched The reason for the order cancellation was that Emirates reviewed its fleet requirement and the Airbus A as it is now was not what Emirates had signed up for years ago The cancellation opened a door for rival <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>which had not yet sold any Dreamliners to Emirates Although one of the reasons for the cancellation seems to have been the size of the Airbus A Emirates is now reviewing the Airbus A and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>again Chances are slim that Emirates will order the Airbus A as the company has ordered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>X aircraft and has an additional purchase rights This leaves the Airbus A and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>as candidates The Airbus A is still a suitable candidate but has a range capability that Emirates does not need The Airbus A can transport passengers over a distance of nm The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has a range close to nm and can transport up to passengers Due to the bigger range for the Airbus A the airframe is a bit heavier than Boeings So in terms of efficiency the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>might have the advantage and Tim Clark also recognizes this but is it as fuel efficient as the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>Probably not The major drawback for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is the required thrust The Airbus A is designed for long haul operations and therefore has more powerful engines to get the heavier Airbus A into the air The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>basically is a double stretch of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and has engines more powerful than those on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>In any other airport outside the Gulf region the take off thrust of lbf or kN for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would be sufficient However the Dubai International Airport is a bit different the take off thrust settings are calculated using a temperature of degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit At the Dubai Airport temperatures can easily rise to degrees Celsius Due to the high temperature the air will be thinner and this results in lower thrust coming from the engines and a higher required take off velocity The thrust will be lower due to the engine computers limiting the thrust setting to prevent damage to the engine One solution would be to lower the carried payload but obviously this is not beneficial for Emirates as it will result in a lower revenue and profit Another solution would be to let the engine computer bypass the temperature limits within the engine but this would result in wear of the engine which subsequently leads to lower performance of the engine shorter engine life cycle higher engine maintenance costs and lower dispatch reliability Clark also told Flight Global that thrust bumps are not a way to solve this problem Theyre talking about thrust bumps and I dont do thrust bumps Reading the above one could get the idea that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is not positioned very well to win the order from Emirates The table shows that the Airbus A and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>with Trent engines have about the same thrustMTOW ratio while the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>with GE NYSE GE engines has a slightly lower ratio This ratio indicates how much thrust is available per unit weight Assuming that Emirates wants to use GE engines on their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>it seems that Mr Clark has a valid point However the difference is marginal and although I am not very knowledgeable on the subject of take off performance I do think that Mr Clark is also trying to intensify the competition between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus that should get Emirates the best for its buck From <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>he probably wants higher discounts and a GE engine with a higher thrust rating Using the thrust ratio from the Airbus A which according to Mr Clark has bags of thrust the required thrust would be about lbf The GEnxB is a model of the GEnx engine that never went into production but has been certified at a thrust rating of lbf So I think that Mr Clark would prefer a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>with these engines Airbus on the other hand has nothing but high discounts to offer as their airframe seems to be having the desired thrust requirement I dont think things look that bad for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>but it is in Emirates interest to not give a clue about who might win the order and put some pressure on the manufacturer of whom is expected the most Currently Emirates is expecting a high thrust engine from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>so the airline is putting pressure on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>As a result <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>wants to deliver and not get defeated by Airbus Additionally Airbus should feel some pressure as well so Tim Clark told Leeham News and Comment Were working with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>on that With these words pressure is on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and Airbus Eventually the one clear winner will be Emirates which one will be the other winner still has to be determined Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not
