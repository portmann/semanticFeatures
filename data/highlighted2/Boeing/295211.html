Seeking Alpha Disclosure I amwe are long BA MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article The recent market sell off has dropped Boeings shares by nearly YTD and over from their highs Concerns over a production slowdown are now fully priced into the stock creating an attractive value for both the income and growth minded investor Ramping and production and improving margins on the Dreamliner will very likely compensate for even the worst case scenario for the current generation program <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>NYSE BA will report its quarterly earnings on January th and very likely beat the analyst consensus EPS of on the back of record commercial airplane deliveries This should be no surprise to investors as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has managed a string of upside surprises in their quarterly earnings beating by an average of over the previous four quarters The companys earnings however will only be part of the story on the th More importantly will be managements commentary on the companys all important program that I wrote about last fall in some detail At the heart of Boeings profitability is the companys wildly successful high margin high priced The s current generation ER model is the backbone of the worlds long haul wide body fleet but Boeings most profitable program is facing a near and medium term headwind that investors should fully appreciate First there is growing anecdotal evidence that the wide body market is over supplied in the near term A report last fall by Goldman Sachs identified legacy aircraft coming off lease by while the CEO of Delta announced the purchase of a on the used market for million Just this past weekend several media outlets reported that British Airways was considering leasing ERs from the secondary market rather then purchasing new presumably following Deltas lead where they can find greater value The second component of the headwind faced by the current generation program is an admitted production shortfall between the current ER order book and the next generation X The math is quite simple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has orders for ERs and is producing the aircraft at a rate of aircraft per month or just under ERs per year Without new orders the company will exhaust the ER order backlog by the last quarter of CEO Dennis Muilenburg acknowledged as much on companys October st earnings call when he said he could see production cuts to the program to no less than per month At this most extreme production rate cut <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would reduce its quarterly ER deliveries by nearly aircraft or about of its ER deliveries Investors should assume that at some point in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will announce a production slowdown of its current generation program At the highest estimated impact this could equate to a nearly drag on the companys operating profit assuming both a slowdown of or aircraft per year and that the program contributes as much as to the companys operating profit Note these figures are from a estimate by Goldman Sachs Working from this worst case scenario investors should look to how the companys ramping production in its other programs may offset the decline The majority of Boeings record high deliveries in came from its dramatically ramping narrow bodied program <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has successfully executed production increases in the program over the past years and plans for production to rise to aircraft per month by and per month by There is further speculation that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>may continue to increase production to match rival Airbus and its pledge to produce its popular Aneo at a rate of per month by Even at this dramatically growing rate of production <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will still need years to clear its current backlog of and MAX orders While estimates vary on the profitability of the program it is widely agreed that Boeings margin is far smaller on the then the the sheer volume of the production rate increases will almost certainly go a long way to ameliorating the earnings drag of a production rate slowdown Assuming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>reduced the ER production rate as described in a worst case scenario by Muilenburger the rate would be reduced by aircraft per month by the end of or beginning of just as the program is adding five per aircraft per month and moving towards an additional five a year after In addition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is standing behind its pledge that the will be profitable in as production ramps to per month this year moving towards per month by These additional profitable s however slim the margin is likely to be will also help to lessen the sting of a potential ER production slowdown Another possible source of added cushion to the likely slowdown of the current generation production comes from the renaissance in the companys program led by a plane order from Fed Ex The company announced that it will increase production by in While the size of the program is still relatively small the increase in production should equate to an additional aircraft per year In total the worst case scenario production cut for the ER would equate to approximately fewer aircraft per year in while the ramping production in the and programs would add an additional lower margin deliveries that same year The actions of Boeings leadership shows no signs that they have any concern regarding the companys future cash flow and earnings as they have now dramatically increased the companys capital returns to its shareholders through an increased share repurchase and cash dividend in The early market decline coupled with the companys increased cash dividend gives the stock a nearly yield all while trading at a near PE valuation discount to the SP One might argue that a modest discount is warranted given Boeings cyclical industrial business uncertainty on the defense side of the business and lingering concerns about production and transition but the companys current share price more than discounts these concerns given the companys robust capital return plan Despite lingering short term concerns over the rate of production of the current generation shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>are an attractive investment at their current price The company is perfectly positioned to capitalize on the continued growth in air travel over the coming decades and ramping production in the companys less profitable and production increases should more than offset the likely slowdown in the current generation ER production At its current earnings valuation discount to the SP <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is a buy for both the growth and income investor Tagged Investing Ideas Industrial Goods </div></body></html>
