Production costs are likely to be million under normal circumstances Any analysis using million as a revenue estimate is a flawed one In one of my previous articles This Is How You Can Easily Make Things Look Bad For Boeings Dreamliner I had a look at the faulty interpretation of data and extrapolation that yields potential inaccurate results for Boeings NYSE BA deferred costs totally flattening out In some of my articles I also performed a sanity check to check whether Boeings targets are realistic and attainable Key to this feasibility or sanity check is an assumption for the revenue per aircraft In this article I will have a look at what current market values are what the influence of the delivery mix is to the revenue per aircraft and what revenues some analyses use So before getting to the market value it is important to know the list prices of the airframes and realize that airlines usually get around in standard discounts Table List prices for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>A discount would imply a market value of million for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>million for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>and million for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The discount is a rule of thumb the actual market values are a few percentage points higher lower discounts AeroAnalysis had a look at a United Airlines NYSE UAL investor presentation and did some research to get an idea of the market value for aircraft including the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>The value of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is between million and million implying a discount compared to the list prices With the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>being a bigger success than the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>I do expect the market value of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to be closer to million than to million Using todays list prices and a slight drop in value due to competitive pressure this means a discount of For the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>the market values are between million and million I expect the market value to be at the lower end of this range implying a discount For the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>not a lot of market valuations are available but a discount seems reasonable to me This would indicate a market value of roughly million What can be concluded is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is a bit less flexible in discounting the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>despite dropping demand for the aircraft This likely has everything to do with the already tight margins for the aircraft <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would rather sell the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>which can give them more profit Amidst pricing pressure from the Airbus OTCPKEADSF Aneo and the Airbus A discounts for the other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>models is between and validating an assumption of discount for the longer term According to Leeham quoted in The Herald Business Journal Delta NYSE DAL was willing to pay million per <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>when it was negotiating with Airbus and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>in This implies a discount whereas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>would not go any further than a discount of This shows that where airlines are considering the Airbus counterparts as serious candidates as well Boeings prices can be negotiated down by Some analyses have been using a revenue assumption of million million per airplane and gear their calculations and conclusions on Boeings ability to recoup the deferred costs within the accounting block towards this assumption I think that with Boeings cheapest model having a market value of million and when heavily discounted this revenue assumption could not be any more flawed One of the things to keep in mind is that the delivery mix is becoming more and more oriented Additionally the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will have a positive contribution to the average revenue per airframe as well Table Estimated value for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>members The revenue per aircraft can be estimated using methods The first method is by using the delivery mix and the second method is by having a look at the backlog The results are shown in Table Table Revenue assumption per aircraft What can be seen is that the revenue per airframe is much higher than the million that some use Since we are interested in Boeings ability to completely zero out the deferred costs with its backlog I think it is fair to use the backlog composition and using the discounts that seems to be long term average discount As a reference for the sanity check I used the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER The production of a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>ER costs about million and the market value during better days was around million giving a profit margin For the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>although technology heavy I do expect the production costs to be more or less the same Using the average revenue per aircraft of million you end up with a profit margin of roughly or million What this shows is that the assumption of a positive margin of million that I sketched earlier is far too optimistic What you can ask yourself is what this million figure actually tells you With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>using the program accounting practice instead of unit accounting there is not a lot of transparency and the true importance of this figure might be unclear To make it a bit clearer it is important to understand the deferred costs which in essence are nothing more than the difference between Boeings program assumptions for costs and revenues and what the company realized So for every million that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>expected based on their calculations and that was not there million was added to the deferred costs As of now the deferred costs stand at bn and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>expects to zero this out completely by the end of their unit accounting block This is where the million becomes important We know how many units there are left in the block so we know how much profit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>either by cutting costs most likely or increasing revenue less likely <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has to make As long as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has zeroed out the deferred costs by the th unit in the accounting block there is no problem There are units left in the block meaning that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>has to make an average profit of million on those airframes Implementing the assumption of flat deferred costs for the average required profit is million This is a very simple calculation that shows at first sight <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>will not be able to recoup the deferred costs within the accounting block Careful research has shown that average revenue for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>is likely close to million Program projections that use million as a revenue estimate are heavily flawed since million is most likely a cost estimate rather than a revenue estimate Using some very simple calculations it does not seem achievable for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>to breakeven within the current accounting block unless they are working on a tremendous cost cutting effort whit sizable impact on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Boeing </span>the production costs What you should be aware of is that I am not attaching a sell advise to this outcome but see any dip caused by Boeings accounting practices as a very strong buying opportunity If you would like to receive updates for my
