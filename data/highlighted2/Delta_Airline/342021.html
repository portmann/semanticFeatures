(Uncertainty) </span>Still, Facebook shows a seasonal pattern - "An autumn sprint followed by a winter hibernation."I was reading your last article on Facebook and for the most part agree with your analysis and outlook.I'm curious if you factor seasonality into your analysis.For example, when I look at the seasonality for Facebook on Financhill, I see that it is due to fall by 6.7% over the next 13 weeks.Prior to this message, I had not even heard of Financhill.But after looking at the "seasonality" section of the site, I found my suspicious to be true: It's a black box site.I am not against automated stock analysis services, but I am against those services that hide their inner workings.Financhill indeed shows FB to fall in the coming 13 weeks, but based on what factors?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A look at the chart shows a prediction curve (dotted lines): This alone should be a red flag. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A prediction of this sort implies a model that uses overfitting. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A model that is "overfit" looks good from a numerical standpoint, but almost always fails moving forward. (Uncertainty) </span>That is, the model works on historical data because it is trained on historical data, but the model does not imply anything of statistical significance.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The 13-week period is arbitrary and has no fundamental basis. (Uncertainty) </span>Seasonality is only seasonality if it contains an underlying fundamental cause.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That cause could be related to the weather, as in agricultural stocks, or investor psychology, as in the "Sell in May" phenomenon. (Uncertainty) </span>That is, seasonality is only relevant when it is based on something.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Otherwise, the chosen time segments are 100% arbitrary. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So my first response to Whitney is to ignore Financhill's seasonality predictions - they have no basis and are black box-based. (Uncertainty) </span>Now to Whitney's second question: Whether seasonality is a factor in Facebook's stock.As I have shown in many articles, earnings periods are great times to break up stocks in a search for alpha-rich earnings.For Facebook, I intend to do the same.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>H0: Facebook stock shows no statistically significant stock growth difference during different earnings seasons We will have four alternative hypotheses, one for each quarter. (Uncertainty) </span>Since the inception of FB, the buy-and-hold strategy has outperformed the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA: SPY ) by 100%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Thus, a random three-month period of holding FB should produce a total return of 44.25%. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Hence, we must see returns significantly different than 44.25% for a strategy that employs holding during a certain earnings period. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I ran this test and found significant differences for two earnings periods. (Uncertainty) </span>The numbers you will see in the charts below show the cumulative returns for holding FB for a single earnings period per year, every year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The significantly different earnings periods should be obvious. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Clearly, Q1 and Q4 were significantly different than the average Q2 and Q3 returns. (Uncertainty) </span>Unlike many stocks, which are evenly weighted across the year, FB sees outperformance during Q4 and underperformance during Q1.Think of it like an autumn sprint that requires a winter hibernation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This provides us with a FB hold strategy that possibly surpasses standard buy-and-hold. (Uncertainty) </span>What if we avoided the worst quarter - Q1?Would our gains exceed those of buy and hold?The chart below shows the results of this strategy, compared with standard buy-and-hold as well as holding the SPY: This seasonal strategy far surpasses the other two, despite freeing up three months' worth of funds.The seasonal strategy is 50% better than holding FB and 200% better than holding the SPY.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It also is a less volatile strategy than holding FB - rarely do less volatile investments outperform more stable investments. (Uncertainty) </span>We've also naturally cut down on our average drawdown by 33%.Would a 50% addition to your gains be worth switching from capital gains returns to income tax returns?For the majority of investors the answer is "yes."Investors interested in the seasonality of FB have little reason not to sell FB at the end of the year, buying back in April.The seasonal pattern of Facebook is as interesting as it is profitable.While an underperformance in Q1 is hard to explain, an exceptional Q4 is easier to explain.As an ex-marketer, I know Facebook as the go-to source to place ads for consumers.In fact, I have a saying: "If it doesn't convert on Facebook, it won't convert anywhere."In my experience, ads on sites such as LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) never get the ROI that ads on Facebook get (one exception is YouTube (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) ads, which I've found to work great for infomarketing products but not so well for products).With Q4 containing the holiday season, online ads are ramped up.Because Facebook uses a bidding system for its ads, competition increases, increasing the cost of ads.Seasonal keywords such as "Christmas gifts" become highly targeted and a seasonal opportunity for extra revenue.Many large companies rely on Facebook for online ads during the holiday season.Some of Facebook's largest clients include seasonal consumer product companies such as Nike (NYSE: NKE ), Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ), and Disney (NYSE: DIS ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For these companies, budget is no problem, and Facebook sees a sudden influx of non-stingy marketers competing for timely keywords. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Still, the possible reasons for evading Q1 elude me. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Perhaps readers have their own theories. (Uncertainty) </span>Feel free to post them in the comments section below.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Reducing your exposure to FB during Q1 is a worthwhile strategy, despite the tax implications. (Uncertainty) </span>First, the strategy outperforms buy-and-hold to such an extent that the conversion of capital gains earnings to income earnings only takes a small bite out of the overall profits.Second, the selling of FB at the end of Q4 and the buyback at the beginning of Q2 allows investors to "sell the peak" and "buy the dip," ultimately earning themselves more shares for the same amount of capital.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Third, the strategy opens up 3 months to grow your FB capital, whether safely through bonds or more aggressively through equity (hopefully one that statistically performs well in Q1). (Uncertainty) </span>Alternatively, you can apply the above results without actually leaving the buy-and-hold strategy.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Many investors refuse to sell FB for whatever reason or excuse - "Too much work," "I want the capital gains," or "I don't believe in statistics and you cannot time the market." (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These investors can at least hedge their FB position by recognizing the strong possibility FB will underperform in late winter. (Uncertainty) </span>How?An options strategy opened on FB during Q1 can hedge your FB position.I can think of at least ten options strategies that will work well with FB.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Each has its own use and risk-reward profile; for example, a credit spread works well for highly volatile stocks that begin a slow trend downward. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For the sake of practicality, I will recommend a bear debit spread, which limits the damage of time decay yet puts us in a profitable position for a bearish move: Buy to open FB (strike + 5) April put Sell to open FB (strike - 5) April put The above strategy should cost you roughly $450. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The theta is nearly 0 for such a strategy, meaning that you won't be losing money on the strategy through time decay. (Uncertainty) </span>In addition, delta should be -20, giving you a $20 gain for every $1 fall in FB's strike price.Soon I will be launching my Exploiting Earnings premium subscription here on Seeking Alpha.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In this newsletter, we will be employing both fundamental and pattern analyses to predict price movements of specific companies after earnings.
