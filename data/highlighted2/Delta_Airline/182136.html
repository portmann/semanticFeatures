centred on Boeings middle of market MOM aircraft John Wojick senior vice president SVP for global sales and marketing at Boeing confirmed in an interview prior to the air show that the Seattlebased planemaker is indeed moving forward with a study of an allnew commercial jet tentatively earmarked for entry into service in the middle of the next decade This potential MOM aircraft would be sized between current single and twinaisle offerings and supersede the discontinued Boeing family The upcoming MOM is expected to be a cleansheet design developed from scratch rather than being a derivative of an existing model As aviation professionals descended into the City of Light for the biennial Paris Air Show much of the buzz was centred on Boeings middle of market MOM aircraft John Wojick senior vice president SVP for global sales and marketing at Boeing NYSE BA confirmed in an interview prior to the air show that the Seattlebased planemaker is indeed moving forward with a study of an allnew commercial jet tentatively earmarked for entry into service in the middle of the next decade This potential MOM aircraft would be sized between current single and twinaisle offerings and supersede the discontinued Boeing family Production for the old ended more than a decade ago However it remains somewhat of a darling with US carriers on transcontinental routes and other transatlantic longhaul routes that do not justify the use of a larger aircraft The upcoming MOM is expected to be a cleansheet design developed from scratch rather than being a derivative of an existing model Brand new airplanes are a rare occurrence so even a rumoured launch several years down the line brings much fanfare Boeings previous jet the Dreamliner was announced in and the one prior to that the was launched in Having held highlevel talks with airline customers and industry professionals Wojicks team has identified the key attributes that are expected from this latest offering from Boeing Our customers tell us they want an airplane that is bigger than the and flies farther said Wojick It would be very efficient operating domestically in the continental US or China and regionally as well in Southeast Asia and Europe It could fly from the East Coast of the US to many destinations in Europe Wojick stressed that current interest stems from a broad customer base ranging from established incumbents such as American NASDAQ AAL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>NYSE DAL and United NYSE UAL to smaller lowcost carriers This makes a departure for Boeing from its stance from last year when Boeings chief executive at the time Jim McNerney said the company would take no more moonshots in the form of an entirely new aircraft This change of heart is most likely due to mounting pressure from archrival Airbus OTCPKEADSY The Toulousebased planemaker has a MOM offering in the form of the ALR a stretched version of its next generation Aneo family with more efficient engines Due for an entry to service date sometime in the ALR has been hailed by Airbus as having the longest range of any narrowbody jet The aircraft can be configured to seat up to passengers and with a range of nautical miles nm the aircraft would be suitable for transatlantic routes as well as Southeast AsiaAustralia ones Meanwhile according to analysts from Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch the Boeing MOM offering would seat between passengers and have a range of between nautical miles Based on a patent filing by Boeing US A it is possible that this MOM aircraft would adopt an oval fuselage instead of a conventional circular one From an aerodynamic point of view for a given cabin width the aircraft would be subjected to less parasitic drag if an oval crosssection fuselage is chosen In light of this enhanced cabin width it is expected that the aircraft would be a twinaisle offering possibly seating passengers in a configuration in economy and or in premium cabins It is speculated that the MOM aircraft would have an aluminium body with composite wings similar to the X The MOM programme is however expected to be not as technologically ambitious as the Dreamliner on which entry to service suffered delays of more than years due to glitches plaguing its lineup of cuttingedge technologies The Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch analysis puts the fuel cost per available seat mile ASM of the M at US cents on an average of seats lower than the s US cents per ASM and ERs US cents after factoring in a stepchange in fuel efficiency We expect the MOM to replace the As As As As shortrange routes and s in service today We estimate that widebody aircraft have too much range capability than required for the route they are flying and may provide a downgauging opportunity We note that there is overlap from the two calculation methodologies In our view if Boeing were to produce a middle of the market aircraft at the same rate of the current production of the Boeing per month per year there may be enough demand for almost years of production analysts led by Ronald Epstein wrote The figure was derived from an assumption of of the airport pairs or pairs less than nm a part would be served by the MOM accommodating seats Yet where such a demand exists does not necessarily mean it is best served by the MOM as suggested given the load factor realistic airline use belly cargo and enroute wind considerations The reengined Aneo and Aneo for example will have seats and seats in a standard class configuration consisting of Business and Economy seats for the former and Business and Economy seats for the latter Assuming an average of load factor yields seats and seats for the neo and neo respectively Further factoring in airlines typically have less dense configurations than airframers standards it is easy to see which aircraft realistically serves the market well not the least to mention it is problematic to build a routes business case using a load factor that inevitably leads to demand spill and revenue that is not maximised in accordance to the forwardbooking curve with dynamic changing demand forecasted by the origin and destinationbased OD revenue management system RMS Airlines ability to make full use of the aircrafts performance on transatlantic routes is further hindered by payload restrictions and enroute winds On the London HeathrowLos Angeles route for instance which stretches an average of nm in equivalent still air distance ESAD using North Atlantic tracks existing widebodies already face some considerable payload restrictions For a class seat A with an actual takeoff weight TOW of lbs it would operate at a useful payload inclusive of passengers and cargo at lbs or having just of the maximum structural payload of lbs being available assuming an average headwind of knots January also saw the fiercest North Atlantic winds in over months with a British Airways ER reportedly catching a tailwind in excess of knots on the eastbound New York John F KennedyLondon Heathrow leg and completing the journey in just under hours This illustrates the higher takeoff weight offered by the tonne As is actually needed which would dramatically improve the available payloads from the tonne vintage exNorthwest example used above thus dispelling the notion that the latest available aircraft is overbuilt once cargo and operational considerations are factored in In fact a class seat with an actual takeoff weight TOW of lbs flying the aforementioned westbound LHRLAX journey would be able to carry of its lbs maximum structural payload or in a nutshell a full haul of passengers and cargo What the ovalshaped MOM targets is niche new thin longhaul routes one notch below the smallest widebody aircraft hovering around seats in a realistic load of the seat MOM The seat bracket seems a little too wide and too high Examples abound in the Southeast AsiaAustralia market Philippine Airlines firsthalf load factor between the Southeast Asian nation and Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Darwin and Cairns from st December onwards with an average of seats filled Malaysia Airlines load factor at seats Royal Brunei Airlines factor at seats just to name a few Intriguingly these Southeast Asian carriers fleet planning process lays bare the fact that Boeings M or MOM will be sandwiched between the class seat nm ALR and the Aneo Philippine Airlines is currently in advanced talks to swap out of outstanding Aneo orders into the ALR ones Malaysia Airlines Berhad MAB signed a lease agreement with Air Lease Corporation ALC for As which includes options for additional As and Aneos and Royal Brunei operates the Dreamliner on its Melbourne route Indeed the purported US billion programme cost for Boeings M translates into a US million per piece according to Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch This would amount to a premium on top of the As US million fulllife base value FLBV Whether the MOM offers more value with cargo space in a abreast LD underbelly configuration being suboptimal than an A and the successor ALR remains questionable You have to make sure if you do build an airplane like this that its not overengineered and therefore overpriced said Aengus Kelly lessor AerCap Holdings NV chief executive Its not a longrange airplane Its not going to be a traditional widebody aircraft so you cant charge those prices Asked
