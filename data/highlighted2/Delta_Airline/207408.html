During the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>Air Lines NYSE DAL earnings call the CEO took the opportunity to kill the investment thesis in Boeing NYSE BA The airline manufacturer is set up for years of strong free cash flow due to a substantial order backlog but now questions abound regarding the quality of those orders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>Air Lines though appears to question the strength of that backlog by suggesting that the markets for airplanes are in a bubble The CEO specifically mentions on the Q earnings call an issue with widebody planes and goes further to suggest that narrowbody planes will eventually face a similar fate Well were seeing a huge bubble in excess widebody airplanes around the world and weve been approached by more than one party I mean the market appears to be the s about to years old the price is about million And on A the lease rate is about a fifth of what it would be new So we do think that the aircraft market is going to be right for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>and over the course of the next to months and we think that weakness in that aircraft bubble in widebodies is going to spread to narrowbodies and that there will be some huge buying opportunities because low interest rates really have created a huge widebody bubble in the world Singapore Airlines I think has of these airplanes that are coming off lease or being retired that are to years old He later explains that not many people can take on a substantial amount of s but it doesnt really explain the discrepancy between the large backlogs at the airplane manufacturers and the statements by the CEO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>According to reports from Boeing the majority of the unfilled orders are for the narrowbody plane Of the planes on order as of the end of September planes are related to this model The mentioned by the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>CEO is only of the airplanes on back order or less than The perplexing part is that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>CEO claims that the narrowbody market will hit a favorable point in the next year yet China recently ordered planes The deal includes widebody aircraft though the majority of the planes are the s The country wouldnt order planes if the market for used planes was so favorable Or more importantly the cheap prices on used planes today isnt good enough to pass up new planes that wont be delivered in five years Remember that theses cheap used planes today will be years old by the time China needs the new planes recently ordered Along with the Chinese order Boeing made a commitment to increase the monthly production up to airplanes per month in up from only planes per month now The production levels pale in comparison to the roughly s produced on a monthly basis The news doesnt appear to impact the free cash flow levels that Boeing is on pace to generate over the next few years If anything it highlights the demand is shifting further towards modern fuelefficient planes over used ones Either way lower stock prices only add to the ability of Boeing to repurchase shares on dips A stock with such a strong buyback plan somewhat welcomes dips in the stock price The current net payout yields dividend yield plus net stock buyback yield sits around At the stock is down roughly from highs to start the year Investors even get a solid dividend to help with the volatility from these bubble concerns The key takeaway is that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>CEO is talking his book and describing a used plane market that isnt as strong as the new planes The market shift towards modern fuelefficient planes is clearly having an impact on used plane pricing but it isnt likely to impact current Boeing production rates Also dont forget that a lot of the orders on the books for Boeing arent scheduled for delivery until dates at which a cheap used plane today doesnt offer a replacement value Possibly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>is smart to go the cheaper route with used planes but the strong cash flows of many global airlines provide the opportunity to modernize fleets that were recently outdated Investors need to relax and buy this global airplane manufacturer on
