But theta and vega have been drastically reduced.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We are only spending $0.21 a day to keep this option strategy open, and we've reduced volatility exposure by over 80%. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This gives us a very clear position: Short AAPL without regard to time or volatility. (Uncertainty) </span>If you're shorting AAPL, this is what you will want.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>AAPL is perhaps the most heavily watched stock and can jump $10 on news that a fly landed on Cook's nose. (Uncertainty) </span>You also want to be patient; AAPL short interest is low and AAPL fans hold onto the stock despite bad news for longer than fans of other companies.Shorting AAPL based on the fundamentals is smart, as are most fundamental trades.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But the oft-ignored factors: investor sentiment, fans' support of the company and characteristics of the stock (e.g., volatility) should be accommodated in your short strategy. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The debit spread, in which you sell and buy puts of different strike prices, accounts for these factors when shorting AAPL. (Uncertainty) </span>Debit spreads have two major cons, neither of which apply to AAPL.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The first is limited upside: the selling of the second put option theoretically limits your profit to the difference In the puts' strike prices multiplied by 100. (Uncertainty) </span>Thus, if you buy a $105 put and sell a $95 put, your max profit is $1,000, theoretically.This is not an issue with AAPL because Apple, as a company, does not present unlimited downside profits anyhow.The company has its brand, lots of cash, myriad assets and many other factors that put a lower limit on how the stock can go.With a simple shareholder equity analysis, we can calculate the stock price of AAPL in the event of liquidation (first note that shareholder equity is at a relative low, making this estimate a conservative estimate of a conservative estimate): Anyway, we get a conservative, conservative estimate of $21.40 per share in the worst case scenario.With AAPL currently above $103, the company would have to move 10% closer to its worst case scenario for the above debit spread to stop giving profit to its holder.That is, the limited upside is only a true limit in a dire situation - say Samsung successfully sues Apple for IP theft and drops the stock below 80% of its current price, at which time we really will have no more upside to this strategy.The second major con is liquidity.A stock that is low in liquidity is susceptible to wider spreads when adding multiple options to an options play.AAPL does not have any liquidity issues, so we can safely ignore this.Also note that the above debit spread is more expensive than the pure put option.This is the opposite of reality, in which debit spreads are always cheaper than their one-option alternatives because you gain a premium via the sold option.In the above example, I was purposefully searching for two option strategies of the same delta and therefore had to alter the strike prices, resulting in a more expensive strategy.You can easily do the same with the 92.5 put.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>By the way, pure puts can be used on AAPL but should only be used in swing trades, when you're highly confident that the stock will fall quickly and that you will be able to close your position quickly, as in the example at the bottom of this page . (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If this is your first put debit spread, watch out for these two mistakes: Exiting too early and fear of exercise. (Uncertainty) </span>The first, exiting too early is no amateur mistake.The theory of options states that your max profit has been reached when the lower of the two strike prices is reached by the stock.But this is simply not true, for two reasons.First is the fact that your delta at that time will still be non-zero.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The delta of the higher strike option will be nearly -100. (Uncertainty) </span>That of the lower strike option will be more like -80.Because deltas are additive , you are still -20 delta.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This means that even after AAPL dips below $95, you can still earn money on your debit spread - roughly $20 per $1 decline in the stock price. (Uncertainty) </span>Many options traders sell too early, thinking their max profit has been realized when it can still grow by double-digit percentages.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Second is fear of exercise. (Uncertainty) </span>I've never seen a sold put be exercised.The person who buys the sold put has no logical reason to exercise, and if he does exercise, just consider yourself unlucky: You were hit by a car that doesn't know what side of the road to drive on.Let's look at the mindset of the buyer of your put to understand the reason you won't be exercised: The first reason you don't exercise puts is because it is more profitable to simply sell the put back into the options market.Exercising the put and selling the stock includes an extra action, which requires extra commissions.Unlike exercising the options, which exposes you to AAPL's dividends, exercising puts sends you into a short position, in which you'll have to pay dividends!The second reason is that if the put is in the money and you don't sell, you'll be eating time decay.And a put that's far in the money is equal to stock in terms of delta and still has additional time value.The put gives you exactly what the shorting the stock does without the margin and loan costs.Barring rare conditions, only idiots exercise puts.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Safe from exercise, a put debit spread is not like a call debit spread or a calendar call spread, where you can see your profits disappear due to unforeseen circumstances. (Uncertainty) </span>(I remember seeing all my profits on a six-month calendar call spread disappear due to it slightly dipping into the money and having being bought, forcing me to pay dividends above the time decay profits I earned - six months of opportunity cost down the drain).Shorting AAPL is not recommended for reasons related to the fundamentals of the company - no matter how bad Apple is looking.However, at certain times, AAPL makes a good debit spread short.I've shorted AAPL several times via this method and have come out with more cash for my AAPL long positions in the end.Soon I will be launching my Exploiting Earnings premium subscription here on Seeking Alpha.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In this newsletter, we will be employing both fundamental and pattern analyses to predict price movements of specific companies after earnings. (Uncertainty) </span>I will also be offering specific strategies for playing those earnings reports.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Because my articles occasionally get 500+ comments, if you have a request for an analysis on a specific stock, ETF, or commodity, please use @damon in the comments section below to leave your request.
