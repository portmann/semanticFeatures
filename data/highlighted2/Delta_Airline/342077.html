class='textDiv'>Read This Before You Short Apple Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha After my first attempt at shorting stock I literally ended up sleeping under a bridge With the volatility of Apple stock you could easily repeat my mistake when shorting the stock consider using options instead A debit spread allows us to short the expensive stock that is AAPL without regard to time decay or volatility crushes Because AAPL does not have fundamental problems or liquidity issues the major downsides of debit spreads on this stock are naught After I published Why Todays Apple Products Are Absurd some readers asked me if they should short Apple NASDAQ AAPL This article saves me the trouble of responding to each person individually And on that note I will not give out individual investment anyway as I do not hold myself to the public as an investment advisor But still if you want to short AAPL this article should prove useful for you A quick note on what I do Ive played both long and short positions on AAPL dependent on Apples current situation and the tech economy in general I currently hold no positions on AAPL My previous position was long So let me clear up two things first One my last article was not a bearish thesis on AAPL Nor was it a bullish thesis Honestly Apple is a great growth company in a shortterm transition to becoming a great value company While its previous asset was innovation its current asset is its brand Apples brand allows it to outcompete competitors in many ways so if you are hedging in the tech market ensure AAPL is one of your longs That said if you are shorting the tech market or the overall general market and looking for a fast downward mover AAPL is a good bet AAPL has a beta of and thus will most likely fall faster than both the tech market and the general market in the event of crashes However Im not yet to my second point which is When you buy something you know exactly how much you stand to lose When you short a stock however you expose yourself to limitless risk The next few paragraphs are my personal history on shorting If youre new to shorting read on otherwise skip to the next section My first short was insanely lucky I lost on my first short Yes you read that right I was lucky My luck stems from the fact that I lost more than I expected to lose the very first time I shorted stock I learned my lesson faster than of short sellers Prior to coming to Seeking Alpha my trading strategy was technical In nearly seven years after entering the stock market I shorted stock for the first time Netflix NASDAQ NFLX The technicals were there and I had a lot of margin so why not I pulled the trigger After nearly wiping out my account after I had just moved to Japan I couldnt make rent My backup savings were in Taiwan and my debit card wouldnt work on the ATMs here I later learned that I never activated the international function of the card I ended up sleeping under a bridge in Kyoto That gave me a lot of time to think I now know that a technicalbased short trade on a stock with earnings about to come out is a dumb idea I was so angry at myself that I bought practically every book and journal article I could on stock movement after earnings to rectify my mistake I now understand that trading stocks with upcoming earnings requires a deep understand of fundamental analysis and investor psychology In fact I now run an earningsbased trading newsletter But the unexpected loss from the short still lingers in my mind Why did I expose myself to limited risk when I could have gone short on the stock in a much smarter way At present most of my positions are short positions but none of them are outright shorts Instead I use complex option strategies Each stock should be analyzed for the option strategies most synchronistic with the short position before choosing an options strategy For AAPL at the present time the debit spread is the best options strategy If you are going to short AAPL you need to consider the unlimited risk that you truly expose yourself to For many other companies the unlimited risk is only an academic theory Viacom NASDAQ VIA NASDAQ VIAB for example might have ways of coming back in the television entertainment industry but it will never invent a lifechanging gadget like Apple That is most companies can only eat up market share but a company in the tech or biotech industry especially one with a history of innovation exposes short traders to the risk of an unveiling of a lifechanging and thus stock pricechanging invention Therefore shorting calls or outright shorting AAPL are potential account killers That said the short thesis on AAPL is strong enough to merit shorting the stock in a manner of limited risk Ive laid out my thesis of slowing growth for Apple and another for a potential market crash These two factors combined with AAPLs high beta value puts AAPL at serious risk during an economic downturn Adding to the short thesis is the fact that Apple has had increasingly bad luck in court It has recently lost two cases one of which resulted in a M loss in cash and another that has serious implications for the privacy rights of Apple iPhone owners These spell bad news for APPL stock but not the company itself investors react irrationally which is a fact that many Apple fans do not realize until the stock has dropped unfairly In addition if the M payout seems like chump change and it is to Apple realize that Apple is facing threat of billions of dollars in back taxes to the European Union The short reasons for Apple beyond these are numerous including failed product releases and growth the main aspects that have brought Apple to the forefront of the tech community Although a strong argument can be made for a short position ensure due diligence Returning to the stock AAPL stock has two important characteristics that we must account for movement speed and volatility Most amateur option traders ignore these factors And for AAPL they are especially important A put option limits your risk because you are buying something not selling something When you buy a put option your max risk is the cost of the option But unlike shorting stock you expose yourself to theta decay That is now that weve limited the risk of shorting weve added a new risk the risk that AAPL will not move south fast enough A put option has a daily cost that must be overcome in the end by downward movements in the underlying At first this option should look okay to Apple bears AAPL would only need to move roughly downward for you to profit from this option You can tell from the delta value which gives you a conservative estimate of the amount earned on the option per drop in AAPL stock price In this case the option would bring you per fall in AAPL stock But the theta price is also important It also gives you a conservative estimate of how much value the option loses per day This option costs us per day to hold on to and that value increases In other words every days AAPL does not fall you need an extra fall to reach a breakeven price This is not desirable especially in a stock such as Apple that can hop up for days based on news We need to reduce theta Then there is vega which tells us how the volatility of AAPL stock affects the option price The more volatile AAPL becomes the more expensive the option becomes This is great if you expect AAPL to become more volatile but what if you believe AAPL to be at a high level of volatility and that AAPLs volatility will fall in the future In such a case your option loses per change in the implied volatility of the stock So AAPL could very well move downward evenly and slowly but you witness your short position losing money This is especially important for AAPL because volatility is on the rise For the recent month AAPLs mean and max implied volatilities were and respectively One year ago during the same time period I calculated volatility from Jan to todays date the mean and max volatilities were and To responsibly short AAPL today we need to reduce vega So what did we learn though this option analysis We need to reduce theta and vega the time and volatility decay while keeping delta the gains from downward movement the same Now that youve had a primer on delta theta and vega you know more than of options users You also know the dangers of playing put options on Apple due to the options theta and vega dangers Heres the solution that allows us to keep delta <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>is virtually unchanged But theta and vega have been drastically reduced We are only spending a day to keep this option strategy open and weve reduced volatility exposure by over This gives us a very clear position Short AAPL without regard to time or volatility If youre shorting AAPL this is what you will want AAPL is perhaps the most heavily watched stock and can jump on news that a fly landed on Cooks nose You also want to be patient AAPL short interest is low and AAPL fans hold onto the stock despite bad news for longer than fans of other companies Shorting AAPL based on the fundamentals is smart as are most fundamental trades But the oftignored factors investor sentiment fans support of the company and characteristics of the stock eg volatility should be accommodated in your short strategy The debit spread in which you sell and buy puts of different strike prices accounts for these factors when shorting AAPL Debit spreads have two major cons neither of which apply to AAPL The first is limited upside the selling of the second put option theoretically limits your profit to the difference In the puts strike prices multiplied by Thus if you buy a put and sell a put your max profit is theoretically This is not an issue with AAPL because Apple as a company does not present unlimited downside profits anyhow The company has its brand lots of cash myriad assets and many other factors that put a lower limit on how the stock can go With a simple shareholder equity analysis we can calculate the stock price of AAPL in the event of liquidation first note that shareholder equity is at a relative low making this estimate a conservative estimate of a conservative estimate Anyway we get a conservative conservative estimate of per share in the worst case scenario With AAPL currently above the company would have to move closer to its worst case scenario for the above debit spread to stop giving profit to its holder That is the limited upside is only a true limit in a dire situation say Samsung successfully sues Apple for IP theft and drops the stock below of its current price at which time we really will have no more upside to this strategy The second major con is liquidity A stock that is low in liquidity is susceptible to wider spreads when adding multiple options to an options play AAPL does not have any liquidity issues so we can safely ignore this Also note that the above debit spread is more expensive than the pure put option This is the opposite of reality in which debit spreads are always cheaper than their oneoption alternatives because you gain a premium via the sold option In the above example I was purposefully searching for two option strategies of the same delta and therefore had to alter the strike prices resulting in a more expensive strategy You can easily do the same with the put By the way pure puts can be used on AAPL but should only be used in swing trades when youre highly confident that the stock will fall quickly and that you will be able to close your position quickly as in the example at the bottom of this page If this is your first put debit spread watch out for these two mistakes Exiting too early and fear of exercise The first exiting too early is no amateur mistake The theory of options states that your max profit has been reached when the lower of the two strike prices is reached by the stock But this is simply not true for two reasons First is the fact that your delta at that time will still be nonzero The delta of the higher strike option will be nearly That of the lower strike option will be more like Because deltas are additive you are still delta This means that even after AAPL dips below you can still earn money on your debit spread roughly per decline in the stock price Many options traders sell too early thinking their max profit has been realized when it can still grow by doubledigit percentages Second is fear of exercise Ive never seen a sold put be exercised The person who buys the sold put has no logical reason to exercise and if he does exercise just consider yourself unlucky You were hit by a car that doesnt know what side of the road to drive on Lets look at the mindset of the buyer of your put to understand the reason you wont be exercised The first reason you dont exercise puts is because it is more profitable to simply sell the put back into the options market Exercising the put and selling the stock includes an extra action which requires extra commissions Unlike exercising the options which exposes you to AAPLs dividends exercising puts sends you into a short position in which youll have to pay dividends The second reason is that if the put is in the money and you dont sell youll be eating time decay And a put thats far in the money is equal to stock in terms of delta and still has additional time value The put gives you exactly what the shorting the stock does without the margin and loan costs Barring rare conditions only idiots exercise puts Safe from exercise a put debit spread is not like a call debit spread or a calendar call spread where you can see your profits disappear due to unforeseen circumstances I remember seeing all my profits on a sixmonth calendar call spread disappear due to it slightly dipping into the money and having being bought forcing me to pay dividends above the time decay profits I earned six months of opportunity cost down the drain Shorting AAPL is not recommended for reasons related to the fundamentals of the company no matter how bad Apple is looking However at certain times AAPL makes a good debit spread short Ive shorted AAPL several times via this method and have come out with more cash for my AAPL long positions in the end Soon I will be launching my Exploiting Earnings premium
