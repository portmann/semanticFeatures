style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>would be a major stamp of approval for the program CSeries order would give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>access to the most advanced narrowbody aircraft for a likely killer deal An order would solidify Bombardiers position in the narrowbody market while offering a longterm third alternative to Boeing and Airbus for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>Bloomberg has reported that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>NYSE DAL is in the final stages of a large aircraft order to replace up to smaller aircraft in its fleet Bombardier is in the running and an order win for Bombardier OTCQXBDRBF would be a serious positive for both Bombardier and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>While Airbus OTCPKEADSY Boeing NYSE BA and Embraer NYSE ERJ are also in the running for this order <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>CEO Richard Anderson made some interesting comments back in January when he stated that the company was very impressed with the CSeries the technology it delivered and would buy the CSeries at the right price Since then the CSeries has visited Atlanta the headquarters of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>Air Lines at least two times including last week and Reuters has reported that Bombardier executives were also in Atlanta over the past week The CSeries benefits from substantial technological advantages compared to both the Airbus A and Boeing while also delivering lower fuel burn and operating costs An order of the CSeries would be a major blow to both Airbus and Boeing and would mark a solid entry for Bombardier into the narrowbody aircraft market as opposed to its current situation which has Bombardier teetering on the edge due to lack of aircraft orders for the CSeries Boeing realizes this threat after letting United Airlines in the late s order Airbus Aircraft which saw the aircraft make a major entry into the United States thereafter The latest United Airlines order for narrowbody aircraft involved the airline picking up aircraft for million a piece according to Goldman Sachs a substantial discount from their list price of million This discounting shows how serious Boeing is about keeping Bombardier out of the narrowbody market however despite Boeings wishes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>may wish to keep them in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>Air Lines has turned the airline industry on its head The airline is a great example of innovation in the airline industry in modern times The airline has resorted to out of the box thinking such as buying an oil refinery to control its fuel costs purchasing equity stakes in foreign airlines to build a presence around the world and taking on an abundance of Boeing aircraft an aircraft many saw as obsolete before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>acquired it Giving the deal to Bombardier would validate Bombardier as a solid third competitor in the narrowbody aircraft market something that could benefit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>for years to come as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>would have three vendors as opposed to two to source from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>Air Lines is one of the most profitable airlines in the world and its management is respected among many in the industry and seen as the gold standard While previous orders for the CSeries from Air Canada and so on are great boosts and keep the program running they do little more than that An order from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>would carry substantial clout and may cause many other airlines in the world to take a second look at the aircraft It may also put an end to the heavy discounting from Boeing to keep the aircraft out at all costs since Boeing may realize they are fighting a losing battle and only harming themselves An example to take a look at is the Boeing order I mentioned above Prior to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>order it had next to no interest from any airlines however following the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>stamp of approval the aircraft value soared and lease rates climbed Robert Agnew an aviation consultant described <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>as kind of the market maker For Bombardier shareholders a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>order has the potential to seriously turn the struggling CSeries program around and give it a major stamp of approval It may also involve converting the static Republic Airways OTCPKRJETQ CSeries order over to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>Speculative investors could look to take a stake in Bombardier stock or call options or wait until after such an order is announced before taking a stake If Bombardier does lose the CSeries order it would be unfortunately another blow to the program Despite this there would be one last major airline in the United States who may order it and this is American Airlines NASDAQ AAL For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>shareholders no matter how this order turns out it will be a win If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>orders Bombardier they have validated a third competitor in the space will be getting the best product on the market in terms of tech specs and will likely be getting a killer deal The CSeries will also hedge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>against potential future rising fuel costs as the aircraft is much more fuel efficient than anything else available On the other hand if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>orders from Boeing they are guaranteed to get a killer deal the same or better to what United received An order from either Airbus or Embraer would have to trump both of the above proposals so there is no losing for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>in any case I
