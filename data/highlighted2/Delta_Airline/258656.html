Lewis Sizemore CFA Though were on opposite sides of the Kinder Morgan NYSE KMI tug of war I find that the editors of Barrons and myself tend to sing from the same songbook We both tend to be contrarian value investors who ignore hype often to our own detriment Had I bought the hype and piled into bubbly momentum names like Facebook NASDAQ FB Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and Netflix NASDAQ NFLX this year Id be a lot richer At any rate Barrons announced its Favorite Stocks for over the weekend and Im going to pick through the portfolio for potential gems Overall this is a portfolio Id be happy to buy and hold for the next year Its diversified across industry sectors and for the most part very reasonably priced That said there are parts of the portfolio I like a lot better than others Im not bearish on AMC Networks but the stock doesnt strike me as particularly cheap and it doesnt pay a dividend Its also almost entirely dependent on a single show franchise The Walking Dead Id be reluctant to put any serious money into Celgene for similar reasons A disproportionate share of its revenues come from a single drug And frankly thats a criticism of the entire biotech sphere and a reason why I tend to shy away from the sector in retirement portfolios I was pleased to see Barrons include Apple and General Motors Im long both and expect them to do well in the next year Apple will have a difficult time dreaming up a more lucrative gadget than the iPhone and growth there looks sure to slow The smartphone market in general is becoming saturated and while the iPhone and now s have offered an obvious reason to upgradea longawaited shift to larger screensits unclear as always what will make the next model a musthave Earnings for Apple are projected to rise at only a high singledigit pace over each of the next two years But consider two things First thats the kind of growth investors get from General Mills NYSE GIS which goes for times earnings and carries net debt not a cash surplus And consumers can switch from Cheerios to Raisin Bran without having to migrate their family photos to a new platform This has really been my point for much of the past year Yes Apples growth will slow Of course it will For that matter growth across the entire US economy looks pretty weak right now But at current prices Apple is not only priced as a nogrowth company its priced for actual shrinkage And that is absurd I did a short writeup on the company last quarter see Revisiting Icahns Apple Call After the Correction making many of these same arguments And Ill repeat a point Ive made several times this year Apple has enough cash in the bank to sustain its dividend at current levels for years without earning a single dime in additional profit and this takes into account the taxes the company would have to pay today if it were to repatriate its foreign cash Apple is a nobrainer at these prices and Im glad to see Barrons recommending it here Im also happy to see General Motors making the cut As Barrons writes Earnings for GM are expected to jump more than this year to as the company moves past onetime costs related to faulty ignition switches In two years earnings could approach a share That makes the stock look underpriced at a recent Perhaps more impressive than the upside potential for earnings however is the potential bottom for profits during the next downturn in car sales GM has slashed its debt through bankruptcy restructuring and cut its US breakeven point from million yearly vehicles to fewer than million The recent pace of sales is over million As investors gain confidence in GMs improved earnings stability they could award the stock a valuation more befitting an healthy cyclical business A rise to times earnings would put shares at based on this years estimate for a gain of over A point Ive made for months now is that the fleet of American vehicles is looking long in the tooth The average age of a car on American roads is now over years Yes I understand that demographics are a longterm headwind here But frankly we have a lot of clunkers on the road that will need to be replaced come what may In the meantime Im happy to collect GMs dividend Moving on I like Discover Financial Services and Foot Locker though I dont love either I have nothing particularly negative to say about either other than that at current prices I dont see them outperforming the broader market Though I do not currently own it I do like CVS Health at todays prices Barrons does a pretty good job of summing up the bullish narrative here The company remains at the center of trends that could keep earnings growing at a doubledigit pace through the end of the decade Increased medicalplan coverage is driving more prescriptions So is the aging of the baby boomers Medical plans are looking to save on drugs and some are turning over more business to drugplan managers like CVS Caremark Patients looking for savings including those who remain uninsured can take care of basic healthcare needs through walkin clinics like CVS Minute Clinic chain The stocks dividend yield is unremarkable at but payments are expected to grow more than cumulatively over the next three years I dont consider CVS a screaming buy but I would expect it to at least modestly outperform the broader market starting at these levels As for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>Air Lines and Mohawk Industries I would expect both to do fairly well so long as the US economy avoids a recession Neither wildly excite me as standalone picks but I could see either fitting nicely in a diversified portfolio The only stock I would say I hate at current prices is Electronic Arts Ive been wrong here before and perhaps Im just showing my age here but the profit expectations for video game makers seem aggressive to me This article first appeared on Sizemore Insights as Taking a Look at Barrons Favorite Stocks for Disclaimer This site
