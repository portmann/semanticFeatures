(Uncertainty) </span>.As June ended so did the Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank), and with it took the long standing support for the Boeing Company (NYSE: BA ) down with it.Amid congressional infighting, the charter, which was started by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to provide loans for overseas businesses that buy expensive US products, expired.Famously, Boeing gained significant benefit from the support it received from the Ex-Im Bank, so much so that the Chicago-based company even lobbied hard for the continuation of the charter.So how important was the Export-Import Bank for the American aircraft manufacturer?The whole purpose of the Ex-Im Bank was to promote US exports and increase employment at home by providing financing to foreign customers for purchasing goods and services from US companies.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This in turn also provided American companies to compete with their international rivals who <i>more</i> than often received state support in their businesses .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Unfortunately after <i>more</i> than 80 years of operations the charter slowly started to favor Boeing <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> and it came to the point where the Ex-Im Bank was mockingly called `` The Boeing Bank '' .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>A <i>closer</i> look at Ex-Im Bank 's annual statement reveals that out of the $ 10.786 billion in grand total guarantees it had signed on for in the fiscal year of 2014 , <b>approximately</b> $ 7.37 billion or 68 % were in favor of Boeing .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Not only does this show how biased the charter might have been but it also shows how <b>dependent</b> Boeing was on it .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It 's no <b>surprise</b> that the Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO , Ray Conner , <b>believes</b> that the loss of the Ex-Im Bank puts the company at a `` huge competitive disadvantage '' .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Interestingly enough, there are some companies which had been rallying for the Ex-Im Bank to stop its operations.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Companies like <b><mark>Delta</mark></b> Air Lines ( NYSE : DAL ) cited the loan guarantees offered by the charter to foreign airlines as damaging to US airline prospects since it allowed the foreign companies to reduce their cost of capital in upgrading their fleet and thus charging <i>more</i> competitive ticket prices against domestic producers . (Delta: Surprise) </span>Now the closure of the Ex-Im Bank does not necessarily mean that Boeing will immediately start seeing losses.Ex-Im has said that it will stay open to continue servicing the $112 billion in existing obligations, with its operating budget approved through 30th September.Moreover, in a second quarter deliveries report published by Boeing it was clear that the American airplane manufacturer had surpassed its European rival Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSY ) with 381 deliveries made in the first half of 2015 while Airbus delivered 304 commercial planes in the same period.Boeing's total deliveries for the first had showed that it had showed an improvement of 11% year-over-year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite a troubling start it <b>seems</b> like the 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner models are gaining popularity amongst airlines internationally with a total of 249 737 Max deliveries and 64 787 Dreamliner deliveries made in the first half of this year .  (Uncertainty) </span>This growth in commercial plane demand can be attributed to the improvement in passenger and freight traffic in emerging markets, a scenario which has the potential to carry Boeing through this Ex-Im Bank ordeal with some ease.However where Airbus does beat Boeing is with its total new orders which stand at 348 as compared to the Chicago-based company's 281.Last month's Paris Air Show was just another display of how close the race between these two companies as they both managed to impress potential customers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Unfortunately the closure of the Ex-Im Bank will eventually have a significant impact on Boeing and <b>might</b> see a different situation emerge in the commercial airplane manufacturing market which has been dominated by these two rivals for the past few decades .  (Uncertainty) </span>It's a good thing that Boeing is having a great year so far in terms of its operating performance, which is also represented in its healthy stock price.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the past 52-weeks the company stock has gone up by <i>more</i> than 15 % to its current position of $ 144.48 per share and on 22nd June the Boeing board approved a quarterly dividend of $ 0.91 per share payable 4th September .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The latest quarter 's earnings <b>surprised</b> analysts by posting a <i>better</i> than expected EPS of $ 1.87 .  (Surprise) </span>Now since the current obligations of the Ex-Im Bank are still going to be financed we can expect the company to meet its expected annual revenue of $94.5 billion to $96.5 billion, staying on course to deliver 750-755 aircrafts this year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As a closing note I would like to point out that the aptly labeled `` death '' of the Ex-Im Bank <b>might</b> not necessarily last .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There are <i>more</i> than 1,000 companies , including Boeing , trying to revive the charter .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>More</i> importantly given the current economic condition of the US it seems like the Democrats and some like-minded Republicans might actually manage to <b>revise</b> the Bank 's closure .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Despite calls from the IMF to hold back till 2016, Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen has repeated that the central bank is likely to start raising interest rates this year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Official figures published by the US Labor Department showed that US jobs growth and factory sales had slowed down as figures from April and May were also <b>revised</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite being such an <b>uncertain</b> environment we do know that it is also a very delicate one as well .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There 's a chance that in the coming days if conditions continue to head the way they are then we <b>might</b> see the Export-Import Bank back in action .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But for the sake of analysis let 's also <b>assume</b> that the charter is not revived and Boeing has to move on without its help : over the next few years Boeing would slowly start losing its market share to Airbus and revenues would decline .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Along with its revenues the company will have to resort to <i>bigger</i> discounts which will ultimately eat into its profitability .  (Surprise) </span>However it won't be an easy battle for Airbus either since Boeing boasts an impeccable reputation amongst its clients for the top notch service it provides before and after sales.Overall, the Ex-Im Bank's demise is going to have a very noticeable negative impact on Boeing.But investors should not offload BA stock any time soon.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company stock still has some juice left in it and <i>more</i> importantly we need to wait and see what the future holds for Boeing and whether the Ex-Im Bank will be restored .  (Surprise) </span>And let's not forget that after years of support there's a good chance that Boeing can flourish without the training wheels it had been wearing for decades.Source: The Impact Of Ex-Im Bank's Death On The Boeing Company Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .
