an industry leader and is poised for long term growth As a commercial and defense aerospace leader Boeing will continue to leveraged its position as a wellrun and reliable company to improve customercontract acquisition Boeing is a wellmanaged value stock with an attractive dividend to boot This aircraft manufacturer has performed well historically and based on analyst estimates it is poised to steadily increase profit With decreasing oil stocks Boeing may receive residual benefits from the strong performance of commercial airlines Based on my valuation I believe Boeing is a strong long term investment Boeing is the worlds largest aerospace company and leading manufacturer of commercial jetliners and defense space and security systems A top US exporter the company supports airlines and US and allied government customers in countries Boeing products and tailored services include commercial and military aircraft satellites weapons electronic and defense systems launch systems advanced information and communication systems and performancebased logistics and training Thesis Catalyst For The Boeing Company NYSE BA Based on relevant multiples and projected earnings I believe Boeing is good stock I also believe Boeing is solid well run company Boeings additional provides an additional incentive for investment Boeing also will likely receive residual benefits from tanking oil prices As commercial airlines continue to benefit from cheap oil Boeing will likely receive more orders from newly revised ambitious growth strategies Additionally cheap oil may reduce manufacturing costs for Boeing Boeing is currently priced at and it has a market cap of Billion Its forward pe is and its price based on expected growth NYSE PEG is very attractive at X I performed my valuation based on moderate five year cash growth estimates I based my model on the average of analyst estimates over the next five years avg growth over years and growth in perpetuity discounting future cash flows to present value I came to a fair value of price appreciation with an added dividend certainly provides additional incentive to invest long term the CEO of Boeing is Dennis Muilenburg Muilenberg previously served as VP and COO and he is a business operations expert The average tenure of Boeings board of directors is years which indicates industry expertise and wise macro management Boeings primary competitors are Raytheon NYSE RTN Lockheed Martin NYSE LMT General Dynamics NYSE GD and Northrop Grumman NYSE NOC The competition is fierce but the sector as a whole aerospace has performed remarkably well over the last five years Interestingly Boeing often works alongside its competitors particularly for defense contracts For example Lockheed Martin and Boeing jointly own and operate Hellfire Systems LLC to manufacture AGM Hellfire Missiles and United Launch Alliance ULA manufactures <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>IV and Atlas V launch vehicles for the airforce Additionally Boeing and Lockheed are jointly involved in manufacturing and production of The F Raptor defense program and the V Osprey tiltrotor aircraft I believe Boeings competitive advantage comes from its efficient processes and aggressive cost cutting efforts I believe Boeings full service approach providing customer service manufacturing servicing repair engineering upgrading enhancing and transitioning have allowed Boeing to build a reliable and trustworthy brand as well as increase customer acquisition Boeing is a well run company with upside potential Boeing offers an attractive dividend as well as the opportunity to invest in American manufacturing I believe Boeings willingness to work alongside competition as well as its focus on improvement and cost reduction will continue to improve customer acquisition as well as profitability I recommend a long position in Boeing Source The Long Case For The Boeing Company Disclosure Iwe
