(Uncertainty) </span>As a number of events around the world come together at once, they potentially bring trouble ahead to Boeing's (NYSE: BA ) bread and butter product, the Boeing 737.A common theme among many of these issues for Boeing however is China.The issues range from rising interest rates, low oil prices, China, the C919 and a pilot shortage to the threat of a high speed rail resurgence worldwide.I go into further detail on these issues below.In my previous article here I outlined how we often see big headlines highlighting big orders and big fleet ambitions for Chinese airlines followed by quiet cancellation of these orders or the airlines quietly missing growth targets.In fact in this article I came up with the following chart showing the extent of the problem.There are many likely reasons for this slower Chinese growth, from a slowing Chinese economy to increased high speed rail expansion across China.Table 1 : Aircraft Operated by Chinese Airlines in 2015 vs. Previous 2015 Projections Not only are the airlines missing ambitious growth targets, but I outlined in my article Beijing and Hong Kong as airports that had big ambitions yet fell significantly short of the 2008 Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSY ) forecasted 2015 passenger numbers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the case of Hong Kong the 2015 passenger numbers are likely to miss the forecast by almost 50%! (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After seeing such a drastic difference in passenger numbers forecast by Airbus and the reality of passenger numbers a question comes to mind. (Uncertainty) </span>Does Boeing have a realistic idea of how quickly the Chinese aircraft/air travel market is actually growing?As China's economy continues to slow, and low cost manufacturing leaves as its wages continue to rise it is going to become more and more crucial for the Chinese to be successful manufacturing and exporting higher tech products such as aircraft.Aerospace is now listed as an ambition in China's latest 5 year plan and even if it only racks up orders for its aircraft at home in China this will deliver a noticeable blow to both Boeing and Airbus narrowbody orders.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At Boeing, 737 deliveries to China make up almost one third of all 737 deliveries! (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite many people dismissing the C919 as another likely Chinese aircraft failure, I outlined in my article here that upon closer examination there are stark differences in place this time around. (Uncertainty) </span>The aircraft has a large amount of its components manufactured abroad in the USA and its design is being done by many ex Boeing and Airbus engineers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If China really wanted to it could have its domestic airlines operate the C919 rather than operating foreign aircraft in an attempt to stem the huge amount of money the country sends abroad to buy aircraft. (Uncertainty) </span>Russia too is working on a new narrowbody aircraft.Its latest aircraft, the Sukhoi Superjet 100 has been noted as a technological success despite few orders or recognition from the West.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is unlikely to change with sanctions in place, but its forthcoming aircraft the Irkut MS-21 already has over 150 orders and could see greater international success if it can prove the aircraft is technologically sound and closely comparable to Western products. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>International orders are unlikely to come from many Western countries but they could very well come from many emerging markets and developing nations, especially those with closer ties to Russia. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While China's success in narrowbody aircraft with the C919 is still uncertain, something that is much more certain is its success in high speed rail. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>China has revived high speed rail and is becoming a leader in the sector as the country in only 10 years now accounts for 60% of worldwide high speed rail with another 16,000km, or almost double the current amount under construction. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As the president of the United States travels abroad and sells aircraft, America's largest export by dollar volume, it is not a stretch to assume the Chinese will not start doing the same with high speed rail. (Uncertainty) </span>Countries that value a strong relationship with China are likely to be swayed into buying high speed rail from China as the country seeks to export its technology worldwide.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This push from China could force other established high speed rail players such as Japan to make their offerings more compelling and lead to a resurgence in high speed rail projects worldwide. (Uncertainty) </span>I have read many aircraft industry forecasts and while many mention the threat of high speed rail in China, I cannot recall any mentioning the threat of high speed rail becoming more prominent worldwide due to a resurgence in the technology.The president of Japan on his last visit to the United States announced his intention to bring Maglev high speed rail technology to the United States, and China has already secured a deal to place high speed rail between Las Vegas and Los Angeles.In addition plans are being examined for high speed rail between Houston and Dallas, between Baltimore and Washington DC and there is already construction under way for high speed rail in California.Many countries worldwide are now looking at the technology with Russia, India, Indonesia, UK, Singapore, Australia, Malaysia, Vietnam, and several middle eastern countries a handful of the many countries worldwide looking at installing high speed rail.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In addition, as farfetched as it may seem, concepts such as the Hyper Loop from Elon Musk should not be dismissed and have the potential to take rail technology a step further and make it an even more compelling alternative to air travel for many city pairs worldwide. (Uncertainty) </span>As many countries around the world have experienced a boom in their economies and a growing middle class air travel has taken off.With a lack of local talent with enough experience to fill these pilot roles many airlines in these countries have turned to American and European pilots, giving them what during the recession and until very recently were very competitive pay packages versus what these pilots would have made at home.With $22 billion in profits at North American airlines this year however, a stark contrast to only a few years ago, along with a pilot shortage many pilots are being lured back home.These pilots are coming home to much better pay and benefits as North American airlines make a disproportionate amount of profit this year relative to their peers worldwide.What this does however is make more and more routes in developing countries uneconomical to fly if the local airlines have to use foreign pilots and compete with the salaries Western airlines are now being able to pay.As airlines in these developing countries struggle to find economical pilots, many routes will not be flown and countries will begin looking for alternatives that become more attractive such as high speed rail.If airlines in developing countries cannot economically fly certain routes due to a pilot shortage this will inevitably lead to order cancellations and deferrals, impacting Boeing negatively.The A320 NEO has been a phenomenal success since its launch and the aircraft now holds a 60% market share versus 40% for the Boeing 737 Max.Historically the market share has been closer to 50/50 and it should be concerning that Boeing has lost market share over time.Boeing was leaning towards an all new narrowbody aircraft but had its hand forced the other way to instead re engine when American Airlines made a large Airbus order and Boeing wanted to quickly have a product offering to compete.This unfortunately forced Boeing to re engine rather than replace what is a 50 year old design while Airbus is working with a design 20 years younger that is much easier to re engine and upgrade.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the other hand however, rumors of Boeing launching a possible 757 replacement are welcome news and such a move would allow it to regain a larger share of the narrowbody market. (Uncertainty) </span>It would also allow Boeing to have a monopoly in this segment of the aircraft market as there is currently no true 757 replacement available.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is silly to try and predict oil prices but at the same time it is hard to see a situation where we see $100+ oil as the days of explosive Chinese growth and emerging market growth seem to be over for the foreseeable future. (Uncertainty) </span>It is looking like there will be much more pain ahead for emerging markets before things turn around.This is causing older aircraft to become much more economical and airlines to delay retirements in favor of keeping these aircraft longer.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Low oil prices may be one reason that 2015 will be the first year since 2009 (barring any major orders in the next 2 weeks) that orders for the Boeing 737 are much less than deliveries. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At the same time industry veterans , such as Richard Anderson of <b>Delta</b> are warning of an aircraft bubble and it is not hard to see how this could certainly be a possibility in the near future as emerging market economies who placed enormous orders in prior years continue to slow . (Delta: Uncertainty) </span>A rise in interest rates is expected to be announced very soon now.Low interest rates making new aircraft more expensive are likely to deter airlines from ordering new aircraft compared to the past several years while interest rates remained near 0% and Boeing saw a boom in orders.An interest rate rise is also expected to hit emerging markets particularity hard, an area where Boeing has a large order backlog of 737 aircraft in.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Ex Im bank is a big point of frustration for Boeing. (Surprise) </span>It was only recently reauthorized through 2019 after being closed for 5 months.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This lack of consensus within the government about what to do regarding the Ex Im bank led to frustration at Boeing with the company stating it would be forced to move key parts of the company overseas to countries with export banks if the U.S cannot reauthorize it. (Surprise) </span>Many other countries worldwide all have similar tools to export their goods overseas and if the U.S disarms again due to government bickering it stands to hurt Boeing and put it at a disadvantage to all its competitors.The things that fueled large 737 orders and the huge ramp up in Boeing 737 production over the past several years - low interest rates, expensive oil, and fast growth in emerging markets have all changed dramatically recently.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Due to this it seems unlikely that Boeing can sustain production rates as high as they are going forward, or at least it seems unlikely they can ramp up to 52 737 aircraft per month by 2018 unless things change dramatically between now and then. (Uncertainty) </span>I am not bearish on Boeing but I am not particularity bullish either.I think there are many positives ahead such as a 757 replacement that would set Boeing apart and give it a monopoly in an entire aircraft segment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the other hand however, the issues outlined above, current generation 747/777 orders drying up and the enormous costs to be recouped from the 787 program make me not so optimistic.
