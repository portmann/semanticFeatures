(Surprise) </span>Boeing 777-10X will be the final nail in the coffin of the Boeing 747-8I.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sources state Boeing ( NYSE : BA ) has been proposing a <b>possible</b> Boeing 777-10X jet to their customers .  (Uncertainty) </span>In this article, I will have a look at how this will affect the competitive playing field and how this places the Boeing 777X in the market.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Just like the Boeing 777X family , the Boeing 777-10X is a push towards <i>bigger</i> aircraft but not too big .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The Boeing 777-10X jet would turn the 2-member Boeing 777X family into a 3-member family , which <b>could</b> potentially make all members of the 777X family <i>more</i> attractive for airlines .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Table 1 : Seating and range for the Boeing 777X The Boeing 777-10X would have 25 seats ( 4 rows ) <i>more</i> than the Boeing 777-9 , which has 50 seats <i>more</i> than the -8 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The range of the Boeing 777-10X is still unknown and <b>probably</b> one of the main subjects of discussions with airlines .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The range requirement is one of the most important factors that <b>could</b> determine the success of the airplane .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> that the propulsion system and the wing planform stay the same , an educated guess for the range is 7000 nm - 7200 nm .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>AeroAnalysis expects that customers will require the airframe to have a range of 7500 nm , hence <i>more</i> fuel tanks , <i>bigger</i> engines or a <i>bigger</i> planform <b>might</b> be required .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>On paper, the Boeing 777-10X does not have any competitors.The Boeing 777-10X is seen by many as a direct competitive threat to the Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) A380.The Airbus A380 can seat up to 544 passengers with a range capability of 8200 nm.Those are the pretty figures on paper.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , there are a lot of Airbus A380s flying around with <i>less</i> than 500 seats .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The Boeing 777-10X <b>could</b> effectively compete with the Airbus A380 and even beat the airframe in terms of cost efficiency .  (Uncertainty) </span>What needs to be said is that the Airbus A380 will be superior in the 500+ seat market, but this market is a small one and likely unprofitable for any player that wants to be active in this niche.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Also for airlines , the 500 + seat segment is a <b>risky</b> one .  (Uncertainty) </span>The Airbus A380 has high capital costs and has shown to be hard to fill, making it very cost inefficient to operate.On the other hand, the Airbus A380 offers a standard of luxury that even a Boeing 777-10X cannot offer.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So the Boeing 777-10X will target the <i>lower</i> bracket of the Airbus A380 market , which can not be operated with profits .  (Surprise) </span>Although the Boeing 777-10X can compete with the Airbus A380, I think Boeing will provide the ultimate blow to their very own Boeing 747-8I when they launch the Boeing 777-10X.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The Boeing 777-9 can be operated in 3-class configuration with <b>approximately</b> 357 seats , while the Boeing 747-8I has 8 <i>more</i> revenue generating seats .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Boeing 777-10X would have around 378-405 seats in 3-class configuration - thirteen <i>more</i> than the Boeing 747-8I .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This means that the Boeing 747-8I will be squeezed by the -9 and the -10 X. I think one of the most important conclusions that can be drawn is that the Boeing 777-10X would serve 2 purposes : Compete with Airbus A380 on the <i>lower</i> end of the 400-500 seat market .  (Surprise) </span>Replace the Boeing 747-8I.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With the Boeing 777-9 , Boeing already has a replacement for the Boeing 747-8I but it <b>could</b> be lacking some space to put some luxury in place .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With the Boeing 777-10X , Boeing can either offer that extra space to add luxury and comfort or offer <i>higher</i> revenue potential by adding additional seats .  (Surprise) </span>An important thing to note is that the seat delta (difference in number of seats) between a Boeing 777-10X and Airbus A380 in 3-class configuration is substantial.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are only a few airlines that operate the Airbus A380 with <b>approximately</b> 405 seats .  (Uncertainty) </span>Over the past few days I have read and heard many people stating that the Boeing 777-10X is a hypothetical aircraft for an unsuccessful market segment.I think the Boeing 777-10X does make sense in some way, but will not be able to beat the Airbus A380 in terms of luxury.The Boeing 777-10X would be geared towards the requirements set by the Gulf carriers; carriers that currently are operating the Airbus A380, even on the unsuccessful routes.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The reason for the market segment being ` unsuccessful ' is because the Airbus A380 in fact is too big to operate with <i>less</i> than 450 seats .  (Surprise) </span>So far airlines have been serving this segment with an oversized airplane.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The Boeing 777-10X <b>seems</b> to be a <i>better</i> fit for the job and Boeing already knows who will be buying it .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It will take a while before the Boeing 777-10X will be launched, but what bodes well is that the Boeing 777X is a development that is supported by customer feedback, whereas the Airbus A380 was a prestige project that did and still does not center on customer feedback.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the end , the Boeing 777-10X <b>could</b> be the nail in the coffin of superjumbos in general , not only the Boeing 747-8I or Airbus A380 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Airbus at this point does not have a suitable answer, which gives Boeing an advantage.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you would like to receive updates for my upcoming articles , please click the `` Follow '' text at the top of this page next to my profile .
