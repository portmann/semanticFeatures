(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Signs of consumer fatigue are showing up in the United States when pertaining to the iPhone.However, these trends aren't substantial enough to indicate an inflection point in annual shipment run rate.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Investors could be overpaying <b>assuming</b> the company falls short and iPhone shipments end up being flat year-over-year .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , the arguments do n't seem compelling enough , and one <b>could</b> simply extrapolate the long-term growth in installed base to come away with a <i>more</i> concise picture .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As such , it <b>seems</b> analysts are rationalizing the valuation and are likely confirming the market bias as it 's hard to rationalize sustained outperformance when based on conventional market theory .  (Uncertainty) </span>While, I'm not necessarily bearish on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) it's fair to say that investors should also consider the counterarguments being made by analysts.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For the most part , I felt like the most compelling argument was made by Jefferies analyst Sundeep Bajikar who had mentioned that interest in the iPhone <b>seems</b> to have peaked in the United States .  (Uncertainty) </span>He substantiates this with the below graph.He's one of the highest ranked Wall Street analysts on TipRanks.com.So the guy isn't a scrub, and he's making some pretty legitimate points here.When looking at the above graph the iPhone 6S fetched the lowest level of interest when compared to prior years, excluding China.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , it <b>seems</b> like these sentiment indicators are n't merely isolated to Google trends .  (Uncertainty) </span>I opened the latest Taking Stock with Teens report from Piper Jaffray, and for the most part, the report offers confirmation here because teenagers are demonstrating signs of consumer fatigue with the iPhone.In the spring 2015 survey, there was a slight decrease in year-over-year ownership of iPhones and expectations of purchasing the next iPhone.Of course these trends can be offset with emerging market growth.But for the time being, replacement demand in developed markets should either slow down or stabilize.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Increases in market share seem unlikely , and the recent release of competing handsets from competing OEMs <b>seems</b> to have won a small fragment of this market .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Again , both <i>broader</i> demographic data and tech-savvy teens seem to be in agreement here .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , to offset these concerns emerging markets show a lot of promise and <i>more</i> specifically there <b>could</b> be upside despite weakness in domestic demand .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Again, the Jefferies analyst mentions that the Chinese market offers a lot of upside in calendar year 2015.However, he disagrees with my stance on iPhone generating market share gains in the 2016 calendar year.To be fair, Sundeep's stance isn't isolated.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>broader</i> consensus feels the same way about Chinese iPhone market share peaking in 2015 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>For whatever reason , the <i>broader</i> consensus <b>believes</b> that competitive threats will limit iPhone saturation in the Chinese market .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , it 's quite <b>apparent</b> that Apple tends to dominate the $ 600 plus price category , and in the United States alone it has 90 % + market share .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I 'm not saying that those same exact trends will play out in China , but given the fact that the Chinese middle class is growing at a 20 % CAGR , according to McKinsey and Company estimates , the <i>broader</i> economic landscape can accommodate for approximately 20 % in organic growth with <b>perhaps</b> a small fraction given up to competitor handsets at premium pricing tiers .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Since Apple tends to dominate that specific category , <b>perhaps</b> macroeconomic trends can accommodate for growth in excess of 20 % per annum in terms of Chinese-specific shipments .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Again , those are our long-term average growth <b>assumptions</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the past couple years , growth was driven by execution as Apple opened retail stores across tier-1 and tier-2 Chinese cities , closed deals with major Chinese telecoms , and was able to substantiate the value proposition of a <i>faster</i> iPhone as network technologies started to catch up to specified baseband uplink/downlink speeds .  (Surprise) </span>The rollout of 4G frequency bands and network virtualization trends helped reduce OpEx and CapEx costs over at China Mobile (NYSE: CHL ), which sped up base station deployment in 2015.Apple increased pricing on its iPhones and also generated a 4 percentage point increase in market share.In the United States, Apple sustained 44.2% market share at an average selling price of $670.Now, obviously going into the next year, Chinese revenue will have to be driven by increases in shipment figures as ASPs are unlikely to improve.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>anticipate</b> Chinese shipment growth will be in the 20 % to 40 % range and the remaining developed markets will likely report single digit or flat growth rates .  (Uncertainty) </span>In 2016, mix shift won't drive much of an ASP increase.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But to really neuter assumptions on growth analysts have to <b>anticipate</b> a combination of declining shipments in developed markets and substantial deceleration in Chinese shipments .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Pessimism <b>seems</b> to be the order of the day , and as I have mentioned , they 're making their case based on observable trends in data .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, I think all of these factors can be captured by extrapolating the trend line in installed base or annual shipments.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Yes , I 'm well aware that growth can be patchy in certain years <b>depending</b> on the qualitative factors of updates .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Sometimes</b> interest is heightened when releasing the mid-cycle upgrade .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But given the lack of interest when based on consumer surveys and somewhat promising first week shipment figures one can <b>assume</b> that Apple is really highlighting the strength of the iPhone in foreign markets and not domestically .  (Uncertainty) </span>Furthermore, given the fact that there's still room to further saturate the upper middle class in China, there's no real indication that Chinese market share figures should decline year-over-year, which is what analysts on consensus are forecasting.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After all , it 's hard to forecast 0 % year-over-year iPhone shipment growth unless if you 're <b>anticipating</b> that FY 2015 was a fluke in terms of iPhone sales .  (Uncertainty) </span>Thankfully, Apple's brand is fairly strong and isn't faddish even if consumers are showing some signs of fatigue.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Therefore , I <b>anticipate</b> iPhone shipments <i>greater</i> than 235.3 million units based on consensus estimates ( 6.9 % growth ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>anticipate</b> similar growth trends despite concerns pertaining to Chinese macro and waning interest from U.S. consumers .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While they 're legitimate risk factors , they 're not solid enough indicators for analysts to <b>anticipate</b> inflection in iPhone shipment delta .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sure , I could be wrong on my calculus here , but the cited <b>risk</b> factors of slowing U.S. iPhone shipments and growing shipments in developing markets are trends that can be observed in prior years .  (Uncertainty) </span>Therefore, since all of that data is already built into the historical data set one must merely extrapolate the data to arrive at a reasonable forecast.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Economists continue to cite concerns when pertaining to China , and that 's <b>probably</b> why analysts were skeptical of sustained momentum in China .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , Credit Suisse released a fairly promising report when pertaining to the Chinese situation as their macro team anticipates patterns of stabilization : We have consistently <b>believed</b> that if house prices in China fall by 15 % or <i>more</i> from here , then we would have a hard landing .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Real estate is 15% of GDP directly, 50% of household wealth, 56% of banks' collateral and up to 33% of local government revenue.Recently, real estate turnover and house price data have improved (with prices rising in half of Tier 1 Chinese cities).<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This , combined with some lead indicators stabilizing ( Korean PMIs , Shanghai Rebar rates ) and a <i>greater</i> policy response in recent weeks , makes us believe that near term , Chinese momentum <b>could</b> stabilize .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>We remain fundamentally bearish given the degree of overbuild, overvaluation and the size of GDP it represents (similar to that of Ireland and Spain in 2007).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Albeit , Credit Suisse also is <b>anticipating</b> some deceleration over the long run , but like everyone else , they 're not declaring 2016 to be the final inning of the Chinese growth story .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As such , it would be fair to assume that some of the longer-term macro models may hold <i>more</i> water than originally anticipated , as the short-term divot in economic data is likely driven by asset price fluctuations and not due to changes in aggregate consumption and consumer <b>confidence</b> indicators .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's another way of saying that Apple 's growth in China should hold up and while there are holes in the ship , the plugs are working <i>more</i> effectively than what many would honestly like to admit .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The stock is slightly outperforming the <i>broader</i> index but is still trading below fair value .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The stock will likely exceed the expected return , which is based on beta ( implied <b>volatility</b> ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of course , the possibility of outperforming <b>volatility</b> seems elusive to many , and quite frankly the path to least resistance is to assume that minimal <b>volatility</b> equals minimal returns .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, these valuations are just too cheap.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In fact , almost irresistible to a point where some ca n't help but <b>assume</b> that it 's too good to be true .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The stock is starting to stabilize , and I do n't <b>anticipate</b> the company to fall back below $ 110 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As such , I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation as I <b>anticipate</b> Apple to sustain a reasonable growth rate in key product categories .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Assuming my estimate is correct , we 'll have another year where sales can grow at above mid-teen rates , which is why the stock <b>seems</b> unfairly undervalued .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And while conventional value metrics indicates misvaluation , the technical factors , i.e. global liquidity , is weighing <i>more</i> heavily on recent price action than company specific fundamentals .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>These factors are temporary , and eventually I <b>anticipate</b> the stock to reflate to a <i>more</i> reasonable valuation as company specific fundamentals reassert institutional interest for the balance of 2015 and the duration 2016 .
