(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The original news was bizarre because it is rare for an business man to proclaim to the world of this great deal that <b>might</b> attract a bidding war .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Even <i>more</i> interesting is the <b>apparent</b> fact that nobody else wants the wide-body planes that are n't in high demand these days due to a market shift towards narrow-body airplanes .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The news though smacks of inconsistent with market demands with China Southern Airlines ordering 110 Boeing jets at a listed value of $10 billion.The airline though purchased several versions of the narrow-body 737.With the expected travel growth in China, the country is forecast to need to add considerably to fleets.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Common sense <b>suggests</b> that 110 new planes would trump one old plane .  (Uncertainty) </span>Wells Fargo though downgraded the stock sending Boeing's stock down over $5 for the day.As my research highlighted in the previous article, the 777 is only a small portion of the unfilled backlog.The narrow-body 737 that is the focus of the largest Chinese airline accounts for the vast majority of the orders on the books.At the end of September, Boeing had 5,656 unfilled orders that included only 541 orders for the 777 model in question.As of the end of November, the unfilled orders were stable at 5,648.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The unfilled 777 orders were down to only 530 , or <b>roughly</b> 9.4 % of backlog number .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Naturally , the wide-body 777 has a listed price of <b>nearly</b> triple the very popular narrow-body 737 , but any glut in old wide-body planes is unlikely to impact the backlog and production schedules of Boeing .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>more</i> telling story is that <b><mark>Delta</mark></b> placed a recent order for 40 planes that includes 20Â 737-900 ERs . (Delta: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>For an airline <b>suggesting</b> that gluts exist in the industry , <b><mark>Delta</mark></b> sure is buying a lot <i>more</i> <i>newer</i> planes than old ones . (Delta: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Slide 35 of the Investor Day presentation holds the likely truth to the story.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In essence , <b><mark>Delta</mark></b> is attempting to use the weakness in the used commercial aircraft market to gain <i>better</i> economics from the recent and future deals with Boeing . (Delta: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The key takeaway remains that <b><mark>Delta</mark></b> is trying to work the market for all the discounts <b>possible</b> . (Delta: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With a virtual duopoly for aircraft needed by commercial airlines , the fears of a glut <b>probably</b> provide the best opportunity to grab a discount .  (Uncertainty) </span>At the end of day though, analysts continue to ratchet up the EPS estimates at Boeing for 2016.The forecast is now up to $9.44 per share placing the stock at a value of 14.8x those estimates.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The stock is n't overly cheap , but the giant backlog and large stock buybacks provides plenty of support for <i>higher</i> earnings in the future .
