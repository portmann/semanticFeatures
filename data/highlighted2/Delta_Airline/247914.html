Similar to the C919, the MD-90 was designed in the USA and assembled in China with largely American parts.In Tianjin, Airbus successfully manufactures its A320 jet for many of its Chinese customers.Just as the Japanese overcame a stereotype that they were cheap and low quality, the Chinese overtime will be able to do the same if they develop a solid product.This question is a complicated one and there are dozens of things taken into account when ordering an aircraft.Price is a big factor and with the C919 being subsidized by the Chinese government and the labor costs of Chinese assembly workers being less than that of their American counterparts, the Chinese will have an advantage in cost.Next up comes availability.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If an airline requires X number of aircraft by a certain date and Boeing or Airbus cannot deliver, they may seriously consider the C919 as an alternative. (Uncertainty) </span>This, however, is not such a problem anymore.Before the 2008 financial crisis, Boeing and Airbus had years and years of backlog for their 737 and A320 aircraft and kept their production rates low, causing in some cases these aircraft to be resold used for higher prices due to their immediate availability.Since then, Boeing and Airbus have had numerous production hikes, likely to bring down their unit costs per jet in an attempt to compete better with the Chinese and also to soak the market to an extent.Finally, and this is a big one, is politics.Many airlines around the world are still state run or are largely influenced by the state.Aircraft are usually the largest single good a country will import by value, so there is a desire to try and get favors in return for spending so much money.Japan tries to sway its airlines to purchase Boeing aircraft since Boeing performs a lot of manufacturing in Japan in return.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Meanwhile, countries such as Israel and close American allies will buy Boeing aircraft almost with no second thought. (Uncertainty) </span>When Indonesia ordered a record number of Boeing 737 aircraft, the CEO was reported as saying he did not have a choice and was pressured by government officials to buy the American aircraft.A similar situation played out when Air China ordered 747-8 aircraft and John Leathy was reported as saying they were unable to sell the A380 to China as it was a political purchase.Vueling airlines of Spain was pressured to buy Airbus aircraft in return for additional landing slots at Paris.So economics, technology and price aside, as China becomes a bigger partner to many countries around the world going forward, many countries will be pressured to buy Chinese aircraft just as many are pressured to buy Boeing and Airbus today.The shortage of landing slots at key Chinese airports and the ability for the Chinese to use this as a bargaining chip in securing overseas orders is also overlooked.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Delta</b> strikes me as an opportunistic airline in the U.S who may look to purchase Chinese-made aircraft once they receive FAA certification in return for additional prime landing slots at key Chinese airports . (Delta: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The ARJ21 was a disaster; however, I do not believe that Boeing shareholders should write off the C919 due to this. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>COMAC has taken a completely different approach when designing this aircraft and the approach looks like it will be much more successful and convincing to international customers that the aircraft is a solid product with top quality parts from around the world. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The Chinese will undoubtedly pressure their airlines to order as many of the aircraft as possible to reduce the huge sums of money that flow out of the country annually to import Western aircraft. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That alone will have the potential to sell huge volumes and in addition, the Chinese ability to use politics and slots to win orders is something I believe many have overlooked and something that could drive a large number of overseas orders for this aircraft.
