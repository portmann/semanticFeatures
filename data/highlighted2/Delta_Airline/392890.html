(NYSE:TBI) | Seeking Alpha My previous bearish note may have been a bit early, but the thesis is starting to pan out. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Business fundamentals deteriorating amid macro headwinds that are gaining strength, suggesting more pain in the pipeline. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>TrueBlue Inc. ( TBI ) fundamentals have started to catch up to some of the dynamics discussed in my previous Bearish note on the name, but more importantly, up close the numbers seem to suggest that the deterioration may have just started and the reaction seen in the staffing company's stock, which suffered one of the biggest single-day declines in years, may not have covered it all. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some of the bulls may shrug off the stock movement as an overreaction to not as uncommon seasonal weakness. (Uncertainty) </span>After all, the demand in selective pockets like the construction and SMB (small medium business) segment is holding up well, the recent acquisitions are integrating and delivering ahead of expectations and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), having reduced spending and causing much of the recent damage, is still expected to use the company's services for Canadian fulfillment centers and U.S. delivery stations.The long-term promise was that the company would be able to monetize the fast growth (10-15%) offered by the shift towards RPO (recruitment process outsourcing) in the staffing industry.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But there seems to be a bigger shift underway that is highlighted by the recent quarterly miss or the shift in the Amazon business. (Uncertainty) </span>From a macro standpoint, slowing economic growth and wage rate inflation is starting to catch up, just as the talk of a nationwide minimum wage increase is heating up.These macro problems seem to be having a magnifying impact on TrueBlue.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The organic growth rate seems to be coming to a standstill (almost 4% last quarter), wage inflation and operating cost increases are compressing margins, while Amazon, the largest customer, is reducing spending with the company amid rising labor and sourcing costs. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Financially, cash flows were helped by seasonal tailwinds, especially accounts receivable, and as margins come under pressure and the tax rate increases, the expectations may get readjusted. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Relatively, even though there are different dynamics going for different players in the broader staffing space, the company definitely seems to have lost the growth argument. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Headwinds faced by the business are only getting stronger Much of the macroeconomic news flow seems to be reiterating the growing headwinds faced by the space. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Source: GECS report Q1 by ACCA and IMA Like many other macroeconomic surveys, the Global Economic Conditions Survey (GECS), the largest regular economic survey of accountants around the world, in Q1 highlights the muted optimism shown by the businesses about their prospects, less than any other time in the past four years. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Indeed, more than half of the firms in the survey talked about either cutting or freezing employment and almost 42% of firms were planning to cut back on investment. (Uncertainty) </span>Hardly a pretty picture, overall.Revenue and EBITDA delta.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Source: TrueBlue The perception that the recent weakness was merely a seasonal problem, contained to Amazon or specific to a quarter seems misplaced. (Uncertainty) </span>The weakness has spread across most end markets and various geographies, even though in absolute terms, organic growth came down from an expected 7% to 3%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Within the Staffing Services segment, which is almost 93% of the total revenue and where most of the shortfall was concentrated, both branch-based operations as well as on-premise operations saw weakness, roughly half of the shortfall from each. (Uncertainty) </span>The retail business overall was flat, but branch-based business within retail was down 10%, which ties with what the broader retail sector results have shown.Similarly, manufacturing, excluding the on-premise business, also declined 10% and transportation and logistics related industries declined 5% as well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>No doubt, Amazon, by shifting the scope of service, caused much of the shortfall, almost $175 million that has been recognized so far. (Uncertainty) </span>Amazon over the next year intends to shift the scope of TrueBlue services from serving U.S. fulfillment centers to serving Canadian fulfillment centers and providing for U.S. delivery stations, which are the smaller package sorting centers closer to the final delivery location.The development is significant on many counts.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>First, this $175 million is almost half of the revenue that the company was expecting from Amazon. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Secondly, considering it may take a few quarters to ramp down and a few quarters to ramp up at other sites, expecting any growth comeback during this year may be ambitious. (Uncertainty) </span>Third, the development highlights the weakness in the business model itself, i.e. as the business matures and there is potential to leverage the knowledge, the client brings the business in-house or switches to other partners that are ready to do it at a lower cost.From a macro level, demand for temporary staffing over the last few years was driven by economic growth and large accounts that grew from 7% up to 25% of the company's total branch based delivery system.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now that some of that project-based work of large accounts is coming to an end and general economic trends are softening, staffing service companies like TrueBlue may continue to lack visibility for a while. (Uncertainty) </span>Even though the Street estimates have started to come down, as the chart above shows, they are not that far from what the Street was expecting just a few months ago, when the economic environment, visibility and performance was much better.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But even from the current levels, there might still be some room for readjustment. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Besides the top line pressure, covered in detail above, margins may also come under pressure. (Uncertainty) </span>Slowing demand with rising labor costs usually makes it tougher to increase prices, something that has already resulted in about 50 basis points of margin compression.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The pay rate inflation topped 5% last quarter, above the historical average of 2% to 4%, and looking at the drivers, be it higher wages in a tight labor market, increasing minimum wages in some states or increasing health insurance costs, it might be a while before the pressure eases off. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Besides headcount, which is the largest cost, facilities, the next largest cost, is also relatively fixed and that may make it difficult to cut costs in a short time frame. (Uncertainty) </span>If the margin pressure wasn't enough, the effective tax rate, which was 8% during the latest reporting period and lower than previous expectations, is also expected to increase to 32% on an annual basis.Bottom Line: This looks more like a beginning than an ending.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Author payment: $35 + $0.01/page view.Authors of PRO articles receive a minimum guaranteed payment of $150-500.Become a contributor ï¿½ Tagged: Investing Ideas , Short Ideas, Services , Staffing & Outsourcing Services, Broken Model, Changing Market, Industry Disruption, Secular Decline, Short, PRO</div></body></html>
