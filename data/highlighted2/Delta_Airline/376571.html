(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Morgan Stanley’s AlphaWise Tracker showing demand for 56.5 million iPhones.Apple’s March quarter revenue would come in at $55 billion.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) hit $105 after Morgan Stanley published a note saying its AlphaWise Tracker indicates demand of 56.5 million iPhone units with China delivering the strongest growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It appears the survey picks up strong demand in China similar to the data I published in my February Seeking Alpha article, Can China Mobile's 4G Platform Deliver For Apple? (Uncertainty) </span>Wall Street, or average sell-side analysts estimates, projects Apple's March quarter revenue to come in at $52.1 billion versus the company's guidance of $50 to $53 billion.To get to the midpoint of guidance Apple will need to sell 50.5 million iPhones.To match Wall Street's $52.1 billion it will need to sell about 52 million when paired with reasonable estimates for Macs, iPads, Apple Watch and services.I estimate iPhone's average selling price (ASP) should be about $660 in the March quarter, which would be down 4.4% from the December quarter's $691.This compares to the past three years December quarter-to-March quarter ASP decline of 4.4%, 6.4% and 4.2%, respectively.At 56.5 million iPhones Apple's revenue would be about $55.5 billion, significantly above guidance and expectations.One swing factor to iPhone sales is channel inventory, which increased 3.3 million units in the December quarter to 21.6 million and was slightly above five weeks of sales versus the company's guideline of five to seven weeks.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For the past five years Apple has increased the iPhone's channel inventory in the March quarter, but it would not surprise me to see it flat to down this year because the 3.3 million unit build was above historical trends. (Surprise) </span>If channel inventory does decrease it would lower the number of iPhones Apple reports it sold in the March quarter.Apple doesn't provide EPS guidance, but it does give enough information to forecast a range.Based on the numbers from its January press release I project Apple estimates EPS to fall between $1.87 and $2.05 with a midpoint of $1.96.Or at least that is what it wants investors to expect since the last time it did not beat the high-end of its EPS guidance was the March 2013 quarter.Wall Street has EPS at $1.99 for the March quarter with revenue of $52.1 billion.At 56.5 million iPhones Apple's revenue would be about $55.5 billion and EPS would increase by about $0.20 to $2.18, significantly above expectations.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This would probably lead to a ripple effect on future quarter's revenue and EPS projections, which are $9.06 for fiscal 2016 and $10 for fiscal 2017. (Uncertainty) </span>Each one million delta in iPhone sales translates to $660 million in revenue and $0.03 to $0.04 in EPS.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>How well has AlphaWise predicted iPhone sales? (Uncertainty) </span>In the past two March quarter's Morgan Stanley's initial AlphaWise survey underestimated iPhone demand by 1.4 and 6.2 million units, respectively.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the June and September 2015 quarters it overestimated demand by 5.5 and 5 million units, but almost nailed the December 2015 quarter's 74.8 million units sold with an estimate of 74 million. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Because there can be a large variability to its projection (which is a bit obscured in the graph above) it does appear that even if the survey data is too high, Wall Street's 52 million estimate is pretty safe. (Uncertainty) </span>This would mean its $1.99 forecast for EPS is on solid ground and is more likely to be exposed upwards than downwards.Combine this with Tim Cook's comments on the January conference call that the March quarter would be the toughest iPhone compare quarter it should steady investors concerns just at Samsung's ( OTC:SSNLF ) new smartphones become available.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: Sand Hill Insights and Chuck Jones is not a registered investment advisor or broker/dealer.Readers are advised that the material contained herein should be used solely for informational purposes.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sand Hill Insights/Chuck Jones does not purport to tell or suggest which investment securities readers should buy or sell.
