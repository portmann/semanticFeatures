Typically, the annual insurance costs are 1%-2% of the market value for new aircraft.For older aircraft this can be as high as 5%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In this case, I will apply 5% of the market value for the second-hand Boeing 777, giving it the maximum 'penalty' possible. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Figure 2: Comparison annual insurance costs second-hand Boeing 777-200ER and Boeing 787-10 (Source: AeroAnalysis) What can be seen is that the insurance costs for the Boeing 777 are almost $2 mln lower per annum compared to the Boeing 787-10. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Figure 3: Comparison annual depreciation second-hand Boeing 777-200ER and Boeing 787-10 (Source: AeroAnalysis) The depreciation depends on how many years the aircraft will be in service. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For the Boeing 777-200ER , I assumed that the aircraft can operate about 7 years before needing its next heavy maintenance , at which point <b>Delta</b> probably will get rid of the airframe . (Delta: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The value after 7 years is assumed to be almost zero. (Uncertainty) </span>For the Boeing 787-10, I used a 15-year depreciation model with a 10% value after 15 years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Figure 4: Advantage ownership costs Boeing 777-200ER (Source: AeroAnalysis) Figure 4 shows that the annual ownership costs and the purchase prices for the Boeing 777-200ER yield an advantage of almost $200 mln over the remaining economical viable life of the aircraft. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One would say this shifts the advantage to the Boeing 777-200ER without doubt. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However, to put this cost advantage into context, it is important to have a look at the difference in revenue as well. (Uncertainty) </span>Generally, one would say the reliability of an older aircraft will be less.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However, with average dispatch reliabilities in excess of 99% for the Boeing 777 and the Boeing 787, the gap seems to be small. (Uncertainty) </span>Nevertheless, loss of revenue days should be taken into account, but this is hard to quantify.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Table 1: Seat count and ticket prices Assuming that the flight is operated on average 1.5 times per day (this includes downtime for maintenance) with a load factor of 85% and the seat count and ticket prices as shown in Table 1, the Boeing 787-10 has a $117.9 mln advantage per annum. (Uncertainty) </span>What can be concluded is that a major part of the costs to purchase the aircraft are already being compensated for in the first year of service.Despite the higher costs of ownership for the Boeing 787-10, the higher revenue potential makes the Boeing 787-10 an interesting candidate to evaluate.This article focused solely on the cost of ownership and market value.In the following pieces I will add the costs of maintenance, crew, navigation and fuel as well.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Industrial Goods , Aerospace/Defense Products & Services</div></body></html>
