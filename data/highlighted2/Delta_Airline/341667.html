(Delta: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This of course put some pressure on Boeing 's share prices as <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> Boeing 777s will come off lease in the coming years and this <b>could</b> seriously impact Boeing 's order inflow for the Boeing 777 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is not the first time <b><mark>Delta</mark></b> is not favoring new Boeing aircraft , in 2014 <b><mark>Delta</mark></b> favored Airbus ' ( OTCPK : EADSF ) bid replacement of the <i>older</i> wide bodies over Boeing 's . (Delta: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In this article , I will have a look at how the Boeing 777-200ER compares to the Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner , which <b>could</b> be used as a Boeing 777-200ER replacement .  (Uncertainty) </span>Figure 1: Comparison market value second-hand Boeing 777-200ER and Boeing 787-10 (Source: www.AeroAnalysis.net ) What is clear is that $7.7 mln for a 10-year-old Boeing 777-200ER is reasonable.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Fitting a modern cabin into this 10-year-old aircraft <b>might</b> add another $ 20 mln in costs .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> that no other major replacements are required , the Boeing 777-200ER that <b><mark>Delta</mark></b> bought for $ 7.7 mln , will actually cost $ 27.7 mln to bring it to today 's standards in terms of comfort . (Delta: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This still is much <i>cheaper</i> than the $ 168.4 mln for the Boeing 787-10 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>lower</i> market value also means that <b><mark>Delta</mark></b> 's insurance costs for this airframe are <i>lower</i> . (Delta: Surprise) </span>Typically, the annual insurance costs are 1%-2% of the market value for new aircraft.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For <i>older</i> aircraft this can be as high as 5 % .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In this case , I will apply 5 % of the market value for the second-hand Boeing 777 , giving it the maximum ` penalty ' <b>possible</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Figure 2 : Comparison annual insurance costs second-hand Boeing 777-200ER and Boeing 787-10 ( Source : AeroAnalysis ) What can be seen is that the insurance costs for the Boeing 777 are <b>almost</b> $ 2 mln <i>lower</i> per annum compared to the Boeing 787-10 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Figure 3 : Comparison annual depreciation second-hand Boeing 777-200ER and Boeing 787-10 ( Source : AeroAnalysis ) The depreciation <b>depends</b> on how many years the aircraft will be in service .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For the Boeing 777-200ER , I assumed that the aircraft can operate about 7 years before needing its next heavy maintenance , at which point <b><mark>Delta</mark></b> <b>probably</b> will get rid of the airframe . (Delta: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The value after 7 years is assumed to be <b>almost</b> zero .  (Uncertainty) </span>For the Boeing 787-10, I used a 15-year depreciation model with a 10% value after 15 years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Figure 4 : Advantage ownership costs Boeing 777-200ER ( Source : AeroAnalysis ) Figure 4 shows that the annual ownership costs and the purchase prices for the Boeing 777-200ER yield an advantage of <b>almost</b> $ 200 mln over the remaining economical viable life of the aircraft .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One would say this shifts the advantage to the Boeing 777-200ER without <b>doubt</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, to put this cost advantage into context, it is important to have a look at the difference in revenue as well.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Generally , one would say the reliability of an <i>older</i> aircraft will be <i>less</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , with average dispatch reliabilities in excess of 99 % for the Boeing 777 and the Boeing 787 , the gap <b>seems</b> to be small .  (Uncertainty) </span>Nevertheless, loss of revenue days should be taken into account, but this is hard to quantify.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Table 1 : Seat count and ticket prices <b>Assuming</b> that the flight is operated on average 1.5 times per day ( this includes downtime for maintenance ) with a load factor of 85 % and the seat count and ticket prices as shown in Table 1 , the Boeing 787-10 has a $ 117.9 mln advantage per annum .  (Uncertainty) </span>What can be concluded is that a major part of the costs to purchase the aircraft are already being compensated for in the first year of service.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Despite the <i>higher</i> costs of ownership for the Boeing 787-10 , the <i>higher</i> revenue potential makes the Boeing 787-10 an interesting candidate to evaluate .  (Surprise) </span>This article focused solely on the cost of ownership and market value.In the following pieces I will add the costs of maintenance, crew, navigation and fuel as well.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Industrial Goods , Aerospace/Defense Products & Services</div></body></html>
