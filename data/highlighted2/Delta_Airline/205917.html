investors about a potential bubble forming in the jet market While I respect the CEOs opinion many aerospace executives havent seen the same thing at least to investors knowledge Shares of Boeing BA were finally starting to trade more bullishly following a few strong sessions to start off October However that quickly came to an end when shares fell more than on Oct following some negative commentary from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>Air Lines DAL CEO Richard Anderson In Deltas most recent conference call Anderson said Bold emphasis added by me Were seeing a huge bubble in excess widebody airplanes around the world and weve been approached by more than one party I mean the market appears to be for the s about to years old the price is about million And on As the lease rate is about a fifth of what it would be new So we do think that the aircraft market is going to be right for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>over the course of the next to months and we think that weakness in that aircraft bubble in widebodies is going to spread to narrowbodies and that there will be some huge buying opportunities because low interest rates really have created a huge widebody bubble in the world Anderson attributed this glut of aircraft to the incredibly low interest rate environment another unintended consequence from central bank policymakers But the more important question for investors is is this the end for Boeing Boeing is the premier maker of jet planes and while Andersons comments are somewhat of a concern we have to extrapolate more than what may meet the eye First there are a number of highly respected chief executives that continue to pound the table on the aerospace market as I highlighted here For one Alcoas AA CEO Klaus Kleinfeld was pretty upbeat about aerospace predicting and growth in and respectively On Friday well hear from highlyrespected Honeywell HON CEO Dave Cote who last quarter said the company saw robust jet engine demand and expects a modest acceleration to that growth in the second half of Another big player General Electric GE said airline traffic growth remains robust and aviation orders for the company climbed in the quarter as a result M Company MMM also cited strength in its aerospace market United Technologies UTX expects longterm growth to remain intact too Thats the benefit from listening to so many different conference calls as it really allows you to get a very wide view of the entire global market and its different industries I call this the Big Picture Summary which can be found here Im not dismissing Andersons comments by any means but I think its important for investors to recognize that just because one executive has noted a surplus in decadeold jets a surplus that is a benefit to his company nonetheless doesnt mean the current secular bull market in aerospace is dead At least not in the eyes of some of the most wellrespected executives in the country Theres also two other things to consider the first being that Boeing has an enormous backlog of orders and the other being that global airline traffic continues to grow at a rapid pace Ill start with the latter as global airline traffic is expected to grow per year for the next years according to the International Air Transport Association At this pace the billion passengers that flew in would more than double to a whopping billion by Keep in mind this is for air passengers and not cargo flights volumes of which are also expected to grow per year for the next five years Cargo flights very much matter as well highlighted by the fact that FedEx FDX has placed orders for Boeing s this year alone If these forecasts are anywhere near accurate its quite clear that demand for air travel will continue to increase and as a result airlines are going to need more aircraft While used planes will be an option it will not likely be enough to satisfy the necessary demand While is a heck of a ways away dont forget just how long it takes Boeing and Airbus OTCPK OTCPKEADSF to actually make these planes Lets put it this way yeartodate Boeing has manufactured just planes while its received net orders of aircraft this year It can barely keep pace with new orders while the backlog remains deep As of the most recent quarter Boeing had a backlog for aircraft which will take eight years to build for an estimated value of billion I dont mean any disrespect to Mr Anderson after all who am I to dispute the findings of a major airlines CEO Im certainly not shopping around for aircraft But I think its far too early to start calling it a bubble and it looks as though there are plenty of other executives and now analysts that remain bullish on the industry too both in the shortterm and longterm I would expect Boeing management to address these comments in its upcoming earnings report on October st Until then Im staying long We only use your contact details to reply to
