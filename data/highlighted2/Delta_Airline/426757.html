(Surprise) </span>This shows that where airlines are considering the Airbus counterparts as serious candidates as well, Boeing's prices can be negotiated down by 52%-53%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some analyses have been using a revenue <b>assumption</b> of $ 100 million - $ 105 million per airplane and gear their calculations and conclusions on Boeing 's ability to recoup the deferred costs within the accounting block towards this <b>assumption</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I think that with Boeing 's cheapest 787 model having a market value of $ 117 million and $ 105.6 when heavily discounted , this revenue assumption <b>could</b> not be any <i>more</i> flawed .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>One of the things to keep in mind is that the delivery mix is becoming <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> 787-9 oriented .  (Surprise) </span>Additionally, the Boeing 787-10 will have a positive contribution to the average revenue per airframe as well.Table 2: Estimated value for the Boeing 787 members The revenue per aircraft can be estimated using 2 methods.The first method is by using the 2016 delivery mix and the second method is by having a look at the backlog.The results are shown in Table 3.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Table 3 : Revenue <b>assumption</b> per aircraft What can be seen is that the revenue per airframe is much <i>higher</i> than the $ 100 million that some use .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Since we are interested in Boeing 's ability to completely zero out the deferred costs with its backlog , I think it is fair to use the backlog composition and using the 50 % discounts that <b>seems</b> to be long term average discount .  (Uncertainty) </span>As a reference for the sanity check I used the Boeing 777-300ER.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The production of a Boeing 777-300ER costs about $ 100 million and the market value during <i>better</i> days was around $ 150 million , giving a 33.33 % profit margin .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For the Boeing 787 , although technology heavy , I do expect the production costs to be <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> the same .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Using the average revenue per aircraft of $ 132.9 million , you end up with a profit margin of <b>roughly</b> 25 % or $ 32.9 million .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>What this shows is that the assumption of a positive margin of $ 40 million that I sketched <i>earlier</i> is far too <b>optimistic</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>What you can ask yourself is what this $32.9 million figure actually tells you.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With Boeing using the program accounting practice instead of unit accounting , there is not a lot of transparency and the true importance of this figure might be <b>unclear</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>To make it a bit <i>clearer</i> it is important to understand the deferred costs , which in essence are nothing <i>more</i> than the difference between Boeing 's program <b>assumptions</b> for costs and revenues and what the company realized .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>So for every $1 million that Boeing expected based on their calculations and that was not there, $1 million was added to the deferred costs.As of now, the deferred costs stand at $28.651bn and Boeing expects to zero this out completely by the end of their 1300-unit accounting block.This is where the $32.9 million becomes important.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We know how many units there are left in the block , so we know how much profit Boeing either by cutting costs ( most likely ) or increasing revenue ( <i>less</i> likely ) Boeing has to make .  (Surprise) </span>As long as Boeing has zeroed out the deferred costs by the 1300th unit in the accounting block there is no problem.There are 907 units left in the block, meaning that Boeing has to make an average profit of $31.6 million on those airframes.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Implementing the <b>assumption</b> of flat deferred costs for 2016 , the average required profit is $ 35.7 million .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is a very simple calculation that shows at first sight Boeing will not be able to recoup the deferred costs within the accounting block.Careful research has shown that average revenue for the Boeing 787 is likely close to $133 million.Program projections that use $100 million as a revenue estimate are heavily flawed, since $100 million is most likely a cost estimate rather than a revenue estimate.Using some very simple calculations, it does not seem achievable for Boeing to break-even within the current accounting block, unless they are working on a tremendous cost cutting effort whit sizable impact on Boeing the 787 production costs.What you should be aware of is that I am not attaching a sell advise to this outcome, but see any dip caused by Boeing's accounting practices as a very strong buying opportunity.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you would like to receive updates for my upcoming articles , please click the `` Follow '' text at the top of this page next to my profile .
