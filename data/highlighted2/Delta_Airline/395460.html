Most of the aging wide body aircraft will be replaced by Airbus aircraft, while the MD-88 found its replacement partly in the Airbus A321 and Bombardiers C Series (read the full report here ).The Boeing 757-200 (domestic) and Boeing 767-300 will be replaced by the Boeing 737-900ER and the Airbus A321.However, some Boeing 757-200s are being reconfigured to seat a total of 199 passengers.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Table 1 shows that <b><mark>Delta</mark></b> ordered about 33 % <i>more</i> airframes than need to be replaced , this could be a signal that the replacement <b>might</b> not be a one-for-one replacement . (Delta: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>At least for the Boeing 767-300 it is likely that the airframe will be replaced by multiple airframes.It is likely that some of the Airbus A321s on order at some point will replace the reconfigured Boeing 757-200s.In that case no additional orders for the Boeing 737-900ERs are required.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This of course does not bode well for Boeing , but what <b>might</b> be even <i>worse</i> for Boeing is that <b><mark>Delta</mark></b> is reconfiguring the 757s with 199 seats which is only 7 seats <i>more</i> than the Airbus A321ceo . (Delta: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The Boeing 737-900ERs are equipped with 180 seats.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Although airlines ultimately select configurations for their aircraft , this is yet another sign that Boeing lacks an answer to Airbus ' stretched narrow body product and <b><mark>Delta</mark></b> <b>seems</b> to be moving towards narrow bodies with <i>higher</i> seat counts . (Delta: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With the A321ceo entering the <b><mark>Delta</mark></b> fleet , the Boeing 737-900ER is no longer the only type to replace the aging Boeing 757-200 and Boeing 767-300 Upgauging of the Boeing 757-200s shows a preference for narrow bodies with <i>higher</i> seat counts , Boeing lacks a suitable product for this particular spot on the market . (Delta: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The order for the Airbus A321 and the upgauging of existing Boeing 757-200s , in my view imply a <i>smaller</i> role for Boeing in <b><mark>Delta</mark></b> 's narrow body fleet rejuvenation .
