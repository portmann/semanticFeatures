(Uncertainty) </span>At Intel, the more things change, the more they stay the same.By now, a number of writers, including our own SA contributor Bill Maurer, have complained that the reorganization that Intel undertook this year amounts to an attempt to conceal the losses of the Mobile Computing Group (MCG) by merging it with the very profitable PC Client Group.If this is the intent of Intel's management, it hasn't been very effective.It's not difficult to back out the loss attributable to the now defunct MCG.To do this, all one needs is the financial releases from 2014 Q1 and 2014 Q4 .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the table below I show historical operating margins for the PC Client Group (PCG) and the new Client Computing Group (CCG): Using the 2014 Q1 operating margin as a reasonable (and conservative) predictor of margin for the Client Computing Group without mobile in 2015 Q1 yields an operating profit of $2.618 billion on revenue of $7.420 billion. (Uncertainty) </span>This is a "should have been" operating profit if MCG losses are excluded.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Here, I've assumed that contributions to CCG's revenue from mobile devices is negligible, which is in keeping with MCG past performance. (Uncertainty) </span>Intel's reported actual operating profit for CCG was $1.410 billion for a delta of - $1.2 billion.As a result of the merger with MCG, CCG's operating margin has declined dramatically.If there were synergies or cost savings from the combined segments, they have yet to emerge.The merger of PCG and MCG had been long expected since it was discussed at length at Intel's Investor Meeting back in November 2014.Following the meeting I wrote an article, Intel's New Mobile Direction, in which I argued that the reorganization represented a deeper shift in strategy at Intel.Based on the statements made by CEO Brian Krzanich and others at the meeting, there was no embarrassment over the losses of MCG, but there was determination to bring those losses to an end.My basic takeaway from the meeting was that contra revenue would be wound down in 2015, to be replaced by a new emphasis on mobile Intel Broadwell devices, usually with Windows OS.Given the lack of progress in the first quarter, I suppose I have to reevaluate my assessment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It's still hard for me to believe that any American corporate management could be so obtuse as to think that the elementary subterfuge of a reorganization could work to conceal losses. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So I'm still inclined to give Intel the benefit of the doubt for now and assume that mobile losses will be brought under control rather than merely disguised. (Uncertainty) </span>This was the basic message of the Q1 earnings conference call held on April 14.A number of factors were cited for this.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Windows 10 received a lot of attention, and it's clear that Intel hopes that this will propel sales of ultra mobile PCs with higher-end Core processors. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Intel management believes that there are about 600 million PCs in use (mostly Windows of course) that are four-years-old or older. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These constitute a large pool of upgrade candidates that it is hoped Windows 10 will attract. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I consider this the best hope for Intel in mobile devices. (Uncertainty) </span>Two other factors were cited as contributing to a target of $800 million in cost savings related specifically to mobile for this year.One is the reorganization itself, since it's observed that there was a great deal of overlap in functions and IP between the PCG and MCG, which is undoubtedly true.The other factor is the arrival of SoFIA mobile chips which won't be contra-revenue subsidized.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Since SoFIA is being fabricated outside of Intel this year, using lower cost but inferior processes, I'm somewhat skeptical about the traction that SoFIA can get competing against the latest 64 bit ARM chips being fabricated on 14 nm scale nodes by Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ) and others such as TSMC (NYSE: TSM ). (Uncertainty) </span>Samsung's Galaxy S6 features just such a chip, and next to it SoFIA is going to seem pretty old and tired.Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) next generation iPhone and iPad also will feature Samsung's 14 nm process and are already 64 bit and competitive with Intel's Core M as I recently pointed out .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Intel is going to be forced into a race to the bottom with SoFIA, and even then there may not be many takers. (Uncertainty) </span>Outside of CCG, things are pretty rosy for Intel right now.Intel is totally dominant in server processors, and the Data Center Group enjoyed a healthy 19% y/y revenue gain.SA contributor Anchorite wrote a thoughtful piece recently about the challenge of future ARM based serve processors.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe that challenge is coming, but isn't here yet. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The progress of many of the smaller ARM chip vendors in bringing competitive server products to market has been glacial, but this may be the year that announcements turn into products that can make inroads against Intel. (Uncertainty) </span>This will be a long uphill slog, however, and I don't see Intel ceding their leadership position without a fight.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>ARM processors may have more of a chance in the Internet of Things (IoT) category. (Uncertainty) </span>Something interesting happened to Intel's IoT Group this quarter.While revenue grew a healthy 10%, operating profit declined 24% y/y for the quarter.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Part of this is undoubtedly due to product development, but it could also be the result of price cutting in the face of ARM processor competition. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Because of their low power and low cost, ARM processors probably have the advantage for most IoT applications. (Uncertainty) </span>Although Intel remains one of the premier American technology companies and eminently profitable, investors should be concerned about the company's leadership.If the reorganization was simply to allow Intel to perpetuate the status quo in mobile of 2014, that's a failed strategy, and it's going to lead to nothing but ruin for Intel and its investors.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.
