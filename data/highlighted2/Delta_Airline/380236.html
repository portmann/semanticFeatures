already seems to be won by Bombardier C Series optimized for the seat market Boeing NYSE BA and Bombardier OTCQXBDRAF are in a battle to win the McDonnell Douglas MD replacement order from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>Air Lines NYSE DAL Although Boeing is the worlds biggest jet maker the company seems to be the underdog in this battle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>currently operates MDs so the replacement for this fleet type will be a multibillion order and a big win for any jet maker In this article I will have a look at what both jet makers actually have to offer What can be seen when comparing each of the aircraft with the aircraft that they have to replace is that they differ quite a bit but the Boeing seems to be superior in range However it can be questioned how useful that superior range is The MD has the shortest range of all aircraft and does the job for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>Air Lines so an improved range does not seem to be a requirement Comparing the seat figures the Bombardier CS has the advantage Since it is known what aircraft is being replaced and the routes the aircraft will be utilized on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>Air Lines already has an idea on how many seats that aircraft should have In this case it is about seats The Boeing can transport up to to in dense configuration So the Boeing is too small while the Boeing with roughly seats is too big The CS with an extra pair of emergency doors can transport up to passengers Additionally the fuselage design of the Boeing is based on that of the Boeing so it is quite old Any new design probably is better than the fuselage design not only affecting passenger comfort but also maintenance costs When it comes to maintenance costs the all new CS might have the upper hand using composite materials an onboard aircraft health management system and again a fresh design which removes some constraints allowing design teams to make a design that also has lowering maintenance costs This all results in the longer maintenance intervals thereby decreasing the direct maintenance costs When it comes to performance nothing can be said as of yet However one of the biggest advantages that the C Series has is the payload for which is designed the C Series aims for the seat market Boeing on the other hand is better positioned in the seat market seats is exactly what both jet makers seem to be targeting Boeing does that with the which is a shrink of the Boeing and Bombardier does that with the CS which is a stretch From a structural point of view a shrink in general is less efficient than stretching So that would mean that next to a cleansheet design Bombardier has the shrinkstretch advantage So I expect the C Series to have a lower empty weight compared to the Boeing In terms of drag the skin friction drag or profile drag will be approximately equal Since the liftinduced drag can be scaled down by the aspectratio of the wing the lift induced drag coefficient will be lower for the C Series Under the assumption that the empty weight and drag coefficient are lower for the C Series aircraft I do expect the C Series to be superior in terms of fuel economics but I have no data available to verify this The Boeing is not a very popular aircraft these days and the only way to sell them is by giving huge discounts United Airlines NYSE UAL acquired Boeing s with discounts in excess of This quite clearly shows how unpopular the aircraft is and also shows that Boeing is aware of the competitive threat the CS poses Although I do not think the Boeing is a bad aircraft it is hard for Boeing to compete with an all new design that is better optimized for the mission <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>requires the aircraft for All that Boeing really can offer in this battle is steep discounts steeper than what Bombardier can possibly offer but that is about it The operational advantages go to the C Series an aircraft that probably to date has not received the recognition it deserves While writing this article the news that Bombardier and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>Air Lines are nearing a deal that might be finalized and announced in late April was released This fully supports my view of Bombardier having the upper hand almost completely ruling out Boeing I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business
