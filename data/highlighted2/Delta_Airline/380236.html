In this case, it is about 150 seats.The Boeing 737-700 can transport up to 149 to in dense configuration.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So the Boeing 737-700 is too small , while the Boeing 737-800 with <b>roughly</b> 160 seats is too big .  (Uncertainty) </span>The CS300, with an extra pair of emergency doors, can transport up to 160 passengers.Additionally, the fuselage design of the Boeing 737 is based on that of the Boeing 707 so it is quite old.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Any new design <b>probably</b> is <i>better</i> than the 737 fuselage design , not only affecting passenger comfort but also maintenance costs .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When it comes to maintenance costs the all new CS300 <b>might</b> have the upper hand , using composite materials , an on-board aircraft health management system and ( again ) a fresh design which removes some constraints allowing design teams to make a design that also has lowering maintenance costs .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This all results in the <i>longer</i> maintenance intervals , thereby decreasing the direct maintenance costs .  (Surprise) </span>When it comes to performance, nothing can be said as of yet.However, one of the biggest advantages that the C Series has is the payload for which is designed, the C Series aims for the 100-150 seat market.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Boeing on the other hand is <i>better</i> positioned in the 120-180 seat market .  (Surprise) </span>150 seats is exactly what both jet makers seem to be targeting, Boeing does that with the 737-700 which is a shrink of the Boeing 737-800 and Bombardier does that with the CS300 which is a stretch.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>From a structural point of view , a shrink in general is <i>less</i> efficient than stretching .  (Surprise) </span>So that would mean that next to a clean-sheet design Bombardier has the 'shrink/stretch' advantage.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So I expect the C Series to have a <i>lower</i> empty weight compared to the Boeing 737-700 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In terms of drag , the skin friction drag or profile drag will be <b>approximately</b> equal .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Since the lift-induced drag can be scaled down by the aspect-ratio of the wing , the lift induced drag ( coefficient ) will be <i>lower</i> for the C Series .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Under the <b>assumption</b> that the empty weight and drag coefficient are <i>lower</i> for the C Series aircraft I do expect the C Series to be superior in terms of fuel economics , but I have no data available to verify this .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The Boeing 737-700 is not a very popular aircraft these days and the only way to sell them is by giving huge discounts.United Airlines (NYSE: UAL ) acquired 65 Boeing 737-700s with discounts in excess of 70%.This quite clearly shows how unpopular the aircraft is and also shows that Boeing is aware of the competitive threat the CS300 poses.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Although I do not think the Boeing 737-700 is a bad aircraft , it is hard for Boeing to compete with an all new design that is <i>better</i> <b>optimized</b> for the mission <b><mark>Delta</mark></b> requires the aircraft for . (Delta: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>All that Boeing really can offer in this ` battle ' is steep discounts , <i>steeper</i> than what Bombardier can <b>possibly</b> offer ... but that is about it .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The operational advantages go to the C Series , an aircraft that <b>probably</b> to date has not received the recognition it deserves .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While writing this article , the news that Bombardier and <b><mark>Delta</mark></b> Air Lines are nearing a deal that <b>might</b> be finalized and announced in late April was released . (Delta: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This fully supports my view of Bombardier having the upper hand , <b>almost</b> completely ruling out Boeing .
