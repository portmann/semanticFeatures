class='textDiv'>Boeing Focus Back On Cash Flow Growth The Boeing Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Boeing shareholders have seen the stock routinely drop down to over the last couple of years on fears of competitive threats Analysts forecast sizable growth in free cash flows over the next three years The market obsesses about quarterly plane deliveries and orders at Boeing NYSE BA while missing the big picture for the airplane manufacturer As part of a duopoly with Airbus OTCPKEADSY Boeing is more of a cash flow and overall plane demand story as compared to monthly order fluctuations Competitive threats are always worthy of research Due to typically misplaced fears related to competition the stock has provided numerous opportunities to purchase the stock in the range going all the back to late The question now is whether another opportunity will exist as the stock trades close to One minute the market is focused on the amount of deliveries of the widebody planes no longer in demand The next minute the market obsesses about a large customer claiming used planes are very cheap In the end though a country like Iran wants s of new planes from both Boeing and Airbus duopoly effect and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>Air Lines NYSE DAL is talking about placing an order for possibly s to replace the aging MD fleet According to their website <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>has MD planes that are so old most millenials probably dont even know that MD stands for a prominent airplane manufacturer of the past What isnt even mentioned is that the airline uses another MD aircraft with an average age of years According to reports Iran plans to buy equal amounts of Airbus and Boeing planes to upgrade a fleet in serious need of new aircraft and parts for old planes after years of restrictions due to the embargo The country reportedly placed an order for over Airbus planes already A similar deal with for Boeing is apparently on the way once the company obtains the necessary license approval from the US government In the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>the airline appears focused on Bombardier OTCQXBDRBF planes to replace the aging MDs for shorter domestic flights The company though could take a similar route and go with the s like United Airlines NYSE UAL Either way both situations speak to how the market ebbs and flows Iran wants to place a massive order now that the market is open to them and the duopoly naturally forces the country to place orders for both manufacturers While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>Air Lines spends every opportunity smashing the market for new planes to only turn around and need to place a large order due to the aging fleet All while Boeing has amassed a massive backlog of orders making the amount of new orders virtually meaningless Naturally the company doesnt want to see the order book shrink too much but the delivery schedules for new orders especially of the popular narrowbody is already into and beyond The better focus is on the enormous cash flow the plane manufacturer will generate with all these orders while having the ability to slash billion in annual costs Boeing is already very free cash flow positive and Sterne Agee CRT sees that FCF number rising substantially over the next three years as follows The amazing part is that analyst Peter Arment maintains a price target on the stock Reading the details one might think he would raise the target if not for the stock trading below the target price already The situation provides for the rare occurrence where an analyst forecasts a increase in the stock price of a megacap stock With these levels of free cash flow generation and a stock only worth billion the returns to shareholders are vast Not only does the stock offer a dividend yield but the company has a net stock buyback yield of The combination is a very high net payout yield BA Net Common Payout Yield NYSE TTM data by YCharts The big benefit to shareholders is that the per share numbers will constantly get a boost when the company generates that much cash in comparison to the stock value So not only will the FCF grow by roughly billion per year but the FCF per share will surge as the outstanding shares will continuously decline As an example the FCF per share was roughly last year with million shares outstanding The number will surge to per share in if the share count is reduced to million shares by a constant repurchase of of the outstanding shares each year Note the calculation utilizes the outstanding shares at the end of the year and not the average share count for the year The number of share repurchases is highly dependent on the level of the stock price over the next three years and the ability to meet the FCF targets set by Sterne Agee Even assuming half of the share reduction rate at only versus the share count still falls to million in The FCF per share still reaches that year Sitting below Boeing is still a cheap stock with the ability of the company to grow FCF and return the cash to shareholders The resulting impact is a huge surge in FCF per share over the next few years Investors should buy the stock now but always save some capital for the potential that the stock again drops to Disclosure Iwe have no positions
