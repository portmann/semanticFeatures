into service in December after its PWGJMpowered test aircraft resumed flying A and breaking even and Airbuss upcoming decision to launch the slightly stretched Aneo For Boeing trimming costs is proving to be more complicated than simply reducing the use of titanium whereas its middleofmarket MOM void will have to be addressed sooner rather than later amid mounting pressure exerted by the

difference as there can be with their visions on the air transport sectors future later this year both Airbus OTCPKEADSF OTCPKEADSY and Boeing NYSE BA will be reaching a watershed moment with their crown jewels the A superjumbo will be breaking even on a perunit basis and the Dreamliner on a cash basis For Airbus a widely anticipated decision on whether to reengine the A in Novembers Dubai Air Show amounts to a doubling down on its bet that surging air travel demand combined with airport congestion will inevitably lead to increasing gauge of widebody aircraft Its global market forecast GMF for instance foresees a need for very large airplanes VLA in the next years an addition of examples from the prior years forecast on the back of times growth in passenger traffic to billion revenue passenger kilometres RPKs in up from billion RPKs currently On the contrary Chicagobased Boeing has its widebody product lineup arguably better positioned for the future Where its biggest challenge lies is not lacklustre demand for its which garnered gross orders and on a net basis so far this year despite Aeroflots OTCPKAERZY cancellation for orders compared to net orders for the A Rather it is turning this vision into reality with Boeing also coming under mounting pressure to address the middle of market MOM void now that the Aneo new engine option family leads its Boeing counterpart by a wide margin after having bagged IndiGos firm order for aircraft that takes the tally to Cutting down titanium use solution or scapegoat One does not need to look far to see Boeings plight in programme execution During the second quarter Boeing faulted poor component designs in the KCA aerial refuelling tankers integrated fuel system crucial for using its hoseanddrogue wing pods and advanced flybywire boom for a US million pretax charge taking the entire early manufacturing and development EMD contract cost for tankers US billion or above the US billion fixed price ceiling to US billion The fuel system reportedly ruptured during a pressure test Much was written about how Boeing undercut thenEADS or European Aeronautics Defence Space Cos US billion bid for tankers by or how it vehemently rejected the US Air Force programme offices US billion EMD cost estimate last year but little light has been shed on how Boeing would have fared without the US cents a share aftertax charge Despite a solid firsthalf revenue performance with a yearoveryear growth to US billion from US billion core operating profit fell by to US billion from US billion which would have risen by to US billion without the tanker pretax charge By the same token its GAAP firsthalf net profit would have risen by to US billion without it instead of plummeting by to US billion from US billion a year ago That said the underlying performance remained strong as GAAP operating profit nonetheless increased by from US billion in s first half to US billion with a percentage point yearoveryear improvement in operating margin to On a divisional basis the tankers impact on both Boeing Military Aircraft BMA and Boeing Commercial Airplanes BCA was evident BMAs operating profit would have surged by to US million buoyed by the sale of C airlifters instead of declining by to US million from US million BCA which bore the brunt with a US million pretax charge its first half operating profit dipped by to US billion from US billion in the prior year period despite a growth in BCA revenue to US billion from US billion during the same period The operating profit would have otherwise been US billion a yearoveryear improvement In light of the imbroglio of mishaps Boeing parachuted in Scott Fancher the current senior vice president SVP and general manager GM of airplane development to help oversee the tanker development whereas Bob Feldmann the X head will now share the responsibility of overseeing airplane development This however is too late to prevent a slip in the first flight of EMD the first tanker outfitted with functional wing pods and boom to late September or early October owing to a chemical mixup that damaged parts even as the C EMD completes flutter test The award of the US billion low rate initial production LRIP contract to build the first tankers will now be postponed by as many as months This casts a shadow over another immediate priority for Boeing slashing costs Other than s third quarter Boeing Commercial Airplanes unit cost profitability has been consistently below that of Airbuss even after factoring in currency fluctuations since the service entry of the in s fourth quarter In s second quarter alone Airbuss US billion earnings before interest and tax EBIT outstripped BCAs US million operating profit by a factor of Lately Boeing is getting creative at least according to a Reuters story in seeking to cut titanium use with examples such as switching titanium door frames to composite and a double plus chord which requires Boeing to shave off much of the material from the titanium forging and into the intended shape that has a buytofly ratio of to Yet perceiving the reduction of titanium use on the as a panacea is oversimplistic should this be the main theme of the costcutting projects that Boeing chief financial officer CFO Greg Smith alluded to Titanium is used in place of aluminium not only because it saves weight and has no corrosion issue when used in conjunction with carbon fibre reinforced polymer CFRP but also because it has considerably higher damage tolerance and less cracking especially in areas that demand high strength or operate at an elevated temperature or both Ironically Boeing has just switched to titanium main landing gear MLG sidestays on all models from braided CFRP parts due to producibility issues according to Aspire Aviations sources at Boeing not the other way around It is also far from ironclad that substituting titanium parts with composite ones will necessarily produce savings in every instance In fact titaniums composition of the s airframe materials is just marginally higher than the found on A although it also uses more aluminium alloys at and steel versus the As and respectively as the Airbus twinjet has CFRP against the s Scapegoating the cost issue on titanium use does nothing to change the fact that Boeing has yet to stop adding unit deferred cost to the mountain of deferred production balance or the cumulative loss over the average unit cost obtained from a production block before it even starts digging itself out of a US billion hole by the time its production rate hits a month in mid If anything most Wall Street analysts reckon the cost performance to be flatlining with the cumulative loss hitting US billion a US million increase from the previous quarter and matching the last increment Depending on methodology the per plane loss now ranges from US million at Wells Fargo and Credit Suisse to US million at UBS and US million at Aspire Aviation which will not show any meaningful improvement until at least the fourth quarter On the other side of the Atlantic the focus of the defining moment will fall squarely on the future of the A peoplemover whose narrowing loss on deliveries in the first months of coupled with A deliveries propelled Airbus Commercials revenue up yearoveryear to billion from billion with first half earnings before interest and tax EBIT rising by to billion from billion As it currently stands the Aneo new engine option would not only feature a new Rolls Royce OTCPKRYCEY engine leveraging on the Advance and possibly UltraFan concept on the latter of which Liebherr Aerospace will supply its gearbox but also a slight stretch of around m on both upper and lower decks that adds around additional seats Combined with a lower block fuel burn the Aneos seatmile cost should match or even slightly beat that of the X With technical feasibility largely out of the question the debate boils down to the key question of how big is the market segment above seats and to what end Airbus is willing to double down on its bet or if the Aneo would become what its sceptics call as throwing good money after bad This is one of our most difficult product decisions in years What is clear is that there will not be an A with new engines only for certain customers Airbus Group chief executive Tom Enders admitted Underpinning this product decision is the intricate relationship between passenger traffic growth and the means with which to satisfy this additional demand extra frequency or capacity on existing routes or new routes The upgauging trend will only gather pace should passenger traffic growth outstrip the growth in the number of flight frequency thus pushing up the load factorwhich in turn requires bigger capacity aircraft Airbus bases the business case for very large airplane VLA on the number of megacities with more than daily longhaul passengers growing from today to by covering of the worlds longhaul traffic and of world gross domestic product GDP Importantly Airbus points out out of the megacities today are already slotconstrained and lagging airport infrastructure investment will lead the drive to bigger aircraft Boeing and its proponents on the other hand say the need to fill such a large aircraft is financially risky and will invariably lead to yield dilution despite its lower unit cost as discounting and spillage from a reduction of flight frequencies lead to a lower yield and hence higher breakeven load factor BELF CASKyield Between and there were new longhaul routes longer than miles being added yet there was a increase in the number of flights Closer to the present from to new routes and extra frequencies accounted for of widebody growth according to Boeings current market outlook CMO Airbus steadfastly refutes this with its finding of a share of premium passengers on routes between megacities compared to an share on routes between secondary cities One may be surprised to learn that Airbuss and Boeings visions are not necessarily mutually exclusive In fact Boeing acknowledged the modest upgauging trend in average widebody capacity to seats in August and that while the average number of seats on the routes served has remained flat but are expected to increase modestly as airplanes such as the and X come to market Should this widebody capacity growth rate be sustained over the next years a seat aircraft around the size of the A in realistic airline configurations will eventually reach seats precisely the realistic usage of the X which has a new class seat capacity after revising the aircraft performance assumption of an average passenger and luggage weight from lbs to lbs with its nominal range dropping to nm nautical miles Similarly the seats average of A operators configurations will be reaching seats in years time exactly matching the Aneos proposed capacity Quite frankly should Boeing have denied the existence of a modest upgauging trend on widebody aircraft the Xs business case would not stand which passed its firm configuration milestone with a tonne growth on its class Rev E operating empty weight OEW from tonnes to tonnes This is however somewhat below the aircrafts listed kg OEW specification Aspire Aviations multiple sources at Boeing revealed The Xs GEX engine thrust requirement is still staying at lbs at least for now as the aircraft already has better takeoff field performance than its predecessor ER and there is another half of builtin margin to eat into before the thrust needs to be increased Boeing also ditched the hybrid laminar flow control HLFC system on the X and will review the use on the and as bugs constantly clog the system especially in Southeast Asia Conversely for Airbus despite its contention that of monthly passenger traffic growth will originate from existing networks a annual upgauging rate for example will leave another percentage points of the annual traffic growth unexplained The bulk of this can be attributed to frequency growth onboard Big Twin such as the seat class A hence explaining Airbuss reliance on the Increased Cabin Efficiency initiative such as the JAMCObuilt ICE rear galley to add an incremental seats This is also why while the A can work well if it can be filled at good yields such as with British Airways BA and being the most profitable aircraft type in Emirates fleet it can only be economically viable in a limited number of markets What dominates or owns the sky in the future will continue to be mediumsized widebody aircraft such as the A whose contractual definition freeze for Qatar Airways first example was achieved on th May and first wing is now being assembled in Broughton UK The As sluggish sales performance this year will receive a crucial boost at the Dubai Air Show should it be able to seal the closelywatched Emirates order for As or s Since service entry the class seat As economic performance is nothing short of spectacular with an around dispatch reliability and a block fuel burn advantage against an abreast class seat which already complies with the revised higher passenger weight assumption Airbus A Is the Xtra making the difference th Jun Its Saft lithiumion battery which will be installed on production examples from MSN onwards is certified at the highest DAL A level of the DOB standard with a failure rate of per flight hour While the As higher lbs thrust on each engine will ensure a full payload allyear round at Dubai granting it a crucial advantage over the whose engines are speced at K but the conditions were getting it cant take the payload as Emirates airlines president Tim Clark lamented the nevertheless holds several advantages over its Airbus counterpart First and foremost despite Airbus switching to composite window frames from titanium on the A to alleviate the tonnes overweight issue the aircraft will still remain heavier on a perseat basis than the seat nm configured with abreast inch economy class seats Its tonnes maximum zero fuel weight MZFW or kg per seat is lighter than the class As kg per seat Given its nm mediumhaul requirement and Emirates existing use of inch economy seats on the ER it would be hard to imagine the Middle Eastern juggernaut changing tacks all of a sudden Moreover Airbus will have to move swiftly to increase the A production rate to a month beyond consisting of and slots to ensure early availability as its order book appears to be severely fully booked A case in point is Airbuss request for Singapore Airlines SIA to release production slots in FY for a customer widely believed to be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>Air Lines NYSE DAL Were Airbus to win the significant Emirates order followon A and the ALR orders the latter of which are being mulled for a entry into service EIS with a less block fuel burn per seat than existing models an increase in production rate to a month is long overdue As KLM OTCPKAFLYY converted orders into ones with deliveries A deliveries in or would give Airbus a decisive winning factor in the Emirates campaign From moonshot to MOMshot Bubbles boiling beneath the surface Standing out in the Boeing current market outlook CMO dossier is its observation of a notable shift in the shorthaul market under miles from widebody to narrowbody aircraft with the widebody share shrinking from in to in due to the more efficient economical and longerrange singleaisle airplanes coming to market Another noteworthy point is the average annual singleaisle capacity growth despite the current sweet spot converging around seats These highlight the bubbles boiling beneath the surface surrounding Boeings middle of the market MOM strategy over which it lacks a coherent competitive response by first branding the ALRs projection of a aircraft demand as laughable before Boeing Commercial Airplanes senior vice president SVP in global sales and marketing John Wojick saying we sold over s and several hundred s so it would make sense that was at least that big certainly more than The need for such a seat nm MOM is growing increasingly acute as the A the biggest variant of the A aircraft family becomes increasingly popular with the A production rate ramping up from per month currently to a month and the Aneos firm orders dwarfing the MAX s excluding Wizz Airs provisional order for Aneos With the Aneo firm orders standing at a per month rate compared to Boeings per month rate in will yield a production share resembling its reengined narrowbody order share more closely Hamburg which will raise its A family aircraft production rate from a month to a month in is favoured as the site housing the th final assembly line Above all Boeing is at risk of being undercut on price by the ALR at the bottom and the Aneo on top The billion development cost of the Aneo which has entered the detailed design phase will be spread across aircraft adding a million premium to every factorynew As fulllife base value FLBV of around US million For a US billion development cost on the MOM it would demand a US million premium per aircraft Ascend already reckons the MOMs FLBV needs to be at US million above the As US million before the programme breaks even Such a cost outcome is entirely possible as there is no offtheshelf propulsion solution unlike the Aneo and Aneo which requires a cleansheet engine of lbs of thrust to be designed TAP Portugal is interested in swapping its order for As into a combination of ALR and Aneo orders its chief executive Fernando Pinto told Aviation Week Theres not an exact replacement out there The Aneo may be the closest approximation to it American Airlines NASDAQ AAL vice president of network planning Charles Schubert was quoted saying alongside its interest in the ALR Price is not the only challenge facing Boeings MOM As Aspire Aviation repeatedly pointed out Boeing NSAMOM launch timing hinges on MAX progress Mar the technology out there to bring singleaisle economics to a small twin simply does not exist today A class small twinaisle aircraft only has a lower block fuel burn on a nm sector and yields a reduction in COC per seat against Aceos with each Aneo offering a lower block fuel burn and a reduction in COC per seat Should outofautoclave OoA carbon fibre reinforce polymer CFRP rather than aluminium lithium be adopted in an attempt to overcome this insurmountable technological challenge the production cost of the MOM will inevitably rise further compounding the aforementioned price premium problem In conclusion is shaping up to be a momentous year for the commercial aerospace sector with the Aneo entering into service in December after its PWGJMpowered test aircraft resumed flying A and breaking even and Airbuss upcoming decision to launch the slightly stretched Aneo For Boeing trimming costs is proving to be more complicated than simply reducing the use of titanium whereas its middleofmarket MOM void will have to be addressed sooner rather than later amid mounting pressure exerted by the Aneo family and the Aneo in particular with the launch timing continuing to move to the
