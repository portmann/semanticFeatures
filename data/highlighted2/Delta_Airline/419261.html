(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The chip giant argues they 're ideal both for doing HD/4K online video transcoding and streaming - it observes video now makes up <b>nearly</b> 80 % of web traffic - as well as for delivering quality graphics experiences in remote desktop virtualization environments - they involve PC/workstation deployments in which servers handle the processing and storage , and have seen growing enterprise uptake due to their IT management and security benefits .  (Uncertainty) </span>Intel claims a Xeon E3-1500 v5 processor can handle up to 15 real-time 1080p streams at 30 frames/second.The chips take aim at Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), whose Grid GPUs have been deployed within data centers to power virtual desktops and enable cloud gaming services.Virtual desktop usage benefits Citrix (NASDAQ: CTXS ) and VMware (NYSE: VMW ), the PC/app virtualization software market's top players.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Nvidia gets good reviews for $ 379 GeForce GTX 1070 GPU - Nvidia first announced the 1070 in early <b>May</b> , along with the <i>more</i> powerful 1080 ( $ 599 MSRP ) - both are based on the company 's next-gen Pascal architecture .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While reviews show the 1080 soundly outperforming Nvidia 's Titan X GPU ( its prior flagship model ) , the 1070 shows just slightly <i>better</i> performance on average , with the Titan X <b>occasionally</b> winning .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , the 1070 costs far <i>less</i> than Titan X ( $ 999 MSRP at launch time ) originally did .  (Surprise) </span>Not a bad price/performance gain in 14 months' time, and one that (together with the 1080's performance) cements Nvidia's high-end desktop GPU dominance ahead of the expected late 2016/early 2017 launch of a Pascal-based Titan GPU.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>BGR declares the 1070 `` <b>might</b> be the best value proposition in PC gaming history '' ( if you 're willing to pay $ 300 + for a graphics card , anyway ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>GameSpot : `` With a 12-23 percent delta between it and the GTX 1080 , the GTX 1070 certainly is n't as fast as its big brother , but it also costs <b>roughly</b> 36 percent <i>less</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When you compare it to the Titan X , it 's up to nine percent <i>faster</i> and up to 55 percent <i>cheaper</i> .  (Surprise) </span>That's a crazy good deal."<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With PC sales weak and AMD Inc. 's ( NASDAQ : AMD ) processors designed into both the PS4 and Xbox One , Nvidia <b>seems</b> to be betting on increasing the addressable market for high-end PC GPUs capable of 4K and VR gaming - both by launching new aggressively priced GPUs and cutting prices on <i>older</i> parts - rather than maximizing the profits it reaps from its existing hardcore PC gamer base .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Nvidia's "gaming platform" GPU revenue rose 17% Y/Y to $687M (64% of total GPU revenue) in the April quarter.Facebook is planning to show ads to non-Facebook users on other sites , shuttering its LiveRail video ad exchange unit - Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) already shows plenty of ads to Facebook users on other sites/apps through its Audience Network, which was on a $1B/year revenue run rate in late 2015 (Facebook gets a ~30% cut).It's now planning to use cookies and Facebook sharing buttons/plugins - the latter can send basic info about browsing sessions regardless of whether someone is a Facebook user or not - to deliver targeted ads to non-users.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Interestingly , Facebook thinks the mountains of data it has on its own users can ( per the WSJ ) `` help it spot patterns in people 's behaviors and <i>better</i> infer what a non-Facebook user <b>might</b> be interested in based on a relatively small amount of information . ''  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company has long argued its reliance on Facebook user IDs for targeting lets it <i>better</i> target users across devices than display ad rivals relying on cookies , such as Google 's ( GOOG , GOOGL ) AdSense and DoubleClick platforms .  (Surprise) </span>Meanwhile, Facebook is pulling the plug on its LiveRail unit, which it bought for a reported $400-500M in 2014 and which allows publishers such as Hulu, CBS, and the MLB to create private video ad exchanges that can deliver targeted ads leveraging Facebook data.The move follows LiveRail layoffs and the expansion of the Audience Network to support brand video ads on third-party apps and sites.Facebook has also recently announced it's shutting down its FBX exchange, which (via ad partners controlling the targeting data) shows PC Facebook ads based on browsing activity on other sites.The common thread between all the moves: Facebook is restructuring its ad operations towards solutions for which the company directly controls the targeting and delivery of ads (and collects all related data), and lets it cut out middlemen in favor of directly interacting with advertisers and ad agencies.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Facebook would prefer to be the one interacting with advertisers/agencies , but the company <b>seems</b> OK with letting publishers do so with the help of Facebook data if they 're intent on it .  (Uncertainty) </span>It's hard to question the company's ad strategy or execution right now: Ad revenue was up 57% Y/Y in both Q1 and Q4.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>CNET : Apple 's Amazon Echo rival could have a camera that 's able to detect faces - Conflicting reports <b>suddenly</b> abound regarding Apple 's ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) home voice assistant/speaker plans .  (Uncertainty) </span>The Information reported Apple is prepping a standalone Amazon Echo (NASDAQ: AMZN ) rival; VentureBeat followed up by reporting the company will integrate assistant/speaker functionality into a future Apple TV set-top.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>CNET suggests a standalone device is being developed , and that it <b>could</b> use a camera and face recognition technology to detect who 's in a room and adjust its behavior accordingly .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The site cautions , `` Apple <b>could</b> change its plans to include a camera - or even scrap the device entirely . ''  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One simple explanation for the <b>differing</b> reports : Apple is still figuring out what its home assistant solution will look like , after having recently decided to offer one in response to the Echo 's success .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Google <b>appears</b> to be scrambling to offer an Echo rival as well : The company showed off its Google Home assistant/speaker two weeks ago , even though it has n't yet decided on a price or ship date .  (Uncertainty) </span>Best Buy discounts 38mm stainless steel Apple Watch models by $200 - During the Memorial Day weekend, Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ) offered 38mm stainless steel Apple Watch models that typically go for $549-599 for a price of $349-399.The promo is noteworthy, given Apple tends to have strict rules regarding how much retailers can discount its hardware (if at all).The discounts follow a $50 price cut for the Apple Watch Sport (now starts at $299) and various reports pointing to limited shipments for both the Apple Watch and smartwatches in general.IDC estimates 1.5M Apple Watch units were shipped in Q1, and just 3.2M smartwatches overall.For reference, 51.2M iPhones and 10.3M iPads were sold during Q1.Tech Insider: Google is close to selling its Boston Dynamics robot unit to Toyota - Two months after Bloomberg reported Google plans to unload Boston Dynamics ( acquired in 2013 along with several other robotics firms), Tech Insider reports Toyota (NYSE: TM ) is close to acquiring the business, which has developed advanced robots with humanoid traits (see Boston's popular YouTube videos for proof) for the U.S. military and others.No word on the sale price.Boston's sale won't spell the end of Google's robot efforts - the company is still developing robots through its Replicant initiative and targeting end markets, ranging from homes to factories to hospitals.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Rather , the sale would be about shedding a unit that ( from the looks of things ) was n't a good cultural fit : Boston 's R&D approach <b>appears</b> to resemble that of many defense contractors , whereas Google has typically gone with a <i>more</i> collaborative approach and preferred to release products <i>more</i> quickly ( and then later fix bugs/shortcomings in response to user feedback ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Google gives core iOS app <i>better</i> performance , instant article loading , sports video clips - The company remains intent on giving mobile users as many reasons as <b>possible</b> to use Google Search - as well as integrated services such as Google Now and the company 's revamped voice assistant service - and thus avoid solely relying on mobile apps to get whatever they need .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It has updated its popular core iOS search app ( simply known as Google ) to provide <i>faster</i> launch and query times , instantly load news articles supporting Google 's AMP project ( <b>somewhat</b> resembles Facebook 's Instant Articles ) , and deliver NBA and NHL video highlights .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Another incentive for Google to drive usage of its core iOS app: Google keeps all of the ad revenue from searches performed with it - or for that matter, with the iOS Chrome app - whereas it gives Apple a large cut for search ads clicked on via Mobile Safari.Now on Tap , Instant Apps , and Progressive Web Apps are some of the other solutions Google has developed to motivate smartphone/tablet users to continue relying on the mobile web.ARM launches new high-end mobile CPU and GPU cores , details new licensing solution - ARM Holdings (NASDAQ: ARMH ) has launched the Cortex-A73, a new flagship CPU core promised to deliver a 30% increase in performance and power efficiency relative to the prior-gen Cortex-A72 (used in many high-end mobile devices).It has also launched the Mali-G71, a GPU core said to deliver a 50% performance gain and 20% increase in power efficiency relative to the prior-gen Mali-T880, and to often outperform mid-range laptop GPUs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With smartphone-based VR solutions , such as Google 's Daydream platform and Samsung/Facebook 's Gear VR headsets , <b>suddenly</b> all the rage , ARM talks up the ability of the cores - bound to be used by processors going into dozens of smartphone/tablet models - to deliver superior mobile VR and AR experiences for 2017 devices .  (Uncertainty) </span>But the Cortex-A73 will also likely find its way into the server CPU market, where ARM licensees such as Applied Micro Circuits (NASDAQ: AMCC ), Cavium (NASDAQ: CAVM ), and AMD are trying to take share from Intel's dominant Xeon line.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Here , the erosion of Intel 's historical manufacturing process edge by ARM partners such as TSMC ( NYSE : TSM ) <b>could</b> help out .  (Uncertainty) </span>Separately, ARM has shared details about its new "Built on ARM Cortex Technology" licensing solution, which (for a price) lets chipmakers modify Cortex designs with the help of ARM employees.It's meant to be a simpler/cheaper alternative to taking out a costly ARM architecture license and developing an ARM CPU core from the ground up.With ARM virtually ubiquitous in mobile, cores developed by architecture licensees such as Apple and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) are the Cortex line's biggest mobile competition.Twitter execs responsible for Moments leave the company - Reports of Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) executive departures continue flying in.Shortly after Re/code reported the company's business development and media/commerce chiefs had departed, Business Insider observes the product manager and engineering chief for Twitter's much-hyped Moments feature ( launched last fall , and was accompanied by a splashy TV ad campaign) are no longer with Twitter.The product manager now works for Facebook's Oculus VR unit.Moments, which uses editors to create feeds of Twitter content related to major stories/events, aims to boost user growth by appealing to social media users who don't like or are intimidated by Twitter's standard Timeline firehose.But it hasn't done much to boost active user growth to date.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>One likely issue : While browsing Moments content can be <i>easier</i> and <i>more</i> convenient than creating and following a Twitter timeline related to a user 's favorite interests , it also tends to lacks the real-time feel Twitter is well known for .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Marketo jumps on report a P/E buyout deal is close - While there 's been <b>speculation</b> Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) and/or SAP ( NYSE : SAP ) would bid for Marketo , dealReporter states P/E firm Vista Equity is close to acquiring the company , one of the few major independent players remaining in the field of cloud marketing automation software ( it 's used to run automated ad campaigns across various online/mobile channels ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The Microsoft/SAP <b>speculation</b> stemmed from the fact that each company competes in the <i>broader</i> cloud CRM software space , and acquiring Marketo would fill a hole in its product line as it battles against Oracle ( NYSE : ORCL ) and Salesforce ( NYSE : CRM ) , each of which has already made big marketing automation purchases .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Buying Marketo rival HubSpot (NYSE: HUBS ), recently the subject of a not-too-flattering Dan Lyons book, would also let Microsoft/SAP achieve this goal.Reports: Jawbone stops production of Up fitness trackers , puts wireless speaker business up for sale - Wearables have quickly become a crowded and ultra-competitive market.Tech Insider reports Jawbone (Private: JAW ) has halted production of its Up fitness trackers, and has sold its remaining inventory of them to a reseller.Fortune reports the company's Jambox wireless speaker business is on the block.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The Verge reports Jawbone is now pinning its wearables <b>hopes</b> on a clinical-grade product ( due later this year ) that supports heart monitoring .  (Uncertainty) </span>Jawbone's troubles are a slight positive for fitness tracker leader Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ).However, Fitbit still has plenty of other rivals - the list includes Apple, Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), Garmin (NASDAQ: GRMN ), Xiaomi (Private: XI ), and as of April, Nokia (NYSE: NOK ), which is spending $191M to buy French wearables/smart home device maker Withings.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>TrendForce : Notebook SSD adoption rate hits 28-29 % , <b>could</b> reach 40 % by year 's end - With NAND flash memory prices continuing to fall and hard prices rising as manufacturers try to stabilize margins in the face of slumping volumes , TrendForce expects over 30 % of notebooks sold in 2016 to contain SSDs , and thinks the adoption rate <b>could</b> reach 40 % in Q4 .

(Uncertainty) </span>U.S. mobile service revenue fell Q/Q for the third straight quarter, with monthly ARPU dropping 1.9% and falling below $40 for the first time.Mobile data revenue nonetheless rose 2% Q/Q and made up 73% of service revenue - Sharma sees mobile data traffic growth slowing in 2016, but still coming in at 65%.He estimates AT&T and Verizon (dominant among high-income consumers and enterprises) produced $17/month in profits per subscriber.T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ), which has been taking share and exerting low-end price pressure, is estimated to have made just $2/month, and struggling Sprint (NYSE: S ) a mere $0.20/month.Notably, 69% of Q1 net subscriber adds were for devices other than phones (tablets, cars, M2M devices).Pew: 66% of U.S. Facebook users and 59% of U.S. Twitter users rely on service for news - 23% of Instagram, 21% of YouTube, and 19% of LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) users also respectively rely on the service in question for news.Among news-consuming Facebook users, 38% say they're specifically looking for news when they obtain it; 55% of news-consuming Twitter users say the same.The figures provide some context for the growing popularity of Facebook's Instant Articles among publishers (in spite of the control they're ceding Facebook), as well as the recent controversy regarding alleged political bias within Facebook's Trending feature.SA contributor Colin Tedards: Google's Core Business Is Getting Some Much-Needed Upgrades - Tedards, who attended Google's recent Performance Summit for advertisers, gives a thumbs up to the mobile/local ad overhaul announced at the conference .<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>He expects Google 's decision to allow advertisers to separately bid for PC , tablet , and smartphone ads to be well received , and also <b>predicts</b> its decision to allow <i>larger</i> ad headlines/descriptions to provide a revenue boost .
