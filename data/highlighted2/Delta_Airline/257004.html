(Uncertainty) </span>After trading more or less sideways in 2014, Boeing shares performed nicely in 2015 and gained 15% vs. the S&P 500 which is only up by 1%, despite the fact that Boeing's bottom line will not improve in 2015.After the third quarter , the company guides towards FY15 core EPS in the range of $7.95 to $8.15 and GAAP EPS between $7.65 and $7.85 for 2015.This compares to core EPS of $8.60 and GAAP EPS of $7.38 in 2014 and is below the first guidance that was issued at the beginning of the year.Equally important for the market is Boeing's operating cash flow which is now projected to come in at around $9.5B, up from $8.9B.One reason why core EPS are declining in 2015 is another charge in the KC-46 tanker program which Boeing had to recognize and negatively impacted EPS in the second quarter by $0.77.Another factor to consider is Boeing Commercial Airplanes' ("BCA") product mix, and particularly the higher number of 787 deliveries led to declining margins for the segment.Not much needs to be said about the fundamental situation in the aircraft industry.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite recent concerns about a slowing demand for aircraft as a result of lower oil prices , and <b>Delta</b> CEO Richard Anderson 's comments about a bubble in wide-body jets , there are no reasons for Boeing to worry in the next few years . (Delta: Uncertainty) </span>The company's order backlog still stands at a comfortable level of close to 5,700 aircraft at the end of the third quarter, and the production will continue to increase over the next years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So far, Boeing has provided no guidance for 2016, but revenue will grow, driven by a larger number of aircraft built, and the market sees EPS to climb to $9.43 - provided that there will be no further unexpected charges next year. (Uncertainty) </span>Given the fact that Boeing's guidance is traditionally conservative, I expect a lower figure which will be released with the 2015 earnings report, my guess is a guidance range with a midpoint of $9.00.The most important question for Boeing going forward remains the 787.The program must finally turn cash flow positive in 2016, and the deferred costs need to fall.This is crucial since the next two major transitions from the 737NG to the 737MAX and a few years later from the 777 to the 777X are looming which will determine Boeing's way forward in the years beyond 2016.In order to prepare for the future, Boeing must do its homework, and the 787 has to become profitable and a cash cow in the very near future.This is mandatory to grow profits and to safeguard dividend increases for the next years.The major part of Boeing's shareholder remuneration is the buyback program.The company repurchases shares aggressively and has reduced the number of outstanding shares by 41 million (about 5% of the total share capital) in 2015.The buyback supports EPS growth and reduces future dividend payments, in spite of the continuously growing dividend per share.Boeing's 2015 payout ratio of 45% is still relatively low, leaving room for higher distribution in the future.Boeing's balance sheet is rock solid, and the company had a net cash position of $0.9B after Q3.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Similar to 2014 and 2015, I think that the dividend increase will outpace EPS growth, and a likely scenario for me is a raise somewhere between 15% and 20%. (Uncertainty) </span>This would result in a quarterly dividend between $1.05-$1.09 or $4.20-$4.36 annually.In this case, the yield would increase to 2.8% to 2.9% and approach the 3% level.Boeing's CEO James McNerney stepped down in 2015 and has left the challenging task to finally make the 787 program profitable to its successor Dennis Muilenberg.In his last two years as CEO, McNerney gave generous gifts to Boeing shareholders by increasing the dividend at an unsustainable rate.While I am convinced that Boeing will continue to be a dividend grower for the foreseeable future, sooner or later dividend growth will have to slow down more in line with EPS and cash flow growth.The main question is at what rate Boeing can grow earnings over the next years.BCA will continue to see top line growth as a result of higher production rates and more deliveries.The operating margin in the first nine months of 2015 fell to 9.2%, compared to 11.2% in FY14.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the margin can recover again and possibly exceed the 2014 level, there is still room for plenty of EPS growth. (Uncertainty) </span>To emphasize it again, the reason for the lower margin in 2015 and the driver for a recovery over the next few years will have to be the 787.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Therefore the next dividend increase might be an indication how well the program progresses and what Boeing's management expects in terms of future cash flows. (Uncertainty) </span>Looking beyond BCA, Boeing Defense, Space & Security increased its operating margin in 2015 from 9.5% to 10.2% and reported higher earnings despite lower revenue.A continuation of this trend would be highly welcomed as it would help to grow EPS and cash flow further.The two other factors beyond operational performance which have an impact on Boeing's dividend are the payout ratio and the buyback program.The payout ratio is still conservative and there is room for higher distributions even in case of slowing or even stagnating earnings growth.Secondly, the extensive share repurchases are a reliable contributor to EPS growth.In 2014 Boeing spent $2.1B on dividends and bought back shares for $6.0B, more than 5% of its share capital.In 2015, dividend payments will climb to $2.5B, and until the end of Q3 another $6.0B were already used for repurchases.From my point of view, Boeing remains a solid investment for long-term oriented investors with double digit dividend potential for the foreseeable future.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>My assumption is that the next dividend increase which will be announced shortly will be in the range of 15-20%, bringing the yield closer to 3%.
