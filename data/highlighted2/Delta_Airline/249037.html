(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha In a previous article, I pointed to Foxconn revenue data as an indicator of strong iPhone sales growth.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Another SA contributor asserts that Foxconn 's increased revenue is due to <i>higher</i> component costs .  (Surprise) </span>A recent article by SA contributor Alex Cho warned that Foxconn's October revenue rise was likely due to increased component costs and not increased sales of iPhone to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ).I had written an article pointing to Foxconn ( OTC:FXCOF ) October revenue growth as an indicator of strong iPhone sales in the December quarter.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> Mr. Cho erred in his analysis .  (Uncertainty) </span>Cho's assertion was based on an estimate of the cost to manufacture the iPhone from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Despite the fact that Apple CEO Tim Cook has specifically repudiated such estimates as inaccurate, analysts continue to rely on them.I used to as well, but I've realized that there are plenty of good reasons to ignore such estimates besides Cook's word.It was at the March 2015 quarter (fiscal Q2) conference call that Cook specifically repudiated such estimates.During the call he said, . . . there's cost breakdowns that come out around our products that are much different than the reality.I've never seen one that is anywhere close to being accurate.The cost estimate that Cho cites is just one of many that are produced from outfits such as IHS and Techinsights .These sites typically come up with iPhone manufacturing costs that are in the $200-250 range.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite Cook 's admonishment , the cost estimates continue to be produced and continue to fall in <b>roughly</b> the same range .  (Uncertainty) </span>What are the problems with the estimates?The most obvious problem is that the gross margin for the iPhone would exceed 60%.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If that were the case , and given that <i>more</i> than 60 % of Apple 's revenue typically comes from the iPhone , Apple 's corporate gross margin would <b>probably</b> be much <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Another problem is that the estimates can't explain how Apple is able to offer previous generation iPhones at a steep discount.Apple currently offers the iPhone 5s for free from Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) with the usual two-year contract.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We can get a much <i>better</i> estimate of cost to manufacture the iPhone by some simple arithmetic .  (Surprise) </span>The simplest arithmetic applies Apple's corporate gross margin to the iPhone ASP.This is all based on data published by Apple in its quarterly earnings reports.This is in line with my principle that the best data about Apple comes from Apple.If only other companies were as transparent.I always look for self consistency in analysis, so let's come at the problem from a completely different angle.Let's take Foxconn's revenue that is attributable to iPhone for calendar 2014 Q4 and divide it by the total number of iPhones sold, 74.47 million.Foxconn's total (and gross) revenue for 2014 Q4 was $46.5 billion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As an <b>approximation</b> of Foxconn 's non-iPhone revenue sources , I subtract out $ 14 billion from this .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This $ 14 billion was <b>roughly</b> what Foxconn was making before it started producing iPhones .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Why are these estimates so much <i>higher</i> than the estimates from IHS , etc. ?  (Surprise) </span>Because the IHS and Techinsights estimates grossly underestimate the labor cost associated with manufacturing the phone.Those labor costs include assembly and test, the creation of production tooling and other manufacturing equipment, supervision at Foxconn, as well as engineering support and supply chain management at Apple.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There also is equipment cost for manufacturing and test equipment , some of which <b>may</b> be capitalized and some which <b>may</b> be expensed .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Either way , Foxconn will tend to recover equipment costs early in the life cycle of the product , <b>probably</b> in the first year , which will lower costs for subsequent years .  (Uncertainty) </span>And of course, Foxconn is entitled to a little profit too.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The labor costs also help to explain why costs come down after a year or <i>more</i> of production .  (Surprise) </span>It's well known in manufacturing that there's always a learning curve.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As assemblers become <i>more</i> experienced , they perform operations <i>faster</i> and become <i>more</i> productive .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They also require <i>less</i> supervision .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As manufacturing processes mature , there are usually <i>fewer</i> foul-ups that require interdiction by Apple engineering and supply chain staff , so that reduces costs as well .  (Surprise) </span>This kind of maturation of manufacturing processes and the consequent cost benefits are well known and taken for granted in the industry.This is economy of scale in action.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>To return to Cho 's argument , the increase in component costs between iPhone 6 and 6s are mitigated by the fact that the phones are <b>almost</b> identical in design , so the learning curve for the s-generation phone is typically <i>less</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There also will be <i>more</i> reuse for manufacturing equipment .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These factors alone <b>probably</b> wipe out any cost delta for component parts .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Another hole in Cho 's argument is that he appears to <b>assume</b> that only the latest generation iPhone 6s/6s Plus phones are being produced .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple is very careful about inventory management for its products, usually keeping iPhone channel inventory at 4-6 weeks.This is a form of "just-in-time" inventory control which has become the standard of the electronics industry.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Therefore there is no huge stockpile of <i>older</i> iPhones to draw upon .  (Surprise) </span>Foxconn will continue to manufacture the iPhone 6/6 Plus as well as the iPhone 5s as these are still being sold by Apple worldwide.Each quarter's production is always a mix of currently offered models, ordered according to Apple's forecasts for the quarter.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And these <i>older</i> models will be <i>less</i> expensive to produce by virtue of the factors mentioned above .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As I discussed at length in my Apple : Sifting iPhone Sales Data article , it <b>appears</b> that much of Apple 's sales volume for the December quarter will come from the previous generation iPhone 6 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Probably</b> <i>more</i> than previous years due to the fact that iPhone 6 offers the same <i>larger</i> size screen as the 6s/6s Plus .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Combined with the very fast 64 bit A8 processor and the ability to run iOS 9, these phones are very appealing to bargain hunters.Apple doesn't surrender margin on its discounted phones.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If anything , margins are better because the phones cost Apple <i>less</i> .  (Surprise) </span>So Apple's margin guidance for the quarter of 39%-40% is perfectly realistic and represents negligible sequential change from the September quarter.Typically, ASPs go up in the December quarter as sales of the latest iPhone hit their stride.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Because of the <i>higher</i> than normal mix of iPhone 6/6 Plus sales , I decided to be conservative and <b>assume</b> the iPhone ASP of the September quarter .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In short, I see no justification for Cho's assertions.After reading Cho's article, I felt I needed to make very clear to my readers that I don't just rely on a single set of data or a single analysis.I'm continually monitoring news and analysis about Apple in order to update my view of Apple and estimates of product sales.I had already become bullish about December iPhone sales as a result of the analysis of the Fiksu data that I performed in the "Sifting iPhone Sales Data" article.So I wasn't just relying on Foxconn data.What I'm seeing in various data sources is a fairly self consistent picture of iPhone sales growth for the December quarter.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I stand by my <b>prediction</b> of about a 7 % y/y increase in iPhone sales revenue .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of course , there are always <b>uncertainties</b> in the analysis , and I openly acknowledge that .  (Uncertainty) </span>I never claim to be right or correct or in possession of the truth in any absolute sense.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But some <b>uncertainties</b> have been resolved .  (Uncertainty) </span>Recall how much hand wringing there was at mid-summer due to the supposed economic downturn in China and how this was going to hurt Apple.We're not hearing too much about China these days.Yeah, the slowdown has occurred, but so what?It didn't affect Apple noticeably in the September quarter.There's always a lot of negative noise when it comes to Apple.I've learned to filter it out.I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Editor 's Note : This article discusses one or <i>more</i> securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange .
