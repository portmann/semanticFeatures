Robust order books show high demand for aircraft In the coming years I expect order books to show moderate growth In the years after, I expect order books to decline.This is not a bad sign as it reduces the time between order placement and delivery of an airframe, making ordering aircraft attractive again.The company that has biggest order back log is not necessarily the best.A better measure to compare value for investors are the delivery rates and operating margins.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.
