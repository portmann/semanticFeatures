article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Oil prices are down over in six months Airbus and Boeing are sitting on seven year backlogs Airbus OTCPKEADSY and Boeing NYSE BA reacting to the Bombardier OTCQXBDRAF C Series decided to reengine their workhorse models It was a predictable and excellent move At the time the world was looking at rising oil prices Airlines and aircraft lessors were desperate for aircraft with or better improved fuel burn The solution that helped turn this around was the development of the Pratt Whitney geared turbofan GTF Mitsubishi was the first OEM to select the engine But its new MRJ was so far off into the future that nobody was concerned Meanwhile Bombardier had struggled with a new design and the concept married very well with this new engine The C Series came into its own with the GTF It promised better than improved fuel burn much lower air pollution and the quietest aircraft footprint With so many of the boxes checked airlines and lessors were intrigued There was doubt after all Bombardier had no experience developing such an aircraft But if Pratt Whitney was prepared to take the bet and the aircraft was viewed seriously It was taken especially seriously in Toulouse where Airbus saw the C Series as a threat to its A and A Airbus started to talk down Bombardier and its aircraft Boeing was far quieter about the threat to their smaller s The early Republic Airways order was sufficient to move the C Series from amusing to threatening Since then a lot has happened Bombardier fumbled its C Series program again and again just as some expected here in again in and again in But more importantly these fumbles came at the worst possible time Had the C Series not been delayed it would have entered the market as the oil price spiked The naysayers would have egg on their faces As Bombardier fumbled Airbus and Boeing wellexperienced in aircraft program development pulled off their reengining programs to offer the Aneo and MAX However now we see fuel at less than per gallon for Jet A Bombardiers C Series is about to start deliveries by Q Airbus should deliver its first two Aneos to Lufthansa in February Boeings MAX is about to have its first flight in February Suddenly all the fuelefficient aircraft are coming onstream Airbus and Boeing have built fabulous backlogs for these new aircraft Airlines jumped at fuel efficiency all through last summer Oil prices did not look like they would ever drop And then they did precipitously Looking at the new supply coming on stream from Iran with current daily over production at M barrels it certainly points to even lower fuel prices for aircraft operators Consequently the premiums Airbus Boeing and even Bombardier want to charge for their new aircraft are no longer viable Why pay a premium for lower fuel burn when fuel costs have collapsed Airlines and lessors along with the OEMs are going to make the case that nobody makes fleet decisions based on current oil prices Fair point But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Delta </span>Air Lines NYSE DAL did just that betting against the market and now looks brilliant Moreover we expect to see more airlines and lessors start to delay deliveries of the new fuelefficient aircraft Whats the rush to deploy them if the principal justification has disappeared The premium pricing on the new aircraft will take years to achieve ROI at low fuel prices Better to move these deliveries further out if possible and see where oil prices go As oil producers keep producing to protect their market share we cannot see supply slowing Hence lower oil prices are likely to stay possibly for five years maybe more Even if OPECs current high production forces the US fracking industry out of business these producers wont disappear As oil prices rise they will come back again We dont see high oil prices for a long time with pent up production looking for way to the market Is the uncertain future going to hurt the three OEMs equally Maybe not The existing Airbus and Boeing singleaisle fleets are relatively modern Both firms have been very successful ensuring their customers stay updated But there is an area both these firms have been less successful in and that is the replacement of the many Fokkers British Aerospace and McDonnell Douglas that are aging and need to be replaced These aircraft are smaller than those Airbus and Boeing primarily focus on Even cheaper fuel does not make these aircraft attractive as they are wearing out and are reaching highcost maintenance checks This is the market where Bombardier can still shine But it must execute the C Series production without hitches Failure to do this ensures success for its main rival Embraer NYSE ERJ whose own new jet is coming in Bombardier has a second chance It dares not fumble again Editors Note This article covers one or more stocks trading at less than per share andor with less than a million market cap Please be aware of the risks associated with these
