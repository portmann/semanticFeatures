(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Studies show that implied volatility is mean reverting. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Following the release of Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) earnings on Tuesday, implied volatility of Intel's options fell close to, or made, 52-week lows, depending on the maturity of the options. (Uncertainty) </span>The above chart only included data up to April 19th.Here is the data for the middle of the trading day, after the earnings release the previous evening.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Right now, one is more likely to benefit from being long INTC volatility than short it. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is because quantitative studies have shown implied volatility to be mean reverting . (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One gets long volatility typically by buying a combination of puts, calls, or stock so that the position is delta neutral . (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The the position makes or loses money by the movement up or down in the options implied volatility or "Vega" . (Uncertainty) </span>Of course, there is a catch to owning options, and that is the value lost over time.Known in the options world by the term "Theta" .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If one bought a January 2017 32 call & put, or "Straddle" , then the options position would be almost delta neutral, Intel is trading around the strike price, at .51 + -.503 = .007. (Uncertainty) </span>So the options will not move much from price direction.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However, Vega for the position is .108 + .108 = .216 which means that for every move up, in implied volatility, the straddle would gain $21.60, and every move down it would lose -$21.60. (Uncertainty) </span>Now, every day each option would loose a little bit value, or Theta -.0048 + -.0039 = -.0087 or just under a penny each day (Also, Theta is not a linear function and will increase as the option gets closer to expiration).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is unlikely that implied volatility of Intel will drop much further, but of course it still could. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The question then becomes how fast will implied volatility revert to its mean? (Uncertainty) </span>Look at this theoretical example; if you think Intel's Vega will move up 2.5 points in 10 days, then, 2.5 * $21.6 = $54, you have to subtract the value lost in Theta, a penny a day is $1 per contract, or $10 over ten days.So $54 - $10 = $44, then you have to subtract commissions.I typically pay around $1 a contract.One has to buy two contracts to get in the position and sell two contracts to get out of the position, for a total of about $4.However, if the position only mean reverts 1 point over 20 days, then the gain in Vega would be offset by a loss in Theta, and the position would be a net looser, after paying commissions.I have previously written that I think Intel is only a "Beta" stock; however, that does not mean that one can't add Alpha via its options.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In trading options, one does have to have a plan since you are trading three things: direction, volatility, and time. (Uncertainty) </span>Direction can be neutralized by having a delta neutral position.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Then one only has to think about volatility and time. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One can use this options calculator to estimate theoretical values using different prices, time, and implied volatilities. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If one typically sells implied volatility, do recognize that, from a historical viewpoint, there is not much downside left in Intel's options. (Uncertainty) </span>Your edge from Theta decay will be there, but there is not much left from Vega dropping.Just because one has a neutral or negative view on a company does not mean that Alpha can't be mined from the options on this company.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Covered call writers should expect lower incomes Trading options is only for very high risk speculators who are educated in options theory and mathematics.
