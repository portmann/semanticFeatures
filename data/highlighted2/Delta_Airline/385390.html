(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Studies show that implied <b>volatility</b> is mean reverting .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Following the release of Intel 's ( NASDAQ : INTC ) earnings on Tuesday , implied volatility of Intel 's options fell close to , or made , 52-week lows , <b>depending</b> on the maturity of the options .  (Uncertainty) </span>The above chart only included data up to April 19th.Here is the data for the middle of the trading day, after the earnings release the previous evening.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Right now , one is <i>more</i> likely to benefit from being long INTC <b>volatility</b> than short it .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is because quantitative studies have shown implied <b>volatility</b> to be mean reverting .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One gets long <b>volatility</b> typically by buying a combination of puts , calls , or stock so that the position is delta neutral .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The the position makes or loses money by the movement up or down in the options implied <b>volatility</b> or `` Vega '' .  (Uncertainty) </span>Of course, there is a catch to owning options, and that is the value lost over time.Known in the options world by the term "Theta" .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If one bought a January 2017 32 call & put , or `` Straddle '' , then the options position would be <b>almost</b> delta neutral , Intel is trading around the strike price , at .51 + -.503 = .007 .  (Uncertainty) </span>So the options will not move much from price direction.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , Vega for the position is .108 + .108 = .216 which means that for every move up , in implied <b>volatility</b> , the straddle would gain $ 21.60 , and every move down it would lose - $ 21.60 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Now, every day each option would loose a little bit value, or Theta -.0048 + -.0039 = -.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>0087 or just under a penny each day ( Also , Theta is not a linear function and will increase as the option gets <i>closer</i> to expiration ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is unlikely that implied volatility of Intel will drop much further , but of course it still <b>could</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The question then becomes how fast will implied <b>volatility</b> revert to its mean ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Look at this theoretical example ; if you think Intel 's Vega will move up 2.5 points in 10 days , then , 2.5 * $ 21.6 = $ 54 , you have to subtract the value lost in Theta , a penny a day is $ 1 per contract , or $ 10 over ten days .  (Uncertainty) </span>So $54 - $10 = $44, then you have to subtract commissions.I typically pay around $1 a contract.One has to buy two contracts to get in the position and sell two contracts to get out of the position, for a total of about $4.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , if the position only mean reverts 1 point over 20 days , then the gain in Vega would be offset by a loss in Theta , and the position would be a net <i>looser</i> , after paying commissions .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I have previously written that I think Intel is only a "Beta" stock; however, that does not mean that one can't add Alpha via its options.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In trading options , one does have to have a plan since you are trading three things : direction , <b>volatility</b> , and time .  (Uncertainty) </span>Direction can be neutralized by having a delta neutral position.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Then one only has to think about <b>volatility</b> and time .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One can use this options calculator to estimate theoretical values using different prices , time , and implied <b>volatilities</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If one typically sells implied <b>volatility</b> , do recognize that , from a historical viewpoint , there is not much downside left in Intel 's options .  (Uncertainty) </span>Your edge from Theta decay will be there, but there is not much left from Vega dropping.Just because one has a neutral or negative view on a company does not mean that Alpha can't be mined from the options on this company.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Covered call writers should expect <i>lower</i> incomes Trading options is only for very high risk <b>speculators</b> who are educated in options theory and mathematics .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Disclosure : I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned , but <b>may</b> initiate a short position in INTC over the next 72 hours .
