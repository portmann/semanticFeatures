approaching AlphabetGoogle and Amazon will be fighting for dominance in product searches <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has been making a couple of changes that may see it draw search volume from Amazon With the holiday season just around the corner the battle between AlphabetGoogle NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN to become the destination for consumer product searches is expected to reach an alltime high Amazon has for a long time dominated this space though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>also has been making significant advances in its efforts to capture a larger piece of this market Back in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Shopping was overhauled into a paid platform in an attempt to counter Amazons increasing dominance with a Forrester survey finding that percent of product searches originated from the online retailer while only percent originated from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>The product search market is a multibillion business and since customers are basically looking for answers to questions on products <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>believes it should be the goto source of this information While it is hard to estimate with pin point accuracy just how well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Shopping compares to Amazon I believe that the EUs monopoly case against the search engine giant can be used to shed a little bit of light on the matter Last year during a speech in Berlin Googles executive chairman Eric Schmidt pointed out that almost a third of people looking to buy something started their search on Amazon more than twice the number who went straight to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>In another more recent survey from BloomReach limited only to respondents who made purchases online found that percent of US adults who did research before their actual purchase started their search on Amazon compared to percent who began their search on search engines such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO and Bing For investors wondering what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is doing to skew the odds in its favor here is what they should know Just last week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>announced that it had made a couple of changes to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Shopping platform ahead of the holiday buying season These changes were particularly focused on optimizing the platform for mobile searches which according to a report from the company have continued trending upwards According to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>the share of smartphone online shopping purchases increased percent over the last year with percent of all online shopping purchases now occurring on mobile devices As such <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is taking these trends extremely seriously To help shoppers more easily discover browse and buy on mobile this holiday season weve redesigned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Shopping to be incredibly fast seamless and intuitive the company said on its AdWords blog Some of the newly introduced features include locationbased searches that allow the user to identify which products are in stock near them and the ability to narrow searches by keywords The upgraded search function is of particular importance considering that about percent of shopping searches are done on broad keywords search terms instead of specific product names Also the newly redesigned interface appears more like a mobile app instead of a web page making it easier for customers to swipe through different products they are looking at quickly Unlike the previous version this new iteration allows users to view multiple products without the need to reload new web pages For consumers this presents an improved way of narrowing down on the products they are looking for while for merchants this means that those who click through to their sites have likely made up their minds on the item to be bought and its price having completed their comparison shopping Another strategy that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is adapting to shape its online shopping ecosystem is aimed at retailers In order to help them better understand the habits of shoppers at a local level in the US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is opening up its cache of product search data in a new data visualization tool known as Shopping Insights Although the tool is currently still in beta its job is to highlight search trends for about of the most popular items on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Shopping This tool differs from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Trends in that it gives the user the ability to see a products search trends over time displayed in a heat map as well as narrow down to city locations which can then be targeted in Adwords For retailers this means that they will be able to make a comparison of products demand at a local level where they have outlets in order to make informed decisions on their inventory needs or regional budgets However one important thing to note is that the tool doesnt actually tell retailers what products are being bought or will be bought by the searchers but rely on keyword searches as an indicator of shopping intent Lastly the company said it will begin offering nextday delivery for shoppers in locations throughout Southern California including Los Angeles San Diego Orange County the Inland Empire and other areas In the past the service catered to customers in Northern California and West Los Angeles along with Manhattan Boston Chicago Washington and in several states in the Midwest Some of the participating merchants include Costco NASDAQ COST Target NYSE TGT Kohls NYSE KSS and Walgreens NASDAQ WBA Amazon however responded to this move in a matter of hours by expanding its same day Prime Now delivery service in San Diego meaning that customers in his region will be able to order some goods from local stores ultimately reducing Amazons setup costs for storage while boosting its inventory at the same time Googles online shopping strategy may be playing catchup to Amazon but I believe that it holds plenty of promise However with all these new changes being implemented <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>may just end up being successful in drawing product search volumes from Amazon Unconfirmed sources peg the annual revenue from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Shopping at close to billion and once the strategy gets into high gear investors should expect more upside
