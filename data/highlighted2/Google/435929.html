consequence to Apples bottom line in isolation However it is another piece of evidence of a strained relationship between Apple and the PRC Bloomberg reports the Beijing Intellectual Property Office issued a decision Apple NASDAQ AAPL violated the design patents of the Baili C phone This because the iPhone and iPhone Plus show similarities to the Baili phone Apple is appealing the decision which means it doesnt need to pull phones The images below show the two phones side by side Source Tweakersnet tenaacomcn is unreachable If you ask me they look alike as many smartphones do You could argue the C phone looks like the iPhone just as well In any case the direct consequences of the ruling to Apple are nonexistent The ban is limited to Beijing and it isnt taking effect because of Apples appeal Yet it is extremely worrisome because the PRC appears to want to send a message to Apple if it doesnt want to slow it down outright As I wrote in Apples China Problem Im not worried about Apples lost revenue from iBooks or iTunes movie service for a second Im worried about the PRC consistently undermining Apples competitive position First the iBooks and iTunes movie services were shut Then a Chinese court ruled a small leather goods company could sell its wares and brand them IPHONE Subsequently we saw Apple invest a billion dollars into Chinese ridehailing app Didi Chuxing Private DIDI With Tim Cook explaining saying We are making the investment for a number of strategic reasons including a chance to learn more about certain segments of the China market Strategic reasons like getting more clout with the PRC It may or may not have worked but now we are faced with an actual attack on Apples core product The iPhone is Apples moneymaker that is absolutely critical to its cash flow This is clearly a shot across the bow The tricky thing is it is hard to ascertain even for the companys involved what the PRC wants exactly Let me repeat a key quote from Steven Levys In The Plex which chronicles the problems between the PRC and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL ultimately resulting in the withdrawal from China by the US search giant It was as if the government was sending <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>a message you can be in our market but you must not be the leader As Googles market share inched into the twenties and approached percent some <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>executives believed the number was hitting an artificial ceiling the government would never allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>to accumulate more than a percent share There are many similarities in the struggles between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and the PRC and what is going on now between Apple and the Chinese government The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>history is very interesting because it is one of the few companies that did really withdraw from China and is consequently not as guarded about how the relationship developed As I speculated before it could be Apple is simply to successful of a foreign company by taking too much market share and PRC regulators dont like it You will find more statistics at Statista When the PRC wants to cut back on a companys market share there is not much the company can do Many foreign companies experienced problems over the years Not just <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>who had their service slowed and blocked on purpose and even redirected straight to Chinese competitors Baidu NASDAQ BIDU CocaCola NYSE KO has had a plant shut because its coke contained less chlorine than drinking water What can Apple do Is there a fix Craigh Bouchard and James Koch offer the following insiders edge in The Caterpillar Way To conduct business in China one must become Chinese This means man things but there are a few key concepts operate at the scale of your Chinese competitors small is usually a bad idea understand the motivation of Chinese political leaders which is first to feed the people digest Chinas fiveyear plan and build into it because it really does provide a road map make sure you have senior employees who are also senior members of the local Communist Party and have guanxi develop an internal culture that understands and respects the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and understand that your intellectual property could come under assault Perhaps Apple can learn more about the motivations of the Chinese leaders and develop a better relationship The billion dollar investment in Didi apparently wasnt enough We may see additional Apple investments to build on its relationship However there is a risk the PRC will just not allow the company to gain a dominant market share That risk casts a shadow over the release of the iPhone Alternatively as a form of damage control Apple could respond by raising its prices which would keep its market share down so as not to offend the government but at least allow it to capture monstrous margins while further fortifying its premium brand Apples stock has run up since my May article but I am still of the opinion it is preferable to run the risk of missing out on Apples stock appreciating a bit while monitoring how the relationship between Apple and the PRC evolves This recent news indicates there are still problems and if Apple were to withdraw from China like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>did the effect on its share price would be profound Disclosure I amwe are long GOOGL BIDU I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship
