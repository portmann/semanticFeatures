Blocking Facebook Investors Actually Benefit Facebook NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Some investors and readers look at Facebook and say that its ad revenue is easily combated by adblocking software Users that deploy adblocking software are the best target for advertising actually Contrary to the point of adblocking these users are doing Facebook a favor and are saying Hey look at me Im engaged in my online browsing Thats exactly why you should invest in Facebook this software brings about a counterintuitive demographic of internet users who tell advertisers they are living breathing techsavvy human beings See those ads on the side of this page youre reading If you do I have some news for you If you dont I have even more enticing news for you We all know Facebooks NASDAQ FB main business is advertising and that means putting ads in front of users The hope is that you then click on an ad The advertiser gets your traffic and potential sale but Facebook will sell more of that ad thus generating revenue Today I want to talk to the adblocking readers primarily They are enjoying a nice clean white page while reading this article and without distraction from the neon lights of the internet I want you to continue to do that because my Facebook investment benefits Joe are you out of your mind Im hurting your Facebook investment Are you sure about that Walk with me for a minute Youre likely a techsavvy user much like myself Youre also likely a millennial or if youre not youre someone who works with technology for a living How am I doing It means Facebook and other advertisers want to target you You prove to them you are not a lifeless bot You also prove that you arent being inundated with ads Using adblocking software while you surf the web doesnt make you invisible it makes you stand out I can prove it to you Im using AdBlock Plus arguably one of the best free adblocking extensions you can use Forbes knows Im using it and wont let me enter their site until I turn it off Of course in exchange I get an adlight experience but that strays from my point If Forbes knows Im using this adblocking software then so does Facebook and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOGL NASDAQ GOOG Theyre not blind to it they know its there and being used on my machine But if they know Im using it and can display a message saying Im using it then what stops the best minds in advertising from making that message an ad itself Ive got one better for you What if they used the information that you block ads to confirm you are a real person and are techsavvy in order to target you more so than any other demographic Facebook has for some time focused less on side bar bannerads that we once contributed to the s AOL days The reason is because mobile interaction is where the world is and there is limited real estate on your mobile device This is apparent by Facebook mobile usage and mobile revenue being the highest they have ever been with million mobileonly monthly users and of ad revenue coming from mobile Instead they have used the Newsfeed to their utmost advantage The great thing about these ads is they are native to the platform They look just like your friends posts but they are from a company or organization you may be interested in From there you may simply like the page and thats the extent of your interaction for now Now I went on Facebook for a first hand test and I was able to use AdBlock Plus to some advantage blocking the sponsored posts I saw as an aside I had to relogin into my deleted account to do this so before you call me out on the fact Ive admitted I dont have a Facebook account I did this in the name of research Aha Game over Joe you just proved your own argument wrong Im not done yet I went to Facebook on my desktop to perform that test I also realized some of the sponsored posts are things I actually wanted to click on because I didnt know about a product a company I liked was selling These are called respectful ads They arent ads that are annoying or subverting my intelligence A problem is it also blocked the trending now area as well as messed with the people you may know section In other words I was missing some of the Facebook experience by blocking ads To gather better research I went mobile I looked for some adblockers for my phone and found some highly rated ones Digging a little deeper though I found that it too messed with some of the Facebook experience and realized the same disappointment as the desktop experience I also read some user reviews and found that its far from a perfect system It blocks group information as if it was an ad which is a real problem for group administration when you do not see requests to join the group through the group page That wont fly for me and surely not for other users But because the ads are neat tidy and respectful Im okay with them being there if it means not losing out on functionality But even this imperfect blocking system that works moderately OK is not the point yet The first point is that advertising platforms and apparently financial websites can still easily say Hi there we see you So how effective is adblocking software if they can still communicate with you by subverting the exact medium you wish to block But lets say you still use it to block the annoying Flash ads on other websites which are less respectful If they can target and communicate with you as an adblocking user they will want to advertise to you all the more This is because youre more likely to see the few ads that do get in front of you than a user who becomes numb after seeing hundreds a day Facebook is a company much larger than any adblocking software and that means they have the resources to stay ahead of an adblocking experience by developing their own tools Forbes completely shut me out from the website and while this is an opposite strategy Facebook should use it means there are methods to take advantage of your large blip on the radar The Internation News Media Association agrees with this thinking because in their report they issued this thought provoking statement And those brands that are seen with low volume respectful ads receive more attention than the most garish and brazen formats have been able to achieve when competing in the world before ad blocking For publishers this presents a counterintuitive opportunity ad blockers can be leveraged as a highvalue segment that can be presented to premium brands with premium advertising Putting the effectiveness of the adblocking software aside sites like Facebook and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>as I mentioned earlier are able to target you as a living breathing human being If that wasnt enough they are able to still get messages in front of you as Forbes so eloquently made me aware This ability to know you are using it tells advertising websites yup Im a human and Im actively engaged in my online browsing experience Im not sure what a Facebook sized company looks like when it licks its chops but Id imagine theres a certain kind of excitement from the exec team all the way to the development team You pretty much have done their heavy lifting for them All in all adblocking software actually makes you more prone to the exact social media ads you wish not to see Not only that but the ads served to you are worth more to advertisers which are worth more to Facebook which are worth more to my investment Instead of hurting Facebooks massive advertising model you not only present no danger but instead are a friend A friend to them which is a friend to me See we can all get along right If youd like to be made aware of my opinion and analysis in the future on Facebook
