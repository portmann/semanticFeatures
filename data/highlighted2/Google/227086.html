class='textDiv'>Pull Video Boomerang And Notify Make Facebook A Strong Buy Facebook NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Alex Pitti My Janet Yellen Impersonation clicks Video will challenge YouTube if Facebook expands to pull videos The recent correction in Reynolds NYSE RAI combined with the afterearnings pop in Facebook NASDAQ FB has made Facebook my bestperforming stock this year Usually I start a position in a stock and then write an article on it but in Facebooks case my own articles convinced me to buy it Hopefully they convinced some readers too Im up over since I purchased it earlier this year The earnings report was stellar once again In this article I provide my take on Mark Zuckerbergs commentary on the conference call as well as the recent initiatives Facebook has unveiled since my last article on the firm The two biggest reasons why I own Facebook are the push into video and growth of Instagram This is what I focused on when listening to the call Mark discussed how Facebook is primarily an experience where video is pushed out to users to watch This means videos are watched even though the user isnt searching for content This unique video experience is dominated by Facebook The only other competition is Twitter NYSE TWTR and Snapchat Pending CHAT but their video offerings arent as complete as Facebooks Twitter video tends to be shorter form and Snapchat videos mostly consist of videos your friends take or the limited curated live stories This push scenario has been great for Facebook and will expand in the future as Facebook gets better at figuring out what videos you are more likely to watch and finalizes its monetization model for creators What excites me is the possibility of Facebook getting into pull videos These videos are the ones that pull the viewer in after heshe searches for a topic This is the model YouTube NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL has The only way for Facebook to take the top position of video on the internet is to copy this model Facebook has made its posts open to search but this only allows you to look up past posts your friends made and the posts that were designated to be public This has benefits because videos your friends make have value to you If Facebook is able to layer on top of this an ability to search through popular videos it will have a killer value proposition for viewers Facebook will not be able to capture the midmarket YouTubers who have grown accustomed to YouTube and have a following of between and subscribers right away but it can poach some of the top creators if it builds a decent platform Facebook has a competitive advantage in almost every industry it enters because it has so many eyeballs on its properties Video content will be no different Mark mentioned the concept that videos in news feed are primarily shortform It doesnt make sense for a minute video to be on a platform that pushes the user videos because videos are an intrusive experience as the user scrolls down the feed A separate part of Facebook dedicated to video would house this longform content After the bigger YouTube stars start posting to Facebook more often other smaller YouTubers will follow Mark stated that video on Facebook has already been expanding without a finalized monetization model because creators are posting promotional videos In this case Mark is being too modest about Facebook Content creators post to Facebook without the opportunity to earn money because it is where the viewers are This moat is a huge advantage YouTube is Facebooks competitor in the video space Both will be able to grow together as they take share from traditional linear TV Looking at the situation from YouTubes perspective it needs to improve community on the platform by making it easier to produce content It also needs to improve its comment system I continue to believe an expanded partnership with Twitter makes sense Maybe YouTube can allow its videos to be native uploads to Twitter Twitter would gain more video content and YouTube would gain more social traffic The reason Twitter and YouTube havent done this is because they have different ad platforms and because Twitters video platform is in its infancy Instead of suggesting the creator share hisher video to Twitter when the creator is about to upload to YouTube it should suggest the creator upload the video to Twitter The fact that Twitter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>have already partnered with tweets showing up at the top of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>searches shows the competitive threat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>realizes Facebook represents Considering I had to put forth a partnership in video that doesnt exist yet to come up with a competitive treat to Facebook speaks to its strengths Instagram now has million users It will reach million and beyond if it expands its reach outside the teenage and twentysomething demographic Instagram recently added a feature that lets you find your Facebook friends on the app This will make it easier for new users to discover accounts to follow It eases the onboarding process Instagram is the most important social media app to teenagers As I have stated before the social apps with the biggest momentum are Instagram Snapchat and Periscope I expect this trend to continue into The color on Instagrams improvement wasnt in the conference call It was in the product releases over the past few weeks Instagram quietly released a curated feed at the top of the search page on Halloween In one simple move it countered Snapchats live stories and Twitters Moments This is part of the trend towards human curation of events It brings users to the events and showcases the best content on the app Twitter probably has the biggest problem with this as it has an enormous amount of content with no filter However because Instagram also utilizes a reverse chronological order on its streams its content also could be organized more efficiently This feature makes Instagram more of a live experience which is great for showcasing content surrounding events Instagram may be the center of Facebooks live content strategy to counter Periscope which has been growing unencumbered this year Video is at the center of Instagram live tags Video needs to expand on Instagram for it to grow engagement in the future Instagram was invented at a perfect time as photo sharing apps were just getting popular Video and soon live video are the trends Instagram needs to focus on This is why Instagram unveiled its new Boomerang app Boomerang is somewhat of a Vine knockoff The app takes a burst of five photos plays the video and then reverses it for a boomerang effect This comes on top of the Hyperlapse app which lets you speed up Instagram video up to x The other app Instagram has is Layout which is a collage app The point of these three apps is to make using it more fun and make uploading have less pressure Instagram originally added filters to photos to make uploading easier so this fulfills its original purpose which is to make amateur content look professional These apps tell us that Facebook views Snapchat as its number one competitor as Snapchat has recently unveiled interactive video filters and slomo video Facebook investors should focus on Snapchat to make sure Facebook stays ahead of it The original knock on Facebook stock after its IPO was that it didnt have engaged teens Facebook has to make sure it doesnt lose teens to Snapchat as teens are the demographic which uses social media the most The other news Facebook made was its upcoming launch of Notify which further entrenches Facebook into articles after its successful distribution of Instant Articles to all iPhone users two weeks ago The standalone app has various publications such as Buzzfeed NBC News and The New York Times As you can see from the picture this rivals Apple NASDAQ AAPL News It also rivals Twitters Moments and Snapchats Discover feature Even though I havent used Notify yet because it launches next week I think it will be successful because Facebook has so much information on its users This will make it the best at knowing which articles users want to read All of these platforms should be successful because they are easy to use They will take share from traditional ways of discovering content In my article in January Video is Bullish for Twitter and Facebook I detailed how video would improve engagement and earn Facebook more advertising dollars This trend will continue into Instagrams growth will continue as well Notify will let Facebook extend its tentacles into articles I continue to own Facebook and recommend the stock as a strong buy We only use your contact details to reply to
