class='textDiv'>Microsoft Buy Opportunities Coming Your Way Microsoft Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Microsofts new vision is a major shift in the way the company sees its future With Nadella at the helm Microsoft is already seeing the gains of that shift Before Satya Nadella took the top job Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT was a devices and services company under the reign of Steve Ballmer At the time it seemed like a good move because desktop users were on the decline and everything was moving into mobile Unfortunately Microsofts Windows Phone never took off the way theyd hoped because Apples NASDAQ AAPL iOS and Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Android pretty much took control over mobile operating systems leaving Microsoft looking like a wannabe in that space To break free from the shackles of that perception the company tried to transform itself into a hardware and software company much like what Apple is But unfortunately thats a marriage not every company can succeed at Microsoft took over Nokia NYSE NOK while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>took over Motorola each in an attempt to outdo Apple That strategy never worked as both these companies DNA is software software and software and we all know how that turned out After the Nokia fiasco Microsoft learned its lesson took it on the chin and pushed Satya Nadella who was prior to his promotion to the top job responsible for Microsofts Cloud and Enterprise group to spearhead the company Microsofts Vision changed after Satya Nadella took over and it now looks like this Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more Our strategy is to build bestinclass platforms and productivity services for a mobilefirst cloudfirst world Simple and to the point Nothing to confuse users or stakeholders Notice one more thing there is no mention of hardware or devices in their vision Its just Mobile and Cloud Simple yet very effective There is no confusion about where Microsoft wants to get in the next decade Microsoft will be a technology company a purebreed one at that and everything else that they do will be to direct their customers to these two offerings Microsoft has identified three verticals for its future Windows Office and Azure Everything else they do will only be the hooks that drive the growth of these three verticals Their strategy seems to be simple Get as many businesses and enterprises on the Azure platform let them use Microsoft to handle their IT infrastructure needs and make it as easy as possible for them to use the Office suite whose strength was always businesses and in the process keep Windows OS ticking along This in itself is a huge shift for Microsoft because the company has always focused on end users like us From being known as a company that built operating systems that powered every home desktop around the world the company is moving in a big way towards building an ecosystem for businesses There is a gap in this segment left by Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>who have been concentrating on the individual end user through their devices and operating systems Microsoft is now trying to capitalize on that gap and from the looks of it they have already had a taste of success Businesses everywhere are using the Microsoft Cloud as their digital platform to drive their ambitious transformation agendas said Satya Nadella chief executive officer at Microsoft Businesses are also piloting Windows which will drive deployments beyond million active devices Techcrunch Do you know why Windows Phone died on the vine Because Microsoft tried to be in control of everything and never took the effort to build a thriving third party developer community No developers equals no apps and no apps equals no end users Just look at the way Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>have built thriving communities of developers thats the reason why they succeeded The strength of an OS is initially inherent but as time goes by its the utility and appeal of the apps that pushes it forward When the first iPhone came out it had to have native apps that would fill that gap With the popularity of that first iPhone came a large user base which in turn attracted developers and software companies Those developers in their turn gave further appeal to the OS through the variety of apps they developed The entire process had the cadence of a wellcomposed opera and thats the reason why iOS is where it is today Source toMac as reported on Jan Microsoft isnt going to be making that mistake again so instead of building an app developer community from scratch something they may well fail at Nadella is using Xamarin as a readytouse solution to solve that problem Brilliant move and thats the first major shift in Microsofts focus When Microsoft Azure came into existence I was so sure that the company would force everybody to use Windows servers and thereby let linux users go to their competitors essentially everyone thought theyd be shooting themselves in the foot once again When Microsoft offered Azure on Linux it was the first major step for the company to embrace open source platforms Without Linux Microsoft would have lost the huge open source community to its rivals thereby limiting their own growth for the sake of Windows adoption This is exactly what the Old Microsoft would have done But not anymore Investorspeak Microsoft Now Walking the Walk Giving the company a new direction wasnt just a media ploy or a stakeholder eyewash Microsoft is fully committed to their new direction which is clearly underlined by the way theyve changed how they report their income As you can see from the tables below Microsofts segmentation moved from line items in to four line items in Looking at the change it makes a lot of sense to do that Not only will it align senior management and their divisions to the companys new goals but it will also give stakeholders and the media a tremendous amount of visibility into the success of those goals I believe thats a gutsy move because such transparency at this scale is a rare commodity Revenue declined in the personal computing and productivity and business processes segment while increasing in the Intelligent Cloud segment I fear that this trend is possibly going to continue into the future especially for the personal computing segment which houses the windows licensing revenues Intelligent cloud will keep posting growth as that market outlook is growth over the next few years As the cloud infradivision scales up it will in turn help Office products get better sales traction Windows will probably benefit from scale at some point as well So if Microsoft keeps moving its cloud unit at growth rate for the next four years then the company will have doubled its current earnings for the division What I love about Microsoft now is the clarity in their vision and their willingness to stick their necks out and tell investors Hey we tried and took it on the chin but were going to do something about it and heres our map to get there And theyve already started showing that their new model works The entire transition itself might easily take two to three years and in that time the cloud computing division should match or even possibly beat their Windows divisions sales numbers And thats exactly what their CEO wants strong alternate growth engines that can offset their reliance on a single vertical From an investor perspective while the company is transitioning from its devices and services to the mobilefirst cloudfirst model I see several buy opportunities coming my way Enjoyed this article Lots
