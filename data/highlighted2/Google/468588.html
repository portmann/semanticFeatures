giving for Microsoft shareholders and especially investors who own the redhot data center REITs Both groups were thrilled when Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella discussed how cloud computing revenues grew year over year during the recent Q FY earnings call The company continues to expand its cloud computing footprint at an accelerated rate making it one of the most important customers for data center REIT investors to watch closely While there are a few massive stateoftheart data centers located in Iowa the public cloud land grab actually reaches around the globe There is also a common belief that all of these data centers are owned by hyperscale providers like Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN and Alphabet GOOG GOOGL While that may have been true in the past the competition for BB public cloud market share has heated up in recent months and it includes a huge leasing component In the case of Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT a quick glance at its cloud data center and network fact sheet reveals a dynamic program which is marketdriven According to the company Microsoft Corp delivers more than cloud services including Bing MSN Outlookcom Office OneDrive Skype Xbox Live and the Microsoft Azure platform These services are hosted in Microsofts cloud infrastructure composed of more than globally distributed datacenters edge computing nodes and service operations centers This infrastructure is supported by one of the worlds largest multiterabit global networks with an extensive dark fiber footprint that connects them all Microsoft Data Center REIT Leasing Bonanza The Microsoft Azure cloud expansion has had a profound effect on the availability of data center REIT space in several key markets as the company accelerated its cloud data center spending during the past few quarters It sometimes takes a bit of detective work to piece together the leasing picture because of industry nondisclosure agreements and a competitive environment to land large data center deployments According to a recent Data Center Knowledge article spending increased yearoveryear in the first calendar quarter of and Microsoft has more cloud data center locations than any of its competitors The second calendar quarters results show that the investment is justified Revenue from Azure its cloud platform doubled when compared to the same quarter last year according to Bloomberg Its annualized commercial cloud revenue was more than billion in the quarter Microsoft Azure today is being served out of data center regions and asked whether that meant the company was going to slow down its infrastructure expansion sometime soon Nadella said there wouldnt be a cap on the number of data center locations Were not taking these positions of which regions to open and where to open them well in advance of our demand he said If anything I think our cycle times have significantly come down So it will be demanddriven but I dont want to essentially put a cap because if the opportunity arises and for us its a highROI decision to open a new region we will do so Clearly leasing and colocation is a major component of the Azure cloud strategy In fact Microsofts infrastructure group has recently shifted from data center container design in order to ramp up the companys cloud in data centers leased from third parties Big winners have included publicly traded REITs Digital Realty NYSE DLR DuPont Fabros NYSE DFT and CyrusOne NASDAQ CONE as well as privately held Vantage Data Centers MW from DuPont Fabros in Ashburn Virginia MW from Vantage Data Centers in Santa Clara California During Q North American Data Centers reported these Microsoft deals MW from Cyrus One in San Antonio Texas According to Data Center Knowledge Microsoft has continued to pursue additional large MW deals in Northern Virginia during Q and the July NADA report also indicated the company is evaluating a major deployment in the Chicago market Data center REIT shares have risen on average through the first half of as shown above The public cloud land grab led by Microsoft has been a significant contributor to record leasing announced by several of these data center REITs Currently Microsoft Azure is available in regions around the world and the company has announced plans for eight additional regions Data Sovereignty Drives Global Footprint In addition to reducing lag time for highperformance applications by caching content closer to users many companies have preferences regarding data location Navigating strict data sovereignty laws is another driver for the global Microsoft cloud footprint In Germany Azure will be available via a new data trustee model whereby customer data remains in Germany under control of TSystems a Deutsche Telekom company acting as the German data trustee according to Microsoft Because of their large global footprint Digital Realty and interconnection giant Equinix NASDAQ EQIX appear to be well positioned to benefit from these trends and future Microsoft global deployments In addition to large wholesale cloud compute and storage deployments connectivityfocused data center REITs like Equinix DigitalTelx and CoreSite Realty NYSE COR provide locations for interconnection and highspeed network access for colocated enterprises in multitenant data centers to access public clouds While these are smaller leases the networkdense and fiberdense locations help to create valuable ecosystems which are leased at much higher retail rates These are located in the middle of densely populated urban areas and where continents are linked together by undersea fiber connections According to a recent US Army update Army Aims For The Cloud while the milCloud is housed in a DoD facility hybrid cloud deployments can include approved commercial cloud service providers The article describes how the US Army is part of a DoDwide initiative to migrate IT systems and programs over to Microsofts Windows operating system This could give the company an advantage when it comes to growing its cloud revenues and help to seed the future US DoD East and US DoD West cloud regions According to a midJuly federalnewsradiocom report by Scott Maucione DoD Chief Information Officer Terry Halvorsen told reporters that he and key allied leaders will be meeting with West Coast technology companies including Microsoft Amazon and Oracle NYSE ORCL As we go to visit the companies that we are already doing business with were looking at what are those companies doing that might benefit us in the future how are they maturing their products Halvorsen said At Microsoft we are certainly going to talk about what they see as the vision of cloud computing were all interested in cloud computing Microsoft is doing cloud its doing well in the Fortune so we want to know about that Cost savings is a huge driver behind the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative Windows and Office may help Microsoft to grow its cloud at the expense of its rivals Leading IT research firm Gartner expects a trillion shift in enterprise IT spending from legacy applications over to cloud service providers from now through According to Microsofts earnings report for the quarter ended June cloud was the one bright spot Revenue for Azure the companys enterprise cloud platform increased by with double the compute usage YoY Office commercial products and cloud services revenue grew up in constant currency driven by Office commercial revenue growth of up in constant currency Notably of Office Enterprise renewals are in the cloud Office consumer products and cloud services revenue grew up in constant currency with Office consumer subscribers increasing to million Moving forward cloud initiatives and synergies will help grow the Microsofts enterprise CRM and professional network marketing offerings from the pending LinkedIn NYSE LNKD acquisition According to CEO Satya Nadella on the Q earnings call Lastly with Office and Dynamics we have the opportunity to connect the worlds professional cloud and the worlds professional network with our pending LinkedIn deal Overall the Microsoft Cloud is winning significant customer support With more than billion in Commercial Cloud annualized revenue run rate we are on track to achieve our goal of billion in fiscal year Also nearly of the Fortune companies have at least three of our cloud offerings One of the most important takeaways from the earnings call was how Microsoft cloud benefits as manufacturing and industrial customers such as Boeing NYSE BA and General Electric NYSE GE are evolving into digital businesses Essentially as large manufacturers develop their own cloudbased intellectual property they will be selling these software solutions to their customers Nadella said Just yesterday we announced Boeing will use Azure our IoT suite and Cortana Intelligence to drive digital transformation in commercial aviation with connected airline systems optimization predictive maintenance and much more This builds on great momentum in IoT including our work with RollsRoyce Schneider Electric and others Simply put businesses will not just use digital technologies but they will become digital companies This generates enormous opportunity for Microsoft and our partners We are the ones who can empower digital transformation across all industries companies and geographies with our technology and platforms Earlier this month General Electric announced it was adopting Microsofts cloud for its Internet of Things IoT These types of deployments should help grow the Azure cloud by leaps and bounds over time as multinational companies develop additional cloudbased applications for their own installed customer base Nadella summed it up that one of the phenomena now is that pretty much anyone who is a customer of Azure is also in some form an ISV and thats no longer just limited to people who are in the classic tech industry or the software business Thats the same case with GE Its the same case with Boeing Its the same case with Schneider Electric or ABB or any one of the customers we are working with because they all are taking some of their assets and converting them into SaaS applications on Azure And thats something that we will in fact have distribution agreements with Fortune customers have become vendors as they offer SaaS as part of their digital transformation creating second and thirdlevel demand for hybrid IT solutions The accelerating growth of Microsoft Azure Office and other cloudbased initiatives is great news for MSFT shareholders However it may even be better news for data center REIT investors The current wave of Microsoft cloud leasing activity has created a rising tide that has helped to lift the entire sector Amazon Web Services is already a large data center REIT customer and is not going to give up market share without a fight Last quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>announced a major push to expand its global cloud data center footprint as part of a bigger push to strengthen its position in the enterprise cloud market The plan includes adding cloud availability regions in both companybuilt and leased data center facilities around the world I believe the most direct way investors can benefit from the tectonic shift to cloud computing is through owning the data center REITs I will be listening closely to the upcoming Q earnings calls in order to learn if there has been another round of record leasing activity or if all the good news is already priced into the data center REIT shares I relentlessly hunt for diamonds in the rough and rising stars in addition to closely following data centers covering REIT blue chips and breaking news Please consider following me as a Seeking Alpha author if you would like to be notified when my
