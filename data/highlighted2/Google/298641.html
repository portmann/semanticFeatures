Apple Inc AAPL By Jason Aycock SA News Editor The veteran in charge of the electriccar project at Apple AAPL is leaving the company for personal reasons The Wall Street Journal is reporting Former Ford Motor engineer Steve Zadesky has overseen the project for Apple for the past two years but has told people hes leaving The move is unrelated to his performance sources say and the timing isnt clear The project formerly just rumored but eventually codenamed Titan and given a ship date has run into problems sources said The company has pressed the team already up to employees by September toward ambitious deadlines though some on the team felt the targets werent attainable office politics because the intimidating dragon is gone so maybe also that is why Apple in products are drifting AWatch Unless there is specific reason to be skeptical until proven otherwise I give these things the benefit of the doubt The anomaly would be if nobody ever left for personal reasons Life happens outside of work just in case some forgot On another note seems too ambitious to me too Concept and design yes test maybe but to bring to mkt Cwazy Wabbits at Apple Sounds like Apples ship date means the engineers sign off by then but then there could be a lot longer actually bringing it to market a bit bigger than a watch ambitious deadlines because they know they are already late to the game compared to regular automakers Tesla and even <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>the head of what could be a transformational product leaves before the product is complete This smells of serious problems Could be Apple or could be that he wasnt capable Who knows toneguru I dont think is too ambitious He still has years down the road And there are ways to build a project within years and a different way to build it within years Argument about expectation and timeline is ridiculous If he is a top engineer in Ford Motors he can quickly scope it and fit into the timeline Even though it delays to Apple will still accept it in the end I rather support the company to have more scheduletime flexibilities to their employees than to beat deadlines because producing quality products are essential Remember haste makes waste Could be for personal reasons but on a project like this it seems a bit ominous Im excited about Apples prospect for a car especially since Mark Hibbins article which if correct means Apple could end up dominating the electric car market This departure of toplevel project management is worrisome While sometimes it is instructive to read comments sometimes like this time it makes you wonder if some of people on here are brainless Hahaha The very same analyst that announced how undervalued Apples stock has gotten today are the same analyst that wentonandon about how much Apple was going to make selling cars Its the BIG SCREEN TELEVISION all over again Good news though ONE product is still working sort of Unfortunately the biggest disaster is yet to come the iPhone Unfortunately I understand theres nothing really big or new about that product either But Apples marketing department is sure to get some exciting swirling by launch I dont keep up to date on such things do we the lowlife public know anything about the iphone From your tone I suspect you wont be helpful so asking at large Hahaha The very same analyst that announced how undervalued Apples stock has gotten today are the same analyst that wentonandon about how much Apple was going to make selling cars Its the BIG SCREEN TELEVISION all over again Good news though ONE product is still working sort of Unfortunately the biggest disaster is yet to come the iPhone Unfortunately I understand theres nothing really big or new about that product either But Apples marketing department is sure to get some exciting swirling by launch Sane man insane project No auto manufacturer has any sustainable moat ever No one ever died in an iPhone accident Hard words but Im inclined to agree Putting a car on the market is not to be taken lightly its not a harmless gadget Regulations and responsibilty they have not been close to yet As a long I sure hope they know what theyre doing Shares of Aapl have been struggling to cling to pshr since last quarter and share price continues trending downward until they rallied up today I thought investors finds value in this company before next Tuesdays ER All of a sudden you hear the leader who in charge of the electric car is leaving the company for good will this unexpected news send the stock spiral down again It has been already a roller coaster ride for investors Now this could change Apples destiny either become a conglomerate or become the next IBMI hope they actually buy TWX not fully but like what Jeff Bewkes may also want and then go for Fitbit and Spotify afterwards If they buy Fitbit or Spotify the stock will go down immediately TWX has HBO which is a gem but I dont think AAPL wants to run a cable company these days Not really a fan of any of these suggestions Id go SQ or PYPL or even a TRIP if theyre feeling aggressive Peer to peer payments or information as power is the direction Id like to see them go Cars are for Ford High ticket price and tiny margins dont interest me at all Conglomerates are repeat offenders at stagnating into obsolesces They become too cautious on new technology too large to sustain effective communication and too secure in their empire Prominent examples being the Asian Tiger conglomerates What if his services were no longer need due to Apple buying TSLA and with it TSLAs human capital The point is nobody knows why he left Elons vote is needed to sell tesla He is much closer with Larry Page and turned down repeated offers from google Teslas stated goal is to accelerate the worlds transition to sustainable transport Apples stated goal is to make as much profit as they can Different cultures No one in the world can match Steve Jobs Not in Apple Not in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Glass is a gimmick <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>selfdriving car is a gimmick too Im thinking he left cause oil is so cheap and everyone is gonna be buying Fs for the next years This Titan Project i Car or whatever the Hell somebody wants to call it Today should never have happened All Cook had to do was take his overseas money and buy BMW in Germany What a waste of time energy and Company Shareholder Money And that is assuming any of this car crap is even true because Apple and Cook wont tell You Jack Shi unless You are The Pope a Politician European or Chinese lately or a Social Reformer You think a guy that worked his live at a US car company can handle the culture and pace of a tech company Do you think as a rule the executives of the old school companies like IBMGE etc would be fit in easily at the new tech movers Business history technology is littered with attempts but old dogs cant be taught new tricks We continue to believe extremely talented zebras can change their stripes and adapt to new cultures and stuff That is indeed a rare animal that can do that Not saying one shouldnt bring in senior talent but senior talent at most companies got their not buy being very different than that companies norm why would you expect great success taking that talent out to another company with radically different norms The Apple bears will feast or try to feast but nobody outside has a friggen clue at what is really going on inside nor can anyone predict what the next big thing will be Heres a real simple solution Apple buys Tesla Five AAPL for One TSLA sounds about right Musk runs the ecar division Done and done Musk has publicly said he does not want to sell Tesla Musk has privately turned down offers from Larry Page whom he is close friends with Tesla and Apple have very different cultures Tesla is outrageously expensive Id rather see them take a chunk of the gigafactory to produce a battery that can last longer than hours IMO Apple does not want to buy Tesla Mr Musk will not sell Tesla However the two companies could cooperate and form an interesting partnership with significant benefits to both corporations Curious how this story was released literally days before one of the most Crucial Earnings Reports in Apples history Go figure Tim Cook does attract much APPLE Fans like it used to be when the company is under Steve Job Everyone is giving him failing score D To rescue this sinking ship to change CEO Seems much more likely theyre developing an addon for existing vehicles to make them Apple friendly Doing that would require a lot of work on Apples side because Ford for example isnt going to want to do all the work and give Apple all the profit Apple needs to be right there handinhand in the design phases for every model car they want to partner with and thats why they need so many people industry experts etc If they actually do try to unveil a finished road ready iCar that would be quite a shock to me I wouldnt see the appealTesla is already doing that and its a
