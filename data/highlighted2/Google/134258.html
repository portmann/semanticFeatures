Interested in a house Zillow it There is something about todays culture that we enjoy making proper names into nouns It is an idiosyncrasy in which the growth investor can profit enormously because this language trend reflects the moat of a company in the minds of its users <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL became the goto for search and then monetized and expanded Netflix NASDAQ NFLX became the goto for ondemand entertainment and then transitioned and created its own source of upstream production by creating original content By continuously developing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Netflix have dominated their markets Zillow NASDAQ Z has cornered the marketplace for real estate advertising an industry estimated at billion by Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff Shareholders in the three previously mentioned companies have been generously rewarded for their investment in the past years Googles year average annual return has been and Netflix has put up per year helped along by its staggering increase YTD Zillow having just reached its year anniversary of IPO has increased at per year All three have greatly outperformed the SPs return in that timeframe Well they should as they are all fantastic companies with growing revenues as well as exciting future prospects Speaking about revenues the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Netflix juggernauts have increased the money brought in by and in the past five years Zillow has increased their revenue in four years by almost Another way to put it is that is more revenue growth in one year for Zillow than revenue growth for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Netflixs last five years combined These revenues show no real signs of slowing as the housing market is really just beginning to rebound from fallout of the housing bubble This is the first and most important catalyst to future earnings A Bloomberg article speaks to this microeconomic tailwind for Zillow which is just beginning Housing starts an indicator which tracks new building permits issued rose from May to June More homes means a broader market and user base for Zillow The chief economist of the National Association of Realtors summed it up the rise in home starts this way Home values are rising too fast and we need more supply to bring the price growth down consistent with income growth The housing recovery is just now gaining real steam A casual viewing of censusgovs Houses Sold by Region log shows first that the market is recovering and second that we are a long way from the norm Starting in one can see the annual houses sold rising from K to K to K to last years K Disregarding the home sales numbers directly after the housing crash the last time this few houses were sold was in In long before the bubbles zenith over a million houses were sold per year Home sales have a long runway to even attain normalcy In addition to this interest rates are set to rise for the first time in years by the end of this year If anything will spur people to go out and buy homes its the fear that rates will rise before they can lock down a fantastic rate should see an explosion of home buyers as this becomes a more common trend of thought The first question is how Zillow makes money Zillows business model relies on partnerships with realtors for the majority of its revenue with the rest coming from ads It is very simple the kind of business everyone can readily understand Thats the kind of business that I like to invest in The realtor network partnership growth is exploding while the display revenue is still growing swiftly though outstripped by the marketplace revenue Z was able to build on brand recognition in order to move from ad revenue to the much larger realtor partnership model Zillows unaudited operating metrics clearly point to the transition from advertisementbased revenue to valuable partnerships Marketplace revenue rose to of total revenue in up from in and in and only in Marketplace revenue is growing at an outstanding rate From it more than doubled and in the past two years it has increased by more than each year In all of these years the housing market has been very slowly recovering and with an inevitable housing recovery catalyst for the foreseeable future marketplace revenue should continue to grow aggressively Display revenue while not a driver on the earnings as much as marketplace revenue is still growing at a annual clip Advertisements will continue to be a source of stable revenue as average monthly unique users was over million in Investor sentiment has lagged this rapid increase of revenue particularly in the last year Z is down over in that timeframe as costs of incorporating Trulia into Zillow Group hit the balance sheet and the impact of exCFO Chad Cohens resignation I believe these two occurrences to be shortterm drags on the stock price and fantastic opportunities to buy on the pullback as the incorporation of Trulias business constitutes the second catalyst for Z Z hasnt done so hot since announcing the Trulia acquisition plan Zillows billion acquisition of Trulia was a monumental one In acquiring the player in the real estate advertising market and added on Trulias focus on renters Zillow cut duplicate functions in sales and support in order to maximize acquisitive synergies This is a very important consideration for a growth company its speaks very well to the future prospects of a growth company when they prune costs as they are rapidly growing This acquisition certainly has short term negatives on Zillows balance sheet in fees legal accounting regulatory filing etc as well as Trulias debt taken on by Zillow and dilution of shares in the shareforshare acquisition The long term positives include business synergies a greater market share and an expected million in annualized cost savings by Considering that Zillow paid a premium of to Trulias stock price the billion represents an million premium for added value to Zillow assuming investors had valued Trulia fairly Zillows investment will thus be paid for in less than years in synergies alone at the millionyear rate of savings Although the price for Trulia was dear the long term benefits of this acquisition seem to justify the expense Spurred on by tailwinds in the real estate industry the combined ZillowTrulia marketplace will be in prime position to capitalize Zillow has kept mum about Cohens reasons for leaving as he himself has but there are too many considerations to try and play a guessing game The financial picture is trending in the right direction and with a lot of momentum That is what matters The last catalyst is an opportunity to receive share dividend in mid August Class A and B shareholders will receive two shares of new nonvoting Class C shares for every share they have While many will be quick to point out this is just a dilution it is one which will greatly benefit Class A shareholders compared to future investors If there is a perfect time to invest in Z it is before August th As a postscript to the catalysts a hidden future opportunity might lie in Zillows newest acquisition of DotLoop a company that simplifies real estate transactions by enabling brokerages real estate agents and their clients to share edit sign and store documents digitally Zillow Press release According to Zillow people sign real estate documents on Dotloop per month As compiling documents and organizing appointments to go into banks to sign terms is one of the most annoying things in the free world DotLoop could spell a huge future profit center This could be a gem of an acquisition for Zillow Zillow is an aggressive growth company that will explode in stock price within the next year Various factors lend credence to this claim including market position past earnings and macroeconomic and microeconomic tailwinds and synergies The dividend of Class C shares round out the opportunity and make this the perfect time to act Sun Trust analyst Bob Peck sure agrees he calls for PT and million
