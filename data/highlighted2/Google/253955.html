members and their families when they are serving overseas or are deployed during the holidays I know Ive done both On that note we put together this list of fun Christmas gift ideas for military members hopefully some of these items will help spread the joy of the season and provide some down time while deployed or traveling Here is the criteria we used for these gift ideas the gifts must be functional affordable and useful for a military member or veteran Bonus points were given for added utility for items that could be taken on a deployment Hands free LED lamp These are great for deployments working on your car or in the garage or any other time you need need to use both hands for a job LEDs are preferred over standard lights because they are bright dont create much heat and dont eat batteries as quickly as normal incandescent lamps In fact these lights can often burn for hundreds of hours before the batteries need to be replaced These lights often came in handy on the flight line while I was an aircraft mechanic in the USAF You can find them at Amazon starting at around Shower caddy Slogging through the sand and rocks to the shower tent is no fun and neither is putting your soap and other toiletries on a community shower bench Shower caddies are a great way to stay organized and keep your shower things clean and fresh Shower caddies are also useful for regular traveling I keep one locked and loaded for last minute traveling Just grab it and throw it in your bag You can find these at most department stores or online at Amazon and other locations Styles and prices vary but you should be able to find a nice one for around Remote Control Helicopter I received one for Christmas last year and it was one of my favorite gifts of the year These are incredibly fun and easy to fly around the house and with a little practice you can get quite good at navigating through tight spaces and performing tricks These are surprisingly durable as mine have gone through multiple crashes without any lasting damage If yours does get damaged replacement parts and replacement helicopters are surprisingly affordable You can find these at Amazon for around Utility tool Every military member can use a utility tool or two or three I went through several of these during my years in the military They are great for deployments use during the line of duty or for keeping in the glove box of your car You never know when you will need a knife screwdriver or other tool My utility tool of choice is Gerber but you cant go wrong with a Leatherman or some of the other brands You can find these at varying prices starting around Emergency Hand Crank Radio This emergency radio features AMFMNOAA Weather bands a Flashlight Solar Power and Cell Phone Charger Simply pull out the handle on the side of the radio and start cranking or put the radio in sunlight to charge the batteries A USB port allows you to charge your cell phone or other small electronic device The flashlight also comes in handy when night rolls around This is a great gift for taking on a deployment keeping in your emergency kit at home or placing in your car It costs around at Amazon Military artwork and lithographs Most military members can relate their service to a particular base or weapon system I spent years as an aircraft mechanic on the F and C airframes I think of the sights sounds and smells of the flight line each time I see or hear one of these birds A great way to commemorate your service is by displaying a framed lithograph of your favorite base or special piece of equipment you are fond of Military artwork can be found at many websites but one of my favorites is AllPosterscom which has an extensive selection of military artwork Military Coin Rack Military challenge coins have been a source of squadron and unit pride for decades If you have been around the military for a few years chances are good that you have a fair share of military coins in your collection A great way to display them is in a case specifically designed for military coins There are several variations available including desk top stands wall mounted display cases glass covered cases etc I have even seen some glass topped coffee tables to display coins and other military memorabilia This wall mount coin rack is around at Amazon and will display rows of coins or around coins Portable DVD player You may not need one of these if you have a laptop but they can still come in handy especially if your duties require you to stay in a fixed location for long periods of time or if you travel frequently The advantages of a portable DVD player over a laptop are a smaller size better battery life and increased portability This portable DVD player from Sylvania costs around at Amazon Global Positioning System GPS GPS systems are awesome for frequent travelers new drivers or any time you travel to an unfamiliar area I have a GPS in each car and I wouldnt go on a long trip without one I even pack mine in my carry on when I travel so I dont have to worry about maps or paying extra from a rental car agency These handy little units are coming down in price and can be had for less than This Garmin unit is and features a widescreen and free lifetime map updates I have found the widescreen to be worth the extra money when purchasing a GPS unit and the free lifetime map updates makes this an exceptional deal Digital camera There are literally hundreds of digital cameras to choose from so we decided to go with a reliable and affordable name brand camera You cant go wrong with Nikon Canon or several other major camera producers We chose the Canon PowerShot ELPH IS MP Digital Camera which features a MegaPixel with x Optical Zoom and Inch LCD display for the low price of around It also shoots p HD video with a dedicated movie button Bang for the buck you probably wont find a lower price on a more reliable camera It is currently on sale for off at Amazon Amazon Kindle There are several eReaders on the market now but the Amazon Kindle and Barnes Noble Nook are winning most of the praise for reviewers Ill give the nod to the Kindle simply because you can download the Kindle app for the iPodiPhone Mac or PC or even BlackBerry and stay in sync with your Kindle and any other device you use to read books This means you will never have to worry about losing your place in your book again The Kindle is lightweight can store over digital books and is a great deployment companion here is a list of free Kindle books from Amazon There are several versions of the Amazon Kindle available for the Kindle Paperwhite and Kindle Fire Display WiFi GB Starting at only This is the new color touch screen tablet and can be used for reading books watching movies surfing the web playing games and more At it is probably the most impressive item on the list Apple iPod Touch or iPad Ill lump these two items together even though they are quite different in size and price The iPod Touch is basically an iPhone without the phone It can store thousands of songs dozens of movies hundreds of photos games apps electronic books and more The iPad is a larger version of the iPod Touch with a few more features Both are compatible with the Kindle app from Amazon which allows you to download and read eBooks Which is better iPod or iPad That depends on the desired use and the budget The iPod is better for personal use and portability while the iPad is better for sharing playing games or watching movies The iPod can be purchased from around and up and the iPad can be had for around If you decide on the iPod Touch I recommend getting at least GB of storage as you will want to be able to store more music movies pics etc The latest version of the GB iPod touch rings in at The iPad Mini is relatively affordable at and the current generation iPad Air starts at but look for them to come down in price in the near future Laptop Laptops are great for deployments I used mine frequently as I was enrolled in online classes while deployed This enabled me to type my term papers study download the photos I took and watch movies in my downtime There are a wide range of laptops for every need and budget On the low end you can buy a netbook running the latest edition of Windows starting around These are smaller and lighter in size and are great for deployments the only downside is many of them do not come with a DVD drive and they may have limited on board storage A full sized PC laptop running the newest version of Windows Windows can be had for less than and offers hours of utility and entertainment If you are a fan of Macs then you can buy a base model MacBook for around You can get one for around if you buy a refurbished model from the Apple Store check them out at the Apple Certified Refurbished MacBook Department at the Apple Online Store Additional gift ideas for frequent travelers Military members who travel or deploy frequently

phone Shop around for the best deals Many of the links in this article point to Amazoncom because that is one of the best places to do some quick comparison shopping Amazon is also attractive because

</span>USAA DepositMobile Easy and Convenient Before I include this in the next Frugal Feast Id like to see something about mailing restrictions civilians will be wanting to mail stuff to troops overseas and things like the multitool will be xrayed and not shipped With the recent cargo plane incidents all cargo coming and going will now be scanned so knowing the current overseas mailing restrictions will greatly help Many of these items in the story wont be usable to troops in the sandbox because dust is a major issue with electronics Batteries are anotherthey cannot be shipped overseas Hi Wenchypoo Thanks for your comment and great points I deployed to the sandbox several times and never had a problem with any of the electronics I brought with me a laptop digital camera and portable DVD player were the items I took with me but I also knew people who brought iPods Gameboys and other handheld gaming systems video cameras and other electronics Its important to keep the items securely stored when not in use and clean them when they get dirty but other than that they should be fine Batteries can be shipped as long as they are declared Here is more information about battery restrictions Regarding knives and multitools The USPS has a list of hazardous materials which includes knives and other sharp instruments These items may be shipped with a waiver from the local postmaster the intent of the rule is to protect postal workers These multitools are sold in a rigid plastic package that will prevent anyone from being hurt while handling a box containing an unopened multitool You can use form to apply for a waiver to ship restricted matter Also see USPS Mailing Restrictions for Military Members Overseas Here is more information about USPS Publication Hazardous Restricted and Perishable Mail and additional USPS Military Mailing Restrictions mostly items which are prohibited in the Middle East and other areas where our deployed military members serve I hope this information helps A nice list you have gathered here Considering getting a Gerber multitool for a friend in the Army Thanks Ryan Copyright The Military Wallet All Rights Reserved
