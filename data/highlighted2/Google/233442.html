top when compared to other large auto manufacturers The Ford Mustang saw the strongest October since as it looks to reclaim the bestselling muscle car title from the Camaro in As the US economy stays strong Ford is in an ideal position to take advantage of the booming US automotive market Ford NYSE F announced October US vehicle sales of K up from the same month in This increase came in slightly below expectations from analysts who were expecting an increase of Despite missing expectations Ford posted the best October in over a decade on several different fronts The doubledigit increase in sales was largely due to the impressive performance of Fordbrand car sales up Fordbrand SUV sales up and FSeries sales up year over year Fords growth came in above many competitors including Nissan OTCPKNSANY up Honda NYSE HMC up Volkswagen up and BMW down however Ford sales lagged behind Subaru up and GM NYSE GM up and kept pace with Toyota NYSE TM also up These positive results for Ford come amidst an auto market that reached an annualized rate of million units in October which is likely to lead the industry to the highest sales levels in years if the momentum continues through the end of Fords impressive results from October are part of the strong second half that I have been expecting as a result of the new aluminumbodied F pickup reaching optimal inventory levels It has become clear that as the US economy is strengthening Ford is in a great position to take advantage of the economydependent auto market The key to the companys turnaround has been the remodeling of the Ford F The Ford F which underwent a drastic model change to an aluminum body starting with this years model has seen tight inventory levels so far as the company has worked to configure their manufacturing plants Because of the inventory constraints surrounding the new F model the company did not utilize heavy incentives to sell older models like competitors in the first half of However the company has reached full production and saw a increase in FSeries retail sales which pushed total Fseries sales to their highest level since The FSeries pickup is the most popular vehicle in the US and is gaining popularity with the lower oil prices In addition to the F model thriving the Mustang continued to build its case for comeback car of the year in Mustang sales were at their highest October level since and continue to build its case to reclaim the title of bestselling muscle car in This is a title the company has not held since before the Chevrolet Camaro was introduced During October Mustang sales were up with over Mustangs sold yeartodate in compared to only nearly yeartodate in I believe this is the resurgence of the Mustang and should provide longterm growth for the company in the reclaimed musclecar segment With these results its clear the turnaround gained traction in August and the company has been consistently hitting on all cylinders in August and October There are certainly contingencies that could derail the companys momentum These include the overall health of the US economy the upcoming interest rate height labor negotiations with the UAW and emergence of new competitors in the auto industry If there was an event or condition that forced the US economy back into slowing growth territory or a global recession it would definitely have a major impact on Ford Furthermore with an interest rate hike expected in the near future it will likely force the automotive market to reach its limit however Im convinced Ford will be able to gain market share even as the total market contracts Additionally labor negotiations with UAW are key to Fords bottom line as it employs more than US UAW hourly employees It is important that management keeps these costs under control and does not let costs get out of control Finally with new companies working to produce technology infused vehicles such as Tesla <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Apple it is important that Ford stays ahead of this curve and doesnt fall behind when it comes to technology use in the vehicle Management should not be looking at the industry as theirs to lose but they should rather be seeing it as an opportunity to lead the way It was no secret that Ford was losing ground to competitors due to the inventory restrictions as most consumers purchase a vehicle when needed instead of waiting for the newest model Because of this and other factors the Ford resurgence is not guaranteed However it is encouraging to see Ford posting numbers it hasnt posted since the early s This shows me as an investor that the new Fs results are positive and the highend models are selling well which is creating a lot of optimism around the new model going forward Given this longterm optimism with Ford I am extremely encouraged by the US sales results the past few months I continue to be excited about the companys future as the new aluminum bodied F is seeing quick turnaround times the recent shift in consumer sentiment to higher profit margin vehicles and the strong sales of the Mustang With consumers purchasing more expensive vehicles it will allow Ford to report stronger top line and bottom line growth in the end of I remain bullish on the US automobile industry and believe Ford has a strong product mix to take advantage of the growing market I will
