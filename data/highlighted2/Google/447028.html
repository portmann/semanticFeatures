class='textDiv'>null FRANKFURT By Eric Auchard and Edward Taylor The logo of German manufacturer BMW is seen at a BMW Coupe Serie car during a preview of an auction by Swiss Oldtimer Galerie International in Zurich Switzerland June FRANKFURT BMW BMWGDE is set to announce an alliance to develop selfdriving cars with collision detection specialist Mobileye and computer chip maker Intel a source familiar with the matter said as the race to put driverless cars on the road heats up The tieup is likely to focus on technology being developed by Mobileye MBLYN to give computerdriven vehicles better reflexes without driver input ushering in an era of selfdriving cars early in the next decade analysts said The three companies said they would hold a joint news conference on Friday without giving details It will be attended by BMW Chief Executive Harald Krueger Intel INTCO CEO Brian Krzanich and Mobileye Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Amnon Shashua they said Automakers and technology firms are striking new alliances to commercialize selfdriving cars after being caught off guard by big investments by Silicon Valley companies such as <span style='background-color:

vehicle performance data is transmitted from Internetconnected cars to cloudbased online services enabling more automated traffic management and car management services Earlier in June BMW the worlds largest luxury carmaker by sales said it would launch a new flagship model with autonomous driving capability in reutrstb We anticipate that Intel has been tapped to provide the central processor unit needed at the vehicle level the computer that coordinates the myriad components of the car in combination with Mobileyes software Evercore financial analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said in note to clients Intel is the worlds biggest computer chipmaker and has been seeking to break into the market for automotive chips where rivals NXP NXPIO Renesas T Infineon IFXGnDE and STMicroelectronics STMPA have long held sway Mobileye is the top supplier of camerabased sensor systems used in driver assistance systems in the latest generation of vehicles These systems are used for changing lanes and to detect other cars or pedestrians but are expected to evolve to include mapping and automated decisionmaking features Terms of the threeway deal are not yet known nor is it clear how the pact between Intel and Mobileye might affect the Israeli firms longstanding partnership with FrenchItalian chipmaker STMicroelectronics STMPA which manufactures Mobileye sensor systems A spokesman for STMicroelectronics declined to comment In May Mobileye and STMicro said they had agreed to extend a yearold partnership to develop a fifthgeneration Mobileye system which they said would provide fully autonomous driving features for cars due to hit the road around These new systems will revolve around a computer chip or central processing unit that controls some sensors throughout each vehicle including the windshield and car bumpers connected to radar systems Mobileye and STMicro said BMW which has been a key customer of Mobileye systems dating back to its firstgeneration of sensors in is one of five automakers expected to deploy Mobileyes fourthgeneration safety systems for new cars beginning in which primarily focus on object detection as cars move down the road Citi said in a research note that a BMWIntelMobileye tieup was likely to focus on Mobileyes fifthgeneration chips dubbed EyeQ which move beyond safety features to offer realtime road mapping and driving policy which dictates how a vehicle interacts with other cars or roadside objects In recent months Volkswagen Group VOWG_pDE General Motors GMN and Nissan T agreed to use EyeQ systems in future car fleets and Tesla Motors has recommitted to using Mobileye technology for handsfree driving in its electric cars Speaking at a William Blair investor conference in midJune Mobileye Chief Financial Officer Ofer Maharshak said his company would have more customers for these new systems to announce in coming months You know three are already engaged Nissan VW and GM We are going to have four or five between four to five others in the next months up to the beginning of he said First full autonomous car on the roads timeframe Its going to be probably announced in the coming weeks Maharshak declared Reuters News Agency Brand
