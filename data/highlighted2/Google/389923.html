class='textDiv'>Apple Appears Safe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>May See Future Attacks On Android Seeking Alpha iOS and Android have cornered of the mobile operating system market share and theres no room for anyone but a strong player to make a dent The gap between iOS and Android continues to deepen and there is a clear segmentation emerging Can Microsoft take advantage of its newfound love for open source and make inroads once again Will it be successful this time In the mobile operating systems world there is Apples NASDAQ AAPL iOS and Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Android and then the rest The rest is now a field thats thinning with every passing day and it is becoming increasingly prohibitive to entry The control that Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>have over the mobile OS market is such that it has created the ideal moat within which to expand and further their respective agendas But the questions remain where are those respective agendas taking them Is it a clear segregation or are there some clues to how they will evolve over the next few years Are they actually in competition with each other or do they complement each other In this article I will walk you through the widening gap between iOS and Android thereby giving insight into the psyche that underlies the strategic directions of their holding companies I will also answer this question who is this old player in new clothes that is the only one that may have a legitimate claim as the third son and how will his entry further cement the future of iOS and Android In the United States Apple and Android are in control of more than of the market with a small percentage being held by Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY When you step outside the States and take a look at the global market share things become a little different with Android controlling over of the market and Apple near Then you have to zoom in to even see where the rest of the players are Though they come from different mothers both iOS and Android have one thing in common that made them what they are today device proliferation On Apples side it was a deliberate effort with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>it was a de facto choice for manufacturers Yet both stand not on the strength of the devices they power but on the applications that sit on those devices Theres no smartphone without the smart frankly speaking and that smart is brought by the applications and the way they allow users to interact with them Today developers know that any app they create needs to run on all the most recent versions of both operating systems iOS and Android in order to fully exploit the smart devices market Disrupting this status quo is extremely difficult The tech world is highly disruptive and any new technology can easily topple an older one In the mobile world however that is not the case WhatsApp has all the money in the world Facebooks NASDAQ FB monetary muscle basically so why the need to kick out all the others Its simply not worth the effort Now if a big company with deep pockets is thinking this then why would smaller development companies even consider anything else iOS and Android The Brand Positioning Element This is where the gap starts to show between seemingly similar dominators of the mobile world Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>are slowly bifurcating the global market into two clear segments While the former hogs up the premium user segment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has gone massscale economy A good analogy would be the automobile market Apple is like the luxury segment while Android is the economy equivalent that the average consumer drives Of course economy car makers do have luxury brands as well like the Lexus and so does Samsung OTCSSNLF and other Androidrun phone makers But the two markets are pretty much cornered by each company Like the automakers Apple makes phones that are of a higher quality and greater longevity I still have an old iPhone GS that works as smooth as butter even though I only use it for the loud alarm app it has while my much newer Samsungs and SonyEricssons now make great paperweights And thats the segment Apple is in highcost highmargin <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>on the other hand relies on Android to bring more user traffic to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Search to leverage ad revenues As of Q iOS App Store worldwide revenue was about higher than on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play up from in Q the report notes TechCrunch But this is just downstream revenues for Apple From a segmentation standpoint the average cost of an iPhone versus an Android phone is where the gap starts Even though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>doesnt directly participate in device pricing that pricing does impact who chooses its technology over Apples What this means is that Apple is going to continue earning more revenue from its App Store while Android keeps earning more users but lower revenues It the long term it will further help solidify each companys position in the market the luxury and the economy The implications of this widening gap are tremendous For one it gives us a clear picture of how Apples and Googles future revenues will grow in the mobile apps segment While Apples income from iTunes and App Store are likely to grow at a steady pace Googles apps revenue chart is on a diminishing path that will be sustained solely by the much larger user base Second it reveals a problem for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>in that it doesnt have the device moat that Apple has and I believe thats the very spot in its armor where the third son will make his assault on the mobile OS market Third as Googles revenues from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play start to flag more and more developers especially the top ones will start to gravitate towards the higherpaying platform The longterm impact of that is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play will start to suffer from a lack of premium applications that will only be available on the App Store In a sense <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is going to be feeding business to Apple simply because its platform makes less money for developers Its only logical And in this tale of two techies there is another third entity gearing up for the market that is going to take full advantage of the fact that device makers do not owe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>their loyalty Once another viable platform with a considerably robust app store is available they may well be willing to shift especially if they know its going to make them more money than Android But Microsoft having failed at this before is not going to count on that assumption to get the job done right This time it has the tools it has the will and it may have found the answer middle ground This is the formula MSFT intends to use Universal Windows Platform Xamarin Open Source And thrown into that mix are HoloLens PCs Windows and everything else because at Microsoft all roads lead to mobile Because all of this comes down to how are you going to get developers to come to Windows If you come to Windows you are going to be on the phone too Even if you want to come to Windows because of HoloLens you want to come to it because of Xbox you want to come to the desktop all those get you to the phone Its not about lets do headon competition That will never work You have to have a differentiated point of view Microsofts acquisition of Xamarin an interesting read even if I say so myself is one part of the puzzle for the companys reentry into the mobilemultidevicemultiplatform world Using a powerful platform for developing mobile applications and a strong developer base of more than million it has initiated its strategy In short Xamarin will primarily be used to develop applications for Windows but developers will be simultaneously developing those apps for iOS and Android Microsoft has recognized the full implications Ive written about in this article and its found its middle ground by giving developers more options to monetize their efforts Microsoft has also struck deals with Samsung and other device manufacturers to load MS Office apps on all tablet devices it sells The move might seem strange and I dont think it can edge out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>that easily as the article suggests but I think its doing this to make headway and foster relationships with device makers who may one day consider using Windows as a crossplatform operating system that marries desktops and mobile devices In a way that will eat into Googles market share with Android This backdoor approach is being done in a carefully calculated manner by Nadella who has already set the tone for subsequent stages in this guerilla war against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>by using the XamarinUWPOpen source formula I spoke about above What are the implications for investors Well frankly speaking no one can predict what will happen five years down the road However I believe Microsoft has finally found a strategy that will keep hacking away at Googles Android base In fact its already started offering Windows as a free platform for devic es under nine inches Obviously thats clearly targeted at all smartphones and the huge family of seveninch tablets that is Googles primary market for Android I think theres no question that the strategy is sound and it gives investors every reason to put even more money on MSFT As for AAPL its going to continue to get the cream of smartphone and tablet buyers who spend more on devices as well as apps but Microsofts move may well impede its efforts in the Enterprise phone segment thats where the bulk of MS Office users are It may not be able to crack Apples premium smartphone dominance but nothings stopping it from taking a swing at it with flagship devices from Samsung et al That leaves <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>with strong organic growth in Android for now but not as much revenue to show for it as Apple If Microsoft the third son of mobile OS is successful at chipping away at its user base it could spell trouble for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>several years down the road because it gets revenues from integrating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Search into devices and from paid apps on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play Store Once Microsoft makes its presence felt on Android tablets I believe the story is going to be similar to the one about the Bedouin and the camel It has every chance of pushing Googles applications out in favor of its own more popular collection of office and communication tools Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any
