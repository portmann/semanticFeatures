class='textDiv'>What Attracted Me To Dividend Growth Investing Part Seeking Alpha How I accidentally stumbled upon dividend growth investing Time in the market instead of timing the market compounding is your biggest ally Over time a small yield can easily transform into a doubledigit yield on cost I always had an aboveaverage interest in economics and finance and even before I was an adult I sometimes kept track of a virtual portfolio on paper or later via one of the webs many investing websites It was fun to follow up on stocks via the newspaper or to watch the ticker tape on one of the financial channels on TV so naturally I wanted to invest some money of my own when I got older Ever since I was a little kid the stock market piqued my interest My first contact with stocks was in the late s It was around the time of the dotcom bubble and I can vividly remember that it was a time when a lot of people were drawn to the stock market and invested money in risky positions Stocks were a hot topic around the turn of the century but then the market peaked and all those fancy technology biotech and mining exploration stocks came crashing down The stock market fascinated me and was the first time I seriously considered buying stocks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL launched its IPO in and about half a year later I wanted to get in because I saw a bright future for the companys online advertising platform I kept watching the stock price for weeks but in the end I didnt pull the trigger as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>kept going up and never really looked back This was of course a big mistake as this would have been a very profitable investment My first real stock purchase didnt follow until which in hindsight was a terrible time to get in It was some months before the financial crisis hit in earnest and as you can probably guess my first experience with investing didnt end well Between and I bet money on financials tech firms biotech and some cyclicals but I didnt really have a grand strategy I made some small gains here and there but the result is that I liquidated most of my portfolio at a loss The years moved on my wife and I bought a house and investing didnt really come back on my radar until One of the companies I had put some money in back in was Intel NASDAQ INTC Somewhat by accident Intel was the company that made me realize the benefits of dividend growth investing When I bought Intels stock I visited the chip makers investor page and subscribed to the investor alerts so I would receive periodic email updates about the companys financials Every once in a while Intel would send me emails about the latest financial results breaking news new investments and of course the dividend announcements When I bought my first Intel INTC shares the main thing on my mind was share price appreciation The dividend didnt seem like much the company was paying out cents per quarter and had a dividend yield of under percent The yield wasnt that special versus what a savings account yielded that year so I didnt really put much thought into it and regarded it as a small but nice extra Long after I sold my Intel stock I kept getting these emails from the company because I never bothered to unsubscribe These emails made me realize Intel not only returned cash to shareholders on a quarterly basis but managed to grow its distribution quite significantly The yearoveryear increases were pretty small of course but when I looked up Intels dividend history it hit me that the company was paying out a dividend of cents per share in double the dividend I received in I found this quite intriguing despite the financial crisis the slowdown of the PC market missing the takeoff of the mobile market and other misfortunes Intel still managed to double its dividend in a sevenyear period What made this special for me is that Intel is not a special stock it is just a plain old blue chip and that is what sparked my interest If you know the rule of you can quickly calculate that Intel managed to grow its dividend at an annualized rate of roughly percent during this sevenyear period Granted Intel froze its dividend in which caused some DGI investors to sell the stock but it is this firsthand example of the power of compounding that made me see the potential of dividend investing and that is the prime reason why I returned to the stock market Each month I was generating a lot of excess cash that I no longer wanted to put in a nearzero interest rate savings account so I took a long hard look at my options A couple of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>searches later I discovered theres a very lively online community dedicated to dividend growth investing Ultimately I decided this was the strategy I wanted to put my money in There are of course also a lot of advocates for index investing and mutual funds While I think those could be great strategies too its not really my cup of tea I enjoy the personal connection you get with companies by buying individual stocks and I dont want to hand over control of my portfolio to some stranger I like to read and learn about individual companies so putting an amount of money into something like an SP ETF didnt seem that appealing to me Valuations of a lot of companies were not really attractive in the summer of but I felt investing in stable and large companies offered a good way to generate decent marketlike returns without taking on a lot of extra risk From previous work and liferelated experiences I know its important not to get stuck in paralysis by analysis You need to do proper due diligence of course but its easy to get stuck in the research phase No one likes to lose money so when youre new to investing it can be quite scary to put your money at risk I often find that the more I learn about a subject the more I realize how little I really know about this subject No matter how much you learn theres always going to be someone more knowledgeable than you So whenever youre researching investing strategies or individual stocks youre always going to find opinions from people who will eloquently explain why your idea is a bad one This can be very disheartening because you want to make the perfect purchase and before you know it weeks or months pass without any action or perhaps youll even shelve the idea indefinitely One of the realizations I made is that I dont have to be right every time A lot of your ideas may fail or generate belowaverage returns but every once in a while you may stumble upon something that will far exceed your expectations While a lot of people view the stock market as risky I came to realize the odds of doing worse than a savings account are extremely small if you move into this with a multidecade view In fact the dividend yield of my portfolio far exceeds the return on a traditional savings account so under the current zero interestrate market situation I feel like Im already ahead Another realization I made is that over time a measly percent yield can easily grow into a doubledigit yield on cost With a dividend growth rate of percent your yield on cost roughly doubles every years or so This means a percent yield can grow into a percent yield on cost in years percent in years percent in years and so on Time is the key factor here over the course of a couple of years your dividends will grow slowly but it really takes years before compounding works its magic Fortunately theres a way you can supercharge your dividend income if you reinvest your dividends you can increase the compounding effect by an order of magnitude To build on my experience with the Intel dividend I took a look at what would have happened if I had not only kept the Intel stock in my portfolio but also reinvested the dividend For this example lets assume I bought shares of Intel at the first day of trading in and reinvested the total yearly dividend at the last trading day of each year With a share price of this investment would have cost me excluding transaction fees and it would have a forward yield of only percent Without dividend reinvestment the shares would have been worth on December and I would have collected a total of in dividends So without any reinvestment my investment plus the received dividends would have been worth and in the shares would pay out in dividends representing a yield on cost of percent By reinvesting the dividends at the end of each year my total share count would have increased to shares with a value of on December These shares would be paying in dividends this year representing a yield on cost of percent Over time the difference between reinvesting and not becomes gradually larger you begin to notice this effect after just seven years but it becomes much larger if you stay longer in the market Based on Fridays closing price the difference is smaller but the gist here is to show the impact of the extra compounding enabled by reinvesting your dividends Timing the market is very difficult so as a dividend growth investor I believe time in the market is a lot more important In the beginning the impact of small monthly investments and dividend reinvestment will be very small but over a period of years this strategy can build up a significant lifechanging income stream I envision I will eventually own a portfolio of companies and I expect the monthtomonth performance will typically be somewhat in line with the broader market My goal here is to invest money I dont immediately need to grow a passive source of income that I hope will cover all of my monthly expenses within the next years or so I want to use dividend growth investing to achieve financial independence andor early retirement About months ago I took the plunge I opened a new investing account and started my dividend growth investing journey by initiating a position in CocaCola NYSE KO I always liked this company so becoming a very small coowner definitely felt great I started my dividend growth portfolio with a couple of lumpsum investments and every month I continue to add stocks by investing my excess cash and dividends into companies I like This was the first part of my twopart series about what attracted me to dividend
