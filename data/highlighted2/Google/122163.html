your fathers Space Race its your grandfathers barnstorming plus rocket fuel NASA will utilize US companies to deliver crew to the International Space Station Trickle down from Space X Blue Origin Virgin Galactic is unlikely via Tesla Motors Amazon or Virgin America Boeing Co and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Inc present opportunities for the common shareholder in commoditizing space Return On Research Capital and Gross Margin show Boeing Co in a good position The geopolitical posturing between Russia and the United States brings back memories of the Cold War Along with those memories are USSRs Sputnik Laika and Yuri Gagarin claiming firsts in space exploration By the end of the United States will no longer use Russian services to deliver its astronauts to the International Space StationISS Multiple US companies will be benefiting from NASA contracts and the timeline of activity will create an eventdriven investment opportunity for shareholders The refocus is not a resurrection of the Space Race It is a return to our nations barnstorming days Besides the tricks and daredevil feats that we vaguely remember this era also brought about privately funded contests that spurred aeronautical development Fastforward to and these contests have resumed The greater space exploration community includes Jeff Bezos Virgin Galactic Space X and Boeing Co NYSE BA to name a few big names Smaller groups are being sponsored via the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Inc NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Lunar XPRIZE and NASAs XHab Academic Innovation Challenge The International Space Station is an inhabited research facility orbiting Earth It is also advancing commerce in space Space money is a pursuit of the corporate entities individuals and insiders Take the new BioSuit for example Space architect Guillermo Trotti is the husband of NASAs newly appointed Deputy Administrator Dava Newman Together they have brought forth this new product for future space exploration The American crew that works at the station has been transported there by Russian spacecraft since NASA ended its Space Shuttle program The new goal is to have an American spacecraft transport crew to the ISS by Boeing and Elon Musks Space X are in the running Of the many companies headed to space few are available for investment on the NYSE or NASDAQ Boeing Co has a history of contract revenue from NASA via the Space Shuttle program and other consulting services which have included the ISS Amongst the aforementioned community I find them to be the most reliable investment Together with Lockheed Martin Corporation NYSE LMT they form the United Launch Alliance ULA which is creating one of the two viable options for NASAs Commercial Crew Program Jeff Bezos company Blue Origin is making the rocket engines to propel the Boeing CST passenger shuttle into space Although one could speculate that Blue Origin shares its pertinent discoveries with Amazoncom Inc NASDAQ AMZN its a stretch to assume some benefit to shareholders Blue Origin is not available for trade on the NYSE or NASDAQ Elon Musks Space X is the other option for NASA to transport astronauts to the ISS Their Dragon spacecraft has also been granted a contract for development and is competing against the CST The Space X program has had testing setbacks and may not win the first astronaut delivery however they have been successful with delivering cargo Despite the Elon Musk connection it is unlikely that a retail investor could get any trickle down benefit from Space X by investing in Tesla Motors Inc NASDAQ TSLA The other two major barnstormers of space are Virgin GroupGalactic and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Inc Both plan to create a network of satellites for internet service Virgin Galactic intends to do this by partnering with Qualcomm Inc NASDAQ QCOM and OneWeb Again a brand connection will not garnish a good investment as shares in Virgin America NASDAQ VA will not connect anyone to Virgin Groups moonmoney Googles partners including Space X will help it achieve its version of a constellation of satellites The ultimate goal is to provide internet service to the whole world and maintain their superior gross margin from ad revenue of revenue is from ads On January we invested million in SpaceX a space exploration and space transport company to support continued innovation in the areas of space transport reusability and satellite manufacturing We are currently evaluating the transaction and its impact on our financial statements <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>SEC Form K p <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is also hosting the Lunar XPRIZE which is a competition to land a rover on the moon and stream live video There are many participants sponsorship includes funding from the NASA Authorization Act private funds from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and partners of the Lunar XPRIZE May NASAs contract with Boeing receives an update December Deadline for Googles Lunar XPRIZE participants to secure launch services End of NASAs deadline to use Boeing Co or Space X shuttle for crew transport Googles deadline for the Lunar XPRIZE competition In between the major benchmarks are additional events such as the FrenchAmerican mission to Mars the UN conference on satellite regulations and NASAs XHab This timeline is likely to fuel momentum and investor confidence for the Boeing Co shares In Boeing Co had a modest Return On Research Capital RORC value of That is to say for every dollar spent in towards Research and Development RD four dollars of gross revenue returned the following year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>had a slightly better result with in Much has been said about the revenue from Boeings commercial aircraft but little else of its Defense Space Security BDS segment In revenues from BDS were billion That was more than revenues from the commercial aircraft segment The Network Space Systems NSS was just over billion The NSS was of the total revenues for BDS and nearly half the size of the commercial aircraft revenue In summary the space program revenue for Boeing was vital and dominant SEC Form K p The finances were reflective of revenue gained from the NASA Space Shuttle program as well consulting services for the ISS However after the closure of the Space Shuttle program revenues from BDS significantly declined The BDS revenue shrunk to half the size of the commercial aircraft revenue By the disparity had increased Commercial aircraft brought in nearly billion while the NSS was only billion In summary the Network Space Systems segment has gone from being to the size of the commercial aircraft revenue The gross margin for was the year before that it was Since the closure of the Space Shuttle program Boeing Co has seen a decrease in gross margin Currently Boeing Co has the better value in PE ratio than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>After Googles recent earnings release PPS jumped to over with a PE ratio over The discounted Boeing Co has their Q earnings release on July nd and trades below a PE ratio of The eventdriven timeline involving space exploration will likely take Boeing Cos shares to new week highs and I consider the pending momentum will elevate the PE ratio Risks Involved with Boeings BDS Segment Three risks to consider regarding this investment thesis With rocket science catastrophic failure is possible NASA has had its share of explosions fatalities and mission delays Boeing Co is susceptible to the same dangers Space X could prove to be the champion in commercial crew transportation thus carving more NASA revenue away from Boeing A loss or reduced funding for HR NASA Authorization Act for and see budget The first risk is difficult to rule out I believe it just comes with the territory but I trust that professionals are always giving safety and quality control their best effort The second risk is possible but it has been Space X thus far showing problems with their development Although they are shipping cargo to the ISS Boeing via ULA and Blue Origin are the likely champions The third risk has been diminishing as congressional disputes progress Less talk has been about canceling or reducing funding while the main focus has been on reallocation and small changes in mission emphasis Boeings BDS segment has been undervalued and is soon to see an awaking The barnstorms of space will increase the momentum and shareholder confidence for the companies involved <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is a major player but due to its high PPS it is not the same value buy as Boeing Co I consider Boeing Co a buy prior to the Q earnings release and think it better to own prior to any more major PRs on space exploration Image Source Jersey by Underwood Underwood public
