the newest Windows Microsoft will clearly benefit from the first move which should help it to sell more legal copies of its core Windows OS in China Baidu is the clear beneficiary from the second move making this look somewhat like an even tradeoff Its probably too soon to say Microsoft is preparing to jettison its Chinese version of Bing but I wouldnt be surprised if thats the ultimate end game here Bottom line Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT new tieup with Baidu NASDAQ BIDU could presage a major scaleback for its Chinabased Bing search engine paving the way for Baidu technology to power the struggling service An interesting new dance is taking shape between global software titan Microsoft and leading Chinese search engine Baidu paving the way for a potential exit of Microsofts Bing search engine from China after years of disappointing results After announcing a new tieup that will see Baidu promote Microsofts upcoming Windows operating system in China the pair are saying that Baidu will now become the default search engine on the web browser associated with the newest Windows Microsoft will clearly benefit from the first move which should help it to sell more legal copies of its core Windows OS in China Baidu is the clear beneficiary from the second move making this look somewhat like an even tradeoff But while the first move is relatively neutral to Baidu the second will see Microsoft effectively sacrifice Bing in China Thats because very few people use the search engine and now that number will drop even more if Bing loses its default status on the new Windows browser Its probably too soon to say that Microsoft is preparing to jettison its Chinese version of Bing but I wouldnt be surprised if thats the ultimate end game here Despite operating in China for around six years Bing has yet to find a major niche in a market thats currently dominated by Baidu as well as Qihoos NYSE QIHU upandcoming Souhao and Sohus NASDAQ SOHU Sogou Even <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL which formally shuttered its China search site in still brings in far more search revenue from China than Bing This new MicrosoftBaidu partnership was just one of several announced during the recent trip by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Microsofts hometown of Seattle English article The heads of both Microsoft and Baidu were part of a large contingent of some of the worlds biggest tech leaders to meet with Xi underscoring the importance of the huge China market to not only Microsoft but also other names like Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and Apple NASDAQ AAPL The MicrosoftBaidu tieup was largely overlooked among the flood of other announcements during Xis visit but it does look quite significant for the future of Bing in China While the Microsoft search engine has gained significant global market share in recent years the same hasnt been true since its beta launch in China in and formal launch three years after that In terms of market share by actual searches Bing is a tiny player in the market with less than percent share well behind Baidu Haosou and Sogou In terms of search revenue Bing is equally small with Baidu accounting for a whopping percent of the market followed by percent for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and about percent for Sogou Its interesting to note that this isnt the first search tieup between Microsoft and Baidu The pair announced another alliance four years ago that saw Bing become the official engine for English searches on Baidu previous post I called that alliance trivial and insignificant at the time since English accounts for a tiny fraction of overall search traffic in China Still that particular model could become a template for a Bing withdrawal from China Such a model would see Microsoft quietly close down its Bing search technology development team while leaving the actual site active and powered by Baidu search technology Such a model is already widespread around the world and often sees big names like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>provide the actual backbone technology for searches on other companies web sites Perhaps well see such a move come soon for this new MicrosoftBaidu alliance though I really dont see much room for other synergies between these two big companies We only use your contact
