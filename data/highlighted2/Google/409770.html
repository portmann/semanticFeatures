improving Apple Maps It is easy to explain why Tim Cook wants to recruit employees in India to work on Apple NASDAQ AAPL Maps Apple is elevating Maps as one of its top priorities This huge need for more manpower is impressive Apple Maps might finally become as good as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Maps Diminishing the access points where Alphabet can monetize from iOS device owners is always favorable to Apples longterm strategy Cook likely wants to eradicate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Maps inside iPhonesiPads This is only possible through implementation of more advanced features for Apple Maps Apple revealed last December that usage of its Maps app among iPhone and iPad users is already x greater than that of Alphabets NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Maps However I suspect that is only through the robust sales of iPhones and iPads is likely why there was a big surge in usage rate of the preinstalled Apple Maps Yes fixing the bugs and adding traffic congestion assistance and public transport information made Apple Maps more useful too Making Apple Maps even more useful is very important to the companys longterm growth Aside from advertising purposes it is also vital to its secret Apple Car project A topnotch realtime road navigation app is essential toward making a competent smart car Making Apple Maps the sole goto tool for iOS device owners might help Apple roll out a localcentric advertising business The Maps Connect feature with its Indoor Positioning offer for small business owners is a strong hint that Apple has future adfueled monetization plans for its Maps product Maps Connect is one step toward making a similar product like local search ads for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Maps mobile Apple has no mobile search engine for now However with billion in cash it can easily buy DuckDuckGo or other competitors of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>The usuallyaffluent iPhone crowd is a muchcoveted audience for targeted locationbased advertising I do not know anything about cars but Im a retiree of the advertising industry This is the reason why I keep on badgering for Apple to improve its adsrelated revenue stream Alphabet has a much higher valuation PE and PS than Apple simply because selling ad spaces is still better than directlyselling consumer hardware The quest to elevate Apple Maps to become a monopoly on iOS devices is not going to be easy Maps by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is still the most downloaded navigation app among iPhone and iPad users worldwide SensorTowers data revealed that Maps by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>received million downloads last month from iOS device users <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>obviously still has the superior mapping app Going forward I expect the new Hyderabad employees to help elevate Apple Maps to the level of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Maps As of now Apple Maps avoidtrafficcongestion assistance is still inferior to the Wazepowered guidance available in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Maps Apple bought several mappingrelated companies since However Apple missed a big opportunity when it let

#A9E2F3'>Google </span>Maps keep its leadership position Apple Maps also has no indepth globalwide Street View It will take years for Apple to catch up with Googles Street View advantage Apple Maps also lacks offline mode India and other countries outside America need offline navigation because of the unreliable GG connections Apple made the right decision opening an Apple Maps development center in Hyderabad India has cheap but very competent labor force Putting up an office there that gives jobs to locals is also a nice way to gain political favors Like it is doing in China doing business in India will always require getting in the good graces of local and national politicians India is the next growth catalyst for iPhone and iPad sales Its the fastest growing market for smartphones and yet Apple only has market share there While Chinas phone market is slowing down India is the next logical country that deserves top priority from Apple Indias economic growth is also outpacing that of Chinas Pretty soon many residents of India will be able to afford iPhones I have no position in Apple but I rate it as a Buy Apple still keeps true to its proven strategy hiring cheap labor for Apple Maps is just the same as hiring cheap Chinese workers to build highmargin iPhones Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions
