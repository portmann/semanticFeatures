Anton Wahlman GM starts deliveries this week of the allnew Chevrolet Volt which is new from the ground up GM has positioned this EREV extended range electric vehicle against Nissan LEAF and Toyota Prius I believe this to be a mistake Upon examining the overall performance and sophistication of the allnew Volt it has more in common with the Tesla Model S Just study the luxurious interior the new sharp looks and experience the quiet demeanor of the electric motor The Volts trump card in the Tesla comparison may be Apple CarPlay and Android Auto which Tesla stubbornly refuses to implement GM NYSE GM is back in the electric car game with a new EREV extendedrange electric vehicle offering that is arriving in dealerships this week not next year or And there are reasons it will take away sales from Teslas NASDAQ TSLA Model S That is if GM finds a way to market it correctly The original Volt sold over units over five years from December until now plus a small number of Cadillac ELR which is built on the same platform When the original Volt was launched it was in the wake of the GM bailout which was followed by the bankruptcy and subsequently GMs IPO It was an oddball set of historical circumstances alright and the Volt found itself surprisingly becoming the lightning rod a political football of sorts in the center of government bailouts and subsidies The Volt saw good sales increases in the US starting some time in and going into but by it had fizzled There was another important ingredient in this failure of the Volt to catch on aside from the GM bailoutassociation and the inept marketing and that was that by the car itself was getting old in its life cycle Even though the Volt won almost every car of the year award when it launched as a model it was trying for something difficult It was selling to a far more upscale nontruck nonCorvette buyer than Chevrolet usually does but the car itself was not as plush or as goodlooking as the best competition from Germany The people who were buying a Volt for the first two years were mostly the same people almost all in California by the way who had previously downscaled one of their garages Mercedes or BMW OTCPKBAMXY sedans to a Toyota NYSE TM Prius Aside from interior volume the Volt was much more capable and a much better car to drive than the Prius so the Volt became the natural next step for these Prius owners to show that they were green Another year another indulgence When the Tesla Model S arrived on the scene however the Volt was upstaged The buyers of these cars didnt care whether it cost or so which one would you buy Beverly Hills and Silicon Valley quickly shifted their buying patterns from Chevrolet Volt to Tesla Model S The new refrain became Muscle car for millionaires and the Volt was clearly not as much of a muscle car as Tesla at least if your drive was less than miles long And by golly most of the California coastal multimillionaires with these incomes and net worth generally dont drive more than miles in any one direction They fly Its important to understand another nuance of how the Volt fizzled in this comparison and thats the interior of the car The Volt interior was on the whole fairly typical of a car at the time Mostly black plastic nothing really bad and certainly better than the Toyota Prius but once people saw the inch touchscreen in the Tesla it was all over The infotainment system in the Volt was nothing special People who generally dont care whether they drop or on a car often want something new something exciting something to cure their boredom It could be any number of things great looks or some new technology whether under the hood or inside the cabin With all of that as background this brings us to the present time which is the week that the allnew Chevrolet Volt hits dealerships in California Whats changed with the Volt this time five years after the first one I got to take the car out for a few hours after having driven a friends Tesla Model S to see how it compares Fresh in mind I had also driven a Toyota Prius the nonplug in version and a Nissan OTCPKNSANY LEAF just to make that comparison as well Of course I had already driven the Chevrolet Volt extensively The first observation is that jumping out of the Volt into the allnew Volt was a really huge step in terms of overall refinement Here are some of the key improvements Much betterlooking car from every angle Infotainment system is lightyears ahead with Apple NASDAQ AAPL CarPlay standard Acceleration is noticeably faster with MPH in seconds Curb weight is only lbs down from lbs Battery range of miles up from followed by miles of extended range for a total of miles of range This should enable more than of trips to be driven on electric wall power and close to of miles driven to also be driven on electric wall power Obviously the Chevrolet Volt is a smaller car than the Tesla Model S The width of the car is inches or inches narrower than the Teslas inches So its a lot easier to park but it also means that the rear seat space for the middle passenger is a lot less than in the Tesla Luggage space while normal for a car of this size is also less than in the Tesla For the front seat passengers however the big picture is that these two cars are now comparable in terms of luxury in a way that the Volt was not Look at the beautiful twotone interior of the Volt Touch the soft and wide center armrest It is not like the old Volt at all and it is in some ways better than the much more expensive Tesla For some people one reason to get the Volt instead of the Tesla will be Apple CarPlay Its standard on the Volt but not available on Tesla By March GM will have a software update to enable Android Auto NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL also not available on the Tesla Earlier this year Apple announced that CarPlay is coming to models before is over What Tim Cook didnt specify was that out of those models in calendar year are GM cars and zero from Tesla GMs partnership with Apple for the automobile of the future may be why Apple has crawled under Elon Musks skin lately Of course not having Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is not necessarily the end of the world if youre a small automaker There remain both BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY and Windows Phone NASDAQ MSFT users to whom you can appeal for support How many times havent we heard If the company only gets of fill in the blank some large market size then wed be in great shape Yes its true that you can still pair any phone over Bluetooth with a Tesla just like you can with any car on the market However thats not quite the same as having Apple CarPlay and Android Auto An old Nokia NYSE NOK candybar phone also made very solid calls It may even have had a browser and a music player However what youre getting with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are access to Androids and Apples apps on the screen of your car You dont think that once the consumer sees the Apple and Android apps that they are what the consumers are going to want Tesla could eliminate GMs advantage in a nanosecond by simply partnering with Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>too just like GM did They could push a software update to all existing Teslas and this would no longer be Teslas Achilles heel But will Tesla do it Will they cut a deal with Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Can they There are no signs other than Teslas official word which is no GM put together two ads for the Volt targeting Toyota Prius and Nissan LEAF owners I think thats a total misreading of the market and a major mistake Once you have had a chance to spend some time behind the wheel of these cars youll realize that the Volt has a better chance at taking share from Tesla than from Nissan LEAF or Toyota Prius Of course all of these cars take some share away from everyone else but relatively speaking I think Chevrolet is focusing its marketing in the wrong direction Why make the consumer believe that the allnew Volt plays in the same league of driver sophistication as Nissan LEAF and Toyota Prius Just look at it inside and out Feel the quality of the materials study the upscale nature of the design and once you realize that only one of these cars has Apple CarPlay and is getting a software upgrade to Android Auto it ought to be clear that the allnew Volt is pointing a lot more in the direction of Tesla The new Volt will not take away all of Teslas sales There remain a few reasons why people would still prefer to pay xx as much for a Tesla It is available with allwheel drive And granted many of the Volts advantages are in the shape of lower costs that may not matter much if at all for the prospective Tesla buyer The Volts entire purchase price isnt too different from the first years depreciation on the Tesla The Volt can be driven anywhere with ease so no inducement to own a second car for longer trips The Volts overall repair costs are likely going to be lower than Tesla especially after the Teslas warranty runs out With those economic advantages not likely factoring in for the person who crossshops the new Volt with the Tesla we are left with the Volt suddenly having caught up and in some cases exceeded the Tesla in terms of luxury appointments If you took away the labels on these two cars and presented them to the novice buyer asking them which is the more expensive car you might get a verdict thats closer to than you would have thought Those favoring the Volt in the sidebyside comparison would point to its richer interior appointments and availability of Apple CarPlay before considering which car is inches easier to park at a minimum lbs lighter and cost anywhere between half and a quarter the Teslas price I can hear the complaints already from the peanut gallery How dare you compare a Chevrolet Volt with a Tesla I will remind everyone what was one of the mostcited arguments in favor of the Model S in the early days But did you drive it yet In this case that argument has come full circle and boomerangs But did you drive the Volt yet Editors Note This article discusses one or more
