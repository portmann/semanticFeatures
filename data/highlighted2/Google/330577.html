the almostterminal Crash of readers have been warned on many occasions thatthe Next Crashis scheduled for this year Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Moments ago as part of the ongoing feud between the FBI and Apple over the question of whether or not the US government should be allowed to have a backdoor hack into every iPhone the Cupertino company filed a page brief in the matter of the search of the seized iPhone As can be seen in the full filing presented below Apple argues that the governments request is unprecedented and violates the companys First Amendment rights This case is not a case about one isolated iPhone Apple said in the filing reiterating previous comments This is not a case about one isolated iPhone Rather this case is about the Department of Justice and the FBI seeking through the courts a dangerous power that Congress and the American people have withheld the ability to force companies like Apple to undermine the basic security and privacy interests of hundreds of millions of individuals around the globe The government demands that Apple create a back door to defeat the encryption on the iPhone making its users most confidential and personal information vulnerable to hackers identity thieves hostile foreign agents and unwarranted government surveillance The All Writs Act first enacted in and on which the government bases its entire case does not give the district court a roving commission to conscript and commandeer Apple in this manner Plum Creek Lumber Co v Hutton Fd th Cir In fact no court has ever authorized what the government now seeks no law supports such unlimited and sweeping use of the judicial process and the Constitution forbids it Thats all great but how is any of this different from the access the NSA already has to all digital communication technology Apple continues There are two important and legitimate interests in this case the needs of law enforcement and the privacy and personal safety interests of the public In furtherance of its law enforcement interests the government had the opportunity to seek amendments to existing law to ask Congress to adopt the position it urges here But rather than pursue new legislation the government backed away from Congress and turned to the courts a forum illsuited to address the myriad competing interests potential ramifications and unintended consequences presented by the governments unprecedented demand And more importantly by invoking terrorism and moving ex parte behind closed courtroom doors the government sought to cut off debate and circumvent thoughtful analysis The order demanded by the government compels Apple to create a new operating systemeffectively a back door to the iPhonethat Apple believes is too dangerous to build Specifically the government would force Apple to create new software with functions to remove security features and add a new capability to the operating system to attack iPhone encryption allowing a passcode to be input electronically This would make it easier to unlock the iPhone by brute force trying thousands or millions of passcode combinations with the speed of a modern computer In short the government wants to compel Apple to create a crippled and insecure product Once the process is created it provides an avenue for criminals and foreign agents to access millions of iPhones And once developed for our government it is only a matter of time before foreign governments demand the same tool And why Apple just says no for now The government says Just this once and Just this phone But the government knows those statements are not true indeed the government has filed multiple other applications for similar orders some of which are pending in other courts And as news of this Courts order broke last week state and local officials publicly declared their intent to use the proposed operating system to open hundreds of other seized devicesin cases having nothing to do with terrorism If this order is permitted to stand it will only be a matter of days before some other prosecutor in some other important case before some other judge seeks a similar order using this case as precedent Once the floodgates open they cannot be closed and the device security that Apple has worked so tirelessly to achieve will be unwound without so much as a congressional vote As Tim Cook Apples CEO recently noted Once created the technique could be used over and over again on any number of devices In the physical world it would be the equivalent of a master key capable of opening hundreds of millions of locksfrom restaurants and banks to stores and homes No reasonable person would find that acceptable Whatever the ultimate outcome expect much more drama in this tragicomic case study of a marketing campaign one which seeks to portray AAPL as a defender of personal privacy right How do we know this is one big farce Because moments ago both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and FaceBook the biggest abusers of private information filed motions supporting Apple Thu Syrin Definitely Until the IRS audits them into bankruptcy The Nazis wish they had access to tech like this Our govt is the modern day Nazis Thu Anopheles Why do you think Apple keeps almost all of their billion in cash overseas outside of the country The government cant touch that cash The way Apple has it structured they also have difficulty in bringing that cash back into the US without giving most of it to the government as tax Thu Beam Me Up Scotty Why do they need a backdoor into the iphone Isnt this about simply unlocking his phone bypassing the security thumbprint I thought the courts already had the ability to subpeona information like this Or is this truly much more Orwellian Yup its like we all knowits MUCH MORE Orwellian Thu CPL They gave up their rights as a single corporate entity as soon as the laws passed All their base are belong to the government No one gives a fuck what they say If they really had an opinion they should have fought BEFORE the laws passed worldwide Here are their legal options at the moment Nothing Zero Nada Zlich They signed away their rights Not some of them either They gave away all of them if they go review all four pieces of legislation They literally gave away all of their IP to the government Again if they wanted something different they shouldnt have followed the herd or sold their own customers down the river Thu BigRedRider Thu gatorengineer and what makes you think that Appl hasnt been doing this for years sorry APPL MSFT GOOG FB are subsidaries of the MIC to think otherwise is foolish Thu KirkNCC In a previous ZH article it was mentioned near the end that Apple might work on an iPhone that even they couldnt crack Uhm I think we already HAD that It was called a Blackberry from Canada Thu TradingIsLifeBrah Apple is exposing this government for its lies I expect Apple to feel the governments wrath for this one Shareholders should be worried citizens should be cheering and supporting Apple on this battle Thu Dr Engali Apple didnt realize they had that much in common with Trump They are both getting free publicity peddling fiction and theyre both a great distraction Thu BuddyEffed Free publicity Hell no More probable that those corporations with weak security and back doors and trap doors might be trying to weaken apples strong position and good reputation Thu Dr Engali For Gods sake man you dont really belive this is legit do you Apple sold its soul to the government long ago Thu BuddyEffed I suspect some corporations took pieces of silver or of gov cash in the past to provide back doors but not apple At first back doors were hidden code exploits if you knew where to look and those were highly kept secrets And then multiple encryption keys were likely added when encrypting got popular where any of the keys could be used to decrypt As the OS got bigger and with any new version more exploits could be hidden and you could get rid of old exploits just in case they had been compromised Ive been in the belly of the beast and I do have a very educated opinion Crypto is on my resume along with Secret Thu Pheonyte All previous iPhones can now be sodomized by the Feds But our new iPhone is superduper encrypted Get yours now Thu Helena BonhamCarter Doesnt the government know about how dangerous this shit will be Of course not when Stuxnet got loose they STFU Hamfisted statists that have an appetite for power No wonder this case came to the forefront They thought since this one was fresh in the publics mind that they would jump on board Thu me or you Thu mcmc Bill Gates says Apple is full of it Breaking into an iPhone is like cutting a ribbon httpwwwftcomcmssfedcefddfehtmlaxzz It is no different than the question of should anybody ever have been able to tell the phone company to get information should anybody be able to get at bank records Lets say the bank had tied a ribbon round the disk drive and said Dont make me cut this ribbon because youll make me cut it many times Thu pods Pods That Windows atrocity will finally sink the ship though Talk about security Thu Beam Me Up Scotty Thu Syrin Bill Gates gave us Zika and is trying to bankrupt America for global frauding Bill Gates cock smoking socialist ass bag Thu TradingIsLifeBrah Thu Helena BonhamCarter Glad for only so long a term as he did persist ignorance in why its makers did name it so Thu Chuckster Mr Apple is in for a rude awakening Oh lord its hard to be humbled when your so successful in every way These people been living in ivory towersnow they get to face what some of the rest of us have had to put up with GeeI wonder how much he gave Hillary But why waste an opportunity on Apple the biggest tax evader in the world Congress is going to fuck Tim Cook up the ass and not the way he likes it Big gummamint has time and endless cash and if you fuck around with their tax system they will fuck you back X harder as Tim Cook is about to find out Thu dexter_morgan Unfortunately likely to soon be moot Once we have the lefty righty court this will wind up there and who wants to bet THAT court will take Appless side Regardless of who appoints out of current crop of potential nominators none is likely to find a strict constitutionalist that would uphold the th amendment Fourth Amendment The Rights of the People The Rights of the people to be SECURE in their persons houses papers and effects against UNREASONABLE searches and seizures shall not be violated no Warrant shall issue but upon probable cause supported by Oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized Cruz Carson and Trump along with all the other republicans are siding with the government So much for personal liberty Thu TradingIsLifeBrah People quote Bill Gates because he says Apple should comply Microsoft embedded an assistant called Cortana into all of its operating systems phone and computers and then created a video game of Halo in which Cortana was the villain and tried to destroy all of humanity What are they trying to tell us Thu Bennie Noakes I wonder whether the FBI is at all worried that some of the tens of millions of Americans who oppose the request might simply refuse to convict if ever serving on a jury in a case involving the FBI Rona BarrettbornRona Burstein October New York City is an American gossip columnist and businesswoman She currently runs the Rona Barrett Foundation a nonprofit
