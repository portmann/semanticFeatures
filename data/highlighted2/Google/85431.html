Amazon and Nordstrom are using for growth Sometimes its difficult to consider Amazon NASDAQ AMZN a retail business because it has attempted to position itself as a tech company rather than the warehousedistribution company it actually is So when I compare my outlook for Nordstrom NYSE JWN against Amazon it may be hard for some to think of it as an apple and apple comparison because it has initiated numerous projects outside of its core competency which gives the appearance of a multifaceted company but cant hide the fact its basically a retail distribution company Nordstrom is of course easily recognizable as a retail company and Ill show in this article why they are more predictable and steady over the long term than the adventurous Amazon which still tries to extend itself far beyond its core business at the expense of its earnings free cash flow and consistency In the short term Nordstrom will be under some pressure because of its growth strategy which it has committed several billion dollars to over the next several years So while it will have some pressure there it is financing its growth through its cash flow and not adding to its debt something Amazon isnt participating in Overall Ill show why Amazon is much more vulnerable to a downturn than Nordstrom is and why Nordstrom will do better as it solidifies its foundation for future growth First well look at Amazon A couple of weeks ago Amazon announced it was going to hire over fulltime workers for its fulfillment centers in the US citing rising demand Early in June it also said it was going to hire another workers for its fulfillment centers in California This doesnt include the announcement it made concerning hiring workers for its first PC game Its possible the billion in free cash flow will pay for part of this hiring spree although thats not a given It depends on if there is something else it wants to throw capital at and if it decides to do it through debt or cash flow My concern is where Amazon is getting its justification for hiring this many new employees It stated it is coming from demand and yet there hasnt been much to show that is the case Its possible the latest report on US retail sales reflects a boost in Amazons retail unit as they increased by percent in May after a weak percent gain in April While that points to Amazon getting the benefit of some of that spending it certainly couldnt be the impetus behind hiring over new workers for its fulfillment centers in the US It could also be a move to boost its brand image which has been under pressure in Europe concerning anticompetitive practices and in the US for worker conditions and wages At this time it appears its probably a combination of both that has caused the company to add to its retail work force Ill wait to see the next couple of retail sales reports before I conclude growth is a part of the hiring process If it slows down again my conclusion is the hiring is to primarily strengthen its brand If consumers are again loosening up their wallets than it is a positive catalyst for Amazon one that will likely move its share price higher in the short term Why does this concern me as to motivation behind the number of new hires Remember the robots Bezos boasted about in There is also the recent robotics conference hosted by Amazon where it had a competition to see which robot could best pick orders While theyre not ready yet if we are fairly close to getting driverless cars on the road it wont be as difficult to successfully design robots that can successfully pick products at or near percent levels Sizes and colors appear to be the challenge left to be conquered The point is while Amazon is hiring it seems to be at the same time sending a message to those that are attempting to pressure or force it into paying higher wages and better benefits With it struggling on the profit side since it launched this is something that investors will have to watch closely over time I dont believe Amazon as it is now could survive a major increase in wages and benefits to human employees The latest numbers for Amazon especially with its free cash flow resulted in it getting an immediate boost to its market cap of billion after its earnings report was circulated Thats concerning because there is absolutely nothing in the report and its past performance that can justify that type of increase Of course investors have done this so you could say they consider Amazon having the ability to generate significant future earnings and cash flow I dont consider that outlook approaching reality and Ill show you why First lets look at net income for Amazon It has been quarters in a row since Amazon last posted an earnings gain and that was in third quarter of when it generated billion in earnings In the latest quarter it had a loss of million yearoveryear The last time it performed that poorly was in the last quarter of Over the longer term it isnt much better In the last decade it has only produced earnings of billion Thats on revenue of approximately billion That means on average over the last years Amazon generated million annually on revenue of about billion a year For some unknown reason the market has chosen to reward it with a value at X earnings and a market cap over billion It boggles the mind and sends up red flags What about free cash flow Is that any better Not to me While it did come in at a little under billion in its latest quarter that brings the company being valued at X free cash flow Again I cant see anything that can justify that valuation While it paraded that number more than any other it also added it was up percent over the same reporting period the prior year The problem is that came in at a time when it was at the bottom of a downward move Finally when looking at the end of free cash flow for Amazon stood at billion That means the annual rate of growth for free cash flow over the last five years has been under percent It also looks like earnings and free cash flow will remain under pressure as the EU is scrutinizing the tax practices of Amazon in the region and it has already agreed to change its practices in some countries and will probably do so in all countries in the region which will increase its tax burden Taxes are also increasing in the US as it adds to the number of states it has fulfillment centers in physical presence and also data warehouses The latest state it has agreed to collect sales taxes in is Ohio which it is doing voluntarily although it was almost a surety it would have had to in the near future This is going to be a growing burden on Amazon and in light of its weak longterm performance will need to find answers or its going to take a big hit in my opinion Nordstrom has a goal of increasing its revenue from just under billion annually as of the latest earnings report to over billion by This is the major narrative for Nordstrom and what investors with a longterm outlook need to look at To achieve that the company will have to add new customers and improve its crossshopping strategy To add to its sales with existing customers it will have to continue to offer more merchandise on a timely basis Thats the new reality for fashion retailers like Nordstrom and it has been doing a good job of that over time And as mentioned it will have to make improvements on its crossshopping outlets to increase sales there That also has been doing well As for new customers a lot of that will come from its foray into Canada which the company sees as ultimately being a billion dollar market It is also opening a couple of new stores in the US as well as San Juan Puerto Rico These will be a nice addition to its revenue momentum which as of last quarter was up percent over the same quarter last year reaching billion As for comparable sales that was up a decent percent led by its Nordstromcom website which gained percent and its offprice Internet sales up percent yearoveryear Nordstroms EPS did drop in the most recent quarter coming in at down from yearoveryear That was from Nordstroms increasing presence in Canada and the acquisition of Trunk Club Without that earnings would have been a little on the positive side before taxes Im not concerned about this at all because the steps being taken and strategy implemented is resulting in solid growth for the retailer According to CFO Michael G Koppel investments in HauteLook Trunk Club and Canada has boosted sales by million in the first quarter Concerning Rack growth there has been very good as the company has plans to open another stores in this quarter Another are planned to be opened in fall season Rack comps were slightly down by percent but maintains its outlook of comps ending the year with growth in the low singledigit range To better serve its customers it is also building a new fulfillment center in Pennsylvania in the fall Guidance for earnings and revenue were maintained by the company with expectations of to in yearly earnings and revenue growth in a range of percent to percent for the year On the capital expenditure side the company will spend about billion which amounts to approximately percent of sales Of that the company plans to spend about billion or percent in Manhattan and Canada Koppel added that those two projects are viewed as extremely important calling them generational investments which have the potential to significantly add to the value of the Nordstrom brand and boost markets share He sees them being a major impetus to gain market share for several decades About percent of its growth plan will include expenditures on opening new stores and reinvestment The remaining percent of CapEx over the next five years will be spend on fulfillment and technology which it has a goal of creating synergies in the entire business Thats a reference to providing a seamless experience across a variety of sales channels In the short term meaning CapEx will have more of an impact on earnings with that decreasing after coming down to under percent of sales Along with new stores in Canada and Manhattan and the Pennsylvania fulfillment center the company also has plans to remodel a few of its flagship stores The importance of all of this to me is Nordstrom has been able to continue to grow while it is putting its foundation for future growth into place That speaks of brand strength and good management I dont see anything that will change that in the short or long term I like how Nordstrom is positioning itself for ongoing and sustainable growth long into the future Once is over and the stores and fulfillment center are operational it should bring about a major growth spurt that could last for many years Add to that the fact the costs of that strategy will continue to fall and the company has a good plan in place to retain its brand strength and I see this as a good business to invest in and hold for the long haul Amazon must start to show it is committed to profits and quit acting like its a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>or Apple wannabe It may have an Internet ordering system but its still primarily a warehouse retail distributor Until it accepts that and quits throwing shareholders money carelessly around with little in the way of a coherent strategy its going to continue to struggle with earnings and free cash flow The new tax pressure and additional workforce make it very difficult to see how Amazon is going to improve its performance What I do like concerning Amazon is its Amazon Prime service which I see as the most important part of company growth Thats because it is highly valued by its customers and they spend far beyond the nonPrime member The churn is also fairly low which means its one of the few constants that can be counted on from quarter to quarter by the giant retailer But even here the company had to increase its price because of higher delivery costs Also a factor is its Prime Instant Video service which it has to continually pay out to produce its own content and to pay for content from other media companies The importance of its video streaming service is it helps to keep churn at a manageable level When looking at a year chart for Amazon and Nordstrom it would seem crazy to choose Nordstrom over Amazon for the future But Amazon is a lot of smoke and mirrors and is very prone to move off its core business to throw a lot of capital at dubious ventures The longterm weakness of earnings and anemic free cash flow confirm to me it will eventually have to be more particular and careful about what it chooses to invest in I understand the marketing value of making the seemingly endless announcement of new projects its undertaking or acquiring but it is doing so at the expense of meaningful profitability Until shareholders pressure management to become more cautious with their money I dont see this changing Thats why it will remain a volatile company that will suffer significantly with its share price when the next downturn comes Nordstrom on the other hand is positioned for more visible and consistent growth It has a very clear strategy and amount its going to spend to achieve its goals which I believe it will reach over the next several years I also like the fact it is aware of and responding to the demand for a constant introduction of new products to its mix That is the key for retail fashion stores and those that get it right will continue to outperform those that are slow to respond For example it has brought brands like Brandy Melville Tilbury and Madewell to its stores and customers have responded strongly to them With a projected revenue growth goal of about percent to over billion in less than five years I see Nordstrom outperforming Amazon Not only that but I see the market catching on to the weakness of Amazon and when it underperforms and is identified as such it will be hit hard That is certainly going to happen more than one quarter over the next several years which is another reason I see Nordstrom being the better performing company during that period of time Source Why Nordstrom
