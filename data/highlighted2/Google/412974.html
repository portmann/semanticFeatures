class='textDiv'>Apple Googles Project Ara Shows That iPhone Got It Right Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Googles Project Ara promised the ability to mix and match module components to build a customized smartphone Ara represents an inappropriate application of PC concepts and will probably never reach consumers Project Ara is Alphabets NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL development project for a modular smartphone that promised expandability and upgradeability In its latest incarnation announced at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>IO Ara backs off considerably from those promises In fact Ara highlights the wisdom of Apple NASDAQ AAPL in going the opposite direction with iPhone Ara also underscores Apples unique advantage in controlling the design of both its hardware and software Ara is a project in Googles Advanced Technology and Projects ATAP group which had its origins in Motorola and was kept after Motorola was sold to Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY Starting in Ara was developed by Paul Eremenko who had worked at DARPA as had the manager of ATAP Regina Dugan In the initial concepts Ara smartphone would consist of a frame with a data bus to connect various modules The modules could include processors batteries cameras etc Modules were easily removable and the user could mix or match to customize the phone Its a cool concept but just looking at the picture the reader can probably spot some obvious shortcomings Ara is bulky and thats necessitated by not only the frame but also the modules which are fully enclosed This means that Ara caries around a lot of excess packaging bulk and weight Theres also an underlying technical challenge Having all modules share a common data bus even the very high speed bus Gbitsec of Ara isnt necessarily optimal Modern smartphone SOCs such as those designed by Apple use multiple data buses to interface to high data rate devices such as RAM flash storage cameras and display screens Maintaining separate dedicated interfaces for these peripherals seems to be the right answer At least its the answer that has been universally adopted in the industry The challenges of making the shared bus work apparently led to a major rearchitecting of Ara as announced this year at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>IO In the latest version base components such as the SOC battery position sensors and the display will all be integrated into the frame The data bus will only be used for accessories such as cameras and speakers In Ara was expressed a longing for the PC paradigm of standard expansion interfaces like PCIe a vast hardware ecosystem of addon devices and the ability to customize and upgrade the computing device Along with the promises of the PC paradigm came all the downside difficulty in developing drivers for the disparate hardware and basic reliability issues When a device was shown at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>IO it failed to boot Having embraced so many aspects of the commodity PC business model in Android the appeal of ARA was an understandable extension It was however completely inappropriate for the mobile device market where the premium is on compactness durability and reliability From the beginning Apple understood what would be important in a smartphone Prior to iPhone Apple had a business model in search of a product Apples business model for computing devices was to control the operating system and hardware design thereby assuring presumably the best user experience Applied to personal computers the model was only partly successful Apple commanded a small but loyal following who saw value in Apples approach but for most computers the commodity model was sufficient In smartphones Apple found the perfect application of its business model Consumers werent terribly interested in tinkering with their smartphones The physical size of the devices limited the interfaces that could be used mostly USB derived ports and flash card readers Consumers upgrading mostly from feature phones when iPhone was introduced in did have very high expectations for reliability It just works became the mantra of iPhone marketing But iPhone was light years ahead of other smartphones at the time presenting the user with what amounted to a miniature PC For many the experience of a PC that just worked was new The reliability of the iPhone has been part and parcel to its ability to command a premium price and its share of the smartphone industry profits It was Apples control of its operating system application software and hardware design that enabled that reliability Apple is the only smartphone maker that does develop both its operating system and its hardware down to the processor design I often get asked Why is that an advantage The best answer I can give is an engineering answer that may not satisfy nontechnical readers Integrating hardware and software is hard Back when I was working in aerospace system integration bringing together software and hardware was always the most difficult phase of a program Having control of hardware and software as Apple does both makes that process easier and assures a better quality outcome Even now iOS is much more reliable and iOS apps crash less frequently than Android Control of hardware and software also has allowed Apple to introduce apps and functionality that iOS users take for granted every day iCloud iMessage and Facetime are just some examples Given the problems Android still has with reliability and fragmentation I doubt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>will ever take the risk of unleashing Ara on an unsuspecting world It represents a paradigm for which theres probably no market in mobile devices And it would be a Pandoras Box of reliability problems Is it any wonder that Paul Eremenko has left <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Ara behind to start a new research lab for Airbus OTCPKEADSF Investors should still be concerned that Apple is not sufficiently leveraging its advantage in hardwaresoftware integration Apple needs to do a better job of educating the general public about its innovations in both hardware especially SOCs and software I get so tired of hearing that Apple is no longer innovative Theres also the problem that the greater reliability of Apple products afforded by its systems integration expertise isnt readily apparent at the store counter Apple needs to bring forward more cutting edge features that consumers can see instore Apples iOS split screen feature should have been on iPhone since the s was introduced As I have pointed out and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>IO has confirmed this feature will soon be available on new Android phones Im cautiously optimistic that well see more innovation in iPhone than is expected by Apple bears I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy for investors with a year investment
