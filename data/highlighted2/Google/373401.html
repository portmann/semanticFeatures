class='textDiv'>Stick With Best Of Breed Stocks Seconds Usually Dont Pan Out Seeking Alpha Leaders in the industry might maintain above average valuations but they also maintain above average growth Buying a lowervalued stock in the same industry wont ensure success Investing in companies that are considered the best of breed or industry leaders is smart momentum investing This strategy is not blindly buying a stock because it increased significantly recently Investing in best of breed stocks involves careful analysis of a companys business and where it likely headed This also involves avoiding similar companies in the same industry that are not likely to achieve the success of the industry leaders Investors can get caught in a value trap by merely looking at valuation metrics and not thinking clearly about where a business is likely to go Investors can get a false sense of hope by having a contrarian viewpoint on an inferior company that will never achieve nearly what the industry leader has and will in the future To avoid such a trap many investors choose to own an index fund or broadmarket ETF to reduce risk However other investors enjoy picking individual stocks in an attempt to achieve higher returns One solid strategy for picking individual winners is to invest in proven industry leaders These are companies that are clearly the front runners in their industry in terms of sustainable revenue and earnings growth I would also choose industry leaders that sustain positive operating and free cash flow When a company consistently grows free cash flow dividend payments and stock repurchase plans can be sustained and increased This is beneficial to shareholders since their dividends grow over time The buybacks are beneficial as they help to boost EPS and reduce dilution thus making existing shares more valuable Industry leaders could also be in a high growth phase and not yet pay dividends However these high growth companies will use cash flow to expand the business In this case think Facebook NASDAQ FB as the industry leader and Twitter NYSE TWTR as the less desirable investment If you think about and compare Facebooks business with Twitters business it is easy to see that Facebook is the better investment Users spend an average of over minutes per day on Facebook while Twitter users spend an average of minutes per day on the site Those aged to spend an average of minutes per day on Facebook Facebook is still able to grow its daily user base at strong double digit rates beyond billion people Twitters user growth has been leveling off when looking quartertoquarter Twitter ended with about million MAUs which was the same figure that the company reported at the end of September So Twitter is suffering from busted growth and that has shown in the declining stock price Investors might mistakenly like Twitter over Facebook for valuation reasons Twitter has a lower valuation with a forward PE of and PEG of while Facebook has a forward PE of and a PEG of However Facebook has the higher market share growth in the amount of users So investors are willing to bid up the stock price for its industry leading performance Investors are better off owning Facebook as the industry leader The company has superior user growth with higher average time spent on the site Those metrics are important for attracting advertisers Facebook is continuing to grow its advertising revenue at a strong pace The company achieved revenue growth yearoveryear on a constant currency basis for I think that Facebook will continue to grow at a strong pace especially since WhatsApp represents a user base of over billion which will be monetized in the future Another example of an industry leader is Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL vs an industry laggard Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO Yahoo had its IPO in while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>went public in Yahoo did have a great run in the s but never fully recovered after the dotcom bubble burst Investors have put more emphasis on rewarding companies with quality revenue and earnings growth after the dotcom era If we just look at the past five years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>increased revenue at strong doubledigit rates reaching about billion for Yahoos revenue stagnated over the same period and failed to rise above billion If we think about Alphabets and Yahoos businesses it becomes clearer who the industry leader is Investors should have compared search market share growth between the two companies Googles market share increased steadily while Yahoo experienced a decline The term <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>officially became a verb back in when the Oxford English Dictionary and the MerriamWebster Collegiate Dictionary added the term as a verb That says a lot about the popularity and industry leader status of Googles search business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>attracts advertising revenue because it has the highest market share for search in the industry To increase your chances of picking winning stocks over time carefully analyze similar businesses The industry leaders may have higher valuations than others in the industry but if they have superior market share revenue and earnings growth they are likely to continue to outperform If you like my analysis
