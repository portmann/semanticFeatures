long held short positions the Comex Banks have now issued enough new contracts to drive total open interest back to levels not seen since Will they be successful in Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Update The Senate just got involved As ABC News report Senator John Thune has sent letter to Facebook seeking information on alleged manipulation of news curation As we detailed earlier in response to allegations from former Facebook staff that they censored rightwing just not liberal enough news stories in the social networks feed the man who is responsible for Facebooks Trending Topics has issued a statement directly refuting the claims of biases As TechCrunch noted an earlier statement by Facebook that Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin and weve designed our tools to make that technically not feasible At the same time our reviewers actions are logged and reviewed and violating our guidelines is a fireable offense left it unclear whether any contractors hired to curate the trend had potentially violated those rules My team is responsible for Trending Topics and I want to address todays reports alleging that Facebook contractors manipulated Trending Topics to suppress stories of interest to conservatives We take these reports extremely seriously and have found no evidence that the anonymous allegations are true Facebook is a platform for people and perspectives from across the political spectrum There are rigorous guidelines in place for the review team to ensure consistency and neutrality These guidelines do not permit the suppression of political perspectives Nor do they permit the prioritization of one viewpoint over another or one news outlet over another These guidelines do not prohibit any news outlet from appearing in Trending Topics Trending Topics is designed to showcase the current conversation happening on Facebook Popular topics are first surfaced by an algorithm then audited by review team members to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not for example similarsounding topics or misnomers We are proud that in the US election was the most talkedabout subject on Facebook and we want to encourage that robust political discussion from all sides We have in place strict guidelines for our trending topic reviewers as they audit topics surfaced algorithmically reviewers are required to accept topics that reflect real world events and are instructed to disregard junk or duplicate topics hoaxes or subjects with insufficient sources Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin and weve designed our tools to make that technically not feasible At the same time our reviewers actions are logged and reviewed and violating our guidelines is a fireable offense There have been other anonymous allegations for instance that we artificially forced BlackLivesMatter to trend We looked into that charge and found that it is untrue We do not insert stories artificially into trending topics and do not instruct our reviewers to do so Our guidelines do permit reviewers to take steps to make topics more coherent such as combining related topics into a single event such as starwars andmaythefourthbewithyou to deliver a more integrated experience Our review guidelines for Trending Topics are under constant review and we will continue to look for improvements We will also keep looking into any questions about Trending Topics to ensure that people are matched with the stories that are predicted to be the most interesting to them and to be sure that our methods are as neutral and effective as possible As TechCrunch concludes Stockys explanation suggests that Gizmodos sources may have exaggerated the claims Its possible that what was perceived as suppression may have been shortcomings of the algorithm or hesitation to display Trends based on news outlets not deemed to be credible So to be clear another entity accused of wrongdoing has undertaken an internal review and found no evidence of wrongdoing However the report has already done significant damage to Facebooks reputation with conservatives and increased fears that it manipulates the world Even if its records show no evidence of tampering with Trends the perception of bias could haunt the company through the election season Tue HedgeAccordingly That was funny Facebook is full of it Whats funny is they censor political posts yet let extremists recruit young people At least Twitter cleaned up the extremist accounts httphedgeaccordinglycomexpertterroristsyoungerbecauseof Tue D Nyle Facebook <span style='background-color:

There is no reason a private company cannot do whatever they want with their own product If they want to censor purple people eaters from Facebook they have the right to do so There should almost

media company Does social media include news reporting I dont know It could but like any private media source it has its biases just like the NY Times Huff Post Rolling Stone and many many others SHould Congress tell the NY Times not to exclude conservative opinion also People just will find out for themselves if they are attracted to more leftleaning or more rightleaning news and that should include their views of Facebook FB can do what they want Tue kennyc Tue Peacefulwarrior AMEN to that try posting a negative on Clinton policy EX the Repealing of GlassSteagal and watch the paid for
