Fundamental Look At Disney And Its Competitors And Why Disney Is A Buy The Walt Disney Company NYSEDIS Seeking Alpha Sep PM ET About The Walt Disney Company DIS Includes CBS CMCSA FOXA LGF TWX VIAB by Suyog Dahal Markets are down over presenting a great opportunity to add to your portfolio Fundamentally Disney still in line with industry averages but is set to grow earnings quicker Disney has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry and a strong portfolio of content as catalysts for perspective investors Disney NYSE DIS stock has been on a tear over the last years gaining over before the recent selloff Investors have loved CEO Bob Iger and Disneys acquisition of quality brands including Marvel and Lucasfilm Disneys latest mixed earnings release combined with the recent market sell off presents a great opportunity for prospective investors to buy shares or for current shareholders to build on their positions I have been looking to add a media entertainment company to my portfolio so I decided to fundamentally analyze of the major media entertainment companies The companies I researched were The Walt Disney Company Viacom NASDAQ VIAB Comcast Corporation NASDAQ CMCSA CBS Corporation NYSE CBS st Century Fox NASDAQ FOXA TimeWarner NYSE TWX and Lionsgate NYSE LGF I compiled the annual and quarterly results of each company as well as analysts projections for future Revenues and EPS from Yahoo Finance Using this data I determined the Enterprise Value EV of each company and calculated EVRevenues EVEBITDA the Enterprise Multiple EVEBIT PE and PEG multiples Here are my results Note that I used the total shares disclosed on the latest SEC filings for each companies share count Figures on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Finance or Yahoo Finance may differ and may not accurately reflect the total diluted share count Prices used reflect prices at market close on September From the chart above youll see that Disney trades at the highest PriceEarnings ratio compared to the other media conglomerates Lionsgate a studio focused business is the only company of these that trades at a higher PE ratio Disneys PEG ratio is also slightly higher than its competitors at using the sector growth rate of indicating that Disneys PE is growing quicker than the company itself EVRevenues EVR EVEBITDA and EVEBIT are multiples that are used to assess the financial health of public companies usually as potential acquisition targets or to compare potential investments EVR similar to the PriceSales multiple is normally dismissed because it is not profit related but it is a reliable comparison tool The median EVR across the entire US market is x but varies widely by industry Top decile of firms have EVRevenues that exceed x with the bottom decile have ratios under x Generally companies with a lower EVR are seen as more valuable because their revenue stream can be acquired for less money The median EVR multiple among these media companies is x with an average of x Disneys multiple of x puts it slightly above the rest of this group EVEBITDA better known as the Enterprise multiple and EVEBIT is where Disney looks more attractive The Enterprise multiple looks at a company through the eyes of potential acquirers including company debt Not at all likely for these firms but a good analytical tool The average Enterprise Multiple among these companies is x High growth companies tend to have higher enterprise multiples that slower growth companies as evident with Lionsgates multiple of x and Comcasts multiple of x Disney has an Enterprise Multiple of x higher than Comcast Viacom CBS Fox and Time Warner showing Disney to be a higher growth company than its competitors EVEBITDA is useful as a growth and cash flow type comparison as it ignores the noncash expenses of depreciation and amortization which can differ as not all conglomerates are built the same However as an investor EVEBIT may be more useful Some investors actually prefer EVEBIT to PE because it includes important balance sheet information like net debt and compares firms profits while ignoring tax differences Disneys EVEBIT multiple is x in line with the industry average of x But Disney is growing revenues and earnings more quickly than the rest of the industry as can be seen in Disneys forecasted years and its EVEBITDA multiple making Disney a more attractive investment than its competitors Fundamentally Disney is in line with industry averages using these multiples In addition Analysts have forecasted Disneys revenues and earnings to grow at a greater rate than the rest of the industry which makes Disney an attractive investment This anticipated growth is likely why Disney trades at a slight premium over its competitors in terms of PE However Disney also has numerous catalysts in its favor throughout the next few years including at least five Star Wars films nine Marvel films and four Pixar films that have already been announced It also has planned expansions to its Walt Disney World parks in OrlandoFL and its parks in Asia This combined with steadily increasing park ticket prices and park attendance makes Disney a valuable stock to buy at current prices Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this
