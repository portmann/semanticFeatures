Just Occurred To Me Trump Proposes Boycott Of Apple While Tweeting From An iPhone Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Authored by Steve H Hanke of The Johns Hopkins University Follow him on Twitter Steve_Hanke On Thursday Venezuelas central bank released a longoverdue and littletrusted report claiming Now that you know what really affects price you should be able to control your emotions both on upticks and downswings Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Moments after AAPL announced on Wednesday that it would not comply with FBI demands to hack into its phone Donald Trump was already arguing vehemently that Apple should help investigators crack the phones encryption system To think that Apple wont allow us to get into her cell phone Trump said on Fox and Friends Wednesday morning Who do they think they are No we have to open it up Apple this is one case this is a case that certainly we should be able to get into the phone he said And we should find out what happened why it happened and maybe theres other people involved and we have to do that I agree with the courts the mogul added In that case we should open it up I think security over all we have to open it up and we have to use our heads We have to use common sense And then moments ago during a campaign event in Pawleys Island South Carolina Trump had an epiphany It just occurred to me His solution a boycott of Apple Inc products until the tech giant agrees to US government demands that it unlock the cellphone of the San Bernardino killer Boycott Apple until they give up the information Trump said The phone is owned by the government Tim Cook is looking to do a big number probably to show how liberal he is Apple should give up The billionaires call to action followed an interview with Bloomberg in which he offered harsh words for Cook Tim Cook is living in the world of the make believe Trump said Friday in a telephone interview I would come down so hard on him you have no idea his head would be spinning all of the way back to Silicon Valley I think Tim Cook is totally out of line and I think the government should come down on Tim Cook very very hard Trump said in the interview Friday I think its a disgrace what he is doing were talking about lives potentially thousands of lives and we should find out who else was involved in the plot where people were killed It was unclear initially it Trump had a specific cell phone company as an alternatives or if this was all part of a grand marketing ploy by Tim Cook to get Trumps opponents to rush out and purchase iPhones in retaliation We will keep an eye on channels checks over the next few days for the answer Update less than an hour later Trump appears to have realized his error by tweeting from a Googlebased platform the same <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>which supports Apple in its fight with the government Fri Kreditanstalt Fri The Juggernaut Fri ToSoftTruth Fri OrangeJews If they use say ATT they can get the phone numbers from the phone company Emails I havent heard of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>or Yahoo in the news not giving up Email accounts This just doesnt make sense Fri Say What Again This is almost as good as the KonYeah tweet to zucerberg to fund his projects As a reminder Zuckerberg runs FaceBook Fri Zoomorph Dead Islamic terrorists have no rights No right to privacy The government owns their phone and should use it if it helps catch their accomplices Just like the government can search their house they can search their phone Do ZH commentors seriously disagree with this Are ZHers seriously making this into a big issue and going to stop supporting Trump because of it Isnt immigration the biggest issue of this election Dont we all know that Apple is already in cahoots with the government and this is a publicity stunt on their part ZH has always been antiTrump No coverage of his conspiracy remarks or anything else Only focus on one tiny issue and blow it into something big Typical dishonest reporting We need to open the page document to find out what happened What happens Youll quickly be directed to another candidates website Donald Trumps As it turns out the Bush campaign doesnt own jebbushcom The domain name is owned by a company called Fabulouscom Pty Ltd an Australian company that helps people monetize their internet domain names The site was apparently created on Nov and updated on Oct according to a domain registration search Fri Say What Again He is going to use his Apple to tell everyone to boycott Apple That is the joke here If it is a publicity stunt as you say Trump is buying into it ZH posts all kinds of proTrump stuff too youre the one being dishonest They are neutral to slightly sympathetic but they support no one except Ron Paul They support giving this corrupt system shit they like when Trump does that Fri SirRobin While Im fine with unlocking the phone giving the gov the codes to do it is not part of the deal There is a process for that its called a warrant and if they have one Tim should unlock the phone and give them the data This seems pretty clear Don Don making statements that he will use government resources like a mob boss is not helpful to his conservative position This is inspite of the fact that this is currently standard operating procedure for most agencies Business as usualThe Donald should fit right in Fri Citxmech Fri Demdere Last thing Trump said about that I attended to was the bit about s of dancing Muslims Right after that AIPAC decided Trump was a great guy Presidential debates treated him like an actual candidate and MSM gave him even more time ran his ads free all the time to show the people what Trump was doing The dancers of course were Mossad agents as a result of which we know the names of the Mossad agents who transported and set the explosives in the WTC complex All those buildings were gutted not just the Fri SirRobin Yep Donald has never commented on Audit the Fed the SEC etc its unclear what he really stands for other than his own ego and self promotion In addition to what big players are supporting him to you point Fri Demdere Yes it doesnt make sense That is because the Feds are intentionally confusing different issues so people like Trump say dumb things like that First issue Apple help us get into that phone for reason of national security To which Apple properly says But you see we cant because our very best security people designed and implemented the hardware so that we cant It is a sales point in foreign countries all the places that killed electronic sales because of the backdoors you guys put into everyone elses devices Second issue Apple put a backdoor into your system so that we can see into the phone for reasons of national security Oh yes it would be good to be able to do that at any time without the user knowing To which every security professional says That would be dumb Look at your record of keeping secrets Snowdons most important info was that you guys cant keep secrets we certainly should not assume Snowdon was the first certainly should assume that the Chinese and Russians have read everything Teenagers read your directors email accounts OMBs databases The whole government is vulnerable to hackers and spies and we are supposed to give you more secrets to keep Fri JLee Fri The Saint Why has Trump been on the wrong side of this and other recent brushups Because deep down he isa Clinton liberal with liberal ideas Fri NihilistZero Hes playing the political game The tough talk is his shtick and hes gotta stay on message I doubt Trump sincerely believes any of the truly outlandish things he says The positions page on his website has his tax plan in detail which is spectacular and could get us a step or from repealing the income tax completely on individuals the border security stuff and tradeforeign policy All the rest is window dressing to keep him perpetually in the new cycle Every politician does it Trump just used his existing celebrity to perfect it Wrong Ron Paul never did it Fuck this country for not electing the closest thing we ever had to Cato the Younger Fri ejmoosa Lets see what happens when Trump finds out that Apple has had back doors in for years and taht the feds have always had access Like many Americans he may believe this tragicomedy at the moment But sooner or later we all will see the truth Fri eruth Ill admit he says some stupid things but thats not against the law until IDIOTS make it against the law Fri tmmyBerg Yeah I am actually now looking into buying my first iPhone And also less likely to vote Trump Maybe I will vote for that crazy bastard McAfee Or maybe I just will not vote at all Fri Pheonyte If Trump ever had my vote he didnt hed have just lost it Shove it up your statist ass Donald Fri Say What Again I have no doubt that McAfee and a few of his buddies could crack that phone in less than hours Fri peddlingfiction Fri richinSpirit Fri yellensNIRPles Yeah this fucks with me hardcore I was going to vote for Trump just to tell TPTB to suck it but this is his official embrace of TPTB This is a clear violation of th Amendment rights since what GOV wants is the backdoor to ALL iphones It isnt just about this one phone They can get that information and Apple should give it to them but Apple should NOT be forced to give our government a backdoor to our own security Like many here have warned in the past Trump wants to fuck you before hes even in office and hes finally showing it Bad news Although the concept that any one person can fix our fucked up system is laughable in the first place this is sad I was really truly hoping Trump would get this right but hes screwing the pooch as they say Fri peddlingfiction Fri TradingIsLifeBrah Fri SirRobin Agree its a sad state of affairs The people could have backed Rand but instead choose a former liberal blow hard because they had seen him on their mindless idiot box a few times Run Away Run Away Fri TradingIsLifeBrah Fri Mr Pink Fri Zoomorph ZHers are dumbasses One day theyre proTrump They read a single negative article about him and now theyre all against him Whimsical fools They gobble up whatever Tyler feeds them mostly crappy articles Fri MsCreant ZHers are not all anything If you spend time around here you know that I have been antiTrump all along So have a number of posters here Lots of folks like him too Fri jomama Fri Mr Pink Ill vote for Trump if there is at least a chance he blows the lid off the coverup Fri tmmyBerg Apple is not protecting trash like you only lettered accounts Are you saying that Apple will lose sales selling your info to anyone who pays or only to those Trump inc pays Fri fourZero Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site EUs Tusks spokesperson states there is still no deal on Venezuelas President states that they are sending new
