could bridge the gap Apple has with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Maps and lays the foundation for a potential link with Apple Pay Apple NASDAQ AAPL made some changes to its Maps app after the recent iOS update The most noticeable change is that Apple Maps will allow small business owners to apply and update the points of interests POIs directly inapp through a Report a Problem pane Although it is unclear as to whether AAPL has promoted this update so that small businesses are aware of it I see that crowdsourcing POIs is a smart way for AAPL to update and enhance the content inside Apple Maps thereby allowing the app to be vastly more superior and more importantly accurate than rival <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Maps NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Improving user experience will likely to be AAPLs nearterm objective in opening Apple Maps to crowdsourcing with the mediumterm objective adding transactional services for small business owners by drawing them onto the Apple Pay network Longterm speaking I believe that locationbased advertising and onlinetooffline transactions will likely to be on the agenda Given AAPLs iPhone will likely continue to face challenges in terms of exceeding consumer expectations and that rivals such as Samsung Xiaomi Lenovo and Huawei are gradually moving up the value chain AAPLs market share and the fate of the iOS ecosystem will be at risk While much of the attention has shifted to the Apple Watch and the probable Apple TV see Apple Is WebTV Addressing An Ecosystem Risk it is worth noting that both products are hardware that will eventually be commoditized by lowcost leaders with their unique ecosystems To address the ecosystem and hardware risk building up its mapping service allows AAPL to potentially diversify away from the iPhone and into mobile advertising which is expected to reach b by according to eMarketer I remain bearish on Apple mainly on the hardware risk However I also believe that faster than expected rampup of Apple Maps merchant POIs and Apple Pay could be a catalyst for the stock price A small tweak for Apple a giant leap into mobile ads With the iOS release small business owners have the ability to update POIs within Apple Maps after verifying the business in question A specialist in Apple would review the update and assuming it is accurate the map will be updated accordingly This feature is an offshoot of Map Connect that Apple rolled out last year to build its map aggregation service This is vastly superior to traditional POI collection by map content makers in that it can deliver timely and accurate updates to the users In the near term updating the map with the most accurate info will allow AAPL to achieve a better user experience compared to that of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Maps Being an iPhone user who also has the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Maps app I often find that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Maps delivers more relevant location search and POIs than AAPL so clearly AAPL needs to catch up In the medium term I expect AAPL to embed Apple Pay into merchant locations so the user can purchase an item or book a restaurant via Apple Maps using Apple Pay This is a logical extension for AAPL and should even be encouraged in that it does not require an NFC terminal which can be partially blamed for the lackluster AAPL rollout While the amount of transactions that can be done over Apple Maps may be limited to restaurants hotels flights small goods and appointment setups I believe this is likely to change over time as the Apple Maps user base reaches a critical mass In the long term mobile advertising is the elephant in the room for AAPL Within the mobile ads space local ads is expected to be one of the faster growth verticals and AAPL could leverage its map services merchant relationships and Apple Pay to allow small business owners to advertise via search results push notification locationbased advertising andor locationbased promotion The idea is to have local merchants advertise on Apple Maps by notifying a user of an ongoing promotion and offer a discount to the user if the user purchases the promotion via Apple Pay The user closes the transaction by going to the merchant for a physical pickup thereby closing the transaction This will not only allow Apple to generate advertising revenue but also payment revenue As I have highlighted many times before AAPLs iPhone will be increasingly challenged by rising Asian handset makers that are creating their own ecosystems see Apple The Party Is Over Initiating With A Bearish View North America is the only market where AAPL has a sizable market share whereas elsewhere AAPLs market share is only in the lowtomid double digits I expect North Americas smartphone market to become increasingly fragmented on the back of rising exports by the Chinese OEMs see Apple Outlook Where Do We Go From Here That said it is important for AAPL to diversify its operating profits away from the iPhone and into other verticals with mobile advertising the most attractive area given the higher data usage associated with a typical iPhone user This will also allow AAPL to scale iBeacon which will likely produce a meaningful revenue stream within this decade I remain bearish on AAPL due to the iPhones flattening innovation curve as yearonyear comps gets tougher for the device and the potential contraction of the iOS ecosystem due to the proliferation of Android devices However I believe a deeper entry into mobile advertising particularly incorporating mobile payments into Apple Maps could be a catalyst for the stock Source Apple A Small Change In Apple Maps
