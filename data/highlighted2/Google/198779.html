class='textDiv'>Investing In Yahoo Net Of Alibaba Still A Very Compelling Opportunity Yahoo Inc NASDAQYHOO Seeking Alpha The riskreward for this investment has never been so favorable Over return under a favorable tax outcome with modest upside even under a negative one Investing purely in the Operating Business net of both Alibaba and Yahoo Japan can drive phenomenal returns once both are spun off a longer term opportunity In this article I want to outline why the Yahoo RemainCo or Yahoo stubessentially YHOO net of its stake in BABA is a compelling longterm investment opportunity To do so I will provide a background for those unfamiliar with the situation explain why this mispricing exists and show that this dramatic undervaluation is unmerited The background follows below Yahoo initially invested in Alibaba in sold a portion of its holdings during the IPO and currently owns a stake valued at roughly B Earlier in the year it announced plans to monetize its stake as part of a taxfree spinoff and sought a Private Letter Ruling PLR from the IRS to ensure that the spinoff would be taxfree However on September it was revealed that the IRS had declined the companys request for a PLR This means that the IRS is not immediately guaranteeing taxfree status it does NOT indicate that an unfavorable tax outcome is certain The stock has fallen precipitously and the current price reflects a fullytaxed BABA stake and a discounted value for the remaining assets the company owns The board has recently authorized the spinoff and evidently feels that the chances for a taxfree divestiture are high The current price offers a compelling investment opportunity in the RemainCo which one can create by shorting Alibaba and going long Yahoo This allows one to hedge exposure to BABA secure modest upside if the BABA stake is taxed or potentially tremendous upside if Yahoo can divest BABA tax free I believe the chances for a taxfree divestiture are high And given that the spinoff is expected to close in H expect this to be a very lowrisk highreward opportunity within a relatively short timeframe Note that it will likely take some time for the market to properly value the operating business But the benefits of a tax freedivestiture will be realized immediately Moreover the full potential of this investment will be realized once Yahoo Japan is spun off as well which is likely to occur in H at the earliest I recommend shorting BABA for every share of YHOO long to create the RemainCo at approximately I think its conservatively worth per share even under a worstcase tax scenario and in a taxfree scenario The principal reason that the market currently undervalues the RemainCo is that the BABA stake makes up a significant majority of Yahoos value YHOO has essentially served as a tracker stock for BABA see image This has caused investors to ignore YHOOs other assets Negative news regarding YHOOs taxfree distribution on September th also caused panicselling among eventdriven investors Poor performance at the operating business search and display ads the OpCo also has dampened investor enthusiasm and led to an undervaluation of the Yahoo RemainCo Its important to recognize that this is a business with close to Bn in net cash and over Bn in expected EBITDA for which includes margin royalty revenues from Yahoo Japan YHOOs current price also assumes zero possibility for future improvements in the operating business There are several opportunities available to improve the operating business and stem the revenue declines which will be discussed later In this section I will attempt to detail why the RemainCo is a compelling investment opportunity despite the considerable skepticism surrounding Yahoos ability to survive as an independent company Its very clear that the Yahoo Operating Business has been struggling but the fastgrowing MaVeNS Mobile Video Native Advertising and Social has offset some of the declines on the desktopside Revenues are showing sign of bottoming and various sellside analysts have projected modest growth in the quarters to come I also believe management has several tools available to improve profitability Adjusting its cost structure to bring EBITDAemployee closer to AOLs and a switch from Bing to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL to improve its net search revenues can add over M in EBITDA increase see below Despite operational difficulties the company is forecast to realize B in EBITDA for and has close to B in net cash which management has shown an inclination to direct toward share repurchases MAVENS performance has been strong Source Susquehanna Search growth is expected to stabilize and may grow under an amended search agreement with Bing and use of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>as the principal provider See below Source Morgan Stanley Management has shown an inclination to reduce share count I believe there is scope for considerable reduction postspin cash will comprise a significant portion of RemainCos valuation Source Company filings Despite a struggling core business YHOO has options available to create value YHOOs search agreement with Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT terminates in October Under amended terms Yahoo may use Googles Search capabilities up to a potential of of search revenues and benefit from its significantly higher over PPC Even with a premium and additional revenues at EBITDA margins the OpCo can increase EBITDA by M As prominent activists and analysts have commented Yahoo has a bloated cost structure In comparison to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and AOL NYSE AOL it severely lags on RevenueEmployee and EBITDAEmployee By simply bridging half of the gap between AOL in terms of EBITDAemployee Yahoo can add M of EBITDA for a total additional M over This translates to an additional Share of value I believe that management interest in focusing Yahoos efforts and right sizing its coststructure amid investor pressure will make this a priority Yahoo owns a stake in Alibaba Group Holding Limited as a result of its investment in the company BABA is a holding company principally engaged in online and mobile commerce The company provides retail and wholesale marketplaces through PC and Mobile Interfaces including Taobao Marketplace BC Tmall CC Juhuasuan groupbuying discounted sales and AliExpress global ecommerce Alibaba controls over of the ecommerce market in China and has numerous other high growth assets Increase in mobile takerates coupled with very strong mobile growth should allow growth to continue at a healthy pace Furthermore the current valuation leaves substantial upside from non ecommerce assets online payments cloud logistics etc I feel the RemainCo is far more undervalued and low risk our trade is thus intended to hedge exposure to BABA However one should recognize that this trade structure involves hedging only the taxable portion of Yahoos Alibaba stake As such any upside in BABAs share price from now until the completion of the spinoff will provide an additional source of upside I have no substantive opinion on Alibabas value going forward yet I note that its current price is roughly X adjusted EPS net of its cash and investments This seems to be reasonable value for a company with such tremendous growth potential Note that Yahoo is including its smallBusiness Unit ATB within this SpinCo for the sake of simplicity Im valuing it as a component of the RemainCo I believe there is a very high probability that a tax on BABA can be avoided evidently so does the board as the spinoff has been authorized Given extensive research by Skadden Arps Slate Meagher and Flom a highly regarded corporate law firm and the companys tax counsel I believe the spinoff may proceed tax free Liberty Interactives NASDAQ QVCA spinoff of its heavily appreciated TripAdvisor NASDAQ TRIP stake in addition to the numerous other similar spinoffs John Malone has successfully executed shows that similar transactions have occurred in the past Even if a spinoff of BABA is found to be taxable I believe YHOO management has multiple options available to avoid a tax For instance the Yahoo OpCo can be spun off leaving legacy YHOO as a shell for YHOOs public stakes Sellside analysts have proposed that Yahoo can issue preferred stockdebt collateralized by the BABA stake and distribute them To use another Liberty technique Yahoo could issue a tracking stock for its BABA stake or OpCo as Liberty has done for its Latin American and Caribbean businesses The company owns of Yahoo Japan a JV between Yahoo and SoftBank Group Corporation OTCPKSFTBY Yahoo Japan is trading within the multiple ranges of its ecommerce and Internet Media peers although valuations are high Performance at the ecommerce division has been strong transaction value growth last quarter and its payments business continues to gain users and market As with YHOO the company is executing well on mobile but somewhat struggling on the desktop side of its business The outlook on Yahoo Japan is flat due to valuation but one can easily hedge against it given that its publicly traded I will outline a method of investing in Yahoo net of both Yahoo Japan and Alibaba which is more long term YHOO management has expressed a desire to taxefficiently monetize this stake but this is unlikely to occur before H This image shows the future corporate structure of Yahoo following the spinoff The trade is intended to create an interest in the OpCo and Yahoo Japan RemainCo Source Susquehanna The RemainCo is valued as follows in the table below I value the YHOO OpCo using EVEBITDA As a result of numerous acquisitions and investments there are considerable noncash charges goodwill amortization etc The company also has a significant net cash position which would not be reflected in a PE analysis I value YHOO OpCo at X I consider the company similar in nature to a newspaper company in that its principal source of revenues advertisements are in decline and there is considerable competition from large internet companies Yahoos internet peers justifiably trade at much higher valuations as they are much better businesses As such it would be inappropriate to use an internet company multiple I have adopted a multiple lower than even the mean for newspaper companies for conservatism A similar company oldera tech company with declining businesses AOL was acquired at X EBITDA and traded in the s range prior One can create an investment in Yahoo RemainCo at a price of by shorting BABA for every YHOO long This assumes that BABA will indeed be taxed and leaves potential upside for a favorable tax outcome If one is confident in a taxfree distribution one can short BABA for every YHOO to create RemainCo for approximately this can lead to significant losses under a negative tax outcome however and I do not suggest it Modest returns are still possible even under a negative tax outcome owing to Yahoos current undervaluation as shown below As one can see substantial returns can be realized if BABA is spunoff tax free The investment is structured to be profitable even with a tax the upside to YHOO approximately Sh in the event of no tax will translate to substantial returns for RemainCo Over the longerterm a taxfree divestiture of Yahoo Japan can be expected to generate even greater return Given the timeline of the BABA spinoff this should not be expected before H Note that this trade is not intended to reflect any returns from the cash generated by the BABA short and does not factor in shorting costs however given BABAs lack of a dividend this should not be substantial See below for a return analysis of investing in Yahoo net of both of its Asian assets Additionally if the value of BABA increases I am not anticipating this AND a tax is avoided the increase in value of the RemainCo will be disproportionately greater as this trade structure hedges for a tax I also have not modeled in additional EBITDA for the OpCo or the effects of an aggressive share repurchase the former is something shareholders will undoubtedly pressure management to pursue and the latter is very likely to be on managements agenda for creating value The thesis principally relies on a favorable tax outcome to generate returns But evidently there are numerous additional opportunities for return We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the personal contact
