this link or you will be banned from the site With the looming TransPacific Partnership dominating the headlines now is a good time to revisit an old scam called free trade In Kevin Flanagan was an information technology employee at Bank of America They told him he was being replaced with foreign labor and he was ordered to train his replacement After he completed his assignment he was laid off Then he went to the parking lot and shot himself Like The Ministry of Truth in George Orwells sometimes the most effective way to lie is to use the most innocent words No word is more susceptible to propagandaleveraging than freedom Attach that word to any concept and all of a sudden its unassailable Thats exactly what happened with free trade Proponents of free trade will often use the simplest analogies to convey their point as if you were retarded The reason they have to resort to such caveman illustrations is because free trade does not exist in the real world There is no such thing as equality of bargaining power If someone has ten million dollars and you have zero dollars anything above zero is an improvement in your situation The free trade economists will say this person with zero dollars is free to work for per hour and they will do so because it improves their situation This is what freedom means to free trade economists If you doubt the free trade economists they will call you a protectionist as if protecting your countrys economy were some kind of grievous transgression In fact nothing is more American than shunning free trade nonsense Ian Fletcher calls free trade the myth of cowboy capitalism According to Fletcher all four presidents on Mt Rushmore were protectionists The entire American Revolution was fought because the colonists were tired of being economically exploited by the British Alexander Hamilton realized that British dominance in manufacturing and American reliance on agriculture were dooming us to a banana republic future The solution Tariffs By taxing British goods the United States boosted its manufacturing industry By tariffs were at One of the fascinating parts of this history is that the South was opposed to protectionism They wanted free trade Why Because free trade was necessary for the international slave trade from Africa to the United States Fast forward to Thats when the North American Free Trade Agreement was enacted The result was nothing less than the wholesale destruction of the American manufacturing industry And where did these displaced workers go In the s of all net new jobs created were in the service industry which has lower wages This is what free trade looks like I love the smell of freedom in the morning One doesnt have to look hard to find free trade evangelists in the corporate world Apple the worlds largest company is also the largest example of how free trade is a game of heads I win tails you lose Only of Apple workers are in the United States There are Apple employees in the country and employees overseas However Apple is nothing without its global suppliers where workers make the next round of flashy gizmos that nobody needs anyway These suppliers should be included in the worker count because they are directly involved in the manufacturing process In February President Obama asked Steve Jobs Why cant that work come home Despite having the last name of Jobs Steve Jobs made it clear that he didnt care about jobs He only cared about money He said Those jobs arent coming back In Jobs used patriotism when it was convenient for him He called the Macintosh a machine that is made in America Later he said Im as proud of the factory as I am of the computer But by patriotism gave way to profits and Apple became an American company in name only It relied on foreign manufacturing Betsey Stevenson former chief economist at the Labor Department said Companies once felt an obligation to support American workers even when it wasnt the best financial choice Thats disappeared Profits and efficiency have trumped generosity Of course Apple falls back on the timeless corporate lie that American workers are not skilled enough One anonymous Apple executive said We shouldnt be criticized for using Chinese workers The US has stopped producing people with the skills we need They were skilled enough before NAFTA but after NAFTA all of a sudden they all forgot how to do their jobs Its funny how that amnesia works Now for every two American college graduates with degrees in science technology engineering or mathematics only one of them is hired into a job in their field Sounds like a real skills shortage Alan Blinder a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton and a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board said Contrary to conventional wisdom the more offshorable occupations are not lowend jobs whether measured by wages or by education The correlation between skill and offshorability is almost zero The anonymous Apple executive made it clear that Apple was really a country to itself and did not care about jobs or social effects We sell iPhones in over a hundred countries We dont have an obligation to solve Americas problems Manufacturing analysts estimate that if Apple paid Americans to build iPhones it would cost an extra per iPhone With hundreds of dollars of profits per phone Apple would still be profitable While Obama asked Steve Jobs about bringing jobs back to America the Apple executives had their own suggestions They wanted more visas so they could bring in more foreign workers They wanted a tax holiday so they could bring back some of their overseas profits at no cost They wanted government funding to train American workers Notice a pattern here They want to exploit government assistance so they can maximize their profits which would boost their stock options On and on it goes You may be familiar with the term corporate raider from the s but what is happening now is on a scale much larger than that It is country raiding Entire countries are being exploited and saddled with the burden of supporting multinational behemoths who tell you that your very demise is actually your greatest freedom Some Americans are catching on to this scam and are actually leaving the country in pursuit of opportunity Imagine that leaving America for economic reasons Ellis Island has been flipped on its head Give me your tired and your poor has been replaced with Lets GTFO As Zero Hedge reported in the first quarter of a record number of Americans renounced their citizenship One expatriate Emily Matchar described her experience After applying for jobs over two years my husband finally got the offer hed been hoping for a wellpaid position teaching philosophy at a respected university We should have been thrilled There was just one little thing The job was in Hong Kong My husband said I feel like were being deported from our own country Meanwhile in China Apple continues to thrive on its masses of slave labor Like the antebellum South Apple supports free trade because it makes their slave labor possible Foxconn Apples major supplier is located in Shenzhen Do you know how they keep their unemployment rate down If you are a migrant worker who has been unemployed for more than months it is illegal to rent housing So you can either be homeless or leave Im sure the people at the Bureau of Labor Statistics would love a policy like this in the United States Then they wouldnt have to bend over backwards to goalseek all their employment data to conform to the official recovery story line If youre not unemployed in Shenzhen youre probably getting beaten by Foxconn security or jumping off buildings to escape your miserable existence So you can imagine my level of trust when President Obama says this time will be different He called the TransPacific Partnership the most progressive trade deal in history And yet he doesnt want to tell us anything about it With NAFTA million American manufacturing jobs were lost and factories shut down What will the TransPacific Partnership do Its like a sequel to a movie that was terrible in the first place Obama visited Nikes headquarters as part of his political rally One of the highquality jobs at Nike is held by a yearold mother in Indonesia who processes shoes per hour for cents Im sure she is a free trade supporter After awhile you start to realize that the people who love free trade so much are economic hacks and the uberrich They use sterilized language and hollow arguments to convince you of the positive ideals of free trade In all honesty its a great theory It really is But then the moment you start believing it they start working in all sorts of exceptions usually for themselves Before you know it youre an unemployed American or a Chinese slave at Foxconn And the uberrich are in the Bahamas laughing about it thanking the economists for playing along with the story Sun gwar If Obama is for TPP then it is very bad for people Obama is a sociopath Little wonder the details are top secret even from members of congress who are supposed to vote on it Hint The state is your abuser not your savior and arguing endlessly over how it should use violence for the good is ridiculous Sun remain calm If obama wants it then it aint good for you If obama doesnt want it then its good for you He is a fucking liar Sun TeamDepends It is now obvious that TPP will work in conjunction with Jade Helm to attempt the final takedown of America Hope and change Sun Oh regional Indian They as in they never give names casually announce dates casually or any such thing This is a highly choreographed drama with every set piece named and identified So yes it is free trade but to whom Trade is free

Sun HowdyDoody Sun JenkinsLane Obama is a front man for the US oligarchy as was GW Bush Clinton Reagan Daddy Bush on the other hand was actually part of the oligarchy Sun junction It is not just the USA workers who were hurt by NAFTA Three million farm laborers in Mexico lost their jobs years ago thanks to Mexican companies importing cheaper subsidized American corn Carlos Slim now one of the worlds richest men made his fortune from buying most of the Mexican government telephone monopoly on credit and then charging high call rates to the Mexican expatriates in the USA forced to leave a Mexico wrecked by President Carlos Salinas and his drug peddling associates Obama is just a darker version of Salinas whose brother arranged the killing of their main political opponent a crime which Mexico is delaying the prosecution of especially with PRI now in charge Obama also has a secret kill list to bump off his enemies from Michael Hastings to talkative Navy SEALs to even Joan Rivers you dont believe that story about her botched medical procedure do you right after Joan made fun of Michelle calling her a tranny Sun GRDguy From NYtimes today President Obama is aggressively courting Republicans and Democrats to grant him accelerated power Thats the way it is with sociopaths theres never enough power to get more OPM Other Peoples Money But they fly so high on it And the masses keep giving it to them Sun Bagbalm Sun Dearlydeparted Sun cheech_wizard I know doesnt it strike you odd that people dont turn around and off the person that ordered the end of their livelihood Sun Conax They have always worked played by the rules and have acquitted themselves admirably all their lives Killing themselves is one thing doing murder over anger is another They just feel hopeless without a future Killing the old boss wont fix the situation it would only bring condemnation and shame on the family name In anguish they off themselves Sun Last of the Mid Free Trade NAFTA Right to work Affordable Healthcare Act If you dont know the link you need to go back to skool always ALWAYS name the bill something warm and fuzzy then your political cronies write the guts of it Been going on a long long time Sun Achilles Heel After applying for jobs over two years my husband finally got the offer hed been hoping for a wellpaid position teaching philosophy at a respected university Well now theres someone who will surely be a contributer to society Congrats on taking the job in the exact moment that your weeks ran out Sun GRDguy Free trade is as stupid as a phrase as free for all It just means the biggest can trample others freely Id much rather see fair trade and fair markets Of course theyd lie about that too To manage the resulting price inflation they must control exchange rates Part of controlling exchange rates is having production move off shore Then they must control wage increases and so layoffs andor imported replacements The FedRes and their criminal and treasonous violencepuppets need to go and go hard Want to see free trade grind to a screeching halt Outsource lawyers Let any lawyer on planet earth operate inside USA from a remote location Sun falak pema We dont like the private sector Oligarchy so we dont want TPP Its reminds us too much of TBTF and crony capitalism gone global We dont like state programs that could define rules which enact legislation to breakdown the Oligarchies THAT HAVE GROWN IN THE USA SINCE REAGANOMICS WAS EXPORTeD WORLD WIDE AND OUTSOURCING BECAME RELIGION Why COs its STATISM aka Communism FDR prime example from past Sowe are stymied between the devil and the deep blue and libertarians just cant dig their heads out of u know where The west is now going oriental cant decide what decision making in a responsible way means Maybe the East will go rational and show us the way of how to be balanced and pragmatic without going ape shit paranoid Sun isolato There are other factors at work as well

American companies were profiting so handsomely that any attempt tro raise this issue has been quashedevery year Thats free trade isolato There are other factors at work as well Allowing China into
