Submitted by John Rubino via DollarCollapsecom First it was the banks reporting horrendous numbers largely we were told because of their exposure to recentlycratered energy companies Now its Big Tech which is a much harder thing to explain The FAANGs Facebook Apple Amazon Netflix and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>own their niches and not so long ago were expected to generate strong growth pretty much forever Thats why every largecap mutual fund and most hedge funds not to mention a few central banks owned so much of them This years first quarter was emphatically not what their fans had in mind Apple for instance reported not just a slowdown but a doubledigit yearoveryear sales decline CNBC Apple reported quarterly earnings and revenue that missed analysts estimates on Tuesday and its guidance for the current quarter also fell shy of expectations The tech giant said it saw fiscal secondquarter earnings of per diluted share on billion in revenue Wall Street expected Apple to report earnings of about a share on billion in revenue according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters That revenue figure was a roughly percent decline against billion in the comparable yearago period representing the first yearoveryear quarterly sales drop since Shares in the company fell more than percent in afterhours trading erasing more than billion in market cap That afterhours loss is greater than the market cap of of the SP companies Looking ahead to the fiscal third quarter Apple said it expects revenue between billion and billion Wall Street had expected billion on average according to StreetAccount One area of weakness for Apple in its secondquarter was the Greater China segment comprising mainland China Taiwan and Hong Kong Revenue for that region fell percent yearoveryear to billion Previously that area had posted consistent growth for China Twitter managed to grow in the first quarter but its nextquarter revenue projection came in below Wall Streets consensus CNBC Twitter on Tuesday posted mixed quarterly results and gave sales guidance that disappointed Wall Street even as its user base grew more than expected The social media company reported adjusted firstquarter earnings of cents per share on million in revenue Earnings rose from cents per share in the previous year while sales climbed percent from million in the prioryear period Analysts expected Twitter to report earnings of cents per share on million in revenue according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters Twitter said it expects secondquarter revenue of million to million well below analysts estimates of million according to Thomson Reuters In the companys conference call executives downplayed the low estimate saying it did not reflect sagging interest from advertisers The repercussions from techs tank are myriad in part because so many sophisticated investors own so much of this paper As Zero Hedge just noted First it was the blow up of hedge fund darling Valeant that crushed countless funds who were long the name Then one month ago after the collapse of the AllerganPfizer deal we showed one of the reasons why the hedge fund world continued to underperform the broader market Allergan was one of the most widely held hedge fund stocks And now following the biggest Apple debacle in years here is the reason why the hedge fund community is about to see even more redemption requests and underperform the market even more according to the latest GS hedge fund tracker at least hedge fund are long the name which has just lost over billion in market cap in the after hours The good news it used to be over as recently as a year ago Tears wont be confined to Wall Street however lets not forget that none other than the Swiss National Bank is also long some million shares of AAPL It also wont be a surprise to find out that the Japanese central bank a massive buyer of equities which recently began diversifying into other countries shares and the US Plunge Protection Team are on the hook for a few tens of billions here But stock market squiggles and hedge fund redemptions are a sideshow The big questions are Can a hyperleveraged global financial system survive if its main economies cant grow The answer to both questions is almost certainly no So either something extraordinary and extraordinarily unlikely happens to ignite sustainable growth or the dissolution of the fiat currencyfractional reserve bankingcentral planning model will begin Expect developed world governments to do almost literally anything to stop that from happening Wed Zero Point Answer to question Banks energy companies and tech companies are mostly fraudulent crime syndicates An economy that relies on them SHOULD fail Wed remain calm The CBers will just everything to desperately cling to their delusion that they can make things better The end of the Keyesian ponzi scheme is close Wed Ghordius well increasingly as an excuse to shot moar money into the economy and yet at the same time war is becoming increasingly expensive and increasingly limited in the numbers of units and soldiersmercs deployed if not deaths and devastation of Other Peoples Territories from an older Keynesian point of view war is the moment where people ration their consumption but the state has a glorious revolution in technological progress which then leads to exactly moar of everything up to a certain point its true technological progress tends to save the bacon the real question is if we havent experienced so much war and so much technological progress that we are at the point where dreaded deflation would be the natural thing to happen but how to know with all this monetary flooding of the fields going on just look at those faangs so much of them depends on a stock market that has to find winners somewhere anywhere Wed EF Mutton But with the eager help of a complicit media most of the sheep still believe its just a flesh wound Wed brada Jack Ma is the richest man in China as he just sold a piece of his new company Ant Financial The word you should focus on is sold Are they getting earnings growth No So it stands to
