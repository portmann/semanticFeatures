It was another roller coaster ride for Wall Street Wednesday The action however was more volatile than whats usually witnessed by investors Mad Money host Jim Cramer pointed out to viewers that the Dow swung about points during its session Wednesday The SP closed down points or to not before tumbling as low as its lowest level since February The market first saw heavy selling then it took off like a rocket ship Cramer said Then there was a bruising sell off All eyes appear to remain on the Fed and whether it will keep intact its plan to raise interest rates While the world is in crisis mode the Fed wants to slam the brakes Cramer said The Mad Money host kept his worries focused on Fed action pointing to past Fed moves that put markets in a tailspin His example In as the world was recovering from the Great Depression the Fed raised rates which just about put the economy into a recession within the Great Depression The ominous signs continue to surface Industrial production is lagging and car manufacturing is slowing while retail and home sales are peaking And of course theres the troubled oil sector Now the market is fighting for its life while the Fed tinkers with a possible rate hike Cramer said And this all comes as investors also look overseas Japans market is down more than from its highs Germany is down more than but its markets may be better off given the push by the European Central Bank to ease rates and with data on the economy that looks rather good Germany could have a better market than ours Cramer suggested Domestic markets seem expensive Cramer said thanks to a strong dollar and continued tightfisted polices from the Fed The currency issue is making our market look rich he added To sum up his feelings Cramer said stocks are stuck in nomans land and are not cheap Cramer said we need to see a few key developments before suggesting things are clearing up including more clarity on the Feds next moves Making A List and Checking It Twice When can investors expect to find an investible bottom Cramer brought out his checklist to determine if its safe to again look at the markets and determine if we found the bottom As his list suggests that bottom still appears elusive Does the Fed Narrative Change This doesnt look good given that New York Fed President William Dudley said last week All systems are go regarding the economy and that the Fed still may tighten Political Uncertainty Resolves Itself Maverick candidates from both sides of the aisle Democrat Bernie Sanders and Republican Donald Trump for Republicans are roiling the political waters Theres more uncertainty than when I put this list together Cramer said China Cleans Up Its Act Not happening Instead China has become worse Cramer suggested Commodities Bottom Commodities have only gone lower Oil Stabilizes Oil continues to be in a freefall now down since the start of the year Geopolitical Situation Improves Cramer put this one on his list when North Korea surfaced as an issue Those concerns may have been put on the backburner but we cannot say that about the rest of the world Zombie Companies Put To Death No major commodities companies have filed for bankruptcy even as balance sheets appear stretched to the hilt Also Chinas superfluous companies continue to do business The Dollar Markets want relief from the super freakin strong dollar Cramer said Instead the dollar keeps surging especially against emerging market currencies Healthy MA Market The number of takeover deals may have peaked The Return Of a Healthy IPO Market There havent been any recent IPOs and the ones we have seen have fallen apart Cramer said Peak In Certain Sectors The housing market doesnt look strong Key indicators like car sales look weak Tech Sector Leadership Can investor interest expand beyond FANG Facebook NASDAQ FB Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Netflix NASDAQ NFLX and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL That doesnt appear likely Is there a sector that investors should carefully consider during the current market turmoil Cramer suggested investors should look at traditional telecom companies like ATT NYSE T and Verizon NYSE VZ along with surging wireless provider TMobile NASDAQ TMUS as potential candidates The Mad Money host spent his time talking about two of these stocks Verizon and TMobile and how they may be attractive to certain investors Verizon the traditional pick has a strong dividend with a yield and is viewed as less risky Verizon offers capital preservation and income generation And Cramer suggested Verizon could be the best run of the oldschool telecom companies Meanwhile TMobile is the highflying growth stock The wireless provider continues to stir things up in the wireless space with its aggressive push to take market share with lower prices and attractive packages TMobile also could be a takeover target At the end of the day it appears to be an applestooranges comparison Cramer suggested Verizon is better suited for investors seeking less risk while TMobile may appear suitable for younger investors willing to take on more risk One stock to avoid in the space Sprint NYSE S Cramer said the wireless company is looking stressed out and cannot keep up with the others Cramer also said eventually the telecom space could move from four players to three with the ongoing talk concerning consolidation Cramer also spent time with Mark Hurd coCEO at Oracle NYSE ORCL talking about the companys moves to support enterprise clients in the cloud the companys growth and competition Hurd pointed out what he called Oracles big advantage among enterprise software companies its ability to offer both onpremise and cloud capabilities to companies using its platforms He said Oracles accelerating cloud growth can be attributed to strong development of the technology investment in items like RD and a sales force thats becoming more accustomed to selling cloud services The Oracle executive also took on the competition saying we win more deals than others working in the same space Its a fight but its clear we are winning Hurd also said Oracles management is strong which along with himself includes coCEO Safra Catz and chairman and founder Larry Ellison It was BOGO buy one get one free day in the oil markets To round out his show Cramer pointed to talk that Irans reentry into the global oil markets has the nation doing big deals in an effort to take market share from other producers The effort reportedly includes offering one free tanker of oil to any buyer purchasing another tanker Bigger companies such as Royal Dutch Shell NYSE RDSA NYSE RDSB are doing their best to defend dividends Cramer said Meanwhile small and midsize independents are just trying to defend their business And hedge funds that had been shorting these types of companies apparently are turning on bank stocks that lent to these independents thinking that they may be vulnerable with the ongoing rout the oil industry continues to fight WalMart NYSE WMT Cramer said he would bless a longterm position He said the stock likely isnt going below Jim Cramers Action Alerts PLUS Check out
