numbers are highest by far for S and lowest by far for VZ T TMUS numbers about the same Counter to expectations rate of complaints against S appears to have increased significantly in last months Information supports investment case for VZ cautiousness around T TMUS and lastly closer scrutiny of S turnaround progress and potential Using freely available complaint data from the popular customer website ConsumerAffairs Ive derived some insight into the recent customer satisfaction levels for the big four US wireless telecommunications providers Verizon NYSE VZ ATT NYSE T Sprint NYSE S and TMobile NYSE TMUS Where Verizon has by far the lowest number of complaints ATT and TMobile are about comparable and Sprint has the worst level by a factor of about compared to ATT and TMobile The information supports a strong investment case for Verizon cautiousness towards ATT and TMobile and closer scrutiny and doubt around the investment worthiness of Sprint already much beleaguered compared to the others The complaint levels for Sprint have been particularly high in the past months which is unexpected considering new CEO Marcelo Claures comments in the past two earnings calls emphasizing the importance of improving customer service and satisfaction for the Sprint business When reading those earnings reports I was impressed by Claures honesty and forthrightness about the need for better customer service The data Ive seen however indicates Sprint has a long way to go It goes without saying that customer satisfaction is extremely important for the business operations of these companies It drives churn when it is low it affects reputation and therefore adoption rates it affects upgrade potential or the potential for expansion of services and it is also important from an investors ethical perspective at least in theory we might say speaking tongue in cheek that is assuming the investor possesses such a thing as an ethical perspective Seriously speaking most of us have probably had our own horrible experiences with utility or telecom companies and thats not something we want to support with our dollars Simply put I consider customer satisfaction very important Aside from this customer satisfaction is one of the more easily gauged factors about the telecom operators which provide little detailed specifications on the quality or capacity of their network If we cannot assess their technical specifications we can at least assess what people are saying about their personal experiences in forums and on other websites Before discussing customer satisfaction any further lets take a second to recapitulate the basic investing theses here Why should we care about these stocks First of all the wireless data market has matured and could provide great business opportunities in the next years I discussed some of these potential market developments in my last article The two biggest operators Verizon and ATT both have high yields and Verizon has shown significant price growth in the past years TMobile is positioned to grow and has an important competitive role Sprint though facing financial struggles has a discounted valuation the third most customers of any nationwide operator and a sizable asset base Using current data from recent earnings reports and SP business reports we can get a sense of relevant valuations by looking at the ratio of the customers to the market cap of each company This number reflects how much the market values each company for each individual customer A low number compared to the average indicates undervaluation against the competition As demonstrated in the chart Sprint and TMobiles businesses are valued much less per wireless customer than the big two In this section Ill show how Ive made my analysis from looking at complaints on the website ConsumerAffairs Though this is just one place of many on the internet where customers can submit their complaints it has a high enough volume of complaints and a prominent enough space in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>results to make it arguably representative of overall customer opinion Ill also point out the relatively recent results published by Consumer Reports These showed that Verizon ranked best in voice and data service but lowest in value evidently you get what you pay for as a wireless consumer Sprint came dead last not just among the big four but also including the other smaller providers with middling results in voice and text and poor results in data and value These results are corroborated by what Ive seen from personally inspecting the complaints listed on ConsumerAffairs Note that ConsumerAffairs is forprofit organization so its data has no guarantee of neutrality nevertheless it allows us personal insight into the customer satisfaction of each carrier Tabulating all the and star out of reviews given for each carrier over the past four months and then normalizing these by the number of wireless customers for each provider listed in the chart above I created the graph shown below Note I have used complaints specifically from the pages for VZ T S and TMUS As can be seen Sprint gets many more complaints than the other three carriers and about more complaints than the next two Verizon ranks much better than the other three carriers it is better than ATT and TMobile by an extraordinary factor of The accounts on ConsumerAffairs that make up these complaints are related to poor service quality contractual disputes and all sorts of reasons In terms of absolute numbers ATT gets more complaints in some months than Sprint but ATT wireless has many more customers Having acquainted myself more closely with Sprints business in the past week I had become interested in the possibility of the companys turnaround story playing out Sprint was bought out by SoftBank in a highly successful Japanese telecom firm but has struggled to improve financial results since then New CEO Marcelo Claure was appointed this past summer and has specifically mentioned improvement of customer satisfaction as one of his biggest priorities in the past two earnings calls Based on the above analysis this clearly wasnt just a feel good story Claure identified Sprints customer experience as being a key problem for the company In the past two earnings calls he had discussed several initiatives to improve customer satisfaction the establishment of a new elite level call center at company headquarters and concentrated efforts on improving network quality so that customers get what they pay for Ive made some changes to my leadership team to better understand our customer needs and experience and have asked my lead team to periodically sell in our retail stores and take customers services calls directly Marcelo Claure Sprint Q Earnings Call Based on the above quote as well as the tone and content of the rest of his commentary I believe the company leadership is putting sincere work into improving customer satisfaction Nevertheless the complaint results dont paint a pretty picture Below Ive plotted the complaint results for Sprint over the past months They show that the complaint level has risen significantly since Claure took over The increase in rates is likely due to the aggressive promotions which have been attracting more customers as well as the new creditquality restrictions Sprint has been imposing causing more connections to be disqualified or deactivated Regardless it shows that Sprint management has a long hard road to go to turnaround the companys financial results The complaints that Ive seen justify placing a significantly higher valuation on Verizon than its competitors On the other hand the complaint levels for Sprint dont support its valuation which is actually higher than TMobiles on a per customer basis Sprint has a lot of work to do to improve its customer experience both on the network side and on the side of customer relations It has the unenviable position of desperately needing to increase income while at the same time making its customers significantly more happy In navigating this position Sprint has made moves like releasing aggressive price promotions which are nonetheless chock full of caveats as described by Mike Gikas at Consumer Reports Needless to say it will be a long road ahead Source
