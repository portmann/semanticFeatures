beyond manufacturing and selling vehicles GM has consistently outperformed Ford in total shareholder return with a lower debt to equity ratio and higher return on invested capital These metrics will shift as autonomous vehicle market matures and investors get a better idea of the value of innovations partnerships and acquisitions during this early stage Executive Chairman of Ford Motor Company NYSE F Bill Ford recently commented about the company his greatgrandfather started saying you cant be all things to all people and you shouldnt be Ford may not be able to be all things but in a shifting marketplace it is looking to become more things to more people Monday Ford announced that they would look for partnerships as they plan to become a general mobility company rather than simply an automobile manufacturer and seller For now that means they are joining the fray over the future of ride sharing and selfdriving vehicles They certainly are not alone in this field Rival General Motors Company NYSE GM invested heavily in Lyft Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV NYSE FCAU is working with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG and Tesla NASDAQ TSLA has its own autonomous vehicle development Earlier this week Toyota NYSE TM and Uber announced a partnership that although not specifically about autonomous driving could lead to valuable data collection and establish a base for autonomous vehicle collaboration Volkswagen and Apple NASDAQ AAPL have made their own investments into ride sharing companies for similar reasons Each strategy is a bit different and the details have been extensively covered across various media In this busy world of partnerships and strategy GM and Ford sit as the two traditional giants of American automobiles The two have approached the advent of autonomous vehicles in unique ways that are still developing GM and Lyft believe that the beginning of driverless vehicles will be ride sharing rather than personal ownership They plan to combine GMs work on selfdriving software with Lyfts established ridesharing business GM complemented this earlier this year with the purchase of selfdriving tech startup Cruise Automation Ford has experimented with its own ride sharing approach utilizing peertopeer vehicle rental and is experimenting in London with a service similar to Uber called GoDrive Notably the two companies expenditure on research and development as a percentage of revenue has not spiked yet with the escalated interest in autonomous vehicles Perhaps the Q numbers will show further investment or perhaps the companies have been investing in it for much longer than the recent uptick in public and media interest would suggest Neither Ford nor GM has announced an autonomous driving partnership with <span

the large automobile companies just outside of the top six in global unit sales GM is at third while Ford is at sixth While Ford and GM do not have the sales of Toyota or Volkswagen first and second in global sales they do dominate in the United States In GM led the US auto market with of market share followed by Ford at Toyota at and Fiat Chrysler at The bestselling vehicle for the last years was the Ford Fseries pickup truck but is not exactly a prime candidate for partnership with ride sharing If autonomous driving grows to a large scale in the states which seems to be the trend then the American auto companies will remain well placed for potential partnerships It will be interesting to see if the major American technology companies begin to court these two American automobile companies or vice versa specifically to target their dominance in the United States market Ford and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>were allegedly in talks for a deal but nothing formal resulted from them Autonomous driving is still mostly a future revenue driver but the market is reacting to the perceived potential of these two companies Ford and GMs total shareholder return at this point and moving forward are going to be based not only on direct competition with other manufacturers but competing and collaborating with an entirely new range of companies especially in technology With all of this in mind how do the markets view the two American automobile leaders over the past few years From the start of to the present GM has consistently outperformed Ford in total shareholder return TSR At market close on Tuesday GM showed a TSR while Ford showed a TSR The gap has closed from the plus differences for most of December of Note Median Peer Set represents General Motors Company Despite not having a high profile deal like GMs Lyft investment Ford maintains a significantly higher debt to equity ratio from the beginning of until Q of In relative terms GM has seen a consistently rising ratio since while Fords ratio has been more erratic though it ultimately lowered throughout the period Note Median Peer Set represents General Motors Company With this higher debt to equity ratio Ford mostly underperformed General Motors in return on invested capital during the same period For the Q of the numbers for the two companies were essentially identical Note Median Peer Set represents General Motors Company As the autonomous vehicle market matures and investors get a better sense of future prospects it will be interesting to see how these metrics shift
