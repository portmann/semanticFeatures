examination Apples results bode well for the difficult yearoveryear comparisons in the coming quarters Apple NASDAQ AAPL reported stellar revenue growth of yy and EPS growth of yet the market was disappointed and Apple shares dropped after hours I had high expectations for the quarter which were not quite met but the markets reaction represents a buying opportunity Occasionally the consensus of the professional analysts is right on the mark and this happened to be one of those times Apples revenue did come in above their guidance range but didnt exceed it by much As summarized by Philip ElmerDewitt the analyst average revenue estimate was billion vs the actual billion Analyst average EPS was vs the actual Heres a summary of my preearnings estimates compared with the actual results iPhone Even the analysts were caught a little flat footed by iPhone sales in the quarter As reported by PED the consensus estimate was for million vs the actual million Joining me in my bullishness for the iPhone was KGIs MingChi Kuo who estimated million iPhones shipped for the quarter Apple achieved an impressive yy shipment growth which could have been higher but for a couple of factors Apple allowed iPhone inventory to draw down by units as disclosed by CFO Luca Maestri during the conference call This was clearly in anticipation of the iPhone s release and may indicate that the new iPhone will debut a little earlier than the normal late September time frame The other factor affecting shipments was the competition from the Samsung Galaxy S My take on this is still the same as I indicated in Apple Clobbers Samsung in China Samsung has delivered at most a glancing blow to the iPhone and I expect the next iPhone to turn the tide in Apples favor once again Mac Mac sales did about as well as I anticipated in my Mac sales preview article As anticipated IDCs recent sales estimate was much closer to what Apple actually reported It would have been higher if Apple had been able to achieve supplydemand balance for the latest MacBook with Retina Display which is still backordered several weeks on the online Apple Store iPad Sales still declined but at a slower rate than in the past We may be seeing a bottom soon in iPad sales Apple also allowed iPad channel inventory to draw down by units suggesting that an iPad refresh or new iPad Pro also is on the way for the September quarter Watch Apple didnt announce specific unit shipments for the Watch supposedly because this is competition sensitive It might as well have released the number anyway Maestri and Cook both acknowledged that the sequential change in the other category of million was all due to the Watch Taking this as the Watch revenue for the quarter we can back out unit sales following the methodology I outlined in my Watch sales preview At an estimated ASP of sales are about million for the quarter This is still better than initial sales for the iPhone and about the same as the iPad in roughly the same time frame of days initial availability a significant achievement for a new product launch This is still considerably less than the final pro consensus reported by PED of million Clearly the supply constraints were much more severe in their impact than we realized The low sales figure also confirms my theory that in store sales are vital to the success of the Watch Late June was when the Watch became widely available in Apple retail stores As I pointed out in my preview the Watch is not something that people want to buy sight unseen online On the conference call Cook deliberately contradicted the widely reported analysis of Slice He stated categorically that sales turned up by the end of June This also confirms my theory about the Slice data that it under reported Watch sales as sales shifted to instore rather than online Cook indicated that as of the conference call Apple has finally achieved supplydemand balance Now that the Watch is available for sale in Apples retail stores well finally get a better idea of what the demand really is Cook also indicated that he anticipates higher sales volume for the December quarter as consumers gift the Watch OPEX Apples operating expenses grew to billion while I had been expecting billion The difference was mainly due to slightly lower RD at billion vs my expectation of billion Apple guided to a midpoint of billion in revenue a yy increase compared to last year when the iP was introduced This is probably conservative but it bodes well for the difficult comps that Apple supposedly faces in the last two quarters of the calendar year If Apple makes this level of growth in the September quarter well probably see similar growth in the December quarter This could be impacted however by the timing of the release of the iPhone s Apple may move the release date up in the quarter in order to drive sales The steep afterhours drop will undoubtedly dismay some investors who recently bought in especially if they were expecting a postearnings pop Apple is not a good stock for a shortterm momentum play It doesnt enjoy the kind of irrational exuberance of Netflix NASDAQ NFLX or even <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL The main argument against Apple continues to play on the fear that Apple cant sustain its current level of growth Such arguments are successful because they are selfevident as well as appealing to investor insecurity Its selfevident that Apple wont continue to grow at plus yy So what Apple will continue to grow double digits and pursue greater capital returns Apples cash pile now exceeds billion Irrational fear may drive the stock even lower as Apples growth slowdown is portrayed as if it were a contraction This is just a buying opportunity Eventually as Apple continues to outgrow competitors such as Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Samsung OTC SSNLF the market will
