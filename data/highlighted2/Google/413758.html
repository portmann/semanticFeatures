class='textDiv'>Cloud Investing Who Leads Who Lags Seeking Alpha The top three cloud providers are growing at revenue rates quarteroverquarter From the dust of the cloud emerges a new truth about how companies report their cloud earnings Investing in Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT IBM NYSE IBM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL is no longer about investing in their individual technologies as cloud computing permeates every industry in the world this is something every savvy tech investor must hold in their portfolio because it involves an estimated billion worth of business through Even the smaller subset of InfrastructureasaService is currently worth billion and growing at a CAGR of When I first started writing about cloud investing in Seeking Alpha more than two months ago I was surprised to see the kind of interest it generated You can review the article here Cloud Investing Buy The Space Not One Company This littleunderstood but highly disruptive technology of technologies was changing the very fabric of some of the worlds top tech companies but not many people knew what size the industry was or how the biggest players were positioning themselves for multibilliondollar market share opportunities within cloud After having written several articles on the subject and covering the individual cloud businesses of the largest cloud providers it is time once again to review where each of the Cloud Fource or Cloud ce companies stands with respect to cloud revenues and forward strategies The companies that term refers to are the worlds top cloud contenders Amazon IBM Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>This article covers the top three of the Cloud ce but thats only because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is still a long way from seriously competing with them in terms of market share and cloud revenues as I will show Amazon took to offering cloud services early on and has been the market leader until now The company started breaking out AWS revenues as of Q and that was the earnings call that showed investors how profitable the division really was Note Amazon started reporting quarterly numbers only since Q I have used the provided growth numbers to backcalculate their revenues for Q and Q The good news for Amazon is that despite the fourway race to the top of the cloud industry they have managed to maintain their growth rate quarteroverquarter As you can see from the growth line in the chart above that figure is down from in Q to this past quarter The reason for the slowdown is aggressive marketing by Microsoft on the one side and enterprise penetration by IBM on the other Nevertheless AWS still enjoys strong demand in the market Their costs are typically lower at the front end because of deep discounting and although theyre not necessarily cheaper in the long run from a Total Cost of Ownership TCO perspective the slew of addon services they introduce every year make it easier for devops teams to deploy and manage their IT systems on AWSs cloud At the current level of revenue Amazons annualized revenue run rate which Ill cover in detail shortly now stands at around billion Moving forward AWS has positioned itself as a lowcostofentry and convenient cloud provider that offers attractive services to complement their core cloud infrastructure services I dont see enterprises forming a line to migrate to AWS but the bulk of small to medium companies that need flexible IT real estate will be drawn to these merits As such AWS revenues will continue to grow at a rate for the next few quarters until <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is able to start capturing chunks of the market that AWS currently caters to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is also entering the market as a lowcost provider initially so it will be interesting to watch if they can penetrate the moat that Amazon has already set up around its costattractive cloud business For now investors can expect AWS revenues to grow between and quarteroverquarter And be sure to keep your eye on their operating margins as they grow revenues the level is a significant marker for this key metric that will drive Amazons profitability as their retail business continues to stagger towards the black IBM reports their cloud earnings in a more complex way than Amazon but it is in line with their business model Essentially they report an annualized run rate for their asaService offerings separately but the rest of their cloud revenues are clubbed into total cloud revenue which is for the quarter Since their cloud strategy is primarily focused towards hybrid cloud their earnings from hardware and related software to support that hybrid model are all accounted in the total less their asaService revenue As you can see below IBM has shown steady growth since they began offering software infrastructure platform and now analytics as cloud services Their annual run rate for the asaService component of their cloud business was reported at billion in Q which puts their quarterly earnings from this segment at about billion This is still significantly lower than AWSs billion for this past quarter However from a total cloud revenue perspective IBM was already at billion for and theyve hit a TTM revenue of billion this quarter At the current rate of growth of around to million every quarter TTM I expect IBM to cross billion by the end of Q The growth rate will escalate as IBM pushes more of their clients to adopt the hybrid cloud model of which they are the current market leader This is a significant tipping point for IBM as their legacy business continues to decline and the company is increasingly dependent on their strategic imperatives namely cloud analytics and engagement In addition IBMs large and growing data center footprint including the latest one in Johannesburg South Africa has allowed them to overcome regulatory compliance issues in many of parts of the world In my interview with Dr James Comfort IBMs Cloud CTO linked at the bottom of this article he specifically mentioned that the transparency of IBMs data storage offering gives clients the freedom to choose exactly where their data is being stored In turn this allows them to comply with local regulatory guidelines on sensitive data so they are more likely to sign on with IBM over the competition At the current YoY growth rate in the cloud segment IBM has a tremendous runway for continued growth because of how theyre leveraging their relationships with enterprise clients Their expertise in hybrid cloud deployments and their large data center footprint are just two of the advantages they currently have over the competition Additionally they are aggressively pursuing AnalyticsasaService across several verticals like healthcare marketing manufacturing education cybercrime banking and much more IBM is already the cloud leader as of this last quarter with billion in TTM revenues discussed in the final section below A projected CAGR of puts them at over billion TTM coming from their cloud business thats more than a third of their overall revenue of billion This is a growth segment and you need to be investing in IBM to take advantage of that growth over the next several years Microsoft provides an annualized commercial cloud run rate on a quarterly basis which includes their Office and other cloudrelated services that were part of their business before they started pushing hard in the cloud race On segment reporting they provide numbers for their intelligent cloud unit which includes Microsoft Azure and also their hardware serverbased business and consulting services However using intelligent cloud numbers alone will be misleading because it does not include cloud properties such as Office Therefore we have to rely on their commercial cloud numbers which includes all cloudrelated revenues to see their growth Since Microsoft started reporting their cloud numbers only as of Q we dont have data before that time But its easy to see that Microsoft has kept its pace along with the rest of the pack The run rate has moved from billion last year to billion this year Thanks to ample help from their Office and other cloudbased offerings Microsoft is slowly reducing the gap with Amazon as we saw in IBMs case Another thing thats still very clear is that Microsoft Azure revenues are growing strong Even though they dont break out the numbers they did mention this in their Q earnings report for Our server products and cloud services revenue grew million or driven by revenue growth from Microsoft Azure of and higher revenue from Microsoft SQL Server offset in part by lower revenue from Windows Server Server products and services revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency impact Azure revenue grew in constant currency with usage of Azure compute and Azure SQL database more than doubling yearoveryear So while you can see that their reporting doesnt allow us a peek under the hood it does reveal enough to prove that Azure is still growing at a healthy rate Thats what has helped them to hit that billion run rate this past quarter Moving forward I see strong adoption of Azure in the small to midsized business segment while the newly launched Azure Stack will penetrate the hybrid cloud market currently dominated by IBM As Office and Azure continue to see significant uptake the commercial cloud and intelligent cloud segments should report solid numbers over the next several quarters Microsoft has three growth drivers at this point Office Windows and Azure Stack Combined these three will be the foundations on which the new Microsoft is built Office is already the leading SaaS application in a market that was long dominated by Salesforcecom NYSE CRM Windows powered by the Universal Windows Platform shows tremendous potential in gaming and application development and Azure Stack is perfectly positioned to handle competitive threats from IBMs hybrid capabilities Microsofts cloud growth rate is pretty much in lockstep with that of IBM so you can expect their overall cloud TTM revenues to be in the similar billion range by Investorspeak Where Should Your Cloud Investment Dollars Go In my first cloud article I recommended that investing in the space was a much better bet than depending on just one company The logic behind that was the fact that the cloud industry though still defining itself is clearly going to be led by these four companies I refer to as the Cloud ce There are two things I need to explain at this juncture One why I think run rate is not an accurate measure and two why I left <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>out of this cloud update On the first point run rate is essentially an extrapolation of quarterly results into an annual time line With cloud adoption growing at twodigit levels for the foreseeable future you can see why this would not be a clear indication of where each company stands at any given point in time As such it can only be used as an approximation So what Ive done is to bring all their cloud revenues to a trailing twelve months basis so we can make an apples to apples comparison and this is what I found IBM outright reports its cloud TTM and that figure is billion as we saw That gives us a total of billion Microsoft is a little more complicated For commercial cloud they report an annualized run rate which is essentially the most recent quarter extrapolated to the next three quarters From those rates we can calculate their actual quarterly revenues from this reporting segment Q billion run rate which equates to billion for the quarter Q billion run rate which equates to billion for the quarter Q billion run rate which equates to for the quarter Q billion run rate which equates to billion for the quarter That gives us a total TTM revenue of billion So now we have the real numbers And as you can see they tell a different story from the one that run rates do With the TTM cloud revenues in hand we now have this interesting revenue ranking Third Place Microsoft with billion That may come as a surprise to most people especially those who consider IBM to be a nonmover in a fastmoving world The important thing to remember here is that all these companies are growing at greater than quarteroverquarter and this is the pace that they will maintain moving forward In and of itself that is a significant milestone for the cloud industry and that brings me to my second point why I didnt cover <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>in this report Ive left Alphabets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>out of the picture here because they have a lessthansignificant presence in the cloud infrastructure industry Moreover if we were to analyze Googles cloudrelated services business we would find that they have the largest user base but the lowest resulting revenues But its not just that At the last estimate Googles cloud business made about million in the fourth quarter of A year before they were at around million thats an growth in one year where its key competitors are growing at every quarter As such IBM Amazon and Microsoft are the companies to watch over the next few years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>may well catch up but only in its own time I would still recommend investing in all four companies because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has made significant investments in cloud and is on an aggressive client acquisition path with Diane Greene leading the attack but cloud revenues are not yet significant enough to have an impact on overall performance In subsequent reports I will continue to use the TTM approach to deciphering reported revenues It is the best metric to keep your eye on if youre looking to invest in the cloud space because it is more realistic than run rates In fact if you go back a few quarters youll be able to see how IBM was actually leading the pack as far back as Q when they were at billion and Amazon had only just started reporting AWS revenues separately I expect all three companies to continue to grow at levels yearoveryear especially Microsoft and IBM because theyve barely penetrated the enterprise market With Microsoft now squarely in the hybrid cloud space with Azure Stack the market now has two viable options which will make them more open to moving to the cloud AWS will continue to grow in the SMB segment with a smaller portion coming from enterprise They will also continue to provide the tools and services that make it easier for these companies to move to the cloud Theyre already growing more than twice as fast as the industry average of CAGR and the saturation point is still very far away As a group these three companies will drive the cloud industry forward And thats why these are the three tickers you want to see in your portfolio when the decade comes to a close and these are the three companies that will define the growth of cloud over the next several decades If you found value in this article please follow me by clicking on the Follow link next to my name at the top of this
