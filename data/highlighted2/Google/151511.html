Blocking On Safari Could Lead To Apple Losing Billions In Easy Money Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Implementing ad blocking on mobile devices is difficult since it causes battery drain and CPURAM hogging Apple which gets billionyear from using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>as the default search engine in mobile Safari also could get hurt by adblocking browser extensions Apple NASDAQ AAPL will reportedly release iOS next month However its not an immediate threat to advertisingdependent firms like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Apple did not make any official announcement that iOS will come with the best method for thirdparty developers to create adblocking browser extensions for Safari What iOS is promising to deliver is a Content Blocking extension API Application Programming Interface that uses JavaScript and CSS to block content before a page is loaded on Safari This method is deemed inferior by developers of ad blocker extensions like AdBlock Plus The experts at WebKit says the JavaScriptbased content blocking extensions cause serious drain on battery and also slow down loading of web pages Its therefore unlikely that top adblock developers will use iOS s content blocking API because of the battery drain issue and performance throttling The current implementation of ad block extensions is already a CPURAM hog on desktop PC browsers Using Apples JavaScriptbased content blocking extensions on phones with weaker CPU lesser RAM and batterydependent phones would be a worst experience The performancebattery issue is why ad blocking is still unpopular among mobile users There are dozens of standalone adblocking apps browsers and browser extensions available on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play and iTunes and yet very few people use them In spite of the growing number of people using ad blockers on desktop PCs people still prefer not to use ad blockers on their iOSAndroid devices Adobe NASDAQ ADBE and PagePairs Q report shows a steady growth in number of adblockers However PageFair and Adobe also state that mobile only contributes to adblocked traffic This is in spite of the fact that mobile devices already accounts for of all global web traffic Aside from the performancebattery issue another compelling reason why Apple will not be actively implementing adblocking on iO devices is that Tim Cook likes the estimated billionannual payment from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Since Apple is estimated to be getting to per iOS device from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>as a Traffic Acquisition Cost NYSE TAC fee to make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>the default search engine on mobile Safari The geniuses at Apple might eventually come up with a better adblocking extension API that would address the battery drainperformance of ad blockers However the easynocost billionyear from helping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is a strong incentive for Apple to not propagate ad blockers Theres no money to be made on Apple letting freetouse adblocking extensions on Safari I also seriously doubt that approving thirdparty browser extensions would lead to significant improvement in iPhoneiPad sales The SafariGoogle search engine deal is set to expire this year The noise over content blocking extensions on iOS might just be a scare tactic of Apple to motivate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>to pay a higher TAC fee A successful persuasion of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>to pay plus per unit TAC fee is justified As a long on AAPL Im cheering for Tim Cook to strongarm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>to share more of the money from Safari search advertising Apple devices contributed to of Googles estimated billion revenue from mobile ads last year Half of that amount is subject to the Safari deal the other half is from appinstall ads <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>therefore grossed billion on search engine ads on iOS devices but it only probably paid just billion in TAC fees to Apple last year Mobile is the future of search advertising It is therefore more preferable for Apple to negotiate a new or revenue sharing agreement The current per unit traffic acquisition cost deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is not fair to AAPL investors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>remains the global leader in mobile search with over of mobile search It makes for Apple to retain its partnership with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Disclosure I amwe
