from the App Store This means that theres a major paradigm shift taking place in the Chinese market since China is notorious for software piracy This change in thinking might be beneficial for Microsoft which is transitioning to a new business model where it will be selling its products through its cloud According to App Annie Apples NASDAQ AAPL App Store has lately been seeing an explosion in volume of downloads thanks mainly to a huge surge in app purchases in the Chinese market Googles GOOG GOOGL app store <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play as usual enjoyed the lions share of downloads during the first quarter but played second fiddle to the App Store when it came to revenue According to App Annie China has for the first time now surpassed the US in volume of downloads Part of the reason why the App Store is doing so well in China can be chalked up to the popularity of the iPhone and the iPhone Plus Apples smartphone market share in China reached an alltime high of in February China has become a very important market for the company Apples revenue in China grew by a blistering during the first quarter to reach a record billion That means China is only slightly behind the entire European market where the companys revenue clocked in at billion during the quarter This trend is a very encouraging sign for Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT which has never been able to crack the China market It has come as a huge surprise to many industry observers that China is now so willing to pay for apps The country is notorious for software piracy its estimated that more than of Windows copies in China are pirated China is a potentially huge market for Microsoft products with hundreds of millions of users QIHOO NYSE QIHU a leading Chinese security company has more than million Windows PC users There were some reports recently that Microsoft has agreed to give free Windows upgrades even for pirated Windows copies ostensibly to get a chance to upsell its other services The fact that the Chinese are now buying apps by the buckets is a clear indication that a major paradigm shift is happening with the Chinese consumer This is great news for Microsoft because the company is currently undergoing a major business remodeling and product cycle transitions that will see it use its cloud to sell most of its products and services Microsoft will offer free upgrades to Windows for Windows and Windows users The new OS will be available during the second half of the current year Microsofts game plan is to use the free upgrade as bait so that it can get chance to crosssell its other services such as OneDrive Music Pass Live Gold Office MSN Skype and a raft of other Microsoft products With the Chinese more willing to pay for apps Microsoft now has a good chance to finally tap into this lucrative market Microsofts huge installed base of Windows PCs in China can become very lucrative for the company if its able to monetize it better Business Insider estimated four years ago that Microsoft makes just billion or less than of its revenue from the Chinese market Compare that to Apple which makes more than of its revenue from this market The number of PCs sold in China every year is roughly equal to those sold in the US yet Microsoft makes times less money in China compared to the US If the Chinese are able to purchase so many PCs then its quite obvious that they can afford to purchase many of Microsofts products which cost only a fraction of what an average PC costs All thats required is a big change in the way the Chinese think about the need to pay for software Luckily for Microsoft this seems to be happening now Microsoft has been working hard to fight piracy in China It has invested in local software JVs with Chinese companies as well as opening up a raft of RD centers But the company also has been trying to strike a balance by not cracking down too hard on pirated software to avoid pushing the Chinese people to other free OSes such as Linux Microsoft makes about six times more money for each PC sold in India compared to China thanks to Indias strict antipiracy laws Microsoft has lately been facing a strained relationship with the Chinese government after years of good relations The Chinese government has been probing the company for what it terms as monopolistic practices and even banned the purchase of some Microsoft products by government bodies Microsoft however is not alone in this conundrum and the Chinese government has placed the clamps on other US tech companies including Apple and Cisco NASDAQ CSCO But this has not stopped Apple from becoming successful in this key market Apples iPhones have a larger smartphone market share in China than Chinas own Xiaomi The probes by the Chinese government are not likely to slow down Microsoft either with Windows OS powering more than of PCs in the country There appears to be a major shift happening when it comes to how the Chinese consumer thinks about the need to pay for software This change in thinking might prove to be beneficial for Microsoft which has never been able to fully tap the huge Chinese market Hopefully the Chinese will now be more willing to pay for the companys other services delivered through its cloud Source Apple Play Doing Roaring Business In China A Positive Sign For Microsoft Disclosure The author has no
