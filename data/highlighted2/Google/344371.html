class='textDiv'>Twitter Lack Of A Distinguishing Quality Puts Platform Significantly At Risk Twitter Inc NYSETWTR Seeking Alpha We believe it is pretty clear at this point that Twitter has fallen out of favor of not only Wall Street investors but Main Street users as well Our bear thesis is predicated mostly upon the belief that the social media space is getting crowded and this overcrowding is creating a significant overlap of users and purposes This isnt a problem for social media platforms that have a differentiating and defining quality but we struggle to identify such a quality for Twitter More than of a smartphone users mobile time is spent within five social mediamessaging apps and Twitter is at significant risk of not being one of those five apps Advertisers are running from the platform following investors who ditched the stock in mass over the past year and we believe users are the next to leave Twitter We believe it is pretty clear at this point that Twitter NYSE TWTR has fallen out of favor of not only Wall Street investors but Main Street users as well The stock is off its week high resembling a user base that has stagnated at million for two straight quarters against Facebooks NASDAQ FB user base which grew million or more than of Twitters total user base last quarter Twitter already is largely out of favor with both the mass market of social media users and advertisers and we believe as the Facebook growth machine continues to ramp and consolidate functionality it is only a matter of time before Twitter users see little purpose in having a Twitter account and start leaving the platform From this standpoint we expect significant customer churn at Twitter over the next several years Our bear thesis is predicated mostly upon the following belief the social media space is getting crowded Facebook continues to be the dominant and consistent player in the space but then there is LinkedIn NYSE LNKD for professional networking Snapchat for instant picturevideo messaging Instagram for picture sharing Pinterest for picture sharingbrowsing Tumblr for blogging MatchTinderOkCupid for dating Vine for creating video loops and MessengerWhatsAppWeChat for messaging among several other applications for several other purposes There are a lot of social media apps for a lot of different purposes and that means there is going to be significant overlap of users and purposes We think the biggest loser of this overcrowding is Twitter the outoffavor social media app whose character appeal is somewhat of a bygone in a new era where you can get everything you want on other platforms Investors need to look no further than the recent success of Instagram to understand part of the secular story underpinning Twitters decline a picture paints a thousand words Instagram already boasts advertisers for its million user base one advertiser for every users in just a few months while it has taken Twitter four years to get to advertisers for its million user base advertiser for every users This is all part of a secular shift in mobile as users ditch the characters jammed in a box and adopt pictures with captions Why Because pictures with filters and captions attached engage consumers significantly more than characters An astounding of Instagram users say they take action after being inspired by an Instagram post Instagram is and will continue to take advertising revenue from Twitter Another part of the secular story here is that Twitter is playing catchup in a space that normally undercuts the laggards Twitters Moments failed because Snapchat already had Discover and Facebook already had Trending These are the two precedents for news discovery in the social media space that users have grown exceptionally fond of Likely because it didnt fit with what the normative user experience was as defined by Facebook and Snapchat Moments was a dud Falling behind in the quickmoving popularitydriven social media space is a tall task to overcome Just ask the likes of MySpace The final and maybe most important part of the secular story underpinning Twitters decline is that the platform really isnt necessary Users can jam quirky thoughts into a Facebook or Instagram post Because those two have synergies a user can post simultaneously on Facebook and Instagram the user gets much more exposure through FacebookInstagram than through Twitter Moments is the David to the Goliath of Facebook Trending and Snapchat Discover David wont win here though The mobile interface is not moreso leveraged to mobile than any other social media platform It really is difficult to label anything differentiating about Twitter besides its character limit At the end of the day other platforms have their defining quality Snapchat is ephemeral Facebook has more than onesixth of the world on its platform Instagram is the picture hub LinkedIn is the resume builder Twitter though really isnt anything noteworthy This explains the following matrix wherein we see Twitters lack of a distinguishing quality result in significant user overlap with platforms particularly Facebook Around of TWTR users also use FB On the other hand only of FB users also use TWTR A lack of engagement functionality and distinguishing quality means Twitter isnt that cool of an application anymore The whole social media space though is growing so losing popularity isnt a total losing situation for Twitter if the whole social media pie is growing right Wrong and this is where the overcrowding issue comes into play Chris Messina independent product designer and former user experience designer at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL says that one of the truisms in the smartphone industry is that a lot of people buy smartphones but dont download that many apps He says app engagement is a very difficult thing to achieve and more importantly retain This is why applications flood users with push notifications constantly reminding the user to engage with the application The problem therein is that users view the overt usage of push notifications as intrusive and end up deleting the app This is more commonly known as the app enigma People love smartphone applications but dont download new ones Around of smartphone users do not download a new app every month Data suggests that consumers load up on a few favorite apps when they first get their smartphone and then just stick to those apps According to Julie Ask principal analyst at Forrester an average smartphone user spends of his or her time in just five apps Those five apps are most normally dominated by social media and messaging apps Last year it appeared as if Twitter was one of those five apps Today Its unclear With Instagram and Snapchat rising in popularity and Facebook attempting to shrink the app world even more see our articles on Facebooks consolidation plans here here and here Twitter is at significant risk of not being one of those five apps The stalling Twitter user base versus significant growing user bases at Facebook Instagram and Snapchat suggests Twitter may already have lost its place as one of those five apps Major firms seem to echo this According to Morgan Stanley Twitter has ceded significant market share A June survey pegged Twitter as the third leading social media application behind Facebook and Instagram but ahead of LinkedIn and Pinterest The same survey in November showed Twitter had fallen in popularity behind both LinkedIn and Pinterest More poignantly the survey showed that the number of people who have no intention of creating a Twitter account increased by from in June to in November Morgan Stanley also noted that Twitter app downloads fell YY in Q and mobile time spent on Twitter fell over YY marking the fifth straight quarter of plus mobile time decline Evercore mirrors this sentiment noting that Twitter continues to cede market share to faster growing competitors like Snapchat and Instagram Similar to Morgan Stanleys finding Evercore found that total time spent on the platform continues to fall while other social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat demonstrate doubledigit growth off of larger bases Most recently RBC Capital Markets found in a survey of online marketers that Twitter was the only major social media platform to see a significant falloff in its relative ROI versus the prior survey Roughly of Facebook advertisers plan to up their ad spend on Facebook over the next year while that number stands at a mere for Twitter advertisers Moreover of Facebook advertisers plan to cut ad spend while a much higher of Twitter advertisers plan to cut ad spend The survey found that Twitter generally had the weakest results with respect to advertiser budget allocation expected future spend and general satisfaction Advertisers are already running from the platform following a year that saw investors run from the stock Users are the next group that will run from the platform as the app world shrinks and consumers ditch their Twitter accounts to become fully immersed in other more distinguishing social media apps like Snapchat Instagram and Facebook We think the unfortunate truth for TWTR shareholders is that barring a buyout from a company seeking a social media platform like <span style='background-color:
