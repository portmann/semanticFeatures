reasons why you will never be financially independent Heck its the reason why you wont even be financially comfortable If you are a regular user on Facebook the odds are stacked against you that you will be financially independent Some reading this might be taking offense Youll tell me that you are on Facebook all of the time and you are doing fine financially But are you really Do you have zero consumer debt Do you follow a budget to keep spending in check Do you have at least months worth of living expenses in an emergency fund Do you max out your retirement accounts each year If you answered no to any of these questions then you arent in of good financial shape as you think So now you are wondering how Facebook is keeping you poor Here are ways The first way Facebook is keeping you poor is through wasted time While some people take a few minutes a day to check their friends status or update their own others waste loads of time They check friends status updates comment play games etc And I wont even go into how watching one innocent video suddenly turns into on YouTube In fact Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that the average time spent on Facebook is minutes a day While you might think that isnt a big deal remember that this only per day On a weekly basis this is roughly hours a week that are being wasted on Facebook To some this doesnt sound like much but what could you be doing with those extra hours a week Working on starting a business Setting up a budget Reading more Enjoying a hobby Maybe getting to work earlierstaying later so you can become filthy rich Get some muchneeded sleep Or even strengthening your relationships The next way Facebook is making you poor is through advertising The majority of revenue that Facebook earns is from ads These advertisers can target the exact people they think will buy their product or service Remember they have tons of personal information about you This includes in many cases This information tells advertisers more about you than you think Every time you like something you are giving one more piece of data about your interests to Facebook to sell to advertisers so they can better sell to you And by better sell to you I dont mean introduce you to products you need but rather make you think you really do need something you dont In addition to this think about how many third party apps you use that you log into using your Facebook account I bet you never thought about that information getting passed along did you While the information is not personal it is still one more piece of the puzzle that makes you who you are and allows advertisers to better target their ads Finally have you noticed after you search for something and then go to Facebook ads for that product magically appear in your feed and off to the side This is one more example of advertisers getting to you While all of the above contributes to Facebook stealing your money there is one more reason and its the biggest one of all The biggest issue with Facebook is that we as humans feel the need to fit in Facebook knows this and it is what makes Facebook so dangerous They use our need to fit in against us Here are the two ways they do this When you browse through your feed on Facebook you see what your friends and family members are up to You see the pictures from their trip to the Cayman Islands You see the awesome party they just had In other words you see all of the great things happening in their lives and you want that too You want to go on vacation You want to get a shiny new car You do these things even though you cant afford them because you want to fit in and keep up with the Joneses Dont feel bad about this after all it is human nature We all want to be part of a group This is why when in a group setting most people go along with what is suggested because they dont want to be singled out We dont consciously do it it is how we are wired Likewise studies have shown that we buy name brands to show that we are part of a group Why do you buy a Coach purse Is it because of their high quality or because they make a purse like no other company does Or is it because you see everyone else walking around with them and that makes you want one too Most likely you never thought about it this way mainly because youve never thought about why you want that brand of purse so bad But chances are you want one because you see everyone else with one The second reason is the need to increase your selfesteem When you post pictures of your new car you get a temporary increase in selfesteem I know this feeling well When I was a new grad over years ago the economy was in recession and I couldnt find a job I became depressed and starting spending money I didnt have Buying things made me feel better about myself The problem is that the high wore off faster and faster causing me to spend more and more and go into more debt Eventually I addressed my low selfesteem issue overcame it and set up a plan for getting out of debt My experience with debt is very much like showing off your success on Facebook You get a high when you show that you bought the big house or got the new car The problem is that this feeling fades and you need to find a way to replace it You might do this by posting vacation pictures or showing the designer jeans you just bought Heck some people even post fake updates to make others think their lives are better than they really are The cycle of keeping up with the Joneses and increasing selfesteem is a dangerous cycle The more you see others success the more you want to show off your success too You get the temporary rise in selfesteem but its only temporary After all you are putting yourself into worse and worse financial shape The only difference is that you dont see others rising debt levels You think they know something you dont So how do you stop Facebook from stealing your money and keeping you poor The simple answer is to not even use the site But I understand this is not an option for many people though some people have sworn off of Facebook If you arent ready to end the relationship with Facebook you have to limit your exposure to it Here is how Choose to visit the site as little as possible and as early in the day as possible This is because the earlier you check your feed the greater the chance you will get busy at work and forget about those Caribbean pictures that were posted Take the app off of your smartphone How many times are you waiting somewhere the doctors office the grocery store when you habitually pull out your phone and start checking Facebook Riding on a trainsubway and a taxi are other times when people check Facebook without ever realizing it Next time you are out look at people who are supposedly out together yet instead of talking to one another they have their heads buried in their phones checking their social media accounts Think for a minute if this is you When you go on Facebook keep things in perspective People only post the great things happening in their life Remember above when I said you post the highlights of your life to increase your selfesteem This is the same thing others do too So when you see awesome vacation pictures new cars etc understand that this isnt the whole story Think back to a time when you were shocked that a friend was getting divorced It was a shock because everything seemed so perfect You never know what is going on behind the scenes You rarely see people posting about their awful day unless they mention that the new pair of shoes they just bought made up for the horrible day they just had When you see the same people posting updates all of the time know these are the people that may be the least successful Look at the chart below It shows the amount of time people watch TV per day based on income As incomes rise the less they watch TV This is the same thing about surfing the internet and in particular being on Facebook The truly successful dont have the time to waste They are out improving themselves their relationships and their lives For more about the habits of successful people you have to read this post about the habits of people who are wealthy and successful While I am not suggesting quitting Facebook coldturkey you do need to be aware of how it influences you Just like advertisers can get us to buy things by tapping into our emotions so too does Facebook by getting us to be emotional about the things people post Remember our brains work on emotion first then logic This is why you buy those jeans then regret them a week later They met your emotional need at the time but your logic kicked in later and made you realize you never needed them in the first place Dont let Facebook cost you your time and money Limit your time online and use that time to better yourself your relationships and your life Readers is Facebook stealing your money What do you do to limit your time on the site or not get
