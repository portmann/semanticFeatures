class='textDiv'>Apple WWDC Vs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>IO Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Apple developed more relevant features into iOS Mac OS and Apple Watch OS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>on the other hand attempts to appeal to emerging market users ie the company is moving further down market Googles presentation material lacked imagination and creativity in comparison to Apple At this rate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>will lose the highend of the smartphone and tablet market This spells good news for Apple shareholders and also throws into question whether Android will add any meaningful upside to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>shareholders Apple NASDAQ AAPL blew <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL out of the water at WWDC I mean this as politely as possible to the good folks at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>who work hard to make Android the most accessible platform for mobile users in both emerging and developed markets El Capitan iOS Swift Apple Watch and Apple Music took center stage at WWDC and quite frankly the company was able to supplant Googles Android M every step of the way Apple improved the speed battery performance and power saving features for El Capitan and iOS Head of software design Craig Federighi went on to demonstrate the updates to Mac OS and while there werent many the few improvements inclusive of multiwindow accessibility and spotlight search indicates that Cupertino hasnt run out of good ideas Apple built upon the showmanship model that Steve Jobs was known for After all theres no excuse for a Californiabased company to stink at this as Hollywood is just a car drive away Theres an abundance of advertising and videoediting folk in Cali In fact it has the highest concentration of people who work in the media film and marketing industry Its sort of like starting a company in New York and forgetting about the advertising creatives that are street blocks away on Madison Avenue Selling shouldnt be hard especially when you hire the right people to do it for you Somehow Googles presentation was just another presentation and next year if they show up with that same level of energy and creative talent theyre going to get dismantled by Apple Typically I wouldnt be so critical of any other company but because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is sitting on billions of dollars theres no budgetary constraint So next year they might as well throw money from the rooftops of their campus to better prepare for their next demonstration of Android <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>needs to create more brand uplift for Android I dont care about their market share figures because they only have that kind of market share due to the partnership structure it has with various OEMs The various mobile OEMs are having difficulty with communicating their competitive advantage in comparison to iOS and Windows No one gets fanatical over Android <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has to demonstrate more than just a technical understanding of their products and services <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has to stimulate the imagination and bring together richer more emotional experiences that can somehow paint the empty canvases of the collective imagination of developers attending IO Federighi Jimmy Iovine and Tim Cook showed up at Apple WWDC whereas a bunch of irrelevant midlevel execs showed up at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>IO Absent of Sergey and Larry Im beginning to wonder how committed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is to mobile software and devices Sure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>may have a different business model from Apple and the two cofounders are probably very busy but so is Tim Cook Sometimes leadership is exemplified by the presence and active participation of the executive team At <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>IO Sundar was on stage going on and on about how it has improved this feature or how that new feature is going to make your life so much simpler Of course cranking the complexity down and increasing the capability of a device is hard but its doable Why this wasnt a priority up until Android M is beyond me Apple has dumbed things down so much that its probably impossible to compete Also the various AI features of Android M arent that intuitive until you integrate all of your contact information and calendar information into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Calendar Therefore the integration of the digital assistant into your life requires you to give information to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>But wait a second doesnt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>farm the heck out of your information Apple on the other hand adds complexity over time thus making it easier for users to catch on to various shortcuts and commands Each additional feature gets much more attention from the media and users as Apple tends to make updates to the OS infrequently Also each update handles a major bug or adds a significant feature advantage Therefore ecosystem fragmentation is mitigated as each update is intended to generate a noticeable difference to the user experience and usability of the OS Besides Apple doesnt charge users for OS updates and also explains in concise human language the benefits to updating Mac or iOS to the latest version To briefly summarize iOS will take up less space improve speed and performance has better security and a super power saver mode to extend battery life Simple right It took me one sentence to explain the advantages of updating to iOS Apple also added a unique feature for iPad that allows for a track pad like interface whenever a keyboard is present I just need to combine two fingers and drag around and I can alternate between a traditional laptop track pad and touch configuration I also have the ability to run multiple windows on iPad That being the case Im not saying that everything <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>did lacked imagination or creativity They were just creamed by Apple If anything Googles developer team should have prepared better and worked longer hours to ensure that the feature set not only appeals to emerging market users but also to the more affluent user base that adds the most monetary value Apples lead in software development is unquestionable as the various multitasking features are already patented so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>will have to develop unique shortcut commands of their own for tablet devices From what I have seen Android for tablet is pretty mediocre and various tablet OEMs like Sony NYSE SNE Samsung OTCSSNLF and HP NYSE HPQ are having a hard time differentiating the device category Tablets werent really given much thought at IO and for whatever reason <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>talked about Android M from purely the context of a smartphone user <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>didnt have anything noteworthy to offer on the topic of tablets and quite frankly Im not surprised Apple at least invested huge parts of the keynote to the Apple iPad and while tablets are becoming a niche device theres room to broaden the market potential Apples rumored inch tablet will get a boost from the various multitasking features as it will round out the holes between a multipurpose tablet and a fullfeature MacBook Admittedly its hard to tell which device has more desirable capabilities as the iPad Pro also has a larger app library and has multitasking and touchbased features MacBooks are great for multitasking and have meatier components for running demanding applications Furthermore El Capitan will boost Mac performance so the PC segment should have no trouble with sustaining shipment volume growth Apple iPad Pro could cannibalize demand for the MacBook Air The new MacBook has a significantly higher price point than the MacBook Air and is the new ultra portable Mac The MacBook Air seems extremely redundant based on the performance characteristics of iOS and iPad Pro plus the iPad Pro is going to be even lighter and more portable than the MacBook Air The inch MacBook Pro could become the new lowend MacBook in other words However with Macbook Pro price points starting at the next best alternative is to perhaps buy a inch tablet priced at to This alternative PCexperience that closely integrates with iOS ecosystem could be the device that turns the entire tablet segment around I have conviction in the longrun roadmap following WWDC I believe that the marginal improvements in performance and capabilities of iOS Mac OS X and Watch OS will create enough value for users and will sustain the price elasticity of demand I also anticipate foreign demand and market share gains to drive enough volume uptick to drive midteen shipment volume growth for iPhone The iPad on the other hand could have a banner year as both software and hardware will improve considerably The installed base for iPad has aged quite considerably and assuming a decent portion of users were to upgrade growth will be abnormally high in comparison to prior year comps Source Apple WWDC Vs <span
