shareholder letter remarks about what he considers Amazons big offerings to be Bezoss remarks indicate Amazon doesnt fundamentally see itself as an online retailer but as a service platform underpinned by a giant infrastructure Meanwhile Bezoss comments about Amazon Prime point to a willingness to let nonPrime sales suffer to drive Prime subscription growth Its understandable that much of the attention given to Jeff Bezoss shareholder letter filed with the proxy materials for this years annual meeting relates to his attempts to defend Amazons NASDAQ AMZN demanding corporate culture following an unflattering NYT expose and criticism from other sources However perhaps the most important remarks for Amazons investors involve Bezoss comments on how AMZN perceives itself Notably just after he finished defending his companys culture Bezos declared Amazon Prime the companys thirdparty seller marketplace and Amazon Web Services AWS his companys three big offerings He also stated Amazon remains hard at work on finding a fourth big offering Though Prime and Marketplace of course have much to do with ecommerce its telling that as much as Amazon is referred to as an online retailer in the media Bezos never declared ecommerce in general or some subset of it to be a core offering Rather he mentioned two platforms for which ecommerce is supplemented by other services videomusic streaming and cloud storage for Prime advertising and fulfillment services for Marketplace He also mentioned a third business that while an outgrowth of the tech infrastructure Amazon built to support its online retail ops is a whole different animal altogether and expressed hopes for finding a fourth big business without specifying what it might be The remarks make it clear that Amazon doesnt strictly see itself as an ecommerce company Or even as an ecommerce cloud infrastructure and online media provider Even that narrows the companys vision too much Rather it sees itself as a service platform enabled by a massive IT and logistics infrastructure Yes that infrastructure allows Amazon to be the worlds biggest online retailer But it also allows the company to be the worlds biggest public cloud service provider a major online streaming service provider and digital content seller and a major provider of fulfillment and increasingly advertising services to thirdparty retailers And with Amazon now hiring parttime delivery drivers applying for ocean freight licenses prepping delivery drones and leasing a fleet of Boeing s its safe to assume the companys fulfillment reach is about to get a lot bigger Even Amazons consumer hardware business not referred to as a big offering is tightly linked to the companys efforts to grow its service platform Kindle ereaders help Amazon dominate the ebook market Fire tablets settops and HDMI sticks eschew Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL apps and cloud services in favor of bundling many of Amazons a very mixed blessing and Echo speakers have as their main selling point support for AMZNs Alexa voice assistant which in turn enables online purchases supports Prime Music among other content sources and delivers voice assistant services for thirdparty developers via AWS Meanwhile the fact Bezos calls Prime but not ecommerce by itself a big offering could point to a strong willingness to let nonPrime ecommerce sales suffer for the sake of driving Prime subscriptions and by doing so getting users more hooked on buying from Amazon and using its digital content ecosystem Indeed Amazon is less than two months removed from hiking its free shipping minimum for nonPrime buyers to from and has tried to make its rapiddelivery services another Prime selling point by giving subscribers free sameday or even via Prime Now twohour shipping on many orders We want Prime to be such a good value youd be irresponsible not to be a member says Bezos in his letter Towards the end of his letter Bezos states he wants Amazon to be a large company thats also an invention machine one that combines the extraordinary customerserving capabilities that are enabled by size with the speed of movement nimbleness and riskacceptance mentality normally associated with entrepreneurial startups Hes far from alone among tech CEOs in holding such views Larry Page was probably thinking something similar when he turned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>into Alphabet Nonetheless the remarks further make clear that Bezos isnt tying Amazons corporate identity to any particular business or service Rather he wants the company to act as a largebutflexible entity that with the help of a giant infrastructure it has built at the cost of many billions of dollars and at times substantial losses can deliver a wide variety of services Including some that might not exist yet Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this
