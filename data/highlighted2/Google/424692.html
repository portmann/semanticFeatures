Questions to Always Ask Yourself Before Making a Big Purchase When I say big purchase I mean anything that shows up on your credit card statement and the dollar amount catches your attention That number will be different for everyone could be or it could be triple digits In any case if you get in the habit of asking yourself a few of the following questions before making a big purchase you can easily remove some spending on items that dont add to your long term happiness and financial goals See also Simple Ways to Stop Impulse Buying When making a significant purchase get in the habit of talking to yourself a little bit Ask if this item is something youll need in a week In a month Six months from now Once you have your answers then make the decision By asking yourself the question you can often quickly determine if its an impulse purchase which youll never use regularly or something you actually need and has longterm value The biggest problem with Amazon is they make it so darn easy to make purchases and overspend This is especially true if you have a Prime membership and with a single click you can have an item sitting on your doorstep in two days It often turns consumers into impulse shoppers who rarely do price comparisons and rely on the convenience factor that Amazon provides But in the longrun theres no doubt youre going to overpay on many items and at the end of the year that money will be significant especially if you shop at Amazon on a weekly basis See also This Is How You Stop Online Impulse Spending I recommend disabling the click feature and disconnecting your credit card from your account which makes it harder to complete an order Youll be much less likely to shop click buy and overspend Also before completing your next significant Amazon purchase I encourage you to pull up a separate browser tab and do a quick price comparison on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Shopping See if the price youre about to pay really is a good deal and then proceed accordingly How familiar are you with any given stores return policy If youre like most unless its a store you frequent often you probably have no idea what the policy details are Be sure to familiarize yourself with the policy especially if youre on the fence about the purchase to begin with or dont know if its the right size color or variation Will you be able to return it What about if you open the box How long do you have to bring it back These are all things you need to know so be sure to ask before you make the purchase See also How to Get a Refund When Something Is NonRefundable Also be aware of the return policy of liquidation or going out of business sales Often these type of sales have a no return policy and all sales are considered final With the recent news of Sports Authority going out of business and selling their merchandise to a group of liquidators it has many shoppers anticipating a plethora of sporting good deals Be aware that more than likely whatever you buy you wont be able to return So be sure that pingpong table will fit on your patio before handing them your credit card Despite a plethora of coupon apps and coupon websites available it still amazes me how many shoppers I see pay fullprice in front of me in line while I pull out my smartphone to access a discount Get in the habit of always asking yourself if a coupon might be available and then go find one Then if you cant find one politely ask the cashier if they have one you can use Stores like Michaels Bed Bath Beyond Pier Imports Dicks Sporting Goods and Joann Fabrics are notorious for handing them out to those who simply ask After all the worst they can say is No sorry we dont have any coupons right now See also Ways to Score a LastMinute Coupon Some items have cheaper alternatives that do the job just as well and the only difference is the price tag Things like a KitchenAid mixer Dyson vacuum and Beats headphones immediately come to mind To figure out if the big purchase Im about to make has a cheaper alternative I love using the Amazon product carousels found on the individual product page The two Amazon carousels worth scouring for deals are titled Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought and Sponsored Products Related to This Item For example the Beats Solo Wireless Headphones currently sell for on Amazon but if you scroll down the product page youll find some hidden gems in the above mentioned product carousels In particular the Status Audio HD One Headphones caught my eye with their reviews and an average review of out of stars the exact same rating as the Beats variety Then when you scroll down to the Status Audio reviews the first review by Michael M nails my point Its interesting that the Beats headphones are such sellers and that they are making a ton of money on those because they are horrible headphones with cheap parts and are selling you on their name and as a fashion accessory If thats your thing then thats fine But if its music you want to listen to clearly and accurately then buy these Is This a Replacement Item or Something New Ask yourself if the significant purchase youre about to make is for an item thats replacing something you own or simply something new and shiny that you figured you couldnt live without If its the latter do you really need to buy it right now Odds are if you tell yourself No the musthave feeling will go away shortly as your brain moves on to more pressing things If the item is replacing something you own that broke are you sure you cant do a YouTube search and figure out how to fix it Or maybe its being sold used on eBay for a fraction of the price Sometimes its just plain smart to spend more money on a quality product that will last and not accrue quick replacement costs The problem is knowing when spending more for quality makes the most sense so you dont overspend unnecessarily A good rule of thumb is to consider how often the item will be used If it will be used daily or several times per day and you plan on keeping it for years to come then youll want to consider the quality of the item along with the price and determine if spending more makes sense Things like tools mattresses shoes kitchen knives coldweather jackets and baby gear are all items worth spending more for higher quality Stores like Petco and PetSmart make a killing on the longterm costs of their products As a matter of fact they wouldnt exist without them While that cute hamster seems like a bargain at only the real cost is actually in the hundreds when you consider a cage food bedding and accessories I recently ran into this issue with my yearold daughter who saved up to buy her own hamster and supplies only to lose interest in the cute furball a couple months later Meanwhile the long term costs of the hamster remain the same even though nobody pays attention to it While we will be giving it away to a friend I would have been much better off doing a test run with an animal with lower long term costs in the beginning Perhaps if she could have cared for a goldfish for several months she could have moved up to the hamster Lesson learned Disclaimer
