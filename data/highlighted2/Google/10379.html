The programmatic ad services over iTunes Radio only allows advertisers to tailor their ads according to a target user's email address and phone number.Pandora's (NYSE: P ) advertising platform allows marketers to deliver ads based on age, gender, location, ZIP code, band affinity and musical taste.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Cook's dilemma now is that if he allows Apple to share complete data of the 600 million iTunes users, he risks alienating the people who paid a lot of money to own the iPhone because they like the privacy settings of iOS. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However, quitting or limiting its involvement in the mobile advertising business (in favor of preserving the loyalty of privacy-freak iPhones users) might also endanger Apple's long-term growth. (Uncertainty) </span>The future of the mobile industry is increasingly becoming more about winning the most number of users, not about getting the most hardware profits.While Apple can continue to enjoy its niche in high-priced smartphones, the long-term scenario is that other smartphone vendors will eventually force Apple to also lower its iPhone's average selling price.The race-to-the-bottom trend among Android smartphone manufacturers is now exacerbated by Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) aggressive push for $70 Lumia Windows 8.1 phones.MSFT CEO Satya Nadella no longer prioritizes hardware.The mighty resources of Microsoft are now focused on getting the most amount of mobile users for its new freemium strategy .Another fault in Apple's star therefore is that it cannot avoid a future where it can no longer enforce a $400 operating margin on every new iPhone.This decline in average selling price has already happened with the iPad.As the race-to-the-bottom pricing intensifies among Android and Windows phone vendors, Apple's iPhone pricing will also get lower.Otherwise, the disparity between an iPhone and Android phone will just grow too big for consumers to ignore.Android phone vendors like Asus ( OTC:ASUUY ) and Xiaomi can already come up with a high-end sub- $350 Android phones with the same or better hardware specs than a $700 iPhone.After implementing the bigger displays of the iPhone 6, Apple has no other compelling excuse to increase the average selling prices of its next iPhones.The pressure from Xiaomi and Asus will force Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) to also lower the prices of its flagship Galaxy phones.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Microsoft is now focused on entry-level phones, but after it releases Windows 10 this summer, it might also start releasing $350 high-end phones .
