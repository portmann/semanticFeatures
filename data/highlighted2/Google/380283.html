revenue earner over the coming decade Heres why Facebook NASDAQ FB is aggressively pursuing its video segment as it continues its search for more revenue streams And why not Mobile usage has been on the rise and along with it video consumption is going up and up Aside from the aspects of the number of users watching video content and the amount of time spent video is where the dollars are In this article I will try to cover the reasoning behind the aggressive video push from Facebook According to Cisco mobile video traffic will increase at a CAGR of between now and around higher than average mobile traffic Cisco predicts that total mobile traffic will reach an annual rate of Exabytes per month If you have been following Facebook you may have noticed that in the last two months there has been a neverending stream of announcements with respect to videos This month the company launched a dedicated hub for watching live and recorded videos and a search engine to help you find videos Facebook Live was also launched recently a key feature of which is instant video sharing Its all well and good that mobile usage and video content is proliferating like virus But what does Facebook stand to gain at the end of the day There are a couple of reasons The first is to keep their growing user base engaged and by growing I dont mean just their Facebook users Now that WhatsApp Instagram and Masquerade are in the fray Facebooks user base is greater than the sum of users across all these platforms In an earlier article I explained why even a heavy overlap of users across these applications will not affect their ability to grow their advertising revenue And this brings us to the second reason the monetary motive The monetisation aspects of videos are too irresistible to pass up so its only logical that Facebook wants to position itself as the dominant player in the video space by leveraging what it already possesses human capital and user engagement You may have a question at this point why videos when theyre doing just fine with other types of advertising Notwithstanding the growth of video content and sharing video advertising itself is much more profitable for an advertising platform But more to the point it is also better for the average advertiser because people will tend to click on a video ad more often than any other type of advertising As you can see video ads are three times more clickfriendly than any other ad type So for a given video ad three times as many people are likely to click on it If an advertiser pays per thousand impressions they basically get more clicks per dollar of ad spend So of course more and more ad content is going to move into video format over time Its based on the sound assumption that if a particular model is effective the majority will always flock around that model Thats why video advertising will grow and thats why Facebook needs and wants to be in that space in a big way I believe Facebook is confident that video ads are the only viable solution to their current problem of low CPM rates cost an advertiser pays for impressions served they have to offer to get advertisers on their networks Unlike Googles GOOG GOOGL primary approach of targeting keywords ads on Facebook attempt to target their audience demographically and based on usage patterns Of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has that as well but their keyword planner is a major part of any advertisers arsenal within their AdWords network No article on video advertising would be complete without a look at YouTube the platform that made it all happen YouTube was the pioneer of usergenerated video content that was shareable with the world and theyve learned a lot since they first made their appearance YouTubes viewability on mobiles and tablets is as high as against a combined competitors average of only That means theres a very good chance that a user clicking on a video in YouTube is also going to see the instream ads associated with that video If youve ever used YouTube youll know that you can skip most ads after about seconds Not all of them though after skipping a certain number of ads the next one will have to run its course of seconds before your video resumes And its this feature that makes video ads much more nonintrusive than ugly popups frustrating popunders and truly offensive intheface flash banners In a sense its like TV advertising without the ability to switch channels when commercials come on Thats the new trend in video advertising and as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and YouTube have proven is about as nonintrusive as it will get As for Facebook theyre still experimenting with various monetization options for video advertising They recently started testing their video feed which offers a variety of options such as pictureinpicture the way Tumblr has implemented just last year and the ability to save videos to watch later Theyre also experimenting with inserting advertiser videos within the video feeds and claim to be pleased with the initial results of these multiple tests These recent tests are additions to a slew of tests that include degree video support for the Oculus Rift a webembeddable video player similar to YouTubes as well as tools for live video broadcasting All of these are aligned to make Facebook the next big competitor to YouTube and go beyond the experience and flexibility that the latter currently provides Indications are strong that Facebooks core monetization will be around videos in the next few years The parent platform has already reached maturity additional platforms are being continually added to complement Facebooks own capabilities and international markets dictate that nearly nine times the user base is required to generate revenues similar to North America Thats the reason Facebook has been adding to its user base via Instagram million and WhatsApp billion Video is the future of Facebook and video monetization is the future of their market They have the ability to threaten YouTubes position and Zuckerberg is not going to let this opportunity slip by The challenges are certainly there YouTube has the advantage right now of a much larger base of creators of pro content Facebook has to build that over time nurturing content creators giving them the ability to earn more than YouTube can provide and gradually building that community But community is their forte as we all know Their advantages are their user bases and the fact that Alphabets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>doesnt have the head start of a dedicated social media application something thats starting to hurt them It is also what will continue to allow Facebook and other social players to chip away at their user base and make a lot of money in the process Thanks for reading I hope youll follow me and join me on my journey of deepdive
