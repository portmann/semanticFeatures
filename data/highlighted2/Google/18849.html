class='textDiv'>Going Long On Amazons AWS Glacier Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Amazon appears to be a poor investment Googles Nearline is supposedly better than Amazons Glacier Many investors view Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN as problematic like an eightton statue of your motherinlaw on the front lawn What the heck are you going to do with it On the one hand Bezos and company have a cash flow problem along with no profits and nominal growth And they are adding debt On the other hand Amazons revenues are up and the companys assets continue to increase in leaps and bounds What investors are forgetting is that Amazon unlike <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Facebook NASDAQ FB is not dependent on advertising for revenue Amazon is involved in retailing its own products and the products of other companies And it is part of the movie business And most importantly Amazon is the biggest and the best at archival storage more commonly referred to as the cloud The term the cloud simply refers digital data stored on multiple servers that are owned and operated by the host company such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>or Amazon For big companies with lots of data the primary advantage to using the cloud is that it can be categorized as an operating expense and not a capital expense But wait a minute Didnt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>just announce its superduper cloud storage called Nearline And isnt it supposed to sink Amazons Glacier the name of Amazon Web Services cloud storage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>made it sound like Nearlines availability lagtime was only to seconds which if true is phenomenal But what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>failed to explicate was the socalled latency aspect For every TB stored on Nearline <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>only allows retrieval at the rate of MB per second So if a company stored TB of data on Nearline their retrieval rate would be MB per second TB equates to retrieval at MB per second and TB yields a MB rate That sounds just dandy But wait In realtime application its not so hot If my company has TB of information stored on Nearline my download will begin in to seconds just as advertised But the download wont be finished until days and one hour later Whereas if my company had the same data stored on Amazons Glacier the download time would be to hours Moreover I can retrieve up to of my data stored on Glacier for free Googles Nearline costs me one cent per GB along with one cent per month for storage per GB In other words Nearline picks my pocket both coming and going The way Glacier is set up if I or my customers are careful we can remain within the parameters of free retrieval And if were not careful we dont have to pay a toll both ways The final insult offered by Nearline is that if I overwrite or change my data then Nearline considers this an early deletion and hits me with an additional fee That means Nearline is similar to Verizon NYSE VZ ATT NYSE T and all the other phone carrier providers If I opt out early I have to pay a big fat fee All I wanted to do was overwrite some data I wasnt trying to cancel my contract Thus upon closer examination its clear that Googles Nearline is not better than Amazons Glacier In fact Glacier is faster and cheaper than Nealine <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>simply had a slicker marketing campaign And once companies begin to figure this out Amazon will be in the catbird seat when it comes to cloud storage especially since Amazon just purchased lemetry a company that creates IoT Internet of Things solutions involving the interconnection of embedded devices Eventually IoT has the potential of allowing contextaware automation In other words this is heady stuff By purchasing lemetry Bezos is positioning Amazon Web Services as the foremost business cloud storage one that offers analytics storage and connectivity under one roof What does this mean for Amazons stock IoT is projected to become a trillion industry by the year Source Going Long On Amazons AWS Glacier Disclosure The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next
