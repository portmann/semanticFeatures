Increasing competition potentially leading to declining revenue growth Nearing potential market saturation in the US At the end of the Netflix NASDAQ NFLX had million subscribers including million subscribers in the US By comparison Time Warners NYSE TWX HBO had million subscribers globally at the end of including million in the US Netflix grew paid subscribers by versus the previous year including paid subscriber growth in the US Over the past year revenue increased by Over the past six years earnings per share have grown at a compounding annual rate Unfortunately the stock is trading at an outrageously high PE I believe that increased competition and market saturation are going to lead to slowing revenue growth and eventually a falling stock price I plan on avoiding this speculative stock in my portfolio In the chart below Netflixs stock price has run into price resistance at per share and formed a double top Since then the stock price has pulled back There is price support near per share lower than current levels If the stock price breaks below watch out below as investor rush for the exits If it trades back to a more reasonable times earnings the stock could fall below per share lower than the current stock price During Netflix had net income of M versus the current market cap of B If you factor out a M onetime tax accrual resolution Netflix trades at an outrageously expensive PE Despite growing earnings per share at a compounding rate of per year over the past six years you wouldnt know it by looking at the balance sheet Debt and streaming content obligations are growing at an alarming rate and cash flow from operations is almost nonexistent For a company that had total net income of M over the past three years debt is being added at an alarming rate To this point the additional debt has been used to fund the purchase of additional content At the end of there was M of longterm debt Two years later the longterm debt increased to M On the company announced the pricing of an additional B of debt Why is debt building at an alarming rate And where is the positive cash flow from operations Last year cash flow from operations totaled M versus a market cap of B This equate to a market cap that is times last years cash flow If you use a threeyear average of cash flow from operations the market cap to cash flow ratio improves to a still lofty times It appears that net income is a function of content valuation and amortization versus actual cash being generated by the company At the end of Netflix had future content commitments of B versus B at the end of for an increase of Without significant cash flows from operators how is Netflix going to pay for these content obligations Is Netflix building its own house of cards borrowing money to buy content When subscriber growth slows this all falls apart There are currently million households in the US have high speed internet service Given million subscribers in the US Netflix already has captured of potential US customers in the US is not possible considering some households wont subscribe and some will share their login information with other households I think that Netflixs potential is limited to a similar level as HBOs current million US subscriber base about higher than their current level In Netflixs US subscriber growth slowed to versus in There still appears to be room to grow in International markets When investors witness slowing subscriber growth look for Netflixs stock price to plummet back to a more reasonable valuation million US households have exited pay television Many have chosen Netflix as a low cost alternative for TV and movie content Last year Netflixs revenue grew at a rate of versus the previous year Growth seemed unaffected by competition from the likes of Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL YouTube Amazons NASDAQ AMZN Prime Instant Video streaming service or Hulu Pluss per month subscription service Hulu Plus is jointly owned by TwentyFirst Century Fox NASDAQ FOX NASDAQ FOXA Disney NYSE DIS and Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA NASDAQ CMCSK But is future growth going to be affected by the continued onslaught of new competition HBO Staring this month just in time for season of Game of Thrones HBO Now will be available for a month on Apple TV as an exclusive launch partner for HBO Up to this point HBO was only available to those with a pay TV subscription Now it is going to be available as a standalone subscriptionbased streaming service This will go head to head with Netflix with better movies and better original content While the price is higher look for the higher quality content to steal away Netflix customers especially when HBO Now is expanded to companies like Roku <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google

endless and growing Check out Roku s apps with free TV and movie content including Bloomberg TV PBS PBS kids and Crackle When investing in stocks my most important metrics are earnings and cash flows relative to the stock price factoring in the expected rate of future earnings growth There are a number of investors or speculators that are willing to completely ignore these metrics and focus only on revenue growth and stock price momentum In the late s we saw this same story When growth begins to slow and the momentum stock breaks technical resistance levels these overpriced stocks fell fast While it is possible that some of these companies grow into these valuations over time it also rather unlikely Netflix has a great product and offers value for the customer but the earnings and cash flow dont justify the stock price In NFLX earned per share for trailing PE ratio For every invested your share of earnings was for a earnings yield Dont be long this stock when this house of cards
