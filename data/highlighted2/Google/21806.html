Pragmatic Look At Facebook Facebook NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Young Americans remain hooked on the FacebookInstagram duopoly Organic investments bold acquisitions longterm growth potential The following analysis provides a reasonable look at the strengths and weaknesses associated with Facebook Inc NASDAQ FB Overall I found plenty of bullish indicators For example according to the capital asset pricing model the stock is currently trading at a steep discount to present value In addition growth is high both in terms of users and revenue margins are extraordinary and necessary investments are being made to support the companys longterm success On the other hand however I do not believe management has faced nearly enough scrutiny by investors regarding certain investments overseas in particular the initiative to bring Internet access to very remote populations Whether Facebook should be worth billion is ultimately up to you My goal is to provide meaningful assistance in making that decision It looks like momentum is building With marketing expenditures now totaling as much as trillion globally Facebook is in a favorable position The social media juggernaut recently posted billion in quarterly revenue beating analyst estimates of billion and marking a YOY gain A significant proportion of this revenue was derived from mobile advertising to be exact of total ad sales in the fourth quarter of Facebooks ultimate success still depends on the American youth At its beginning recall that the social network was made exclusive to college students and with good reason This group does after all represent the trendsetters of our society They are the cool kids The crowd with a knack for inspiring old and young alike to change their ways Everyone else annoying little brother mom dad grandma even the guy from Singapore is merely a follower As a result the cultural hegemony of American twentysomethings both at home and abroad is not something to be taken lightly Good thing the FacebookInstagram duopoly remains their social media of choice No other social networking site is a viable a threat The closest alternative Twitter NYSE TWTR almost looks like a joke in comparison Who actually Tweets uptotheminute status updates about the most trivial of daily activities That is largely a thing of the past for trendsetting year olds Instead they prefer taking Instagram selfies and laughing at silly videos or stories shared on Facebook from around the Web Investors can expect to see downward pressure on margins coming soon Costs are continuing to grow in particular for servers storage power data centers security systems and talent to support anticipated future growth In the meantime Facebook is struggling to monetize emerging market users the source of rising costs In fact a whopping percent of revenue is generated in North America and Europe where just percent of users are located In addition at the expense of his shareholders Zuckerberg remains hellbent on providing Internet access to everything that breathes Whether designing unmanned aircraft that can beam internet access down to people from the sky or attempting to evangelize potential partners in the virtues of free connectivity Mark seems determined to see this project to its end He made it clear during a recent conference call When confronted by an analyst on why investors should care about investments to connect African countries the young CEO responded It matters to the kind of investors we want to have Negative Zuckerberg You no longer run a private company Like it or not as Chief Executive and Chairman of the Board you owe a fiduciary responsibility of longterm profit maximization to minority shareholders And since users in emerging markets are already tough to monetize I do not see profitability behind spending time and money provisioning Internet access in least developed countries Investors need to beware the considerable variation in per capita income between emerging markets and least developed countries the latter of which hold almost no potential to generate ad revenue Before IT infrastructure can yield any real value for these parts of the world they first need to develop sound political legal financial and energy infrastructures If Mark really believes in the value of his cause perhaps he should start a charitable foundation instead of being philanthropic with other peoples money To provide some benchmark comparisons I compute key industry ratios from a group of plus firms sorted by Open Systems Interconnection model communality These companies like Facebook essentially provide a service to their users via the application layer of the OSI model Some popular examples include but of course are not limited to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO LinkedIn NYSE LNKD Twitter Pandora NYSE P and Zillow NASDAQ Z Thus we can think of this industry as web applications I choose to do it this way because in my opinion it is best to compare Internet companies relative to other Internet companies as opposed to tech firms in general According to my best estimate Facebook is about below the industry average trailing twelve month priceearnings Because investors should prefer to pay less today for a dollar tomorrow this is a good sign However despite impressive revenue growth the companys pricesales ratio is still about x the average Normally this would be a major drawback However the reason investors are likely willing to pay more for lower revenue in the shortterm is because they expect a major increase over the longhaul Make of it what you will Facebook yields a very unattractive pricebook According to my estimates the company is currently about above average Not a good sign Historically firms with higherthanaverage booktomarket ratios also provided higherthanaverage returns Research and development key to the success of many technology companies is apparently very important to Facebook as well To that end the firm devotes approximately of sales vs an industry average of roughly According to their most recent annual report RD increased almost threefold to billion in Q This capital mainly went toward accelerating development within its acquisitions such as WhatsApp Instagram and Oculus Rift A smaller portion also was used to improve inhouse messaging products and video services However to consider RD on its own could be misleading If the goal is to determine the degree to which management upholds a longterm outlook then we really need to look at the reinvestment rate which accounts for acquisitions in addition to RD Reinvestment rate net capital expenditures change in WC EBIT t I calculate the reinvestment rate for all tech companies by first subtracting RD from operating costs and then adding it back to capital expenditures on the statement of cash flows It makes intuitive sense Why should RD which yields a future cash flow just like any other investment be classified in the same boat as overhead expenses Facebooks reinvestment rate like RDsales comes in wellabove average Management is obviously very confident about the firms longterm prospects According to the annual report cash used in investing activities during primarily resulted from billion for the acquisition of businesses and billion for capital expenditures related to network infrastructure and the construction of data centers and office buildings Even in the face of a bold investment regime Facebooks leverage is below average On its face this might be puzzling especially given a reinvestment rate almost x earnings Just remember that acquisitions a large component of the reinvestment rate are mostly paid for by issuing stock In that sense equity for a highgrowth firm like Facebook also serves as a form of currency whereby issuing more of it can raise the reinvestment rate to multiple times earnings Margins are definitely attractive However as previously noted these are likely to decline a bit going forward especially the operating margin Supporting more growth will come with higher costs overall In the grand scheme of things there are only two things investors should care about How much a stock is fundamentally worth How much it currently trades for A good way to determine how much you should be willing to give up today in exchange for a dollar in the future is via discounted cash flow analysis Following this logic assume the discounted present value of Facebook can be defined by the following n the number of holding periods which in our case is one year The tricky part is coming up with a required rate of return There are quite a few ways to do so For simplicity lets use the capital asset pricing model which is defined by the following equation ERi Expected return on the individual asset Rf Return on a riskfree asset such as Treasury securities To calculate Rm Rf market risk premium I took the total return of SP firms dividends capital gains minus the total return on the compounded value of invested in a year Treasury bond at the beginning of It would be inappropriate to only take the logarithmic return on the SP as I am sure many people do when calculating returns Likewise although the average interest on a year Treasury was roughly during it actually yielded as a result of increased demand closer to when accounting for capital appreciation attributable to those holding the asset from the beginning to end of the year Thus I came up with the following Note that there are limitations to my chosen approach for calculating riskfree rates For instance rates on longdated Treasury bonds likely yield a slight premium to compensate for duration risk Also keep in mind that we are attempting to estimate how much something is worth in the future using data from last year There is a slim chance for example that interest rates going forward will decline and lead to substantial riskfree gains as happened in previous years Moreover this assumption is consistent with Malkiels Fifth Theorem which dictates that the magnitude of a price increase caused by a decrease in yield is greater than a price decrease caused by an increase in yield Taken together I suggest we use an as opposed to required rate of return as the best approximation Discounting the oneyear price target at yields a present value of approximately per share Consequently numerous implications can be drawn First investors should be willing to buy at any price below This is because anything yielded from todays price up to would represent an asymmetric reward Likewise any gain as a result of holding from to the oneyear price target of would just be compensation for risk Secondly no one should be willing to pay more than All of this is obviously very subjective so feel free to adjust the price target as you see fit However even going with an extremely conservative price target discounted present value still comes in at exceeding todays market price I recommend against messing with the discount rate too much Facebook is trading far below its discounted present value As a result therein lay the possibility of an asymmetric reward Investors also must seriously consider the longterm prospects of the company In that regard there are many bright spots Necessary investments are being made both organically and through acquisitions to ensure the companys longterm survival Furthermore the social media conglomerate has no real competition Young Americans are still hooked both on Facebook and increasingly
