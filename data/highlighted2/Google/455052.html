am one They started this last year to be like a Christmas in July From a sales perspective it was great for Amazon From a consumer prospective it was highly hit or miss Being a Prime member I decided to jump onto Amazon to see what all the hullabaloo was about Amazon did have some good deals here and there but they were gone lightening quick Funny they are called Lightening Deals on the Prime Day page Instead of just talking about different Prime Day deals I wanted to show you how to actually score the best deals before they are wiped out by other Prime shoppers It can be hard to do but I saw something last year that worked quite well so wanted to share it with you If you havent heard about this little shopping event its relatively new If you have heard about it then skip down to what you really want to know Only one year under their belt and the first one was a little blah Basically Amazon decided to run a sales event just for those who are Prime members They sent out emails hyping the event and the press coverage was great If you were a Prime member you got to see deals on available for you to buy You could get good deals on TVs clothing electronics books and many other things Amazon decided to run Prime Day again but this time they are promising over deals to be had They will focus largely on televisions but with many other products as well I think their TV selection sales were really popular last year so it seems like a good move on their part to bring more of those to the tableWell see what other types of deals they come up with but they plan on outdoing last year The key caveat to this day is its only available to those who are Prime members If youre not already one the good news is you can sign up for a free Amazon Prime trial for days This means you can sign up just for Prime Day and then cancel it afterward if you dont really want to use it To be honest Im interested to see how they source their deals this year If you didnt see it last year there was a big disappointment for many consumers So much so the hashtag Amazonfail was trending on social media for days The main reason is the really good deals on things people want were going so quickly it was hard to get in on the deal I bought an Amazon Fire TV Stick and a GPS sports watch for my wife These were difficult to get and I only got them by watching the Amazon site for a few hours Yes I was supposed to be working this was before I quit my job but everyone else in the office was doing the same thing We even saw the CEO doing it Most of the other deals were on items many people didnt want Youd see underwear industrial drums of lubrication yep that one went around the press Adam Sandler movies junk electronics no one had ever seen It seemed Amazon was using Prime Day to liquidate much of their stock to get it clear for Christmas This might still be the case but Ill take a look this year How to Get the Best Deals Before They Disappear Alright this is what you came here for right You want to know how to get the best deals before they get swiped up by other shoppers I was in the same boat last year until I found out what a few of my friends were doing I wish I was in on the secret or just method So for this years Prime Day Im going to share this awesomely simple technique to get the good deals before they are gone in a flash Basically youre going to create a Prime Day team or tribe What do I mean about this Well let me break it down and how some of my friends got some of the best deals available without doing too much work Just like with Black Friday shopping with a team is much easier and quicker This is why it works for Amazons Prime Day You want to get a group of people who also plan to shop on Amazon and are Prime members If they arent you can get them to sign up for free trial and then they can join The key to this is find friends family coworkers or anyone else you know who lives in different parts of the country You see Prime Day starts at am PST so am EST on Most people arent going to be up at this time but if they are typically the West Coast will have first dibs on these deals As people across the country wake up on the East Coast gets first crack at the morning deals followed through the time zones until the West Coast If you have multiple people on your team who live in different time zones then you have a distinct advantage Make sure you have people you trust on your team as people are going to be buying products as they find them for other members of the group Make sure you know you will get paid by the other people for your purchases Luckily you can easily return them if you dont You might be wondering about shipping The good thing about Amazon is you can get items shipped almost anywhere especially if you label them as gifts You can also put a new shipping address in your account to have the items shipped to different locations The big caveat to this is when you can only purchase one of a deal not all deals are like this You would just need a team member to send out the link to the other parts of the group if its a deal people are looking for If you cant get people in different parts of the country that is OK too Some of my friends last year banded together to watch Amazon during the day so they had more eyes and opportunity to get the good deals This is really important when trying to grab those good deals What good is a teamtribe if you dont know what the other is looking for There are actually a few ways to deal with this Group Messenger Someone strike up a conversation with the group on Facebook Most people are on Facebook these days so this might be your best option You can add a bunch of people to a group chat This way everyone is in the loop and the deals found can be shouted out easily This is what some of my friends did Someone would find a deal tell the group and then those people who wanted it would grab it Group Texts Same premise as above but with text messaging This is a little harder if you want to buy your stuff on a computer but you can easily purchase stuff from Amazon on your mobile phone Their site is very well mobile optimized <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Docs You can setup a collaborative document through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>that people can type their wantsneeds on for other group members to find Since the updates are pretty instant you can see what other people have typed to see if you can find that deal I have seen this type of method work for a few friends last year They basically just teamed up to get more eyes on Amazon and get to the best deals as fast as they could Are you going to miss some deals Yes you will If you have good communication like group messages or texts then you can easily talk about the deals found and pass around the links to others to purchase them If you think this is a crazy little shopping event and would rather just deal with easier ways then know that Walmart does their own style where they just roll back prices for the day No membership required and it was quite popular last year You just have to head over to Walmartcom as its only on their online store
