why Teslas billion valuation is absurd especially given the companys unrelenting cash burn and mounting debt In short investing in Tesla is as foolish as buying an overpriced lottery ticket and expecting to win Innovation it is said is the engine of economic progress While this might be true people who invest in innovation rarely get rewarded Take the car Its one of the most important inventions in the history of mankind Had you seen at the time of the first cars the enormous positive impact theyd one day have on the world youd have said This is the place to be But you wouldnt have been more wrong In the US alone for instance some car companies have come and gone since the late s Only the big three Chrysler NYSE FCAU Ford NYSE F and General Motors NYSE GM survive today Two of these three also went bankrupt but unfortunately were bailed out Even Ford the only true survivor was on the verge of bankruptcy at one point Given this nearly failure rate the longterm odds of success for the young electric car maker Tesla NASDAQ TSLA are close to nil Thats what the statistics say anyway Unfortunately such facts are often ignored in the investment world Which explains why Teslas stock price is defying the laws of probability with an absurd billion valuation Perhaps if the stocks fundamentals justified its price tag this could be overlooked But they dont Tesla has been hemorrhaging ever larger amounts of cash since its founding more than a decade ago It burnt through billion in free cash flow in alone and theres little evidence that things will improve going forward This is a very serious problem given that Teslas billion of cash on hand is only enough to fund operations for about six to eight months To make it to the end of the company will be forced to do another equity raise andor pile on even more debt to an already overleveraged balance sheet Unless some kind of miracle occurs bankruptcy is inevitable billion cash on hand to million monthly cash burn to months survival without additional cash infusion Adding the million of untapped credit to the equation stretches out Teslas survival to just over a year This isnt the first time Tesla has been in this situation In late the company literally came within hours of bankruptcy before luckily landing a new round of funding that helped keep it afloat CEO Elon Musk later admitted he didnt think Tesla would survive that things were probably fing doomed This neardeath episode was repeated in In a desperate attempt to save the company Musk tried to sell it to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL for billion a lot less than shareholders might have expected Fortunately once again sufficient lastminute rescue money came in to save the day and buyout negotiations with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>ceased Today Tesla finds itself in another similar cashstrapped situation Whether or not Lady Luck will come to the rescue this time is difficult to know What is known however is that theres only so much debt a company can sustain with billion of debt not including offbalance sheet debt Tesla is fast approaching that limit But the bulls refuse to acknowledge this reality just read the comments below to see what I mean Theyve become so hypnotized by the Tesla growth story theyre completely missing the financial disaster unfolding before them All they seem to focus on is this fantasy that one day in the distant and uncertain future Tesla will become massively profitable and its stock price will shoot to the sky Lets play devils advocate and say the bulls are proven right Tesla doesnt only survive but thrives Over the next couple of years its revenue triples from billion to billion and EBIT goes from negative million to positive billion thats an EBIT margin of roughly twice the industry average Even with these extremely optimistic growth and profitability assumptions Tesla would still be selling for x EBIT based on the current price Thats more than three times the industry average of only x EBIT The absurdity of Teslas valuation becomes even more pronounced when we compare it to the valuation of a large wellestablished car maker like Ford Ford generated times more revenue than Tesla in billion vs only billion To put things even more in perspective Fords billion in free cash flow is nearly equal to the sum of all the revenue generated by Tesla since its inception billion Given these drastic financial differences Ford should be valued substantially higher than Tesla But thats not the case Fords billion market value isnt even twice that of Teslas billion market value This can mean one of two things either Ford is massively undervalued or Tesla is massively overvalued The latter is most likely true No matter how you look at it the fact is that Tesla is a foolish longterm bet For the current valuation to make sense Tesla doesnt just have to survive in an industry with a survival rate but it also must deliver longterm doubledigit top and bottom line growth Is this impossible No But it is highly unlikely Intelligent investing is about making bets when the odds are in your favor doing the reverse is a losing strategy I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business
