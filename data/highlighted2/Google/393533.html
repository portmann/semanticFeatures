class='textDiv'>COLUMNAmazon the FTC and the dark art of corporate secrecy in court Frankel Reuters Related Stocks Regulatory News Markets The court system in this country is supposed to be open to the public Thats a core principle codified in the First Amendment and centuries of common law Yet American corporations constantly push to restrict access to court records Once in a while media organizations or public interest groups get involved and orders to seal turn into First Amendment blowouts but those cases are increasingly likely to be exceptions Far more often no one stands up in opposition when a corporation asks to seal or redact court filings A summary judgment opinion issued Wednesday in a Federal Trade Commission case against Amazon is the latest example of what these routine deletions cost the public As my Reuters colleagues Diane Bartz and Dan Levine reported US District Judge John Coughenour of Seattle determined that Amazon is liable to the parents of children who bought items like a boatload of doughnuts a can of stars and bars of gold while playing supposedly free apps Exact damages are still to be decided the judge said but the millions of dollars billed to Amazon customers without a mechanism for consent the thousands of customers complaining about unauthorized charges and the time spent seeking refunds for those charges all demonstrate substantial injury And Amazons strategy was no accident according to the opinion When it developed the Kindle Fire tablet Amazon targeted soccer parents as a key customer base describing them as lowhanging fruit In a marketing document discussing inapp purchases which the opinion cites Amazon admitted it knew children were spending their parents real money on inapp purchases without their parents knowledge As one Amazon employee explained If a parent gives the device to a child and the child is playing the game and they they just decide you know outside of the parents view or whatever to purchase they could do that Judge Coughenour wrote Within a couple months of Amazons launch of inapp purchasing in late parents were complaining in droves Amazon fielded requests for refunds the opinion said prompting an Amazon employee to state the obvious Were clearly causing problems for a large percentage of our customers You wouldnt know any of the details in the preceding three paragraphs if you just read the public version of the opinion Judge Coughenour issued Wednesday Theyve all been blacked out Its only because of a glitch in the execution of the redactions that were able to see the text beneath the black redaction tape As other sites have explained the redacted text appears if you copy the opinion and paste it into a Word file After word of the glitch got out the judges chambers pulled the redacted opinion from the courts electronic docket I could not ascertain who decided what to black out in Judge Coughenours opinion I emailed FTC counsel Amazon lawyers from Venable and Perkins Coie and Judge Coughenours courtroom deputy to ask I heard back only from J Douglas Baldridge of Venable who declined to comment Several months into the case which was filed in Amazon and the FTC jointly proposed an order to keep supposedly confidential discovery materials under seal The judge signed the order in January Later in the case when both sides filed motions for summary judgment Amazon and the FTC each asked the judge to keep some accompanying exhibits confidential Both requests involved material Amazon wanted to keep under wraps the FTC doesnt seem to have protested Amazons assertion that internal corporate memos cited in the governments summary judgment brief should be sealed Judge Coughenours sealing orders duly noted the presumption of public access but nevertheless granted the Amazon and FTC confidentiality motions Corporate strategic planning and financial information he said is of a sensitive enough nature that it outweighs the de minimus public interest in access Really A de minimus public interest in the details of Amazons corporate strategy to entice children to spend millions of dollars of their unwitting parents money in order to play supposedly free games Amazon has now eliminated unauthorized inapp purchases on all devices except its obsolete firstgeneration Kindles as Judge Coughenour acknowledged when he said the FTC is not entitled to an injunction against Amazon The th US Circuit Court of Appeals said in its magisterial Company Doe ruling in a corporation has no right to claim secrecy just because court filings might damage its reputation no more than say the wouldbe adulterers who wanted to keep their names out of a class action against the Ashley Madison website Amazon and the FTC are at odds over the FTCs damages model which estimated Amazons revenue from unauthorized inapp purchases to be million based on an extrapolation involving failed password entries Amazon says that model is completely unreliable The judge has ordered additional briefing But he has already concluded in words the public was not intended to see that Amazon caused millions of dollars of injury to thousands of customers That seems like more than a de minimus public interest Amazon competitors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Apple stayed out of court when the FTC accused them of similarly luring kids to buy fake glittery game currency with real money Apple settled for at least million in January <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>consented to a million settlement the following September The FTC filed its complaint against Amazon in July between the Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>settlements Its a safe assumption that Amazon and the FTC also had presuit settlement talks but unlike Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>decided to take its chances in court Had Amazon settled with the FTC before its case went to litigation it could have kept its awkward documents out of public view The company wanted to have things both ways to go to court and keep ticklish materials under seal It very nearly got what it wanted The Knight Foundation reported earlier this month that the journalism industry is too financially strapped to lead the First Amendment fight for access to court records Public interest groups also have limited resources That leaves judges as the guardians of the publics right to know a burden too many judges shrug off Reporting by Alison Frankel Editing by Alessandra Rafferty News and Media Division of
