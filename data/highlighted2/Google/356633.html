Amazon Thirdparty sellers are flocking to Amazon and driving down prices providing value to customers Did you know nearly half of all of the items you order from Amazon NASDAQ AMZN dont come from Amazon itself Thats right Over of units that are shipped are actually sold by a thirdparty seller on Amazon This amounted to more than billion units Even better these units are actually more profitable for Amazon than when it ships its own inventoried units No other company comes even close to matching the depth selection price and number of sellers than Amazon Lets take a deep look at this side of the business There are roughly million sellers on Amazon many of which are small mom and pop businesses that are running out of their garagehome There are however a number of significant enterprises building their business on Amazon There are sellers that do hundreds of millions of dollars in sales on the Amazon platform and are growing quite rapidly And there are lots of them It is astonishing how much revenue growth these sellers have experienced Revenue and order growth are growing double digits year after year and this is a very profitable business from Amazon as compared to even their own operation I have noticed most thirdparty sellers are now using Amazons FBA Fulfillment by Amazon service that has driven sales growth This includes all of the largest sellers that are in the article above In fact most of them are literally FBA FBA allows sellers three advantages Utilize Amazons world class fulfillment and customer service experience The FBA program is extremely unique compared to any other marketplace There is no other marketplace eBay NASDAQ EBAY WalMart NYSE WMT Best Buy NYSE BBY etc where the marketplace fulfills items on behalf of the seller That is why these marketplaces are not growing nearly as rapidly only experienced sellers with fulfillment capabilities can operate According to Amazon using FBA allows a seller to basically worry only about supplying product into Amazon centers and cost control They do not spend time on customer service returns shipping etc This is great for the seller because they can offer more competitive prices because they are utilizing the low costs of Amazons fulfillment network How does Amazon benefit from ThirdParty Sellers Amazon realizes huge benefits as their thirdparty marketplace grows Some of these include Selection Thirdparty merchants provide an incredible amount of selection and increase customer choice Competitive pricing Prices come down to very attractive levels to most consumers due to intense competition Inventory ownership Amazon does not own or take risk of the inventory that is being sold on Amazon Supply chain and logistic cost reductions Thirdparty sellers increase the volume of packages being shipped and received thereby achieving greater economies of scale Amazon builds a huge moat around their retail business which is extremely profitable The below chart by RW Baird demonstrates how powerful thirdparty sellers are in some categories of the product selection is actually coming from thirdparty sellers There are tens of thousands of new sellers every year and prices continued to get driven down by intense competition This can be seen because prices are competitive down to the penny The seller that has a lower price by even one cent wins the Buy Box and gets all of the sales You can imagine what that does to the price So while competition is incredibly intense for sellers it creates a wonderful situation for the consumer who benefits from a wide selection at a competitive price This obviously helps Amazon even more This moat is ignored frequently as most of the discussion around Amazon lies on how much they are investing in new warehouses new phone development costs etc However Amazon is quietly but surely strengthening this moat by opening up marketplaces around the world There are now thirdparty marketplaces in the US Canada Europe Japan India and China ThirdParty Sales are Extremely Profitable For most items Amazon actually makes more profit from selling a thirdparty item then from selling their own instock item even for the same item Lets take a look at all of the profits that Amazon collects from a thirdparty sale Amazon charges anywhere between to thirdparty sellers for most categories outside of electronics Amazon charges fulfillment fees for those items fulfilled through them FBA Sellers are charged a per order per item and a weight based fee This covers much of the fulfillment cost of an order Amazon charges sellers to utilize the real estate of Amazon fulfillment centers Essentially Amazon has become a huge warehouse REIT that is massively profitable They are charging anywhere between per cubic foot per month Amazon is typically locating their warehouses in rural areas where land is extremely cheap Charging this kind of rent brings in incredible profits Amazon makes a profit from all of the shipments that come into their fulfillment centers as most sellers are utilizing Amazons rates to ship their products Amazon potentially double charges for shipping if a customer ends up placing an order with a shipping charge Amazon charges the seller a fee to fulfill and the customer also pays for shipping even though one package is sent With thirdparty sales growing at over yoy during the Christmas quarter there is a lot to look forward to I can certainly see the perspective of many investors that focus on how many billions of dollars Amazon is investing into new areas and how the company is not profitable Throughout its history critics have said it wont be able to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL in product search Apple NASDAQ AAPL in electronics or WalMart NYSE WMT in retail But as time has passed they have proven to be quite strong in all of them If Amazon continues to focus on developing moats in the industries it is focusing on then we should see outsized profits in the future It took years and hundreds of millions of dollars in losses to develop a marketplace that now brings in roughly billion in revenue half of billion in merchandise revenue Cloud brought in almost billion last year and analysts estimate that it could be a billion business in the future Investors need to pay attention to those efforts that Amazon is continuing to invest in Cloud Media Prime Retail in order to develop a moat They are very successful and longterm oriented so one may want to avoid investing in other companies in these segments Equally important one may want to consider investments in the segments where Amazon has shut down or given up on mobile phones luxury clothing travel payments daily deals I wrote this article myself
