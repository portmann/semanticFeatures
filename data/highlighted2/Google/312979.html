know it by looking at their stock lately Since January th the stock has fallen from per share to its current value of Today alone the stock has shed per share or However is this an opportunity in the making In my opinion it is the key is entrance timing Today well talk about why AMZN is falling so hard how far the decline is likely to go and what we can expect to see moving forward So lets get right to it As mentioned above Amazon started to spiral downward on January th It was on this day that the company reported its earnings for the most recent quarter after the closing bell Unfortunately earnings were far from expectations creating investor fear and leading to massive declines Heres what we saw from the report Earnings Per Share In terms of earnings per share AMZN disappointed investors While analysts expected to see the company generate earnings in the amount of per share the company actually produced earnings more than below expectations at per share Revenue Unfortunately for AMZN top line revenue also came in well below expectations In the quarter analysts expected that the company would generate billion per share Unfortunately AMZN generated billion in topline revenue in the quarter Is Amazon Destined To Continue Falling Following earnings AMZN fell dramatically in value In fact the stock has dropped more than per share in the past couple of weeks So is Amazon destined to continue falling In my opinion the answer is no In fact in this particular case its relatively easy for me to look past the negative earnings report Heres why I have such a strong bullish opinion of what we can expect to see moving forward Make a killing trading penny stocks Learn how today AWS First and foremost lets chat about AWS also known as Amazon Web Services AWS is a cloud based service used for storing data hosting websites apps and more More importantly the product is growing incredibly quickly in popularity In fact when we first heard about AWS in early AMZN announced that it had already grown to be a billion company This is huge considering the massive growth weve seen in the industry At this rate AMZN is in the lead in one of the fastest growing emerging markets that ever existed Amazons Infrastructure Another reason my opinion of AMZN is so bullish is the companys infrastructure In late Amazon started to spend massive amounts of money on infrastructure In fact the company was spending so much money that investors started to get concerned and the stock started to fall in value However at this point these investments are starting to pay off in a big way As more and more consumers shop online one of the biggest driver for these consumers to chose one website over another is shipping times Because of the vast infrastructure that AMZN has created it logs the fastest shipping times among online retailers as a whole This will help Amazon to solidify its leadership role in online retail Amazon Prime Finally Amazon Prime is likely to be another big driver of growth for the stock While at per year per account in exchange for free shipping streaming video and more seems like a loss the details are shocking A large percentage of Prime members spend more than per year or more at AMZN Thats a huge number that will lead to huge profits While I have an overwhelmingly bullish of what we will see from AMZN in the long run my short term view is a bit different The reality is that investors move the market and investors are currently afraid to move the needle up on AMZN So Im expecting further declines on the stock in the near future However soon it will reach support Im expecting for this to happen around per share or so Once it reaches this point chances are that it will be an incredibly good time to buy Where do you
