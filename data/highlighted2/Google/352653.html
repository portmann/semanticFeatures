Submitted by Mike Krieger via Liberty Blitzkrieg blog The results represent a clear victory for Wall Street over Main Street according to the team of Michael Hartnett BofAs chief investment strategist Zero rates and asset purchases of central banks have thus far proved much more favorable to Wall Street capitalists shadow banks unicorns and so on than it has for Main Street workers savers banks and the jobs market the BofA team wrote From the post Bank of America Admits Central Bank Policy Enriched Wall Street While Steamrolling Main Street Recently Vanity Fair sat down with well known venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya to get his take on the state of affairs in unicorn land Palihapitiyas firm Social Capital has backed numerous tech companies with valuations in the billions such as Slack Box and SurveyMonkey But that doesnt mean that he is bullish on unicorn culture Here Palihapitiya speaks aboutMark Zuckerbergssecret sauce which startups are going to make it and the saga between Apple and the FBI among other topics Funding is slowing down both in seed rounds and megarounds There have been fewer tech IPOs recently more companies are raising down rounds Are we in a downturn I think were in a phase where were realizing that the people who have been allocating capital thus far have done a horrendous job Most peoples inherent reaction is to make sure they never lose their job and so they become riskaverse I think what weve had is a handful of investors who have extreme vision who make great investments in things that are amazing businesses Facebook <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Uber And then everybody else reacts to that success by trying to do the thing that most approximates the thing thats working As a result most of those businesses are fundamentally not good theyre poorly run and they never should have been invested in in the first place But the capital came in because the person who had control of the capital was able to justify it intellectually to themselves versus something else that could have become the next Facebook or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>The reality is great companies can go public in any market When we talk about the IPO slowdowns what were really saying is that there really just arent that many good companies being built We need to divorce ourselves from venture capital as an occupation and focus on using capital as a way to take really big bets on things that just seem totally audacious Right now we havent done enough of that and the result is that most of the things weve funded are mostly crap and largely worthless What advice are you giving Social Capitals portfolio companies in the event of a tech bubble burst or correction Were trying to coach our CEOs that the window dressing is both expensive from a cash perspective and tremendously expensive from a culture perspective It distracts the team from building what they need to build Dont waste money on things that get away from your mission which confuse employees about why theyre actually there Meaning the quality of the office and the quality of the food are all part and parcel of a lack of discipline which speaks to the fact that the mission isnt compelling enough Because I can tell you what it was like at early Facebook the food was terrible wed ship in lunch and probably two to three times a week the lunch had maggots in it But we were there because we believed and it didnt matter A number of VCs have been calling on mature latestage companies to go public Theres even been somewhat of a quiet rally in the public tech stocks recently Is now the time for big latestage companies to go public or does it make sense for companies to stay private longer Any company that is making its decision based on external timing is probably not in control of their own destiny and should probably not go public Facebook could have gone public whenever it wanted We decided the right time was It could have easily been or When you hear the call for these companies to go public and theres pushback and they dont whats really happening is the realization that the structural strength of their business is not yet in place So theyre worried about how the public market will react once they have to transparently demonstrate what their business will look like The great companies can always go public whenever they want every other company is trying for some window of time where theres essentially some combination of intellectual laziness and greed in the public markets that will
