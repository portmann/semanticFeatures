tech firms track your location advertisers zero in for the sale Reuters Related Stocks Markets Technology SAN FRANCISCO July By Yasmeen Abutaleb SAN FRANCISCO July Mapping technology advancements from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Inc and Facebook Inc that provide more precise user location data than ever before are starting to dent advertisers longtime skepticism about boosting mobile ad spending In recent years major retailers have restricted mobile to percent or less of their ad budgets because of difficulty gauging their effectiveness and a limited ability to target shoppers by location Targeting is now much easier to the extent that a consumer walking past a given retail outlet can receive ads in his or her Facebook or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>app showcasing some particular product available at that store perhaps offering a discount coupon to lure them inside That is a tantalizing prospect for companies if it leads to actual sales Gauging the ads ultimate effectiveness remains a challenge And privacy advocates say the location tracking and targeting is intrusive and gives companies too much ability to track users movements over time Its unfair for the companies to pull data from the user this way said Marc Rotenberg president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center But for Facebook and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>there are early signs the new technology is already paying off Six advertising firm executives representing more than clients combined told Reuters in interviews that clients have invested significantly more since the holiday season in mobile ads as a result of this new technology In some cases these advertisers including major retailers they declined to name are investing up to percent of their advertising budgets on mobile ads four times as much as at the end of last year With consumers spending more time on smartphones <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>said in May that mobile searches outstripped desktop searches in the US and nine other countries millions if not billions of dollars are at stake in winning advertisers over to mobile platforms Facebook and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>are widely considered to be at the forefront of this shift <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>claimed percent of US mobile ad revenue share in and Facebook had percent according to data from research firm eMarketer Twitter which had the thirdlargest share was far behind with percent of the share Other tech companies that cannot keep up risk losing a share of the fastestgrowing part of the advertising industry US mobile ad spending more than doubled in to billion and is projected to increase percent in to billion according to eMarketer Responding to privacy experts concerns Facebook said it uses privacyprotecting measures when targeting users to ensure location data is not misused <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>declined to comment for this story Advertisers say they are aware of consumers privacy concerns But federal and state laws do not regulate location data and collection While this new effort has improved mobile ads it is still difficult to show their effectiveness On desktop computers advertisers can easily see who clicked on their ads and made purchases whereas it is nearly impossible to prove a mobile ad drove someone to a store Facebook and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>have advanced that technology by offering more precise location targeting but in many cases are still unable to show whether a mobile ad drove instore traffic Facebook said that it is determined to prove to businesses that mobile ads drive people into their stores The company can sometimes determine if the ads drove purchases by looking at instore sales and matching them to the number of times an ad is clicked on mobile If they are able to crack that code there are going to be a lot of retailers investing a lot It wont just be the Macys and Walmarts that have the money
