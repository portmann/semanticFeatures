same thing using what Slope patron saint George Carlin lovingly described as simple direct honest language Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site As readers will recall one of the bullish catalysts that pushed the market off its August ETFlash Crash lows was an email sent by Tim Cook to Jim Cramer of all people one which still hasnt been Ked in which AAPLs CEO said the following I get updates on our performance in China every day including this morning and I can tell you that we have continued to experience strong growth for our business in China through July and August Growth in iPhone activations has actually accelerated over the past few weeks and we have had the best performance of the year for the App Store in China during the last weeks As we subsequently showed using channel check data from GfK looking at AAPL Chinese sellthroughs the realty was vastly different Five months later Tim Cook was forced to finally admit the truth when on last nights conference call he said that we began to see some signs of economic softness in Greater China earlier this month most notably in Hong Kong Alas Cook was once again disingenuous by saying that softness appears only earlier this month because as we again showed in early in November AAPL had cut component orders with its core suppliers by as much as a clear indication it was well aware of Chinese weakness ahead of time But all that is in the past and what AAPL longs want now is some clarity that the future is not only stable but improving Alas they wont get it According to Brightwire one of Chinas top online vendors JDcom has just cut the prices of Apple products by as much as in sale ahead of Chinese New Year or precisely the time when there should be no need for heavy discounting As Brightwire adds JDcom cut prices of Apple products on the internet marketplace by as much as according to information on the JD website Customers can also purchase Apple products in monthly installments with no interest charges and no downpayment Among the discounts iPad Air tablet with GB memory is priced at CNY USD compared with CNY on the Apple online store in China The iPhone s Plus handset with GB memory is priced at CNY compared with the official price of CNY The special sale ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday will span from Jan to Feb according to JDcom The internet company also gives out cash coupons for purchases of a certain amount The question is whether once the discount period runs out and the much neded demand fails to materialize how much greater will AAPLs margincrushing discounts have to get for already waning topline momentum to persist For many former AAPL bulls the answer is irrelevant and with the stock now from its all time highs they have decided to pack up and leave Wed FlipFlop Which are the best news sources for business and economics Here people seem to be ahead of curve I became curious of good news sites to follow Braeburn Capital was at B as of last April The master repackagers have a big stash to their name and are ramping up like crazy in both construction and hiring I drove by the spaceship for the first time in a few months Holy shit that thing has taken form and it is huge Some employees are supposed to work there Cupertino will need to build new skools for the kids of the K employees about to cram themselves into residential Cupertino quite shortly The iPoop age will come to an end in some fashion or another come on wont you feel silly buying that iPhone for fvcks sake but I think Apples got the cash to burn through the next few years trying to maintain their packaging superiority in of obsolescent products whatever they may be Wed LawsofPhysics Wed Dubaibanker Same in Dubai since launching months gao both S and s plus prices have been dropping on a monthly basisdont even ask about s and Apple products just like PCs in the s have become commodities that can be replicated by any Chinese company employing slave labor Wed bamawatson Wed Father Thyme Wed Macon Richardson And I submit that yours is a most illegitimate question a bastard of a question a whores son I submit that you personally have no knowledge whatsoever of working conditions in China and are just talking through your ass Wed Canadian Renegade Apple is also losing market share because their product sucks They expect that iPhone users will remain brand loyal even though they refuse to make simple yet user friendly changes to their phones like micro SD cards and removable batteries Instead forcing their customers to buy more expensive phones with larger memories or pay for a cloud storage subscription service When the batteries go bad after a couple years it is cheaper to just buy a new phone Which is what they want Too bad many people switch to android at that point Also last I checked over a year since I checked you could not download and install apps except off the iTunes store making innovative apps like Btc wallets unavailable Sorry but I am not going to buy products from a company that limits my options and is always angling for ways to force me to spend even more Wed RRRaskolnikov Wed slaughterer Wed darteaus Wed FireBrander A few years back I contacted a USA company about reselling a product of thiers Long story short I could buy the item in bulk off ebay direct from China for LESS than I could by them from the US company WTF I got a sample from both compared exactly the same item minus the brand name The factory in China was cranking them out for anyone that wanted to buy them copyrightpatents be damned Wed Dr Acula It sounds like the free market is working then In the USA where we hate and dont practice freedom you can get a patent which prohibits everyone else in the whole universe from applying a certain sequence of steps to their own property Also if youre a monopoly you can get in trouble for antitrust crimes unless you are the DOJ the sole monopoly in charge of rooting out the antitrust crimes Wed besnook i am waiting for phones to reflect their real value based upon input costs which would be around bucks or less all it will take is one provider to break ranks with the rest Wed J Pancreas Cue the iSheep who only come out of Tim Cooks sex dungeon to post comments about why this doesnt matter Wed dreadnaught Wed Chuckster I think market breadth is catching down to FANTAsy Hows that crawl space in Livermore treating you unknown i Junkster Wed NoDebt What You dont want Apple being run for purposes of gay rights activism I couldnt think of a more perfect match myself Wed Silky Johnson Wed PoasterToaster Wed Dr Acula Wed truthalwayswinsout Apple has never understood that the one who is supposed to have the best technology will get to sell their products with all things being equal and that includes price They think they can charge a premium for a tech product That is what almost bankrupted the company in the s and will most likely bankrupt the company in the future There is absolutely nothing special about any product that Apple makes In fact most of the products they make really dont work that well and have never worked that well That is the same with all computer companies and phone companies You figure that after decades of making crap they might finally get a product that works But they are too busy creating the next shiny thing to really think about making something that might actually work Wed JuliaS Apple is a fabricator They just happened to be at the right time at the right moment Attempts at making touchface phones took place in lates and early s bankrupting many companies like Palm in the process Neither the technology nor the public were ready to progress ahead Software wasnt smart enough wireless internet was slow multitouch processing required to much processing For a brief period there was a void left by the pocket PC makers and thats when Apple decided to jump in and make a blockbuster move Same thing happens in the movie industry Someone makes a bigbudget flick considered a sure thing Hires big names Builds extravagant sets and then the picture flops Nobody wants to touch the topic for years and years Scifi zombies pirates all had such moments Years pass and a newcomer takes a risk and all of the sudden the old thing is fashionable again Apple had a dozen failed products They nearly went bankrupt for a good reason The first apple was a breakthrough system introduced at the right moment The iPhone was the other successful fabrication However one cannot be expected to be pulling rabbits out of a hat continuously As a firm theyre theyre a one hit wonder Their reliance on premium pricing makes them extremely vulnerable to periods of lackluster innovation Apples iOSis special in a lot of ways Native code apps as opposed to thetypical slow bloated batterydraining Android Java garbage Slim binaries big space savings that started with iOS Android apps have to go out of their way to do something similar Lack of fragmentation ie more reliable apps at leastceteris paribus Premium clientelle means hgher revenues for developers andmore apps available Also means desperate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>pays billions to be the search engine on iOS because they need the everdeclining mobile search revenue Also Apples PE ratio is retardedly low Like times lower than Amazons assuming Amazons is even positive on a given day How do you separate the men from the boys at Apple With a crow bar Wed JuliaS Apple designs hardware and software as oppose to creating a product with someone elses specs Thats why cycle for cycle theyre able to get more performance out of their hardware Its an advantage and an Achilles heel On one hand they can extract maximum profit out of their proprietary digital ecosystem On the other hand they are pressured to constantly revise both hardware and software to keep the sales going Without a new iPhone every year theyre bankrupt and thats a lot of pressure At this point they keep repackaging same shit over and over not because they have something new to offer but because its the only survival strategy they have Googles in a much better position with Android OS They do work on hardware platforms but at their own pace Sales and licenses fees generate profit regardless I personally prefer developing for Android Just got around to exploring smartwatch SDK for Androidwear and Pebble Theyre a pleasure to work with and to adapt crossplatform I dont have to think about hardware specs when debugging and to me its a plus The open platform approach does make developers lazy thats part of the reason for battery drain issues not the OS but the kind of things rd party devs can get away with Wed
