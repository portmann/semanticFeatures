class='textDiv'>The Hidden Strengths Of Skyworks Solutions Skyworks Solutions Inc NASDAQSWKS Seeking Alpha Skyworks Solutions is the bestinclass analog semiconductor company Apple may need Skyworks Solutions more than Skyworks Solutions needs Apple On after the market closed Apple NASDAQ AAPL reported revenue of billion vs estimates of billion and earnings of per share vs estimates of per share Apple also provided a Q forecast showing revenue ranging from billion to billion vs estimates of billion In spite of beating expectations and providing a forecast essentially in line with estimates Apples results as well as Q forecasts disappointed the market This disappointment was evidenced in the aftermarket selloff of Apples shares by more than as well as the selloff of Apples suppliers shares most notably that of Skyworks Solutions NASDAQ SWKS I believe the selloff of Apple is overblown and even more so for SWKS The concern the bear case voiced by a few was that Apple is showing signs of slowing down because sales for iPhones were estimated at million for Q where actual sales were million Phone sales for Apple grew by better than yearoveryear yy globally and better than in China on a yy basis The bears also claim that the price of the iPhone is too expensive and yet Apple grew sales volume of the iPhone while increasing the price by more than per phone Apple has approximately of the smartphone market but captures better than of the profit in the smartphone market according to the Wall Street Journal and other publications The simple truth is Apples products are luxury items that provide utility and it is human nature to want luxury If it is within their reach people will buy the relatively more luxurious item That is the Apple phenomenon As per the second bullet point Apple may need Skyworks Solutions more than Skyworks Solutions needs Apple Clearly Apple is as valuable a customer as a company can be The point here is that Skyworks Solutions technology enhances Apples products and therefore the Apple customer experience Skyworks Solutions is an analog semiconductor company Its technology supports broadband wireless connectivity GPS automotive energy management military medical devices etc Essentially SWKS is an integral part of the Internet of Things As I stated in the third paragraph the selloff of SWKS was even more overblown than the selloff of Apple The greatest strength of SWKS is its customer base As per the Q K report SWKS customers to name a few are as follows Samsung OTCSSNLF the largest smartphone provider globally Cisco Systems NASDAQ CSCO Dell Ericsson NASDAQ ERIC Huawaei the fourth largest provider of smartphones globally General Electric NYSE GE Foxconn Apple direct supplier Northrup Grumman NYSE NOC Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY and LG Electronics Lets entertain the bear case and say that Apple for the next two or more quarters will not grow iPhone sales at a higher rate than those of say Samsung and Huawaei That for the next three quarters Samsung and Huawaei report a annualized increase in their respective smartphone sales while Apple is only able to grow at Will Apples inability to grow at the same or higher rate erode SWKS revenue growth It absolutely will not This should be as simple as it gets for an analyst trader or investor but based on the selloff analysts et al have not considered SWKS strengths If Apples competitors are taking market share from Apple that shift also benefits SWKS because Apples competitors are SWKS customers Some of the analysts say that the Chinese economy is in a recession and that Apples future growth prospects in China will shrink as evidenced by the recent correction of the Chinese stock market This position is nonsensical Not only did Apple report a yy increase in revenue from China Huawaei also reported better than a increase in yy sales Again both scenarios benefit SWKS Furthermore SWKS is not solely or mainly dependent upon Apple SWKS has made significant gains in medical devices automotive military and energy maintenance industries to name a few SWKS revenues are growing yy by more than and net income by more than as per Q results On SWKS will report its Q results after the market closes Estimates are that SWKS will report revenue of million and earnings per share EPS I believe SWKS will beat these estimates showing revenue ranging from million and EPS ranging from to Furthermore I believe management will reiterate if not raise guidance for Q The selloff was ridiculously overblown and in all probability evidences a lack of understanding of SWKS markets and products If Apple gives up market share to a competitor that also benefits SWKS My message to investors is simply this dont throw the baby out with the bath water Read the companys K report and you will see and understand that SWKS is probably the best positioned company in its space and will benefit from virtually any move up or down in its space I rate SWKS a strong buy Source The Hidden Strengths Of Skyworks Solutions Disclosure I amwe are long SWKS AND
