Let's entertain the bear case and say that Apple for the next two or more quarters will not grow iPhone sales at a higher rate than those of say Samsung and Huawaei.That for the next three quarters, Samsung and Huawaei report a 40% annualized increase in their respective smartphone sales while Apple is only able to grow at 35%.Will Apple's inability to grow at the same or higher rate erode SWKS revenue growth?It absolutely will not.This should be as simple as it gets for an analyst, trader or investor, but based on the selloff, analysts et al, have not considered SWKS' strengths.If Apple's competitors are taking market share from Apple, that shift also benefits SWKS because Apple's competitors are SWKS customers.Some of the analysts say that the Chinese economy is in a recession and that Apple's future growth prospects in China will shrink as evidenced by the recent correction of the Chinese stock market.This position is nonsensical.Not only did Apple report a 100% y/y increase in revenue from China, Huawaei also reported better than a 35% increase in y/y sales.Again, both scenarios benefit SWKS.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore, SWKS is not solely or mainly dependent upon Apple. (Uncertainty) </span>SWKS has made significant gains in medical devices, automotive, military and energy maintenance industries to name a few.SWKS revenues are growing y/y by more than 58% and net income by more than 116% as per Q2 2015 results .On 07/23/2015, SWKS will report its Q3 2015 results after the market closes.Estimates are that SWKS will report revenue of $801.5 million and $1.29 earnings per share (EPS).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe SWKS will beat these estimates showing revenue ranging from $810 - $815 million and EPS ranging from $1.35 to $1.45. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore, I believe management will reiterate, if not raise, guidance for Q4 2015. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The selloff was ridiculously overblown and in all probability evidences a lack of understanding of SWKS markets and products. (Uncertainty) </span>If Apple gives up market share to a competitor, that also benefits SWKS.My message to investors is simply this - don't throw the baby out with the bath water.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Read the company's 2014 10K report, and you will see and understand that SWKS is probably the best positioned company in its space and will benefit from virtually any move, up or down, in its space. (Uncertainty) </span>I rate SWKS a strong buy.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Source: The Hidden Strengths Of Skyworks Solutions Disclosure: I am/we are long SWKS AND AAPL.
