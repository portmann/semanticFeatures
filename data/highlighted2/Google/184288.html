that now is a good time to buy Yahoo because of its stock buyback plan and potential gains from selling its stake in Alibaba In spite of these factors Yahoos share price will likely decline because of bad management its valuation being almost entirely contingent on Alibaba and lackluster growth in its core business Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO is near a week low and continues to trend lower It started the year trading at and is currently at a decline of This decline has occurred in spite of the fact that last year it unloaded million shares of Alibaba NYSE BABA for an aftertax gain of about billion Yahoo still owns about million shares of Alibaba or about of it After experiencing a lackluster year bulls are now arguing that Yahoo looks attractive because of its stock buyback plan and potential gains from selling its stake in Alibaba Taking a closer look at each of these claims actually highlights the poor situation Yahoo is actually in In fact Yahoos share price will continue to decline because of bad management its valuation being almost entirely contingent on Alibaba and lackluster growth in its core business Although Yahoo has already experienced a significant decline it has not bottomed out yet The bull case for Yahoo is its stock buyback plan and the potential gains from selling its stake in Alibaba Looking carefully at each of these claims on an individual and collective level actually highlight the numerous problems Yahoo faces In terms of its share buyback plan its important to look at the overall goal of this program and to evaluate how it has fared so far But before we consider Yahoos buyback plan its worth considering both the positives and negatives of share buyback plans in general On the positive side a share buyback plan can be a good way to give confidence to investors that the management team will help support a companys share price A good buyback plan can be a signal of strength and recognition of the importance of providing shareholder value On the negative side a share buyback plan can be a costly endeavor depending on how it is deployed and whether or not it actually provides support for a companys share price More problematically it drains money that could otherwise be used to support growth While many companies successfully employ share buyback plans this does not appear to be the case with Yahoo To support this claim we have to take a look back at the history of Yahoos share buyback plans Yahoo has a long history of share repurchase plans Back in Yahoo authorized a halfbillion dollar share repurchase plan that was completed in March It then authorized a billion repurchase plan to cover the subsequent fiveyears In June it authorized an additional billion repurchase plan But here is where it gets interesting Between June and December Yahoo repurchased billion in shares Between January until November Yahoo spent billion on repurchasing shares and authorized an additional billion to repurchase even more shares From that point until March of this year Yahoo repurchased about billion in shares and then authorized an additional billion buyback plan This means that since around the end of March Yahoo has about billion to spend on share repurchasing until the end of December So that means from until early Yahoo had authorized billion to repurchase shares the vast majority of which it used But then between June of and March it repurchased billion in shares Since it did not repurchase any shares in Q this year this means that it still has billion to spend until December to support its share price Taking a broader look at the share repurchase plan it appears that there are two different phases for Yahoo The tenyear phase from until the middle of saw billion authorized to repurchase shares in a targeted manner with an aim to insure share holder value But the five years from July July saw billion in shares repurchased that has done little to support Yahoos longterm growth These recent fiveyears are what is most relevant and looking at this highlights Yahoos problems Before examining this issue further let us first visualize the numbers and look at a basic chart of its share price to get some idea about the effects of its share repurchase program On a superficial level it appears that things have gotten better for Yahoo Market capitalization nearly doubled in years while the number of shares on the market declined by almost a third But of course this is only a snapshot and doesnt tell the whole story Broader context is also important In the stock market was still oversold because of the financial crisis Now weve been in a bull market now for the past sixyears In addition back in Yahoos stake in Alibaba was not a major component of its valuation the way it is now Given this context evaluating Yahoos share buyback plan is considerably more complex Yahoos market capitalization peaked in November around billion being lifted alongside Alibaba But just as it rose with Alibaba so too has it fallen At its current share price Yahoos market capitalization sits at around billion But given that Yahoo owns almost million shares of Alibaba and those shares are currently valued at billion since it is trading at that means that the market currently values Yahoo at on billion if we remove its Alibaba holdings This brings us back to the repurchase plan and evaluating its overall efficacy Given that most of Yahoos current market capitalization is based on its holdings of Alibaba shares this means that the repurchase plan has done little to bolster investor confidence in Yahoos core holdings or earning potential This then undercuts the overall value of its repurchase plan and thus supports the case that the last fiveyears of its repurchase plan have actually hurt the company Yahoo should not have spent billion to repurchase shares and should have instead been investing its resources into new avenues of growth A more modest repurchase plan something along what it had done from the middle of would have been far more appropriate Since Yahoo has already spent that money it is more important to evaluate its current share repurchase plan It now has billion available to repurchase shares But this money will not provide much support to Yahoos share price It would be far more prudent to spend this money investing in growth rather than additional stock repurchasing Looking now more closely at Alibaba it is clear that the fate of Yahoo is deeply intertwined with Alibaba However other than Yahoos intelligent billion initial investment in Alibaba back in that gave it control of the company it has not really managed its holdings in the company all that well In September Yahoo completed the sale of half of its holdings in Alibaba back to the company for billion and pocketed about billion after taxes If Yahoo had held onto these share longer it would have reaped substantially more from the sale of these shares after its IPO Regardless if you combine the billion it received in with the billion it made on its IPO in that means Yahoo received a total of billion after tax for the of Alibaba that it owned It received significantly less than it should have for its shares but at least it still owns of Alibaba But what to do with the it owns of Alibaba has been a contentious issue Earlier this month Yahoos plans to spin off its stake in Alibaba in order to avoid taxes hit a bump in the road when the IRS said it would not offer tax guidance on its proposed spinoff If Yahoo had to pay taxes on its holdings of Alibaba at its current price that would mean it would have to pay almost billion in taxes alone This would still mean that Yahoo would end up making billion from selling its stake in Alibaba Although there remains uncertainty about the possible tax implications from the sale of its holdings in Alibaba it still has a few other options it could pursue to avoid getting a major tax hit It could spinoff its core businesses and retain its Alibaba stake under its main company This would be cheaper and is estimated that a spin off of its core assets would only cost billion Alternatively it could do nothing and wait to hear what the IRS ultimately decides Regardless of what Yahoo decides the future of the company is tied to Alibaba While a nearly billion dollar sale of Alibaba would help to recapitalize Yahoo other longer term issues remain problematic While the bull case for Yahoo has significant problems upon closer in inspection the bear case against Yahoo looks stronger ever day Yahoos share price will face additional downward pressure because of bad management its valuation being almost entirely contingent on Alibaba and lackluster growth in its core business Above all Yahoo has poor leadership Its CEO Marissa Mayer has done little to help the company and a lot to make things worse A lengthy piece last year in the NY Times on Mayers leadership highlights the problems with here leadership style She is a micromanager who wanted to fundamentally reshape Yahoo along the lines of a startup As the article notes Reared in Googles dataobsessed culture Mayer tended to require countless tests about user preferences before making an important product decision Mayer feels the need for her decisions to be supreme and to be datadriven in her leadership While this has some merits and data awareness has helped <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>reach amazing heights it has been a tough sell given Yahoos sclerotic organizational culture Her constant attempts to upend Yahoos entrenched systems have actually made things worse As the article notes Mayer also had a habit of operating on her own time Every Monday at pm Pacific she asked her direct reports to gather for a threehour meeting Mayer demanded all of her staff across the world join the call so executives from New York where it was pm and Europe where it was pm or later would dial in too Invariably Mayer herself would be at least minutes late some calls were so delayed that Yahoo executives in Europe couldnt hang up till after am In theory Mayer kept up with her direct reports through weekly individual meetings In practice she often went weeks without seeing them Mayers largest management problem however related to the startup culture she had tried to instill Early on she banned working from homeMayer also favored a system of quarterly performance reviews or QPRs that required every Yahoo employee on every team be ranked from to The system was meant to encourage hard work and weed out underperformers but it soon produced the exact opposite Because only so many s and s could be allotted talented people no longer wanted to work together strategic goals were sacrificed as employees did not want to change projects and leave themselves open to a lower score What this demonstrates is a micromanager completely unaware of how to effectively run a large corporation It is incredibly difficult to be an effective CEO if you are a micromanager who pushes radical change that ends up backfiring in the long run This is what has happened with her in charge as Yahoos core businesses continue to face serious difficulties and growth remains nonexistent All the while Mayer has made working at Yahoo a terrible experience Another problem with Yahoo is that its valuation is entirely contingent on Alibaba Alibabas billion lockup period has just ended and this means that a lot of shares could be on the open market very soon Alibaba had a challenging first year and has faced a variety of problems including lawsuits and broader problems in the Chinese economy It remains to be seen where Alibabas share price will go While Alibaba faces serious challenges a potential downward pressure it is dangerous for Yahoos valuation to continue to be so closely tied to Alibaba A significant selloff in Alibaba will hurt Yahoo as has been seen in the past few months Until Yahoo figures out what to do with its holdings in Alibaba and its share price finally dissociates with Alibaba investing in Yahoo will inextricably tied to the fate for good or ill of Alibaba Finally Yahoos core business lacks growth While its share of Yahoo Japan is bringing in solid revenue Yahoo has not seen significant growth in its US assets In the last quarter it only saw YY revenue growth while overall revenue remained flat at billion It also had revenue of billion in Q a decline of YY In eight of the past ten quarters net revenue has either declined or remained constant This contradicts CEO Mayers promises to get Yahoo growing again If we look at how the market values Yahoos core business today it provides a pessimistic outlook for its future What this demonstrates is that Yahoos core US assets are currently valued at billion hence indicating that investors remain pessimistic about Yahoos longterm ability to grow The bottom line is that without growth Yahoos core business will continue to struggle to compete against competitors like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG and will hurt its share price While Yahoo has the potential to turn thing around depending on how it deals with its remaining shares of Alibaba its core business is flailing In spite of a massive fiveyear share buyback plan this has not significantly helped Yahoos share price or jump start its business Investors remain very skeptical about Yahoos value and with good reason Although Yahoo is cheaper than it has been in quite some time it remains an unattractive company Its very survival is at stake because of poor management its valuation being almost entirely contingent on Alibaba and lackluster growth in its core business Without significant changes in the near future Yahoos longterm viability remains questionable at best We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the personal contact
