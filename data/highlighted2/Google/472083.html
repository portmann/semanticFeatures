acquisition of Yahoo despite the latters repeated failures to adapt to the world of social media Limited competition in the US broadband market and weak enforcement of procompetitive regulations may help Verizon exploit its large customer base to grow YahooAOLbased revenues However historical attempts by large telephone companies to build successful content businesses have failed to overcome internal bureaucratic and cultural obstacles to developing new sources of revenues outside their core Verizons closest peer ATT is following a different path to building new revenue streams with a stronger emphasis on foreign investments and longer established content platforms Verizon NYSE VZ hopes or expects that its million or so subscribers thanks to their relationships with Verizon as well as the information Verizon possesses on them will enable it to make a success of Yahoo where others including its current CEO Marissa Mayer have consistently failed The notion that telephone companies can make a success of content services and applications and be much more than just pipes is not a new one For example in an earlier preInternet or prebroadband era in the early s when cellular communications also was still in its infancy Bell Atlantic the predecessor core of todays Verizon pursued the interactive TV market It hoped to generate revenues from consumers through home shopping and banking by receiving a percentage of the sales that would result from use of its own navigation tool named Stargazer It also wished to charge retailers rent for space in its electronic mall Stargazer became the basis of TeleTV a media and technology company formed by Bell Atlantic and two other telephone companies Nynex also now part of Verizon Pacific Telesis now part of ATT NYSE T and Creative Artists Agency CAA in February The company intended to offer an interactive TV service with a settop box Howard Stringer CBS chief and president of Sony NYSE SNE was hired as CEO with former Fox executive Sandy Grushow as president Michael Ovitz then head of CAA was to be the dealmaker between Hollywood and TeleTV The company reportedly spent several hundreds of millions of dollars before halting operations in early The cultures of the old Bell System based on the East Coast did not mesh well with the very different culture of Hollywood nor did telephone companies demonstrate the ability to divine or shape consumer tastes Now Verizon is trying to prove that it can overcome the lumbering bureaucratic legacy of its origins in telephony and is capable of building a sizable and profitable content business in the very different and fast paced Internet and social mediadominated world of today In this endeavor it has acquired two pioneers of this environment that were riding high in the late s AOL and now Yahoo but have been left far behind by later arrivals on the scene notably <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Facebook In other words Verizon hopes to build a strong content play by combining two weak players Notably both Yahoo and AOL have participated in several unsuccessful acquisitions AOLTime Warner most spectacularly and for Yahoo its purchases of Flickr in and Tumblr in among others In contrast Yahoos investment in the Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba NYSE BABA has proved to be very lucrative and is not included in the new deal The reasons for optimism about the prospects for Verizons purchase of Yahoo are the Financial muscle it can bring to bear Verizon can absorb losses that would be the death of smaller companies just like Intel NASDAQ INTC which incurred multibillion dollar losses from its attempts to become a force in processors for mobile devices Interest of digital advertisers in having a third sizable platform for online advertising <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Facebook reportedly control about of the digital advertising market while Yahoo and AOL combined only account for and Verizons ability to exploit its position in the US broadband oligopoly for example by exploiting socalled zero rating opportunities Zero rating selected content downloaded by subscribers does not count against any data caps in the broadband services they use In contrast to other content including that which is competitive to zero rated content may become more expensive if its volume exceeds the data cap All major US mobile operators including Verizon already make some use of zero rating It is not clear whether zero rating will be considered as a violation of the net neutrality rules approved by the FCC in February Moreover the FCCs Enforcement Bureau has shown little sympathy to complaints from entrepreneurial challengers to business practices and behavior of the large broadband operators that allegedly violate FCC rules most obviously in the case of the FCCs Data Roaming Order of Hence it is very likely even if the net neutrality rules ultimately survive all legal challenges Verizon will be able to use zero rating and perhaps other stratagems to build on its subscriber base in ways that increase the value of YahooAOL as a platform for third parties As a wireless carrier Verizon possesses considerable information on the locations of its users as well as their behavior and activities on their phones As a smartphone distributor Verizon can influence handset manufacturers to include extra apps and software on mobile devices that can specifically support the goals of its content business However there also are reasons for skepticism about Verizons ability to create significant value out of YahooAOL It does take a lot to move the needle of a billion revenue company One question mark is whether Verizon can succeed in the environment of social media despite the discouraging history of telephone companies attempts to diversify into markets with very different success factors than their core business Notably Verizon like Yahoo seems to be following a policy of innovation through acquisition rather than through internal development This policy has not worked for several leaders with more credentials in innovation and entrepreneurialism that are associated with Verizon There is little evidence that Verizon can apply the capabilities enumerated above to build sustainable advantages against the powerful and unified distribution systems of social platforms Interestingly Verizon has a different emphasis in its development of new revenue streams than its closest peer ATT although the latter also was reportedly interested in acquiring Yahoo ATT is investing in networks abroad for now mainly in Latin America notably Mexico to build new revenue streams as well as in more traditional content platforms DirecTV It will be a challenge for ATT to succeed in markets outside the US Reportedly its year target is to become the market leader in telecommmunications in Mexico overtaking the well entrenched dominant leader Telcel America Movil NYSE AMX Prior to the fundamental reform of the telecommunications market by the current Mexican Government that effectively opened the door for entrants ATT was a partner of America Movil Progress and profitability in markets outside the US will require the mentality of a new entrant or challenger unless ATT buys into an incumbent as its predecessor SBC did in South Africa This mentality is very different from ATTs tradition culture and modus operandi as a privileged incumbent relying on a powerful intimately entrenched and long standing position within circles of political regulatory and financial influence Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my
