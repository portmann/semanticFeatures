operating system has already seen massive adoption in a short amount of time and UWP and Xamarin will jointly fuel further growth The synergies will be tremendous if Microsoft can sustain the momentum theyve generated so far After a point of critical mass it will perpetuate itself When Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT CEO Sathya Nadella announced the companys mobile first cloud first mission the first thing that will have crossed investors minds is that Windows would now be pushed to the background For the longest time Windows has been the chief of the Microsoft family so it would have been natural to assume that a shift in core strategy would see this becoming even more of a legacy product that would be relegated to a consumptionbased economy with no real growth drivers to support it But when Microsoft held their Build conference it became clear that the Universal Windows Platform UWP would funnel tremendous energies into what is already a hugely popular crossdevice Windows operating system It may not have been originally designed or intended this way but the UWP as it stands now is much more flexible and inclusive As such I believe it will be a strong driver for Microsofts Windows adoption initiatives Windows has the fastest adoption of any release in the history of Microsoft It has been out for eight months and is already being used by more than million users across multiple devices Of significance here is the fact that the adoption is not only driven by consumers but also by enterprises however that number wasnt divulged Its worth noting that enterprise adoption of Windows will not only increase the popularity of the OS itself to a significant degree but also give the company additional leverage for providing other solutions like Office and Azure One of the things that underlies the success of an operating system is applications or apps These apps can be downloaded for free or for a fee from one of the many stores hosted by the entity that owns the operating system As such Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL are the dominant players in this segment with their Apple App Store for iOS and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play for Android respectively The Windows Store never really took off despite the ephemeral success of the Lumia range of smartphones but this new equation with UWP and Windows is sure to change the game It is now known that Windows users have visited the app store nearly billion times and the number of developers on the platform has increased by in the last few months Those are strong indicators that the fast adoption of Windows is being supported from below by a growing pool of developers building apps under it In the short run the crossdevice compatibility of Windows will drive adoption but in the longer term it will be the value gained from the many apps available for that platform that will define the success outcomes of this for Microsoft This is not just an assumption its easy to prove Take a look at the average number of apps that smartphone users download to their devices and youll see what I mean by app value driving platform adoption in the long term As you can see the average smartphone user accesses more than apps While that figure has remained fairly flat you can also see that they are increasingly spending more time on those apps In a sense these apps have become an invaluable part of a smartphone users usage behavior Interestingly more than of total app usage comes from a list of no bigger than applications despite the fact that there are literally hundreds of thousands of applications in each category on both Apples App Store as well as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play To sum that up every mobile device user is highly dependent on a number of apps on a daily basis This is why Microsoft has been pushing hard to make sure that this second attempt of theirs at building an app store doesnt fall flat like the last one did Thats where the UWP comes in as does the number of developers building new apps for devices running on Windows The key to doing that is to leverage thirdparty developers and incentivize them to build the most robust apps possible No company can manage to build all those applications by itself and thirdparty developers wont come to the party as it were if they dont see the potential for sales either via paid downloads or inapp purchases On the other hand consumers will not adopt an operating system or brand if it doesnt have the apps that theyre familiar with or replacements that dont serve their needs and exceed their expectations This chicken and egg situation is the reason why Windows Phone and the entire mobile ecosystem around their mobile capability failed miserably against frontrunners iOS and Android That problem was exacerbated by Microsofts closed box thinking which alienated the open source community for a long time Times have changed since Nadella took over and Microsoft is now bending over backwards to win the developers vote And for possibly the first time in the history of Microsoft they are starting to gain some mileage on that front If Im right theres no way theyre going to let up on giving developers every kind of incentive and support to get them on board and building apps for Windows Here are a few of the things theyve been doing to make sure they keep the momentum up and the interest level high within the developer community As you will clearly see Microsoft is taking apart brick by brick the huge wall that has so far alienated the open source developer community They can no longer afford to work along the lines of the old Microsoft During the Build conference Microsoft announced that they will be bringing in Bash Shell to Windows What this does is that it allows developers to run Linux command line tools on the windows platform To put it simply they have made it easier than ever for open source developers a huge thriving community to do their work on the UWP The next and possibly the most critical initiative Ill cover is one that I wrote about earlier in an article called Microsoft Made A GameChanging Acquisition in which I detailed exactly why Xamarin was a key acquisition for the company The Build conference was held one month after I had written that article and further validated my opinions and analysis in the article You are welcome to review it quickly now before reading on That was the first step in their pursuit of developers and it set the tone for their subsequent actions around the core community that they will be depending on to take Windows to the heights of adoption success The initiative essentially gives developers the option to use a single platform to develop apps for not only Windows but also iOS and Android This is a basic yet tectonic shift that Microsoft has undergone from closedbox thinking to embracing their biggest asset even if they have to serve their competitors in the process Youd be forgiven for thinking that Microsoft has made a very poor and counterintuitive decision in deciding to support the success of their competitors but I challenge you to look at it from another point of view I believe this is the smartest thing that Microsoft has done in a long time Instead of sacrificing a vast pool of talent in favor of excluding the competition Apple and Alphabet theyve decided to cater to the needs of developers irrespective of who theyre developing for This is tremendous By providing developers with the UWP and leveraging Xamarin in the process theyve addressed the problem of their earlier failure at the core the needs of the developers not being met Investorspeak The Future of the Mobile First Philosophy Until now Nadellas mobile first cloud first mandate has been unclear to many investors Its understandable because Microsoft was essentially a software product company Now however with Windows the UWP and Xamarin having been given their rightful places in the new ecosystem of Microsoft things should be a lot clearer on where the company is heading There are several conclusions that an investor should be able to draw from the goingson over the past few months Microsoft is clearly committed to enhancing developer experience They will leverage Xamarin and aggressively nurture the UWP by adding more robust functionality and capability on an ongoing basis In doing this they can keep Windows adoption rates at a high level because the number of apps will grow in proportion to the number of developers they keep adding to the UWP community By keeping the apps growing they will entice even more users into the Windows fold In the process their top line will start showing a healthy growth rate This is not something you will see immediately but it is inevitable You dont need to get technical to understand the massive implications of this and Im not going to ask you to invest in Microsoft because thats your decision based on your assessment of the risks and rewards What I will say is that this is a company to be closely watched because mobile is only half the equation The other half will come from cloud computing and this is something Ive covered and will continue to cover extensively over the coming weeks and months So if you think this article was worth the few minutes you spent reading it then I urge you to follow me so you can track the progress of Microsoft and other tech majors as they find their way through the challenging maze of profitability and industry dominance in their respective areas of strength Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not
