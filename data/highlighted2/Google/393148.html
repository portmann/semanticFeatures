preorders for the Model mean Tesla will capture the whole BEV market and close the window of opportunity for Apples Project Titan electric car Tesla NASDAQ TSLA Model represents an important moment for the automotive industry redefining product and consumer demand expectations of a premium massmarket electric vehicle The car has already received unprecedented preorders and is so far well succeeding in fulfilling Teslas main mission to accelerate sustainable transport Does the early success of the Model mean that the Californian company is now so far ahead of competition that it could capture the whole BEV market Would this close the window of opportunity for Apple NASDAQ AAPL and its Project Titan electric car as this Seeking Alpha article by ShortLong Trader suggests Or do TSLA investors still need to worry about Apples arrival in the industry The Model s goal is to remove barriers to increased adoption of electric vehicles The cars more affordable price point starting at solid driving range miles as well as Teslas trademark design performance and safety have certainly done the job If we assume US preorders as per Teslas past sales distribution that number alone represents all electric car sales in the US over the past two years The Model is set to dominate the BEV market however it is important to get a perspective The share of electric vehicles in US car sales in was less than Even if Tesla was already meeting its goal of manufacturing vehicles per year the market share of electric cars in the US would still be less than Electric vehicles represent a small niche market and much opportunity exists for its expansion and Apples entry without Apples EV being locked out of the market by the Model Tesla might have received hundreds of thousands of preorders but now it has to convert them into sales The late launch for Model does not seem to give the company too much breathing room before Apples rumored launch in Given Teslas muchdiscussed problems with planning and execution Elon Musk could not resist to laugh a bit when announcing the Model s launch date it is more realistic to expect first deliveries during with volume picking up later in the year That would give Tesla just year of full production time before Apples BEV is introduced Apple has a good opportunity to take advantage of any potential setbacks in Model s manufacturing and poach a good number of Teslas preorders Furthermore Apples deep pockets and decades of experience working with contract manufacturers on producing massmarket products at a massive scale will make it that much more feasible for the company to quickly ramp up production and catch up with Tesla The Model is a highly attractive car However it is still an evolution of the traditional car as we have known it for decades I see Apples excellence in design as one of the companys most important competitive advantages over Tesla And by design I dont only mean how things look but also how they work I completely agree with Neil Cybarts article where he explores the traditional cars design and the significant ways in which it could change What if car design started from the inside and viewed the vehicle as a room on wheels I believe much different results would be achieved Todays cars follow the same old paradigm of a box filled up with stationary frontfacing seats But what if a different seat configuration is needed for a different travel scenario and experience depending on the number of passengers amount of luggage time of day activity cars stationarymoving state Notice how firstclass airplane cabin design significantly increases the value of travel allowing you to also relax work and sleep Could this be achieved within the constraints of a car With a clever imaginative and flexible design yes Even before autonomous driving resting or working in a stationary car could be a much better experience Source Rinspeed In this light notice how Tesla currently applies its design thinking The Model X uses electric motors for folding rearview mirrors and opening and closing front and Falcon Wing doors But this does not improve the travel experience in a meaningful way Note that where it matters the ndrow seats in the Model X cannot be even manually folded flat Much more value could be extracted from a car if it could be easily configured for different travel scenarios with just a tap on the dashboard touchscreen or smartphone Given how Apple thinks about design and its role in improving the user experience the company has a great opportunity to reinvent the car The Model has a solid driving range of miles however that still falls short of massmarket needs According to research by NREL majority of consumers would consider buying an electric car if it can travel miles on a single charge Such a sentiment is shared by Tesla CEO Elon Musk who sees the sweet spot in the mile range The dynamics of growing EV sales and advancements in battery technology mean that such a driving range will be available in an EV priced for the massmarket much sooner than previously thought Consider that in the price of a lithiumion battery pack was per kWh and McKinsey estimated it would fall to by Yet here we are a decade earlier and the current cost per kWh is just and estimated to further decrease to by Massmarket electric vehicles with a plusmile driving range should be at this rate only several years away and will significantly broaden the number of prospective EV buyers In this light Apples electric car debut seems well timed to tap into increased demand and follows the companys established marketentry pattern of waiting for key technologies to mature If there is an area where Apple is at a disadvantage it is Teslas unique position in autonomous driving Its Autopilot selfdriving feature is already installed in tens of thousands of Tesla vehicles giving the company an unprecedented scope in gathering a million miles worth of driving data every day Compare that to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL who this past March had just selfdriving cars on public streets Apple is not yet testing any autonomous vehicles however it is clearly stepping up its efforts with a fleet of Apple Maps vans which are currently roaming the roads of Europe and the US and which are equipped with LIDAR sensors used for creating extremely detailed navigation maps for selfdriving cars Tesla has a remarkable headstart for building a fully autonomous car and if rumors are true the Model will be that car To catch up with Tesla in autonomous driving Apple will need to rampup its car production quickly and get as many vehicles on the roads as possible to gather crucial driving data The Model is set to dominate the BEV market however that is still a rather small market in the early development stage Much opportunity exists for its expansion and Apples entry Apples arrival in the industry alone will increase consumer awareness of the BEV category while potential disruptive design and more mature technology would help Apples car to get consumer traction and expand the market TSLA investors need to currently worry more about the companys manufacturing capacity and capability as any setbacks in the Model production will hurt Teslas ability to convert preorders into sales achieve economies of scale turn profit and ultimately successfully compete with Apple Tesla is a great brand and car designer If it learns to be a great business and car manufacturer or better starts using experienced manufacturing contractors and reacts quickly to any possible industry disruption by Apple it can emerge from the clash of the titans without a paint scratch However given TSLAs rich valuation I prefer AAPL as a longterm auto investment At the moment you can get Apples Project Titan division completely free while Wall Street is too busy figuring out when the iPhone starts growing again Authors Note If you have enjoyed reading my article and found its content valuable please take seconds to follow me by clicking the Follow button next to my
