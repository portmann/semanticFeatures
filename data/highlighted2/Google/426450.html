class='textDiv'>The Evolution Of Cloud Computing Seeking Alpha Until recently virtually all the computing effort done on servers Traditional server CPUs have made enormous improvements in performance over the last several decades Recognizing the growing importance of cloudbased computing models a number of competitors have tried to work their way into the server CPU market Servers are probably not near the top of your list for conversation topics nor are they something most people think about But it turns out there are some interesting changes happening in server design that will start to have a real world impact on everyone who uses both traditional and new computing devices Everything from smart digital assistants to autonomous cars to virtual reality is being enabled and enhanced with the addition of new types of computing models and new types of computing accelerators to todays servers and cloudbased infrastructure In fact this is one of the key reasons Intel recently doubled down on their commitment to server cloud and data center markets as part of the companys evolving strategy Until recently virtually all the computing effort done on servers from email and web page delivery to highperformance computing was done on CPUs conceptually and architecturally similar to the ones found in todays PCs Traditional server CPUs have made enormous improvements in performance over the last several decades thanks in part to the benefits of Moores Law In fact Intel NASDAQ INTC just announced a Xeon server CPU the E V which is optimized for analytics with independent cores this week Recognizing the growing importance of cloudbased computing models a number of competitors have tried to work their way into the server CPU market but at last count Intel still owns a staggering share Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM has announced some ARMbased server CPUs and Cavium NASDAQ CAVM introduced their new Thunder X ARMbased CPU at last weeks Computex show in Taiwan but both companies face uphill battles A potentially more interesting competitive threat could come from AMD NASDAQ AMD After a severalyear competitive lull AMD is expected to finally make a serious reentry into the server CPU market this fall when their new x core codenamed Zen which they also previewed at Computex is expected to be announced and integrated into new server CPUs Some of the more interesting developments in server design are coming from the addition of new chips that serve as accelerators for specific kinds of workloads Much as a GPU inside a PC works alongside the CPU and powers certain types of software new chips are being added to traditional servers in order to enhance their capabilities In fact GPUs are now being integrated into servers for applications such as graphics virtualizations and artificial intelligence The biggest noise has been created by Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA with their use of GPUs and GPUbased chips for applications like deep learning While CPUs are essentially optimized to do one thing very fast GPUs are optimized to do lots of relatively simple things simultaneously Visualbased pattern matching at the heart of many artificial intelligence algorithms for example is ideally suited to the simultaneous computing capabilities of GPUs As a result Nvidia has taken some of their GPU architectures and created the Tesla line of accelerator cards for servers While not as well known Intel has actually offered a line of parallelprocessing optimized chips they call Intel Phi to the supercomputing and highperformance computing HPC market for several years Unlike Tesla and forthcoming offerings AMD is likely to bring to servers Intels Phi chips are not based on GPUs but a different variant of its own Xbased designs Given the growing number of parallel processingbased workloads it wouldnt be surprising to see Intel bring the parallel computing capabilities of Phi to the more general purpose server market in the future for machine learning workloads In addition Intel recently made the highprofile purchase of Altera a company that specializes in FPGAs field programmable gate arrays FPGAs are essentially programmable chips that can be used to perform a variety of specific functions more efficiently than general purpose CPUs and GPUs While the requirements vary depending on workloads FPGAs are known to be optimized for applications like signal processing and highspeed data transfers Given the extreme performance requirements of todays most demanding cloud applications the need to quickly access storage and networking elements of cloudbased servers is critical and FPGAs can be used for these purposes as well Many newer server workloads such as big data analytics engines also require fast access to huge amounts of data in memory This in turn is driving interest in new types of memory storage and even computing architectures In fact these issues are at the heart of HP Enterprises The Machine concept for a server of the future In the nearer term memory architectures like the Micron and Inteldriven D Xpoint technology which combines the benefits of traditional DRAM and flash memory will help drive new levels of realtime performance even with existing server designs The bottom line is that todays servers have come a long way from the PClike CPUdominated world of just a few years back As we see the rise of new types of workloads were likely to see even more chip accelerators optimized to do certain tasks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL for example recently announced a TPU which is a chip they designed many believe it to be a customized version of an FPGA specifically to accelerate the performance of their TensorFlow deep learning software Other semiconductor makers are working on different types of specialized accelerators for applications such as computer vision and more In addition were likely to see combinations of these different elements in order to meet the wide range of demands future servers will face One of Intels Computex announcements for example was a new server CPU that integrated the latest elements of its Xeon line with FPGA elements from the Altera acquisition Of course simply throwing new chips at a workload wont do anything without the appropriate software In fact one of the biggest challenges of introducing new chip architectures is the amount of effort it takes to write or rewrite code that can specifically take advantage of the new benefits the different architectures offer This is one of the reasons xbased traditional CPUs continue to dominate the server market Looking forward however many of the exciting new cloudbased services need to dramatically scale their efforts around a more limited set of software which makes the potential opportunity for new types of chip accelerators a compelling one Diving into the details of server architectures can quickly get overwhelming However having at least a basic understanding of how they work can help give you a better sense of how todays cloudbased applications are being delivered and might provide a glimpse into the applications and services of tomorrow Tagged Technology
