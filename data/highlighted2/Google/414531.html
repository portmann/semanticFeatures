strong launch of the iPhone Samsung OTCSSNLF appears to have sold million of its Galaxy S and S Edge smartphones since they were introduced a little over a year ago Fiksucom data show the two devices now command of all Android smartphones in use Tomi Anohen estimates the Android installed base at billion devices Applying the figure puts S series sales over million The Samsung S models were first sold in April suggesting average monthly sales of million units Applying that percentage to the estimated million iPhones in use I calculate about million iPhone series are active The iPhone models were launched months ago which suggests monthly sales have averaged over million units The data are rough but consistent with folklore that Apple NASDAQ AAPL outsells Samsung at the flagship end of the market But does Apple outsell Android more broadly at the premium end That questions requires a bit more digging This chart from shows the price mix of each platform with Android phones over comprising a bit less than of shipments while iPhones at that price point make up of sales Applying the percentages for each platform to the installed base we get a mix of premiumpriced smartphones in use made up of million Android devices million iPhones and a few million Windows NASDAQ MSFT and BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY units The data again demonstrate that Apple has the edge in the premium segment but by no means dominates In fact it looks like a dead heat Apple has done a good job of retaking its lead in the premium phone market after losing the number one position to Samsung in but the days when it held over of that segment are history Tim Cook is pointing to India as an area for growth and it is But the premium end of the smartphone market in India is tiny and Apple will have to share that segment with Samsung and others India is unlikely to bail Apple out The next few years will be interesting Major competitors other than Samsung and Apple are struggling to survive and cognizant that they need a slice of the premium segment to make money More and more highend devices are being introduced by cutthroat competitors like Xiaomi Private XI Huawei and even Microsoft The premium end is getting crowded Apple is relying heavily on the forthcoming iPhone Initial surveys suggest it will fare better than the iPhone S but not as well as the iPhone I think Apple will try to make the iPhone best in class with up to GB storage an AMOLED screen and a faster processor It has to do so Apples ecosystem download count has long since been passed by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play GOOG GOOGL and the choice of an iPhone today is hardwaredriven in my view Accordingly Apples new phone will have to have the best the company has to offer to have any real chance of success In my view the iPhone will be very popular with existing iPhone users but will have only marginal success in attracting new users Apple will no doubt also introduce a superpremium flagship device and call it the iPhone Pro to further extend its line Within a few months of its launch I have little doubt that a more powerful and more fullyfeatured Android device will be offered by virtually all iPhone competitors and the steady erosion of Apple market share will continue The fact is Apple has become a bit player in the smartphone arena with a paltry share of market The companys boring routine of offering incremental improvements to entice upgrades should lose its luster as users tire of spending premium dollars for new devices that look feel and perform pretty well the same as their predecessors and in key areas such as battery life perform poorly as well In the words of Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG executive chairman Eric Schmidt Loss of even a few percentage points of market share in the premium end is devastating for Apple Each share comprises million units In my view the iPhone will find it difficult to maintain share against increasing competition and will have to yield share or substantially improve features and costs while lowering prices just to stand still All of those steps will squeeze margins Apple stock is getting a bid based on expectations that the iPhone will markedly improve the companys fortunes Smart money will sell into that strength Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the
