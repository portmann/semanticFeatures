with share price depreciation Be it Wedbushs recent upgrade or positive reiterations from Citigroup NYSE C shares of Fitbit NYSE FIT continue to underperform expectations While I have four positive trades on Fitbit yeartodate this last trade is taking longer than I expected to drive returns on my capital Nonetheless I will remain patient and continue to understand that while shares of FIT will not exude a traditional growth multiple akin to those found in hitech biotech or even social media they will still yet appreciate beyond my cost average of a share And that cost average came on the heels of this latest downturn in shares of FIT that found the stock down some intraday yesterday and on higher than usual volume So why all the selling in shares of FIT recently even as some rather positive notes have been forthcoming from analysts In short Fitbit is a hardware company aiming to saturate the world with Fitbit fitness trackers and beyond that the company has little in its quiver to address what is less than favorable longterm sellthrough trends in what is a oneproduct issuance company While the sellthrough rate remains positive presently it mirrors the total net sales growth deceleration of the company which analysts now see growing close to for the year That is up since the first quarter by an average of give or take The latest notes from Dougherty Co analyst Charles Anderson suggests results of decelerating growth albeit still growth Dougherty Co analyst Charles Anderson published a note on Fitbit sellthrough indicators <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Searches App Downloads The search and app download trends over the past two weeks for Fitbit products continued to be at lower levels than the product cycleinduced run rate he documented from February to April <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>searches for the Fitbit brand last week were up YOY globally up YOY in the US and up YOY in the UK The Fitbit app moved up the charts YOY on iPhones in the US and YOY on Android smartphones in the US last week So whats so bad about the current growth rate I mean there are companies that would kill for Fitbits growth rate Well the issue is plain to see that last year the company grew revenues above so even at the trend does not seem favorable or to have considerable runway beyond Shares of FIT plunged after the company released Q results that beat analysts estimates but the guidance came in light of expectations for Q earnings Having said that the company boosted the high end of its FY earnings expectations But nobody cares about what earnings are forecasted to be come Q and Q when the disappointment for Q is athand and bears contention Additionally it appears that the plunge to a share on May th desires a gapfill response from shareholders Well have to see if that level holds because if it doesnt look out below folks With that said lets take a look at what Citigroup had to offer regarding Fitbit on Monday Citi calls Fitbit relatively inexpensive wearables play after hosting Fitbit management at his firms SMID Cap Conference on June Citi analyst Stanley Kovler continues to believe Fitbit offers a relatively inexpensive way to play the growing wearables market Nearterm Fitbit is focused on filling out its US and international retail channels with new products and higher stock levels of new products Kovler tells investors in a research note The analyst expects the company to drain inventory of older products in the channel heading into early Q He reiterates a Buy rating on Fitbit with a price target Most analysts have a positive near to midterm view on Fitbit and shares of FIT But it must be placed into the right context for investors Some analysts have multiples assigned to shares of FIT that are rather lofty for a hardwarein a stocks lifecycle where anything can happen This is why it is best to trade a company like FIT rather than invest for the long term I say this with respect to the company needing to diversify its product line beyond its existence today of fitness trackers In the Citi analyst note Koyler articulates that Fitbit is focused on filling its retail channels otherwise known as saturating the market Fitbit likely has another months before it fully saturates its key markets mainly North America and Europe AsiaPacific isnt big enough to offset any post market saturation declines that might come once N America is saturated This is the context that investors should consider more broadly but isnt offered in the analyst notes As it pertains to the AsiaPacific Im of the opinion that Xiaomis Private XI lowpriced fitness trackers that currently dominate the region will continue to impede the progress of other brands including that of Fitbit Even as fitness trackers become popular in India over the last months Fitbit is ranked number three in terms of market share in India behind GOQii at and Xiaomi leading with market share This is not to say that Fitbit cant grow sales in India or the broader AsiaPacific region but rather to better appreciate the ceiling for sales is significantly lower than Fitbit has achieved in firstmover markets like N America and Europe While there has been recognizable positive analyst notes sentiment and price targets assigned to FIT shares some are of the opinion that the latest Apple Watch news might have had an impact on FIT shares Apple NASDAQ AAPL launched improvements to its Apple Watch operating system called OS which will feature a fitness app that rivals Fitbits fitness apps There will be a watch face made up of Apples colorful activitytracking rings and another that offers a shortcut to the Workout app People can share their activity data with other Watch wearers so theres finally a social component And the Watch will soon track activity levels for wheelchair users Here is what The Verge had to say about the Apple Watch OS Apples new Watch software watchOS isnt just new software its an admission that Apple had it all wrong when it came to interactions on the firstgeneration Apple Watch Its less of a revamp and more of a rescue of the Watch an attempt to deconstruct the old software and to focus on the stuff that people actually care about Its still not a perfect smartwatch if such a thing exists but the demo of watchOS offers a better explanation for why you might want to use an Apple Watch Its not just a third draft its a total rewrite and something insightful might finally emerge Unfortunately even though the fall release of the Apple Watch iteration will also employ WiFi capabilities that allow the user to untether from the iPhone for using the device the owner still has to own an iPhone to operate the AWOS The owner will also have to add another line and a separate data plan Additionally the AWOS will still only be compatible with the Apple operating system something other devices have greater flexibility with than Apple But none of this really matters as the AWOS is still not an optimal smart device and priced too high to achieve market share akin to its iPhone companions or compete apples to apples with Fitbit As The Verge all but concludes I have confidently concluded many months ago The Apple Watch was and is a poorly conceived product development that Apple will have to pour more money into Even as a smartphone companion the AWOS has no viable purpose beyond the smartphone Everything on the AWOS that forces the price point beyond its competing smartwatches is available on the smartphone Even more unfortunate is that the AWOS lacks some of the key functions that make the smartphone such a daily part of our lives photography and gaming You really cant perform either of those applications within reason on the AWOS Gaming apps are the leading app downloads on smart devices Fitbit realized that form and function have to be optimal for a smart device and as such decided long ago not to travel down this unnecessary road of nonsensical smartwatch applications Its why the Fitbit Blaze is more of a smart fitness watch at than was an errand Apple Watch at and reduced in price to The next version of the Apple Watch will be just that the next version It will likely perform better than the previous version in terms of sellin but sellthrough will be equally as poor as the first Apple Watch I alerted investors and followers of the Apple Watch product development in my March st publication titled Apples Watch Presents Less Potential Than Investors Think The article had over comments some of which were deleted due to direct attacks on my person and was the first contrarian perspective on the potential of the Apple Watch My advanced data and analytics red flagged several issues with the Apple Watch that are inherent to most smartwatches of equality Unfortunately for Apple Inc the performance of the Apple Watch has borne out my analytics In short if FIT shareholders are worried about the next iteration of the Apple Watch good Its good and relevant to have a healthy fear andor understanding of the total wearables marketplace that Fitbit participates within However I think nearterm fears that may have induced some selling pressure on shares of FIT will be a longterm profitable opportunity for shareholders buying into that downturn Then again I expected a rally from the level perspective and big picture When Im wrong Im wrong and fortunately it happens less often than when Im proven accurate in my trading activities As it pertains to shares of FIT with profitable trades in hand YTD and maintaining my current position which has recently grown in size I remain confident that shares of FIT will appreciate near term I truly desired for shares of FIT to close below on June th as this would have likely sparked a flush in selling pressure the following morning But unfortunately that opportunity to buy shares at a potentially lower price didnt come to pass Shares are seemingly rebounding intraday by and ahead of an allimportant FED announcement Wednesday morning Longer term Fitbit needs to broaden its scope of products in order to achieve a greater level of profits and expand its share price multiple Lastly Fitbit executives have to create their own operating playbook in order to inspire shareholders who might better understand the typical hardwarecentric company growth cycle and which I will dive a little deeper into with my next publication I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Technology Diversified Electronics
