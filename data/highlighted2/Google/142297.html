Mohit Manghnani Buy Yahoo as currently it is undervalued Stocks discussed on the indepth session of Jim Cramers Mad Money TV Program Thursday August The market has become a falling knife For a good chunk of time buying stocks on dips or weakness has paid off in the long run This is the time investors and money managers wait for to buy stocks at a bargain price I think this market has changed in that the vast majority of portfolio managers have suddenly become fearful of buying the dips said Cramer He discussed that over the past few years markets have given tremendous opportunities to buy stocks by falling The Fed rate hike scare Greek crisis Russia and Ukraine Iran deal etc all led to fears and the market dipping which gave bargains and discounts on stocks Things are different now The market seems to be in a freefall and money seems to waiting on the sidelines for the market to bottom There have been stocks with new lows in the past few days which means that those investors who bought on dips have been losing If this wasnt enough the commodity sector has taken a heavy beating and coal energy iron ore stocks are down by almost from their highs Even the MLPs were not spared Rails and industrial sectors were also hit and then it was the tech sectors turn due to weakness in China and the strong dollar A company like Apple NASDAQ AAPL was also hit These moves have hit the investors who buy on dips very hard This strategy failed for reliable stocks like Disney NYSE DIS and Viacom NASDAQ VIA NASDAQ VIAB The only leader in this market has been Netflix NASDAQ NFLX What is good for Netflix is only good for Netflix Youre trying to catch a falling knife and unless youre a butcher block youll have very little to show for it except bright red losses oozing from your portfolio said Cramer CEO interview Allergan NYSE AGN The drug company formerly known as Actavis delivered a very strong quarter by beating earnings and revenue estimates but the stock got slammed This was the companys first quarter after the acquisition of Allergan The company has almost products in the pipeline in midtolate stage development Cramer thinks since the company delayed issuing guidance till September the stock was hammered He interviewed CEO Brent Saunders The DOJ investigation really is a red herring Each one of these things are important and we disclosed it this morning said Saunders He added that drug pricing is more like a commodity business that works on supply and demand The government has been used to seeing the drug prices going down He mentioned that Actavis integration in the US is almost complete Cramer then posed a question on dividend as the companys balance sheet is strong However due to the tax status of the balance sheet acquisitions make more sense The company has made B of acquisitions this year and Allergan has earned credibility to deploy capital in the most effective way The companys Alzheimers drug will be eligible for reimbursement from Medicare from The companys effort in making a breakthrough in depression is in early stages There is a sectorwide decline in all media stocks and loss of some subscribers in Disney has led to investor panic Its certainly the end of their high valuations said Cramer Disney is different from other media companies as content from them can be streamed at a later date but users cannot stream ESPN as sports do not have shelflife This is the bread and butter of Disneys offering Why is Disney still declining then Cramer said that it has to do more with the mechanics of the stock market than the stock itself as huge quantities of stocks were not sold on the first day by money managers Barring a catastrophe in the market I think the sellers will be done tomorrow and Disneys huge buyback will mop up whats left said Cramer Money managers have started believing that Disney is not a growth stock anymore and hence are removing it from their portfolios The fact still remains that if Disney continues losing subscribers they will either have to cut prices or diversify The issue I have with the sellers is that its not like Disneys CEO Bob Iger doesnt know this said Cramer Bob Iger has built theme parks and movie studios and with Disneyland Shanghai coming up along with Star Wars the company remains in good shape It is much better than other media companies that depend on subscriber growth Cramer believes Disney will succeed and by this time next year it will be diversifying away from cable faster than any other company How is Clorox managing to perform when Procter Gamble NYSE PG and KimberlyClark NYSE KMB havent been able to The company has a lot less international exposure and is incredibly managed which makes it good The company reported an earnings beat along with higher than expected revenues and the stock is up in the last week Cramer interviewed Cloroxs new CEO Benno Dorer He said that the company is continuously delivering consistent and profitable growth Burts Bees brand is focused on younger consumers and hence Clorox has partnered with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL to advertise online Almost of the advertisement budget is for online advertising The company is also monitoring social media for flu outbreaks and helping get disinfecting wipes to local retailers just when theyre most needed As consumers want quick cleaning products the wipes are an important product He also discussed other products like bleach and trash bags and the innovation which drives their sales On leaving Venezuela he said that it was the right move as the company was losing money there There are companies that do well as Fed rates do not matter to their business Zoetis is the largest animal health company in the world that makes vaccines and medicines for both pets and livestock The company reported a good quarter on Tuesday but the stock did not rally In fact Cramer thinks that this is the kind of stock investors should be buying Activist Bill Ackmans Pershing Square owns more than in the company Cramer interviewed CEO Juan Ramon Alaix to find out what lies ahead for the company Alaix said that the world will need medicines and technology in order to feed the population Outbreaks in poultry and cattle is an issue that will always be present Thats where Zoetis steps in As pet spending in the US increases per year the companys animal companion products are growing well There were also supply issues and the company is improving production and by theyll be meeting all customer demand On the relationship with Pershing Square he said We now have a representative of Pershing Square on our board and it is good to have the perspective of an important shareholder in the discussion with our board So I think the collaboration is going very well EMC NYSE EMC The fundamentals of EMCs business slowed a long time ago Be careful of this and VMware NYSE VMW Solar City NASDAQ SCTY This is a cult stock Six Flags NYSE SIX and Cedar Fair NYSE FUN Both these companies are money and are well run Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO Yahoo is a buy as excluding Alibaba NYSE BABA and Yahoo Japan it should be worth
