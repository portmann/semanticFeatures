class='textDiv'>Yahoo Search May Offer Shareholders A Glimmer Of Hope Yahoo Inc NASDAQYHOO Seeking Alpha Yahoos revamped search deal with Microsoft will give it the necessary financial incentive to develop its own search technology internally The implications of this modified search deal is favorable to Yahoo shareholders as the company has the capability and resources to develop a competing search alternative to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Bing Also recent deals with Firefox Microsoft and mobile apps gives me greater conviction in the bull thesis of Yahoo post Alibaba spinoff Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO will outperform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL this year based on the value of its Alibaba NYSE BABA holdings and the potential upside in its MVNS segments Its kind of ironic when taking into consideration <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has the higher quality business a wellestablished moat in search and promising business ideasproducts in development at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>X <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has more cash than Yahoo and has a better Search product So why invest into Yahoo when all indicators point to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>as one of the better stewards of capital for the st century Yahoo is working on the few areas it knows how to compete in and the initial comments on the modification of its search deal with Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT may offer a glimmer of hope for investors following the taxefficient spinoff of Alibaba Heres what Marissa Mayer stated on the quarterly earnings conference call We were excited last week to announce a renewed and amended partnership with Microsoft This renewed partnership allows us greater flexibility and enhances competitiveness by allowing us to iterate and experiment more with our user experience and monetization The amended agreement has a fiveyear remaining term and is distinctly similar to the prior arrangement except that it reduces our exclusivity commitments on PC to addresses the traffic acquisition cost we pay Microsoft on a gross basis rather than a net basis and lets Yahoo Call on Microsoft for search only ads only or both together paying a fixed cost rather than a revenue share for items that we discard without display The second sentence where Mayer mentions flexibility iterate and experiment with user experience and monetization is perhaps the most important For starters Yahoo hasnt gained any search share in fact it lost share following the search deal it inked with Microsoft back in Sometimes dealmakers put together poor performing deals and this was one of those deals What Yahoo lost in the prior deal was the ability to differentiate its service from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Microsoft The lack of differentiation made it difficult for users to rationalize the use of Yahoo Search over competing alternatives After all if the search experience was going to be the same on both Yahoo and Bing why use Yahoo Also Yahoo Search is difficult to access Unlike <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Bing you have to type SearchYahoocom Yahoocom goes to the homepage instead of the search engine which baffles me If Yahoocom went directly to the search page more users would use Yahoo Search On SearchYahoocom all of Yahoos adjacent properties like Yahoo Mail and Yahoo Finance have links at the top So its a much better layout than the homepage But heres the problem Yahoo doesnt have useful Search technology yet It outsourced that problem to Microsoft Yahoo went from having to allocate of its traffic to Microsofts search engine to of search traffic for PCs This means that Yahoo can directly monetize half of its own search queries with its own search technology Since Yahoo has the potential to monetize its own internally developed search technology further resources will be committed to developing a new search algorithm This search algorithm will need to work across a universe of applications web pages and nonstandard file formats Furthermore the mobile search feature will need to become a digital assistant similar to Siri but with the ability to interact with an ecosystem of applications Combining contextual search with a mobile digital assistant could give Yahoo the technological edge it needs However competition will be fierce Microsoft is working on revamping its entire software ecosystem and needless to say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has an inherent advantage because it operates Android For those reasons Yahoo will need to quickly innovate and invest aggressively into marketing to develop a musthave search app Overall the next five years may be different from the prior years of Yahoos history Its still an underdog in the search space but recent events indicate that Yahoo still has a shot at reclaiming some of its lost momentum across display and search advertising For those reasons investors should consider buying the stock following the spinoff of its Alibaba stake Source Yahoo Search May Offer Shareholders A Glimmer Of Hope Disclosure The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within
