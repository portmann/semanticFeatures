class='textDiv'>The Real Problem in Corporate America its More than Bezos Yes the conditions described in the very long and detailed New York Times Amazon work conditions piece are not pretty But Amazon is far from alone in cultivating this type of environment and I dont think the conditions described are for the reasons people think namely Jeff Bezos Amazons CEO and founder being a maniac Side note Bezos is by all accounts a saint compared to what the much beloved Steve Jobs was Most importantly contrary to popular belief I dont think Amazon or any company benefits from this type of culture and would be wise to snuff it out Before the New York Times ever broke this story the writing was on the wall for Amazon Over a year ago Gawker shared the personal testimonial of an Amazon warehouse worker and a day later of a white collar corporate worker That press should have been a warning sign that more was on the way The New York Times picked up where those stories left off and took it to the next level by interviewing over former and current Amazon employees to get their views on working for the company Their testimony describes a culture where you are expected to put in hours a week take no true weekends or vacation time deprioritize your family and health answer emails at all hours politic and backstab just to keep your job and get burned out almost immediately In other words in exchange for compensation the company owns you Bezos immediately responded that this is not the Amazon he knows Maybe it is maybe it isnt But that many people with similar themed stories is more than just coincidence Its easy to blame the CEO when stuff like this comes out and Bezos should not be absolved of responsibility However whats going on at Amazon is not in isolation Its merely a symptom of a much bigger problem at tech companies and in corporate America today employees are often seen as easily replaceable commodities to burn and churn and get as many hours of productivity out of as possible And theres a huge misconception that more hours more productivity Ive been in the highstress tech industry working for an indirect and sometimes direct competitor of Amazon for over years Ive put in the hour weeks Ive been on the brink of calling it quits a number of times So Ive been following this story very closely can relate to much of what is being reported and know many people in the industry who have been treated in similar ways Heres my take Amazon Facebook <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Samsung Netflix Microsoft LinkedIn Twitter Apple much of their success comes from being early movers on key technologies products and services that there was a huge unknown demand for The success of these companies has exploded and there is immense shareholder pressure for these companies to maintain their torrid early growth rates so management is poked and prodded to always produce more With these companies approaching or surpassing employees it becomes harder and harder to maintain high growth As these companies grow in size there are increasingly more levels of management Each layer pushes on those underneath them Every single manager in these companies wants to quickly ascend the ranks and capture the very handsome incremental rewards that come at each new level What you end up with is a greeddriven pressurecooker ultracompetitive bloodbath The resulting turnover becomes so high that employees are viewed as commodities out of necessity This is much of corporate America not just tech Now when Bezos and other CEOs say This is not the company that I know as he has stated I believe them Politics mask the truth Those who ascend into management are wonderful politickers and politickers are great at politicking Each layer of management is going to paint a rosy picture upward while reaping as much gains as they can from those below Managers and lower level workers are in constant fear of being ostracized for providing any sort of realistic criticisms upward And without any union representation they really have no individual or collective protections Who is standing up for them HR the companys internal law firm Upper management could work hard at counteracting this by Keeping layers of management to a minimum Incentivizing the right behavior such as a greater emphasis on life in the worklife balance equation But they dont because they dont know the full extent of the problem and if they do they incorrectly think that turning a blind eye will lead to better financial results That and creating a positive culture is a lot of hard work One of Facebooks cofounders Dustin Moskovitz had some interesting comments about the tech industry as a whole that I completely agree with and think they can be more broadly applied to the rest of corporate America Productivity naturally drops off the more hours you put in Many still think you get a net increase in overall productivity but Moskovitz and I disagree Eventually with burnout and dissatisfaction from your role more hours will lead to lower productivity than a balanced hour workweek That productivity vacuum looks something like this over hours worked Eventually as burnout and stress sets in you get less productivity out of hour workers than you do out of wellbalanced baseline hour workers At the same time call me oldschool but I still think experience and wisdom have value Unfortunately ageism in the tech industry is very real and a yearold with no worklife balance is highly desired over a year old with a family yearolds dont argue with status quo either alas they too will eventually turn and find their fate has changed This corporate sentiment is deadwrong There is no reason why an experienced or yearold with a family cant coexist with an eager yearold That age and experience diversity in the tech workplace is extremely positive and undervalued The fact that it is not leads to dissatisfaction and eventual turnover So what does Bezos think about the allegations against his company I strongly believe that anyone working in a company that really is like the one described in the NYT would be crazy to stay I know I would leave such a company Well I hate to break it to you Jeff but they are Whats the average length of employment at Amazon One Freaking YearAmazon retains new workers in part by requiring them to repay a part of their signing bonus if they leave within a year As soon as they can keep that bonus theyve probably already spent it for therapy and anxiety meds they are outta there Amazon spokesperson Jay Carney defended the high turnover rate at Amazon saying Ahh thanks for hammering home my thesis Jay Even if this statement is factually correct it doesnt pass as justification There is a belief in the tech world that employees are easily replaced commodities That mentality comes with significant costs I challenge each and every tech executive to explain how this mantra is ROIpositive or in any way beneficial to the company The average cost of lost productivity due to inexperience and learning curve missed work time recruitment signing bonuses training and not long after losing that employee has to be K in the tech industry In some roles I have been in I have seen it be as high as M It does not pay to constantly spin wheels just to fill cubes Amazon and other tech companies need to seriously ask themselves this question Could it be that our success is much more attributable to continuing to reap the rewards of our firstmover advantage and dominant market position than our misguided corporate culture And could we be even more successful with a better culture I think the answer to both those questions is a demonstrative HELL YES Tech workers are much less happy with their jobs but they are well compensated The supporters of these types of work environments will often say something along the lines of You know what youre getting into when you choose to work there Youre getting well paid If you dont like it leave But when this is the norm in corporate America the tech industry has just taken it to the next level where are they going to go Why is the responsibility always on the worker to make things right by either forcing themselves to digest that bitter pill or pick up and move with the hope that they will have better luck with their next employer Why do employees have to turn over their lives rights and dignity in exchange for being well compensated Isnt it enough to provide the company with a shitload of value and return on their investment in you It doesnt have to be this way There is no reason why corporate management cant demand better Happy healthy experienced valued balanced employees not only create the best culture and working environment but they are the most effective and the best for their employers bottom lines It pays to have a heart Corporate America you can do better than exchanging compensation for the perceived right to own people and shit on them Amazon was unfortunate enough to get called out for it Your company could be next You have to do better Because people can and will only take so much Dont be the problem be the solution I am GE Miller this is my story My goal is financial independence ASAP If you share that goal join me others by getting FREE email updates Youll also find every post by category every post in order It might be cool to meet you in person one day Do you ever go to meetngreets at conventions or meet your readers While giant faceless corporations certainly deserve their fair share of the blame so do their employees I think most people would be happier making K a year and working ish hours a week than they would making K a year and working ish hours a week The problem is too many people get caught up on status and the money needed to keep up with the Joneses that they lie to themselves about what they really want Otherwise they wouldnt even apply to highpressure highpay highworkload jobs like these There are plenty of good jobs out there for skilled individuals that pay well not as well but well and dont require ridiculous hours Its just whether or not people are willing to turn down tons of money especially early in their careers to find them Yeah and then theres the folks who work but put in actual hours Once someone does this especially a manager it has a domino effect on the rest of the team Management needs to lead and set good boundaries by not emailing at all hours of the day and on weekends But everyone else needs to follow suit as well Im ok with the argument that people make about working hours a week it sucks But if you are working hours a week making K a year well it would seem pretty logical to stream line your fixed costs and save as much of the K as you can You essentially are working x and making x so you can work as long to retire I happen to work almost hours a week and make close to K I work really hard but I am compensated for it Im on a year plan to stop working at age so long as I focus on that goal and not go off my rocker I should be ok right Thats all good in theory But most white collar jobs are salary so hours hours hours all equals the same pay Now in a perfect world if you put in hours of good work and your manager saw this and you quickly got promoted great But it would take a series of promotions over many years to double your salary If you found yourself in the right situation with the right manager and the right promo structure it could pay off In the real world all it takes is one manager who doesnt like you one manager who wants to control salaries one reorg one departmental shift one reassignment for all that to go out the window Id like to say that hard work is always adequately rewarded with compensation but anyone who has been in the corporate world for long enough knows that isnt always the case And even if it is is it worth or even X the salary for working X the hours I dont know Ive struggled with that myself over the years Youll probably get a better return on investment working on your likability and making friends in the office than you are plugging away all those extra hours and hoping the right people notice Ultimately its up to you and your best assessment and perceptions of your work environment at any given time I cant tell people how many hours they should or should not put in You nailed it It is definitely a trade off time vs money vs work effort The x or x your salary just comes with more taxes too Im dont feel over worked but on occasion put in extra hours Thats what engineers do Love job and while the pay isnt as much as I would like I can work with it and know I could easily be else where making less as workers hours so its a win for me currently Some of us are not into status but want money so we can retire I want to be able to retire with my significant other who makes almost nothing when I am That is going to require some This is the byproduct of a work environment where the supply of potential workers outweighs the number of available positions Its time for a universal basic income to give people a safety net to leave terrible work environments and strike out on their own as freelancers Interesting shift in the work force that is growing bigger than ever Good employers an good for employees too Less overall taxes on wages The loser will be less federal tax dollars and socially security taxes But it doe help in the way of less people in the traditional workforce also Which reduces employee count and increases wage competition for those left working traditional job While I like the sentiment of the article I think youve got a long way to go to show that the steps you suggest would result in success for a business How many large tech companies are there Lets just say a lot Are you trying to tell me theres a way for them to be more productive while retaining employees that is able to be implemented on a large scale doesnt cost them any money and precisely NONE of them are doing it I find that a bit hard to believe A big part of it I suspect is that when a company hits a certain size it becomes pretty much impossible for the passionate employees to make a difference For every passionate hardworking employee there are probably who do the bare minimum to not be fired Yes ideally the managers would sort them out but chances are some of those passionate people are going to have bare minimum managers at some point going up the scale and lose their motivation If Im busting my ass for hours a week but another guy sits around doing hours of work in a hour week and we both get the same raise because of budget restrictions what incentive do I have On the flip side if corporate gives managers free reign to give out raises for performance managers are going to give everyone crazy raises because that makes everyone happy and easier to manage I guess what Im saying is its easy to model a successful corporation on motivated and hardworking employees where a hour workweek and giving them more free time would be beneficial In the real world though a LOT of employees are extremely inefficient I dont find it hard to believe they accidentally do some extra work if theyre forced to stay at the office for longer You always have the option of starting your own company and running it that way but dont be surprised if it becomes impossible after you hit a certain size You could also use that technique when you become a manager Then again once youre managing a group of managers it may become a bit tougher I served years in the military and never once did I work hours in one week And I was serving my country So there is NO WAY IN HELL I would work that many hours for a company Ill take the pay cut My health family and quality of life are more important than a few extra bucks In fact they are priceless Really What did you do in the military I didnt make a career out of it but when I was in the Navy and deployedshore duty was a lot less work there were practically no weeks where I didnt work hours Keep in mind that during deployment weekends might have slightly more downtime but still require you to work hours is about hours of workday on average I do agree with a number of your sentiments here GE but I really do think you put too much blame on Corporate America and not enough blame on individual workers As another poster stated far too many people are obsessed with status and money and they knowingly kill themselves and then complain about it to get these things While the pharase if you dont like it then leave is a bit cliche it also holds a lot of truth Im glad to see that so many people at Amazon leave due to this toxic culture but more people need to take this attitude I have a really hard time feeling bad for people who work crazy hours by choice when they could always doing something else and take a pay cut CNNMoney and Boston Globe recently reported more MBAs are going to tech companies than Wall Street firms You make a lot of good points but is there a novelty or buzz about going to a tech company Promises of stock options Maybe society is having a fun time beating up Wall Street almost any politician will do this for votes but to have Amazon on your business card or resume might help write the ticket for the next thing in life Its just interesting that the culture at some of these tech firms can be pretty rough as you rightly describe but recent grads are still gravitating there I suppose in comparison to Wall Street tech is probably a walk in the park However Amazon vs Goldman and Goldman pays twice as much Im going Goldman You got that right Just had an interesting conversation with a coworker his brother worked for Goldman from worked years with salary and bonus he made M Hes and Never has to work a day more in his life nor do his kids Touche Id do that starting tomorrow The NYT piece was eye opening I thought employees of these big tech companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>loved working for them I cant even imagine the health issues that will crop up from working at such a frenetic pace If Amazons average retention expectancy is genuinely one year that alone is enough of an indicator of how employees are treated I am also curious on how Amazon treats its blue collar workers ie phone operators compared to white collar workers The conditions sound awful and I feel very sorry for the employees who have to endure this kind of behavior This kind of expose posts will help to improve the conditions As more people become aware of these conditions Amazon will hopefully become embarrassed enough to take action Great post thanks for sharing This is an eyeopener Im glad I never had to work at a company that required more than hours or coming in on a weekend </div></body></html>
