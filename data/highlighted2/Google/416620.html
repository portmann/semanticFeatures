in Wall Street announced the purchase of a large block ofApple shares few weeks ago has made everyone wonder why now Apple has lost around of its price since last year Last public results from the company showed a decrease in total revenue and profits due to a shrink in the company sales China was supposed to be the biggest market for Apple which would allow Apple continue growing exponentially but China is not a good market for apple Chinese people dont seem to like iphones and Apple hasnt been able to maintain that growth Learn how to trade smarter today risk free Find winning trades in minutes Our financial guru has decided to invest in Apple shares That makes all think that maybe we have missed something Makes us wonder if maybe there is something else hidden somewhere Lets see The Apple watch hasnt worked It hasnt changed the way we look at watches as the iphone did with phones So we have the iphone success the ipad the iMac Good enough and then the rest of the stuff hasnt performed as good in the market Probably there are so many new projects going on at the back of the Apple lab The top secret Apple car could be presented to the public before we imagine We just cant know if all these rumors are true or not This brings us to the point where we dont know how apple is going to do in the coming future The best investor in the world thinks the situation will be favorable but thats it If we want to adopt a conservative attitude towards this situation we need to consider that maybe God WBuffett is wrong this time and Apple will continue to lose value for another year What I am trying to say is that nobody knows the truth about Apples current innovative capacity to maintain that added value to their stock price At the moment it is the top one technological company in the world in all terms But that can change as we have seen before with other companies like for example Nokia Nokia used to be the best mobile phone producer company in the world Until When Steve Jobs launches the iphone Apple takes over Nokia in sales in less than a year Something completely unpredictable at that time when Nokia would launch a new phone every few months Personalized products where many different designs were made Millions of phones sold of each model The phone with biggest sales in the world it is still the Nokia with more than million units sold Discover the secret to uncovering the most profitable stocks If we compare both companies Apple and Nokia it is funny now to see how both reacted differently to the same problem Between the years took place the crisis of the com companies Technological companies that were pretending to change the way we would look at the world The market created a financial bubble and many companies were looked as bluffs Apple was one of these companies that suffered from the bad performance and not offering any real change But Nokia even if the price fell in with the generalized panick continued as the market leader reaching the dollars again in when it started to fall stabilizing itself around the dollars While apple was traded at dollars in and fell to after Not being able to rise again until when the jump took them all the way up to dollars a year ago Today is traded around dollars Will Apple follow the same path as Nokia did after its big success Or it will reinvent itself to continue at the top We cannot know but we can wait to see what comes next and see if there is still any room for a rise in price This respect everyone has for Buffett can change the natural trend of a certain stock because when he says he bought Apple then few minutes later Apple starts to increase in price It was traded at dollars just before he announced hes bought Apple shares Already risen to Only time will prove him right As a final thought I like to think about what Buffett said long time ago in a conference Warren Buffett only invests in companies he can understand Usually he never liked technological companies because they were too volatile he said But now he is beginning to see opportunities in technology companies The entry into the capital of Apple became public after Warren Buffett himself confirmed that it will support the offer of Dan Gilbert founder of Quicken Loans by Yahoo But Buffett also said he will only accept it with appropriate safeguards Berkshire Hathaway already made a similar move when Burger King bought Tim Hortons coffee shops or recently in the merger between Heinz and Kraft Learn how to trade smarter risk free Find winning trades in minutes Master the tricks to
