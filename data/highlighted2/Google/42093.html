flatrate data pricing makes wireless data similar to utilities like water or electricity If flatrate data pricing becomes standard Verizon would lose billions in revenue that it currently gets due to

NASDAQ GOOGL is out to change how US consumers think of data plans A consequence of this shift Verizons NYSE VZ wireless margins could be destroyed Theres been a lot of discussion about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Fi since it launched last week both on Seeking Alpha and across the web Much of that discussion has focused on the potential of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Fi to undercut carriers or whether Fi will be meaningful for Googles bottom line Both of these ideas miss the actual potential of the service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>isnt trying to establish itself as a major carrier at least at the moment Its trying to push people into viewing data as a basic commodity in the way people currently think of water or electricity One of the main talking points for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Fi is its promise to refund customers each month for any unused data on its plan This alone would be a huge step forward for customers but its not the most radical aspect of Fis pricing The most important announcement and one of the least covered so far is its policy on what happens if you need additional data That means if customers go over their selected data plan they arent penalized with throttled speeds as ATT NYSE T and TMobile NYSE TMUS do or charged inflated overage fees as Verizon does Most importantly it means that a customer could sign up for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Fi select the lowest data plan at per month and treat the service as a payasyougo system with no repercussions They can use as much or little as they want and pay the same rate Again this essentially puts wireless data on a pricing system akin to utilities For US consumers this is an overdue change For the large carriers and Im going to focus on Verizon in particular here such a shift poses a huge threat Why Verizons wireless margins are so high To understand why payasyougo or flatrate data pricing would be bad news for Verizon we need to look at its margins Verizon currently has great margins on its wireless business For Q its total wireless EBITDA margin was Its operating margin was One of the main things supporting this is the fact that most customers are paying Verizon for data they dont use every month According to the most recent report from mobile intelligence firm Validas the average cell phone user has in unused data left over at the end of the month per cellphone line That equals per line per year for Verizon which unlike TMobile or ATT doesnt allow customers to rollover any data If flatrate pricing like the kind <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Fi is offering becomes standard Verizons operating profit will take a serious hit Lets look at the numbers using Validass estimate which as a calculation across carriers could be slightly higher or lower for Verizonspecific customers Verizon has approximately million smartphone connections according to its Q earnings call Im going to leave tablets and other devices out of this analysis as the datause patterns are likely different If the average Verizon customer is paying per month per line for unused data that means Verizon is collecting billion a month because of this mismatch or billion a quarter Over a full year thats just under billion Removing the billion in revenue from unused data drops Verizons Q operating revenue from billion to billion Its operating margin drops from to Looking at the numbers it appears Verizon derives a significant amount of its revenue from customers paying for unused data and relies on this mismatch to support its inflated margins As consumers and the industry transition away from the tiered data plans that enabled this discrepancy Verizon will see significant losses Such a transition wont happen instantly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Fi is currently limited to one phone and relies on the smaller coverage maps of TMobile and Sprint NYSE S for its infrastructure However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has also shown the ability to spur significant change in established industries Its success in advancing widespread Gigabit Internet infrastructure via <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Fiber is a testament to this Regardless of how quickly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Fi itself takes off Verizons current wireless margins are likely unsustainable long term Flatrate data pricing will eventually become the standard as innovative carriers seek new ways to attract customers and gain a competitive advantage When evaluating the situation investors would do well to keep in mind Jeff Bezos popular quote your margin is my opportunity In this case Verizons margins are Googles opportunity Short Verizon The companys wireless business accounted for over of its operating revenue in Q and a large percentage of this is due to a price mismatch caused by tiered data plans As flatrate data pricing becomes standard this discrepancy will disappear and Verizons wireless margins will significantly decline Source Say Goodbye To Your Margins What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Fi Means For Verizon Disclosure The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned
