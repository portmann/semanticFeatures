billion plus users Theres been a lot of talk recently regarding technology giant Apple NASDAQ AAPL and its roughly three quarters of a trillion dollar market cap This is a truly remarkable number and many think that Apple could become the first to hit the trillion level In a similar respect investors may not realize that social media giant Facebook NASDAQ FB is about to reach the quarter trillion mark Today Ill detail why this could be just the beginning as this monster continues to grow The ways that these two companies generate their revenues are completely different although you could argue that Apple is an enabler for Facebook Apple makes a physical product such as an iPhone or iPad and its devices go for several hundred or even a few thousand dollars per unit On the other hand Facebooks billion plus users dont pay the company in a traditional sense The social media name generates most of its revenues from advertising which accounted for billion of the companys billion total in the fourth quarter of In about a month Apple will launch a new product the Apple Watch which will help the company on its next leg of growth Facebook also is looking at new ways to generate revenues especially when it comes to its popular messenger service Facebook is following in the footsteps of names like Line which had revenues of nearly million in Q on just million monthly active users Facebook has more than million Messenger users so there is a tremendous opportunity here Delivering new experiences and finding new revenue streams are a way for Facebook to sustain high revenue growth rates which analysts currently expect Interestingly enough Facebooks revenue growth nearly mirrors that of Apple albeit on a different timeline In the chart below you can see Apples revenues from fiscal to fiscal against Facebooks last three years and analyst projections for and Dollar values are in millions Facebooks last two years above are current projections but that also means that theres the chance to beat these numbers Just remember in the last months the average analyst revenue estimate has risen from billion to billion It is certainly possible that if the company continues to beat we could see revenues get close to billion in Due to the nature of the business Facebook also is more profitable at this point In Facebook had a GAAP profit of billion versus Apples billion in its middle year fiscal of the five above If Facebook is able to improve its GAAP net margin by the end of next year we could be looking at around billion in net income or so Thats a tremendous amount of profits in a space many dont judge as a money maker I dont think this train is slowing down anytime soon According to research from Forrester smartphone users spend the most time on the Facebook app and in that linked article comScore details that Facebook has the largest reach This is one reason why the social media giant has the number two spot in market share for net mobile US ad revenues only behind search giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>GOOG GOOGL In the chart below you can see where mobile ad revenues go and where they are expected to head this year and next While most of the data in the chart and linked article above may not be surprising it does help to detail why I like Facebook From to Facebook is expected to mostly maintain its share of the US mobile ad space while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is expected to lose a few hundred basis points of its share From to based on the numbers above Facebooks ad revenue growth is slated to be while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>comes in at just Overall we know that Facebook is growing at rates much higher than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>currently and I dont see that changing in the next couple of years While everyone seems to be focused on the massive market cap of Apple Facebook is quietly nearing the quarter trilliondollar point The social media giant is poised to continue its tremendous growth in the next couple of years and that trajectory is very similar to what we saw from Apple roughly a decade ago Everyone knows about the billion plus Facebook user number a tremendous user base that the company is just starting to monetize Mobile ad dollars are flowing toward Facebook and I believe the company will continue to steal away some of Googles pie in the next few years At about times expected nonGAAP EPS Facebook is much cheaper than its social media peers Twitter TWTR and LinkedIn LNKD The future of Facebook is definitely bright and Im looking forward to discussing the next milestone that this company hits Source Facebook The QuarterTrillion Monster Disclosure The author has no positions in
