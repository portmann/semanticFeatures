despite stellar growth Early results from seem to show the stabilization of subscriber losses seen in Q of has continued through early The video landscape continues to adapt and coming offerings from Hulu and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>for webbased TV will benefit Disneys Media Networks business I have written many articles consistently arguing that The Walt Disney Company NYSE DIS represents one of the best longterm investments in the SP due to its diverse and wildly popular stable of characters and proven franchise strategy of leveraging those characters across its business segments Despite blockbuster earnings growth in the last quarter of concerns over the companys ability to grow its all important Media Networks segment have weighed on the stock since last summer I continue to believe concerns over the impact of the shifting video consumption landscape are overblown and emerging trends in the first quarter of that build on the last quarter of seem to bolster this argument At the end of the rate of subscriber losses at the countrys largest TV providers slowed and in some cases began to reverse Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA the countrys largest provider grew subscriptions by over at the end of fourth quarter joining Verizon NYSE VZ and DISH Network NASDAQ DISH in adding subscribers at the end of the year Reported results for the first quarter of seem to show this trend from the end of is continuing Comcasts strong subscription additions from Q continued in Q of with the company adding another video customers in the first quarter versus a loss of in Q of last year This tally makes the first quarter of the strongest for net cable additions in nine years This impressive result means that Comcast is now net positive for traditional video customers over the past months The sustainability of this growth is also evident in Comcasts ability to grow its cable revenue per customer by in the first quarter of likely indicating strong demand for the companys new X product offering Verizon FiOS also experienced continued subscriber growth from the fourth quarter of through the first quarter of reporting net additions of some subscribers in the first three months of Verizon did not report as strong a revenue growth from its FiOS operation as Comcast reported from its video service but the company did manage to eke out a fractional revenue gain as it relied on lower pricing to drive subscriber growth and market penetration ATT NYSE T and Time Warner Cable NYSE TWC each reported modest subscriber losses that were smaller than or in line with the modest trends established in the previous quarter With ATT however these numbers are likely to have been negatively impacted by the company actively integrating its DirecTV acquisition and switching customers from its ATT Uverse product to DirecTV Even with the inevitable turmoil of integration the companys subscriber losses were approximately twotenths of a percent of its total customer base of million video subscribers In both cases however the TV providers were able to grow revenue in the video businesses demonstrating demand from its customers for the traditional TV product DISH Network has not yet reported its firstquarter results but it is reasonable to expect to see continued strength from the companys Sling TV product and a modest build or stabilization of net subscribers in the first quarter of It has become clear that there is still very strong demand for highquality video content from American consumers In fact video consumption has never been higher at any point in measured modern programming Disney CEO Bob Iger noted on the companys thirdquarter conference call in August of that the average American is now consuming approximately six hours of video content per day What is evolving is the means through which the consumer is accessing content The past two quarters of operational results for Comcast DirecTV Time Warner Verizon FiOS and very likely DISH Network demonstrate that consumers still value traditional video products if they are enhanced with choice and flexibility For example Comcast noted that nearly of all its video customers have now upgraded to the companys more expensive X platform that provides an integrated social streaming DVR and voice search platform Verizon too has noted that customers are choosing the socalled skinny bundles but looking to move up the value chain to larger packages of channels intermediate between a traditional and skinny bundle The opportunities in the market are still enormous a point that has been driven home this week with reports that both Hulu and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL will likely to begin offering streaming live TV service in DISs investors should recognize that the video delivery landscape is evolving but they should be confident that Disneys Media Networks segment is well positioned to capitalize on the change While the traditional pay TV industry has experienced modest subscriber losses over the past months it is very likely that these losses have largely moderated or even subsided as the traditional pay TV bundle still offers a large percentage of American families a reasonable value relative to their interests in video consumption In addition coming innovations and competition from Internetbased and skinny bundles from a variety of providers including Hulu and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>in will provide further avenues for growth in the companys Media Networks business I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no
