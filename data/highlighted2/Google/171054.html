expansion in terms of MAUs is pivotal to Facebooks success in the next twelve months EPS growth will pick up because of mobile ad growth and Oculus next spring creating exceptional versatility for the company Ive recently picked up a good amount of shares of Facebook NASDAQ FB to help diversify one of my clients portfolios a bit better I couldve picked Twitter NYSE TWTR or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL but I found Facebook to provide an incredibly simple and sound basis for an initial entry Great topline growth from impressive expansion of the user base domestic and abroad was the real pull factor and with my full confidence in Zuckerberg to provide future EPS stability based upon a slew of growth catalysts the upcoming Q report is looking bright on expansion potential With the global equity correction providing a lot of volatility in Facebooks stock I got in at the level which is decent considering the stock is trading at now Were now decently away from the alltime high of which from a simple psychological standpoint gives the stock adequate space to run So why did I buy on the dip Lets get into it When you have a tech company with doubledigit user growth its hard to pass up When we talk about Facebooks potentiality we have to turn directly to DAUs and MAUs DAUs are currently at million online and million on mobile both showing double digit growth from Q Is that necessarily sustainable If you figure another and trend in those categories YOY then were looking at DAUs of billion and billion respectively This isnt going to be any easy task but nonetheless I believe its possible given their past user growth statistics In particular in an increasingly scalable user base I think the Africa platform is going to need to show much greater user growth over the next twelve months The MAUs are in the same boat with double digit YOY growth just slightly higher for online and mobile at billion and billion If thats not incredible enough their acquisition of WhatsApp has now allowed for that app to pass million MAUs making it the second most downloaded app in the Android store and a real monetized force to be reckoned with Although its going to be a while until the billion acquisition cost is recovered there is little indication that this growing platform wont pay for itself The exceptional user growth altogether lends itself to exceptional financial metrics Just look at this beautiful OCF growth Despite one quarter of a slight dip the company has shown significant overall improvement keeping both short and longterm liquidity extremely high View the trend below Oh and with only million in longterm debt Im not worried about them being able to pay it down and if anything they have room to borrow much more That comes before we even mention the strength of billion worth of cash and marketable securities on top of an incredibly impressive gross margin of COGS have declined the last two quarters by nearly showing increased efficiency Theres very little not to get excited about here Revenue in Q was up when adjusted for currency translation Thats absurdly good when we look at them versus companies like Twitter who only have growth Furthermore Facebook crushes the industry average of If we pan back really quick to MAUs Twitter only has million MAU where as Facebook has nearly x that You can clearly see the resilience of Facebook relative to Twitter in the LTM All the news you hear about Twitter is that theyre a potential acquisition target while Facebook is a company more geared towards making acquisitions themselves and can do so based upon the amount of cash on hand Im not so concerned about competitors taking on Facebook given its scale but the comparison is certainly useful Looking forward perhaps one of the best catalysts moving forward for the company is the expansion into Africa Lining up the fresh statistics South Africa MAU is million which should grow now that the office in Johannesburg is directing development of all internet users in Africa are on Facebook If the growth trend in one quarter can continue over the next year given their revamped ad platforms Facebook is going to have an incredibly strong topline surpassing expectations With all of these positives of course I have a few concerns The effective tax rate is recorded in Q which is much higher than the standard US corporate tax rate of but this is because of a lack of cash kept overseas as well as the payment of stock options to employees As Facebook begins to mature as a company taxes and cash reserves will be better held and I expect to see a marginal reduction Another significant concern is bottomline stability In Q we saw a QOQ decline in diluted EPS of followed up by an even more disappointing decline in Q of Granted the bounce back in Q was notable at to rest at but we need to see more stability I fully believe the only way this is going to happen is to see stability in the ad platform and capturing the potential of the below listed catalysts Of course theres also the concern of currency headwinds which for Facebook the euro is a large concern but in the grand scheme of things the million loss due to translation in Q and total million for is not a lot when you consider the companys Q net income was million I believe these risks are fully countered by other catalysts including Oculus hitting store shelves early next year and providing a projected revenue stream of close to billion They still have to make up the acquisition cost of billion and fully integrate it with the Facebook platform but VR and AR are operating in an environment where the total market is expected to grow to an aggregate value of billion in just five years time leaving me incredibly confident in this catalyst Buying Instagram for billion is looking like a steal at this point with the thirty additional countries having ads by the end of September and new call to action buttons that basically let users subscribe sign up or buy something with a simple click The real valueadded component which I think is going to be huge is the second video ad options on Instagram considering the apps growing user base Instagram great acquisition by the company has the potential to do billion in ad revenue over the next four quarters The call to action integration to Facebook in general is going to be pivotal moving forward considering the million businesses that advertise on the site The new personal assistant M which now competes with Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Cortana and Apples NASDAQ AAPL Siri has exceptional monetization potential Im personally advocating for a buy rating not just because its at a good technical level but because of the astounding balance sheet and amount of growth catalysts Im curious if you own Facebook why did you buy it Im putting a price target on it of at least by December based upon my above analysis Id say that if global equity markets can gain some much needed traction itll hit in the next twelve months Disclosure I amwe are long FB MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my
