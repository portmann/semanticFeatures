Jan ET About Apple Inc AAPL By Eric Jhonsa SA News Editor Japans Nikkei reports Apple AAPL is expected to reduce output of the iPhone s and s Plus by around in the JanuaryMarch quarter compared with its original plans The paper adds Apple initially told component suppliers to keep production even with that seen for the iPhone a year ago but has seen SS inventories pile up at retailers in markets ranging from China and Japan to Europe and the US In December Apple sold off after longtime bull Morgan Stanley forecast in response to checks iPhone unit sales will drop in FY ends in September and added to its losses after Dialog Semi gets over half its sales from Apple issued a Q warning In November Credit Suisse reported of component order cuts Apple is trading near following the Nikkeis report Suppliers Cirrus Logic CRUS Skyworks SWKS Qorvo QRVO Avago AVGO and InvenSense INVN are also under pressure Update Morgan Stanley reacts to the Nikkeis report by noting a production cut is more than the it was modeling source Notable Calls For as long as Tim Cook stay silent Repeat something often enough and it becomes the truth He failed spectacularly in this regards Brilliant manager otherwise I think we are going to have this kind of AAPL reportedly cutting every other day until the th of this month Which by then would put the stock around USD Brace yourself as it is going to be an epic ride Unfortunately my predictions back last summer were right and AAPL will touch its low early spring Who needs a new phone All anybody needs now is the watch and the iPad Pro The phone is just a Server now Umm me my wife and my kid Dont know about you but years of lugging around a phone leaves it pretty damaged Last time we heard Apple ordered million iPhones S and S Plus How come the numbers changing overnight Who to believe iPhone S is great but the design is so boring now And D Touch is not yet a must have Touch ID is definitely must have To be able to drive and turn on my iPhone with TouchID is pure genius Im an Apple fan have used their products since the s but I just dont believe in the companys future under Cook Then if you dont beleieve in it and own shares sell them and go buy something else much more exotic that will make you happy But stop pointing fingers at someone who does a perfect job while no one knows what you have achieved in your life Last I heard AW Apple Watch if I need to spell out that for you is doing very very well Their iPad pro pencil is doing alright tv doing well music sub doing well Pray tell where else <span style='background-color:

Cook is a brilliant manager more so that Steve Jobs ever was His one mortal sin is to stay silent through times like this I understand hes in black out period but something like please read what Ive said or we will find out come Jan th is more than enough to calm the market Of course he could be saving his sucker punch for the ER I feel like he will drop some comments on these monstop rumors FWIW which is not much I bought a new gb iPhone s yesterday Sales rep at the Verizon store here in Nashville TN said out of phones he sells are iPhone It was the Green Hills location so a more affluent part of town Swks supplies all major smart phone manufactures and has per cent yoy growth non mobile it seems this means very little and swks gets punished I think this is shaking the tree again and again to trim the weak holders They know something about the ER Thenorthchannel Yes just another rumors throwing out to bash Apple before the earning reports on the th I wonder how much the author who from Japan get paid to write this article Dishonest journalists lost creditbility all together the truth will prevail Getting tired of the same talk about Apple There is no computer like the Mac and people concentrate only on phones how about the tablets and the good dividend they pay enjoying buying Apple at a cheap price and keeping some money for other bargains Have you all lost your minds mortgage your house raid your childs account buy as much stock as you can at All I have to say is over of their revenue comes from iPhone sales they are not very diversified Too many people think they know how Apple works and get proven wrong every time My bet is that some new product is cannibalizing phone sales and that well discover what it is at the end of the month ETF Screener Search and
