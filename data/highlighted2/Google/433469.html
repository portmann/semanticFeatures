everything from the price to the release date While hard details are hard to come by at least one concrete fact emerged last week Learn how to trade smarter today risk free Find winning trades in minutes Apple AAPL has found a new supplier for the phones modem chips Instead of exclusively going with Qualcomm QCOM Apple is now working with Intel INTC for some versions of the upcoming iPhone According to Bloomberg Intels modem chips will be used on iPhones for ATTs network while Qualcomm remains the supplier for Verizon network phones and for China Its a small but important step for Intel to finally make some headway into the lucrative mobile industry ATT is the USs second largest cell provider by market share so Apples decision to expand its supplier base is a significant breakthrough for the mobilechallenged Intel Intel is the worlds largest chip manufacturer yet the rise of mobile technology in the past decade caught the bluechip company completely off guard A month ago Intel conceded that theyre restructuring their approach to the mobile industry in light of a massive person layoff Discover the secret to uncovering the most profitable stocks Admitting defeat Intel canceled its upcoming new smartphone and tablet This concession was probably a wise move as the companys mobile division lost billion in and billion in Despite those heavy losses and a slowing market

promising field as Audi announced that the lineup of vehicles will feature Qualcomm processors The company is also shaking up its licensing agreements for patents to hopefully bring in billion in revenues by While Intel is looking to break into the mobile industry in a significant way Qualcomm is doing the opposite and hoping to break out Both companies are making solid efforts in diversifying
