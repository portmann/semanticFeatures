VLKAF VLKAY by Anton Wahlman GM and perhaps Ford could have the capacity to show an internal Uber competitor within months and launch service by the end of New younger management at GM and Ford see the high valuations of nextgen taxi companies such as Uber and want some of that GM and Ford are embedding G LTE connectivity in their cars and would benefit from a higher market share in shared taxi services I list the reasons why the other major automakers are less likely to offer Uberstyle taxi services at this kind of scale in this timeframe GM CEO Mary Barra is giving the keynote presentation at the Consumer Electronics Show and perhaps the Chevy Bolt wont be the sole highlight There is a long list of reasons why I expect GM NYSE GM andor Ford NYSE F to launch direct Uber Pending UBER competitors starting already in the next two years Lets dive right into it The automobile industry as a whole is one of low profitability over a decadelong upanddown cycle We are now close to what could be the peak of a cycle and many automakers are operating in midsingle digit net margins When times eventually turn south losses are almost guaranteed This is so because the automobile industry as we have known it for almost years has become increasingly competitive with new brands such as Hyundai and Kia having entered the US market over the last years The future looks even bleaker given that we are just now starting to see Chinesemade cars arriving in US dealerships and new Chineseowned automakers setting up shop on US soil With these low margins and a muted industry growth rate over a tenyear cycle multiples on sales and profits are naturally also low Ford and GM have almost identical market caps right now billion and billion as well as almost identical revenue at just a hair above billion a year The trailing PS ratio on both companies is right around an extremely low number by almost any comparison reflecting low net margins The latest auto industry bogeyman for sales and profitability is shared mobility with privately held Uber being the poster child The idea is that fewer cars will be sold partially offset by those fewer cars having a higher utilization ratio and therefore needing more frequent replacement and service events Being privately held Uber doesnt disclose financials so were left with much speculation sometimes heavily conflicting such One report suggested million in revenue and million in operating losses based on allegedly leaked documents It would have to be off by a lot to come even close to justify a total company value which now is said to be between billion and billion or similar to GM and Ford Then theres Tesla NASDAQ TSLA which has a fully diluted market cap of billion million shares multiplied by but lost million last quarter so on an annualized basis almost billion GAAP revenue was million so close to billion annualized although growing fast At the PS ratio awarded to Ford and GM Tesla would be worth barely billion not billion One of the factors behind Teslas market cap holding around the same level as during the average of the last months despite worsening bottomline losses and cash burn is the talk that started in early August on the subject of Tesla offering an Uberlike car sharing service The possibility was raised by Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas on the two most recent quarterly conference calls in what sounded like a prearranged staged QA in which Tesla could make people believe something without having to say it offering the equivalent of no comment The exchange sounded like someone had been inspired by the famous B bomber scene in Wag The Dog Regardless of how the discussion came about its pretty clear that Wall Street has viewed the optionality surrounding the possibility that Tesla could launch an Uberlike service as a positive helping cushion the other negative trends in net income and cash burn The fact that the idea is that Teslas taxi service would be fed with driverless cars is a whole other matter Good luck making that happen within the next decade or two Unlike Tesla GM and Ford could launch this kind of a service at huge scale already in instead of waiting somewhere between a decade and forever for driverless cars But its not just Uber and the speculation about Teslas taxi plans Apple NASDAQ AAPL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL may also enter the car business in taxiservice form and there is already speculation about the intentions of privatelyheld Chinese LeTV Faraday Future which will show its first vehicle in early You can see the issue here as far as Ford and GM are concerned Companies such as Uber and Tesla are being awarded huge valuations based in whole or in part on new forms of taxi services and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Apple may not be too many years behind At the same time GM and Ford move metal down assembly lines to the tune of PS ratios just like theyve been doing for close to years The First Step GM and Ford Prepare for Ubiquitous Connectivity Two years ago GM started down the path of offering embedded G LTE in its cars That transformation is now largely complete with almost of GM vehicles sold today having it as standard When this happened I thought that one useful app for this functionality was that you could build in an Uber drivers app into the GM cars so that you would get a better and more reliable experience than having the Uber drivers app running on a separate smartphone Well I dont think I was thinking big enough Instead of just enabling Uber to optimize for GM cars why not integrate forward vertically into offering the entire taxi service yourself If a company such as Uber is getting a valuation exceeding billion for offering this kind of service why couldnt GM do the same and double its market cap As for Ford it just announced days ago that it too is now starting to roll out embedded G LTE in their cars copying GM with a twoyear lag The first vehicle is the Ford Escape which goes into production in early Through October Ford sold Escapes in the US making it their bestselling vehicle in the US after the Fseries so they are not kidding around with a lowvolume model to start What advantages would a car company such as GM or Ford have in doing what Uber does Why not leave Uber alone especially if they are losing money The first reason GM and Ford would like to compete with Uber is that despite unproven financials at least the private market values this service In Teslas case there are probably a few billion dollars baked into its billion market cap based on the prospects of offering an Uberstyle service some time several years down the road A higher market cap means that you can raise money on more favorable terms perhaps replace debt with equity and offer better terms to the best human resources talent Thats why a market cap can at least in part be a selffulfilling prophecy As for the business operations themselves you could imagine that GM or Ford would have these advantages The benefit of an embedded app in the cars infotainment system thats more persistent and more precise than a separate smartphone app It would also be integrated with more of the vehicles functions unlike a separate smartphone app which would give GMFord more ability to optimize the service and vehicle efficiency Realtime knowledge of where all of the cars are as a service of this kind would require an optin enabling live location monitoring Ability to share in revenue and profits if any Sell more cars If the automaker doesnt control the service the drivers will use cars from all other competing brands This prevents that and is probably the second most important rationale for getting into the taxi service business after the market cap impact Generate volume and better terms for and through the automakers own financing arm The automaker could offer the driver a complete package of car ridesharing service and financing without any middleman whether in the form of Uber or some other aggregator For these reasons a GM or Ford might be able to generate a profit from an Uberstyle taxi service whereas Uber itself might not That also leads us into some other considerations as to the stock market reaction to Ford or GM announcing a direct Uber competitor On the plus side the thematic investor sentiment appears to be very positive and would likely favor such an initiative If the service was profitable and more profitable than the traditional car business it would help the stock not just in the short run but also in the long run On the negative side if this taxi business turns out to be unprofitable or even yielding a lower return on investment than the traditional car business it would reduce future earnings for GM or Ford and then most likely be bad for the stock longer term even if there would be an initial boost This latter sentiment has also been discussed by Bob Lutz who recently suggested that the car business would turn into a financial quagmire with Apple losing billion in the process He said that this would be bad for Apple shareholders One more reason why GM and Ford would now be more open to a new business model of this nature has to do with management The old managements who ran GM before the bankruptcy and Ford before Alan Mulally were much different than the new regimes You wouldnt necessarily notice it from the resumes The new CEOs from Ford and GM started working there in and respectively However if you have been paying any attention at all to what these two new CEOs have been doing since you would know that things are managed very differently now They may be Detroit lifers but there is new blood in the innovation genes For example Ford opened up a significant Silicon Valley RD office and introduced major initiatives in multimodal the new buzzword transportation technology last June Further enlightenment is probably also infused from the retired Ford CEOs subsequent board seat at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Another Ford alumnus John Krafcik recently joined <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>as head of its car business whose longterm intentions are largely unknown but Ford might be welladvised to fear the worst Think about it Fords most prominent alumni are at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>which has a billion market cap almost x Fords Tesla has a billion market cap with tiny revenue and no profits Uber has a valuation of billion to billion Apple has billion in cash on hand and will spend some of it developing a family of cars As the new Ford CEO this has to make you feel nervous and make you open to radical new ideas At GM many of the same motivations apply but in addition consider this For the first time ever CEO Mary Barra will keynote this years Consumer Electronics Show CES in early January We already know that the final production version of the mile range Chevrolet Bolt will be shown but could there be something else too Perhaps demoing a fullyfledged Uber competitor The final question you might ask is this Why GM and Ford instead of the other major automakers The answer really comes down to specific circumstances and personalities I already described above a plausible scenario of why GM and Ford may be highly motivated But what about the other automakers I dont see the other automakers having the vision product portfolio geographic fit or cultural openness right now to launch a multibillion dollar Uber competitor effort especially in the US FiatChrysler NYSE FCAU Really It has not even been able to launch Apple CarPlay or Android Auto Sergio Marchionne may be the brightest renaissance man in the auto industry but does anyone see him or the Agnelli ownership family going after Uber Volkswagen OTCQXVLKAY OTCQXVLKAF I actually see Audi VW and Porsche as some of the most progressive in the business However they are based in Europe and they have another diesel problem that is consuming managements attention right now In addition they are focused on their yes twenty new plugin electric cars that they are developing to hit the market over the next five years in their attempt to wrestle EV leadership away from Nissan DaimlerMercedes Already extremely profitable and with a focus on luxury cars and trucks probably not the highest motivation to compete with Uber in the US BMW OTCPKBAMXY Certainly one of the very most progressive automakers i carbon fiber and production process in the world It also offers a rental car business already However would it be willing to offer a taxi service on this kind of scale It just pulled its rental car business out of San Francisco Toyota NYSE TM The worlds largest and most profitable automaker it should be in a better position than anyone However it is also extremely conservative and has done nothing with Android Auto or Apple CarPlay yet Its cars dont have embedded G LTE I just dont see any signs that it will have the guts to launch a taxi service of this scale Perhaps this will change if GM andor Ford lead the way Nissan OTCPKNSANY A little bit like FiatChrysler in terms of a strong leader except the company is more successful financially It also is already the leader in electric cars to date so that is a bigger focus for Nissan nearterm Honda NYSE HMC Also has a new CEO and is moving quickly with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay However I dont see any signs yet that it has the guts to undertake an offering of this scale especially not in the US Again this could change if another company such as GM and Ford end up leading the way HyundaiKia One of the hungriest automakers and one of the most successful in recent years it could be open to new avenues of revenue and profit However HyundaiKia tends to also focus on proven profit models and simply perfecting them with best in class engineering and then offering it at the lowest price HyundaiKia would likely prefer other companies experiment with completely unproven business models before jumping in Among the largest automakers the leaves us with the two automakers who now have the greatest motivation and new fresh hungry and innovative management culture to compete with Uber GM and Ford Conventional wisdom to the extent that any such exists at this nascent stage might indicate that Ford is more likely than GM Ford has recently shown lots of experimentation in multimodal transportation technologies in a very open way including its new major RD center in Silicon Valley Those could lead to Ford becoming Ubers new competitor in However I think that in this case GM may be more likely to move even faster than Ford GM is showing new innovative marketing leading up to the launch of the upcoming Chevrolet Bolt and Mary Barra is giving the CES keynote speech This would build on GM having seeded its new car sales over the last year with G LTE standard in every car as the ultimate Trojan Horse to the tune of millions of cars at scale It would be a seminal moment for GM to trump them all Uber Tesla <span
