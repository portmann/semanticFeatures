class='textDiv'>Why I Wouldnt Own Microsoft Microsoft Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Theres a belief that MSFT is preparing to make additional job cuts Businesses that are performing well like AAPL FB and GOOG dont cut of their workforce MSFT has sold investors on the prospects of its cloud business That business cant support MSFTs current valuation When Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT CEO Satya Nadella starts talking about the need to innovate in new areas and having to make tough choices you can better believe that job cuts wont be far behind If in fact Microsoft goes this route and announces yet another round of major job cuts thatll be a good indication to walk away and not own stock in Microsoft That said if in fact Microsoft is a big thriving technology company then why cut jobs and why would shareholders buy into this plan Last year Microsoft reduced its workforce by cutting well over employees You know who didnt make any big job cuts and who hasnt Companies like Apple NASDAQ AAPL Facebook NASDAQ FB and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL those with legitimate growth Thats not to say that Facebook or Apple havent terminated an employee or two but none of these big tech companies have cut a double digit percentage of their employees With that said Microsoft has been a market favorite pretty much since Nadella took over the reigns Hes done a tremendous job at emphasizing Microsofts growth businesses while taking the focus off those in turmoil For example Microsofts commercial cloud revenue did grow during the companys last quarter a reflection of strong adoption with Office and Azure However if Synergy Research is correct in its analysis that Microsoft controls about of the cloud infrastructure services market then this hyper growth segment accounts for less than of total revenue Albeit Microsofts server business is strong and theres no way to criticize Microsoft for that Nevertheless Microsofts income statement exhibits strong growth including a reflection that revenue over the last four quarters has grown versus its last fiscal year However one thing to keep in mind is that this revenue growth is very much tied to the acquisition of Nokias handset business In fact if you remove the near billion that Microsoft created from phone hardware during its last quarter which was not present last year then Microsofts total revenue actually declined by million yearoveryear rather than increasing The reason is because of the numerous businesses where Microsoft remains in steep decline Specifically I am talking about its licensing business This includes Office programs and Windows software both for consumers and the enterprise In the consumer side of licensing revenue declined more than billion yearoveryear and it lost another million on the commercial side These are high margin businesses and for those wondering why Microsoft cut so many jobs last year and might very well cut more jobs after making tough choices the decline in this licensing business explains it licensing accounted for of Microsofts total revenue during its last quarter All things considered Microsofts ongoing losses in licensing are problematic and despite the companys move to the cloud it still relies heavily on the business for profits Therefore Microsoft needs something to counter the losses that licensing is likely to keep producing After all PC sales arent coming back anytime soon The problem is that the cloud Microsofts way to combat such loss in general is very crowded While it is expected to become a billion market according to Forrester Research up from less than billion in the question is whether Microsofts small market share in the cloud can one day carry its billion market capitalization Personally I dont think it can and also I think the job cuts are a good way of tempering Wall Streets expectations and preparing investors for a leaner more profitable Microsoft longterm While some investors are satisfied with this new look for Microsoft I prefer growth companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Apple among others In other words so long as Microsoft is cutting jobs and not hiring and seeing losses in licensing I wouldnt want anything to do with it Source Why I Wouldnt Own Microsoft Disclosure I amwe are long FB AAPL MoreI
