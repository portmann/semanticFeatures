Top Stocks Picks For Seeking Alpha Matt Bohlsen High Net Worth Financial Advising clicks World investment in renewables largely in solar and wind went up by to bn in and will likely beat this for and again in spurred on by the successful December Paris COP climate agreement History may show December as a tipping or inflexion point for the renewable energy sector The two largest global economies USA and China are now both fully committed to renewable energy With this in mind here are my top picks for Three of them are in the booming renewable energyelectric vehicle NYSE EV sectors First Solar NASDAQ FSLR Price The COP Paris Climate Change conference in December resulted in the first ever climate change agreement by all countries This will lead to a boom in private and public support particularly for solar and wind energy In December solar energy just received a big boost in the USA with a year extension of the Government subsidy and a phased down extension through to As Elon Musk eloquently says the planet is already solar powered we just need to harness a small fraction of that power See the full video here Or as solar analyst Travis Hoium states Enough solar energy hits the earth every hour to replace all other energy sources used in a year combined If we could capture of the solar energy that hits the world every day it could literally power every car and electrical device currently in existence Most experts conclude that solar and wind will be the major renewable energy sources See also Tony Sebas video here He estimates that US solar will go from homes in to million by a fold increase Read also my previous article on this topic on Seeking Alpha here Currently less than of US has solar compared to in Australia The potential for the US is for to grow to or from m today to m by a fold increase Given the huge drop in solar panel costs over the past decades solar is now often cheaper than grid powered electricity and much better for the environment The government is supporting solar and public opinion and awareness is changing rapidly In only about US homes had solar and the cost was around per watt By February the US is expected to reach the milestone of million homes with solar and prices are down to per watt More American homes than ever before are getting solar panels The amount of home solar roofs grew yearoveryear for the most recent quarter Solar farms are sprouting up all over the US So far this year of all the new electricity generating capacity came from solar First Solar is currently my top pick to play the solar sector despite the stock rallying in the past year The reasons are US number solar company by size and the leader in the commercial solar sector with a strong global business A strong track record and a very strong order book US and abroad for with over of next years available supply already contracted High efficiency and cost effective solar modules Very strong balance sheet with b in cash and marketable securities and growing should reach b by end only million in total debt and a low debt to equity ratio of and a strong current ratio of Low estimated PE at The PEG ratio looks high at however analysts were previously bearish on growth thinking the subsidies would be cut at the end of Current analyst buy ratings are at with a consensus target price of I expect analysts will soon upgrade this target in light of recent positive events NB For investors wanting more exposure to the US residential solar rather than commercial with FirstSolar leader with market share then I would suggest looking at SolarCity NASDAQ SCTY I did not choose it here as it is not currently profitable and therefore more risky Also if investors want the global leader then they should take a look at Trina Solar NYSE TSL Tesla NASDAQ TSLA Price I chose Tesla because will likely be a breakout year when they announce sales of the Model affordable car priced around less of incentives in the US Currently Tesla sells about vehicles a year I would not be surprised to see Model orders of to This would be the catalyst to send a huge charge to the stock price and assure the success of Tesla Electric vehicles will continue to boom for the following reasons COPs success will lead to further Government and private support for EVs As more and more people switch to solar roof top energy they will also switch to using electric vehicles powered essentially for free from their roof top solar Consumers will soon realize that EVs have amazing torque and acceleration and are fun to drive almost silent and pollution free Consumers will switch to EVs especially Tesla Model as they see lower prices long range and very low running and maintenance costs Consumers will at last be able to significantly help the environment Strong management led by Elon Musk and a strong technical team led by JB Straubel Also a sound business plan that is being steadily implemented Tesla is in the top EV companies for global sales and is number for sales of pure EVs globally Tesla is a trend brand name People will buy Tesla electric vehicles because they want the brand name recognition and status thereof Tesla EVs offer more range than other EV makers This is critical to buyers They also offer outstanding performance and soon price Tesla will soon have a completed gigafactory This will help bring down battery costs That will allow the Tesla Model to be price competitive with ICE cars as soon as or as early as if you include running and maintenance costs The gigafactory will lead to other huge revenue streams for Tesla That will include selling batteries to other EV makers but most importantly selling batteries to SolarCity and other solar consumers who want to become totally self sufficient and off grid for electricity These customers will effectively achieve zero ongoing electricity costs Tesla has steadily rising car sales and revenue The company is likely to become EPS positive profitable in or for the first time as expenses slow and sales rise further This will also be a huge catalyst for investors Teslas financials are naturally not great as profits have been is poured back into the company The PE estimate is around NB Byd Co OTCPKBYDDF is also a good EV company to consider if you prefer to invest in the Tesla of China Its currently priced at USD Xinjiang Goldwind Science Technology Co Ltd xhkg OTCXJNGF Price HKD USD China has embarked on the greatest push for renewable energy the world has ever seen China has announced that they plan to add a staggering KW of wind capacity from This will double their wind energy capacity to GW China is already the worlds largest producer of wind power of global wind power capacity and plans further massive increases Goldwind is the global number wind energy company with market share It is based in China but also has global operations It currently trades on a PE of just or PE of with an analyst buy rating and a one year target price of HKD representing upside The Walt Disney Company NYSE DIS Price The Walt Disney Company is primarily a global entertainment company They make money from their multimedia TV online etc content and networks movies theme parks and resorts and merchandise products My reasons for including Walt Disney are as follows A recent buy catalyst is the likely upside to earnings due to the likely record breaking box office dollars million opening record for their latest movie The Force Awakens It may well beat Avatars m record for the biggest US movie sales ever The global movie sales are forecast by Goldman Sachs to reach billion Add to this merchandising from Star Wars The Force awakens that may bring in around billion for Disney Further series and in the Star Wars trilogy will continue Disneys success Market leader for childrens entertainment in a world with more and more kids who love Disney every day The movie Frozen was an example of this The DisneyPixar tie up has been hugely successful Also the b purchase of Lucasfilms will now pay off with the upcoming success of the Star Wars trilogy New and expanded theme parks opening Disneyland Shanghai has been announced and is in planning to open in I expect this will be huge for Disney and will be Disneys sixth Disneyland theme park A acre Star Wars Land added to both Disneys existing Hollywood Studios and Disneyland Park Plus an acre Toy Story land will be added to Floridas Walt Disney World Well positioned in Sports TV with ESPN Subscribers and profits will recover over time from the recent fall back Sports will remain very popular If not it is immaterial to Disney long term As a provider of quality and in demand content Disney is in a strong position to set pricing and not have to sacrifice margins Disney currently
