Nokia Devices acquisition underscores Apples unique advantage in mobile devices Apples organic capability in hardwaresoftware integration has not been duplicated by either Microsoft or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>through their acquisitions Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT announcement that it is writing off the Nokia devices acquisition represents commendable candor on the part of CEO Nadella It also represents only the second time that a major competitor to Apple NASDAQ AAPL has thrown in the towel on emulating the Apple business model the first time being Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL sale of Motorola Vertical integration of hardware software and services in mobile devices has fueled unparalleled profitability for Apple Why has the formula not worked for Apples competitors The simple answer is that being an integrated mobile device maker isnt as easy as Apple makes it look but the simple answer while it may appeal to Apple fans kind of ducks the question <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Microsoft dont lack for brains ingenuity or competitive drive It would be hubris of the sort Apple is sometimes accused to assume that Apples competitors were simply incapable of reproducing Apples success I think its more likely they simply made bad decisions What was bad about the choices was not immediately obvious either to the companies involved or to the tech media Even now there isnt much in the way of intelligent post mortem for the Nokia and Motorola acquisitions Fans of the respective companies mostly want to put it behind them This is understandable but leaves the fundamental question unanswered Investors in technology really owe it to themselves to try to answer the question of why these acquisitions failed since this speaks to the competitive landscape for mobile devices going forward I dont claim to know the answer with certainty but Im curious about it The Motorola and Nokia deals have a lot in common and these are mostly negatives Both were fairly large acquisitions billion for Motorola billion for Nokia Both companies were losing money at the time of the acquisitions so the acquiring companies were burdened with not only integrating the business units but also turning around their financial performance Both companies maintained their own far flung manufacturing facilities having already offshored much of their manufacturing to places such as China and India For some reason the offshoring didnt help profitability The internationalization of manufacturing in these companies may have been a doubleedged sword it reduced labor costs but made the management of the companys internal supply chains more difficult Unlike Apple which relies mostly on contract manufacturing maintaining proprietary manufacturing facilities deprived these companies of a certain amount of flexibility and agility Both Nokia and Motorola seemed burdened with over capacity they were reluctant to pare down The acquiring companies were subsequently burdened with the task of shuttering this excess capacity But I dont think the manufacturing approach of the companies really gets to the heart of the problem of their profitability once acquired The problem for both Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>was that Motorola and Nokia smartphones had to be steeply discounted in order to sell Although initially billed as producing flagship premium smartphones the output of Motorola and Nokia invariably went into lower price tiers Both Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>accepted the resulting losses in order to move phones apparently assuming that eventually they would gain enough market share to become profitable The market share gains never occurred and neither did profitability This speaks to the basic competitiveness of the devices themselves Apple had worked to improve the appearance manufacturing quality and ease of use since the inception of iPhone in Arguably iPhone was pretty much alone in terms of design and execution by the time frame of the acquisitions Why that is has primarily to do with the difference in business model between Apple and its competitors Prior to acquisition both Motorola and Nokia functioned on a commodity business model that was similar to the PC model that had worked so well for the Windows ecosystem In this model the device operating systems came from another business under some form of license The creators of the operating systems Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>werent responsible for integrating the OS with hardware and basically couldnt do much more than create a one size fits all OS On the hardware side the commodity business model seemed to mandate making the devices as cheap as possible Build quality design and reliability all suffered as a result The commodity model invariably led to a race to the bottom that both Nokia and Motorola were losing The commodity PC model as applied to smartphones was successful in capturing market share but not profit as the profitability of Apple demonstrated from to the present One way to look at the Motorola and Nokia acquisitions was that they were fundamentally acknowledgments of the failure of the commodity model They were attempts to break down the barriers between OS provider and hardware manufacturer and bring about the greater level of hardwaresoftware integration that Apple exemplified Doing so would presumably make Motorola and Nokia devices more competitive Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>approached their respective acquisitions in two different but fairly normal ways <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>took a deliberately hands off approach maintaining the separate identity of Motorola as well as a separate organizational structure Microsoft attempted a fuller integration into the parent company Neither approach worked My conclusion as to why this is based on the observation that Apple had grown its hardwaresoftware integration expertise organically over decades from the early days of the Apple II and the Mac Apple had always viewed this as a positive discriminator and Apples flat organizational structure was geared to reducing barriers between hardware and operating system development The attempt to develop this capability by acquisition was probably doomed to failure by human nature The personnel of the acquired companies naturally retained a sense of separate identity as well as a tendency to pursue business as usual The organizational separation maintained by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and the builtin geographic separation of Nokia made vertical integration even more difficult Neither Microsoft nor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>really tried to achieve true integration Both Nokia and Motorola maintained separate management structures There seems not to have been a sense of urgency about this in either company Its as if they thought that mere ownership would be enough The write off of Nokia and the spinoff of Motorola leave significant unanswered questions about the mobile device strategies of Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>going forward The key takeaway for Apple investors is that Apple is endowed with a powerful advantage in smartphones that no other company has been able to duplicate Apples chief competitors in mobile device operating systems are Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>If theyve given up on emulating Apple who is left The obvious answer is Samsung OTCSSNLF and based on my last article I view Samsung as a diminishing threat I dont see any other company overcoming Apples advantage in the next five years Apples advantage is the key reason its doing so well in smartphones Smartphones are where Apples hardwaresoftware integration expertise has the most leverage Apple critics with some justification characterize Apple as one product company Having such a secure bastion is something that Apples competitors would envy Apple does need to demonstrate that it can continue to build on that secure bastion The Apple Watch is a case in point Some have raised doubts about the success of the Watch I believe the Watch is just getting started Well have a better idea of the success of the Watch when Apple reports earnings later this
