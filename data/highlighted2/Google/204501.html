class='textDiv'>Microsoft Power BI And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Analytics Microsoft Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Aug PM ET About Microsoft Corporation MSFT Includes CRM DATA GOOG GOOGL IBM QLIK WIX by Dallas Salazar MSFT has integrated Power BI with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Analytics I believe this a key and excellent strategic integration for the BI platform in that this will provide several meaningful benefits Power BI is becoming more and more important to Microsofts productivity suite growth Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT is out with a key integration update for Power BI that of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Analytics NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL With its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Analytics integration Microsoft is making an even further push to bring Power BI to the nondata scientist nonnumber crunching masses I think this is the single most key integration that Microsoft has brought to Power BI in terms of widespread mass market adoption since integrating the BI platform with MailChimp back in midJune But dont let the closeness of the integration dates discount the statement being made here or make the description of this appear hyperbolic This integration matters in a big way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Analytics as is aptly stated in the intro to the Power BI blog post noting the integration update is one of the most popular website performance tracking tools that companies use to measure progress toward online marketing goals It enables digital marketing teams to gain insights into their audiences navigation behavior and preferred ways of interacting with content Businesses can also discover which search terms led visitors to their site which pages and content attracted the most viewers and what percentage responded to a calltoaction <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Analytics is the baseline of BI for most of the nonI get paid to be a data scientist real world as well and in fact it isnt even BI Its just a data aggregation app that does the absolute minimum from a sorting and availability standpoint BUT <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Analytics is easy to use easy to understand and has a reputation that precedes it for both this matters greatly And there ladies and gentleman lies the large hurdle standing in front of Power BI Tableau Desktop NYSE DATA Qlik Sense NASDAQ QLIK Watson Analytics NYSE IBM Domo NYSE CRM Statistica privately held Dell etc <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Analytics is the peoples champion when it comes to analytics in general <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Analytics is also very importantly highly mobile and utilized on handsets at a high clip Finally what the popularity of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Analytics shows to the BI world is that consumers of all market levels desire BI they desire data they desire a deeper look inside whats happening in an effort to increase efficacy and to gain an edge Thats meaningful to the BI world in a big big way All of that matters to Microsoft and it all matters particularly to Power BI in how Microsoft plans to use the platform Power BI is right now Microsofts highest visibility entry deeper into the allimportant SMBenterprise arenas Microsoft needs to further its penetration into these arenas and to grow its footprint in both arenas to further the usage of its allimportant productivity suite A productivity suite that becoming more and more business focused Microsofts current management smartly I believe is betting big that a transition to that of a business first company will lead the company back to a leadership position and back to a position of global dominance at least for Business its my belief that Microsoft is currently conceding Consumer to Apple but thats subject matter for another article So as goes Power BI goes productivity suite growth You can see why Power BI integrations are worthy of follows For me what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Analytics being integrated does is it essentially acts as a massive top of funnel opener for Power BI Especially with how easy Microsoft made integrating the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Analytics data into the platform this is a key integration aspect that can easily be overlooked Power BI now caters to the massive Wordpress user base the single location sole proprietor website operator as well as the multidigital property manager running a consulting business on top of his Wix NASDAQ WIX development consulting firm Microsoft now casts a much wider capture net in that it can show these users and of course this list is in no way exhaustive how to better use and how to more easily and more aesthetically this matters to people view the data that theyre already viewing Microsoft can show these users via Power BI and Desktop that they might be missing obvious patterns and actionable ideas simply because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Analytics especially mobile doesnt align the data in ways that make the outliers obvious OR that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Analytics doesnt cross reference the data in enough ways to create an outlier from the data Microsoft can show these users that not only should they be viewing data from online sources via <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Analytics but that they should be taking any translated data from online sources that has made it to offline via spreadsheets ticketsales data etc and analyzing that as well If Power BI can help Microsoft do this last part the company and its value prop become sticky and thats the end goal here to become a sticky tool that can be monetized So Microsoft isnt just getting another data set with which to create BI from Its getting a massive free marketing source to draw from and one in which it knows users are already expressing a desire for its services Its getting a targeted marketing pool in which it knows users are accessing mobile via <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Analytics data and that if it can create a switch from would make its app mobile as well Mobile means higher percentage chances of actually getting used which increases retention Mobile also means a walking billboard that other potential users might see Mobile means that the boss might be marketed to indirectly by a rank and file worker who takes his BI with him everywhere he goes That might mean an enterprise or upmarket SMB launch But the big take away here is that Microsoft is doing the right things time and time again with Power BI to try to grow its usage as fast as possible and to try to grow usage with sticky intentions I think Power BI is the easiest BI to use and with its Summer Update to Desktop formerly Designer its becoming one of the most aesthetic That matters when youre viewing pages and pages of data ease of use and ease of recognition are major differentiators Ive opined in the past that I thought it would be a smart and cheap acquisition for Microsoft to pick up Datawatch NASDAQ DWCH the much devalued data visualization tech company in that Datawatch would further differentiate Power BIs visualization With Datawatch on board Microsoft could take a lead step in the current arms race for visualization differentiation In fact Dells Statistica recently deeply integrated with Datawatch and Tableau just executed its first acquisition in company history to pick up an Infographics company read visualization differentiation Both further evidence how visualization is becomingalready is a competitive advantage Right now even without Datawatchlike tech capacity I still consider Power BI Desktop to be the most aesthetic in the business postSummer Update Stay tuned for updates on where Datawatch moves heres to hoping its to Microsoft <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Analytics seems like a natural integration that could introduce the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Analytics of BI to the masses For Power BIs sake I sure hope this is
