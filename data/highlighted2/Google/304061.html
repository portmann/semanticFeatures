price and a rising gold to silver ratio for years This ratio has risen a lot during this time Are we ready to change our call yet Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Biotechs are getting crushed extending losses of the last few days as it appears the earnings beat for Facebook has sparked a great rotation from everything into the social network Yes we know Fwd PE is just x This has dragged FB back into the green for the year but TSLA and NFLX are getting hammered Thu RRRaskolnikov Thu Takeaction Just a quick heads up from somebody who keeps writing Mark Zuckerberg checks As an advertiser for over years in print radio and TV the decline of these medias is frighteningas well as the rise of social media advertising The Facebook advertising works just like TV did back in the s Remember when you just had or channels of TV Not many people had cable and the airwaves were not saturated with any other options like they are today Dish Internet TV Comcast list is endless which dilluted market Well Facebookeveryone in the Demographic that I need to see my ad uses Facebook Facebook allows you to create video as well as static ads for Desktops as well as Mobile THe targeting tools are absolutley incredible RememberI sell Car Audio so I target to males Only within a mile perimeter of my store I can choose Interests I can choose many many different targeting tools that work I myself absolutley HATE Facebook personally But this thing is a dream come true if used correctly If we are having a slow dayI can post a SUPER DEAL on Facebook and make our store packed within hours I know you guys hate Facebookso do I But until the next great thingthis is it AND IT IS CHEAP Right now I have an ad runnng on FB that I started Yesterday and so far people of my targeted market have seen my video And it has cost The response is instantand the dollars coming into our store are amazing How do I know it works Simple You test it with a trackable item Put an item for sale on FB that you dont advertise anywhere else Then require the FB people to ask for that discounted price when they come into our store I can create a line around our store in minutes with the right FB deal Sohope that helps understand why FB as of now is killing it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>ad words is a piece of Shit compared to FB Why The targeting tools That is why Have a great day bitchez NOTE Over the Holidays we spent around on FB The results were to X greater with FB then any other media that we used spending the same amounts Thu Bastiat Thu ThroxxOfVron Sasquatch drove the sled home and its a wonder we didnt wrap that bitch around Devils Tower That Kringle Siberian shroom rumor is fer realz boyz IF you get a chance to score some I highly recommend AWESOME Thu lakecity Thu MFL Thu tmmyBerg Which is why I really laughed out loud when I read the piece when it said the great rotation of of EVERYTHING into the social network Now that is funny It is a fucked up world we are watching implode Thu Takeaction Thu khnum Thu herkomilchen They produce information used for targeted marketing Thats a valuable product to marketers They facilitate interpersonal connections Thats a valuable service to consumers Assessing how monetizable these things are beyond the short term is another matter Not to mention creating some enduring defensible unique competitive advantage to keep people from fleeing FB to a competitor the same way they fled Myspace Thu lakecity Thu JuliaS To be fair most people these days dont produce anything The only difference is that theyre wasting fewer physical resources accomplishing the same series of tasks thanks to the internet If a cubicle dweller spends his day updating FB instead of playing solitaire like in the old days thats not really a problem Somebody has figured out how to make money and gradually bleed these nonproductive parasites dry and good riddance Send them ads and virtual macguffins anything theyd pay for Letem take selfies and brag to eachother Letem try keeping up with the Joneses avatars None of them will be missed and if a longnose Jew swindles them out of their fortunes well thats their own undoing Ignorance is a choice in the age of the internet Some think its a wonderful tool Some waste money and time Others are able to get more done with less and use the information to improve their physical surroundings The rest Letem do whatever they hell they want Its their lives Thu Winston Churchill Thu Bill of Rights Thu Early Retirement Regarding FB it is accounting fraud to not write down Whatsapp as it has been revealed subscription revenue was a lie as nobody would pay even Jew Zuckerberg looted the FB Treasury for billion to give to neighbor Jew and the shareholders have nothing to show for it Nineteen BILLION dollars The Crime of the Decade But the fawning Jewmedia remains silent Here is what Facebook had to say on User metricsThe methodologies used to measure user metrics may also be susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors Processes We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics and from time to time we may discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy including adjustments that may result in the recalculation of our historical metrics Daily active users Some of our metrics have also been affected by applications on certain mobile devices that automatically contact our servers for regular updates with no user action involved and this activity can cause our system to count the user associated with such a device as an active user on the day such contact occurs how much they know about their users While userprovided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users this age data is unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age Accordingly our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete their key metrics While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world duplicate accounts There may be individuals who maintain one or more Facebook accounts in violation of our terms of service We estimate for example that duplicate accounts an account that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account may have represented less than of our worldwide MAUs in false accounts We estimate usermisclassified and undesirable accounts may have represented less than of our worldwide MAUs the reliability of their estimations Our estimation of duplicate or false accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts We are continually seeking to improve our ability to identify duplicate or false accounts and estimate the total number of such accounts and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology At least investors cant say they havent been warned when this thing crashes to ZERO Provided that they read the fine print Thu Deflationist Thu Comte dherblay Knock off the comments about tech stock prices you look like a reactionary fool NFLX is not down but up In the face of all this volatility it would be wise if you intend on not being a chicken little to at lwast wait till noon b declaring yourself First the number of Monthly Active Users is inflated as you read the definition it means if you have an account even if you never use it then you will be counted You could also infer that if you even visit a Facebook page like visiting the local Taekwondo FB page or local city page then that counts I believe they lied when they said they redefined the MAUs since they made it narrower and yet MAU increased dramatically The US users is reported at million and you must be to have an account which means every single person in the US who is eligible has a FB account I dont This is true with Europe as well which means it is likely fudged on the rest Then like emails many people have multiple accounts so it is like the job numbers FB accounts yet one user Second many people if not most use an adblocker the source of their revenue Eventually advertisers will figure this out and furthermore as the global economy slows the advertising budget declines as well Therefore the longterm revenue stream will likely decline by the end of this year over time Anyway who cares it is antisocial and used for data mining there is good but the bad outweighs the good imo Thu sumerakhudwani My last month paycheck was for dollars All i did was simple online work from comfort at home for hoursday that I got from this agency I discovered over the internet and they paid me for it bucks every hour Thu besnook omg you cant make this shit up fuckerberg says they cant do anything about isis posts on fuckbook so everyone should like their posts wwwwaaaaaa Thu besnook while there are certainly many unicorn stocks in the biotech sector biotechs are the only sector that is virtually recession proof with a lot of real companies making real money ironically a market downturn may be be good for them as a crash would certainly make a lot of people sick Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned
