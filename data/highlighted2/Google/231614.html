Apple Tag Heuers just released Carrera Connected is not so much a smart watch as it is the Swiss watch industrys caricature of a smart watch The Connected is too bulky too limited and way too expensive compared to Apple NASDAQ AAPL Watch But it has the Tag Heuer brand slathered all over it If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery this is flattery of an entirely different and insincere form The Carrera Connected is the product of the partnership of Tag Heuer a division of luxury goods maker LVMH OTCPKLVMHF Intel NASDAQ INTC and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL That must have been an interesting collaboration Like oil and water the exclusive luxury goods pedigree of LVMH could not have mixed easily with the commodity device approach of Intel and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>The result is an undistinguished commodity Android Wear watch with just the thinnest sheen of Tag Heuer luxury floating on the surface The Connected is mm thick and lacks the heart rate sensor common in smart watches a commodity Android device masquerading as a luxury mechanical watch The above picture is from the AppleInsider forum The Connected represents a curious mixture of desperation to be like Apple mixed with contempt for Apple The Swiss watch industry is clearly desperate for an answer to Apple Watch but Tag Heuer doesnt have anything like the expertise to engineer both a smart watch operating system and the processor to go with it as Apple does So under the suasion of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Intel Tag fell back on the commodity device paradigm Apparently Tag Heuer thought that this would be good enough to compete with Apple This is where their fundamental contempt for Apple came into play This is a contempt I hear echoed in countless bearish analyses of Apple To the bears Apple is simply a brand and the secret of Apples success is simply brand marketing So in imitation of Apple Tag makes sure that its name or logo appears in four different places on the strap the crown the bezel and the LCD watch face itself The importance that Tag attached to this can be seen in an early concept drawing published by Bloomberg Perhaps the most insincere aspect of the Carrera Connected is the tradein deal being offered by Tag Heuer According to the Bloomberg report After two years a Connected Watch owner can bring the watch into a TAG Heuer retailer trade it in with an additional and receive a mechanical TAG Heuer watch in return Tag is saying to consumers that when this silly smart watch fad blows over in a couple of years Tag will graciously allow its customers to upgrade to a real watch for a modest additional sum If only all of Apples competitors were this stupid OK its not so much stupidity as ignorance an ignorance that Apples competitors often take years to overcome after Apple disrupts their market It took years for Apples competitors to wise up in the case of iPhone and apparently it will take years for Apple Watch as well From the beginning the Swiss watch industry has been in denial about Apple Watch Said JeanClaude Biver president of LVMH Nick Hayek the CEO of Swatch is reported to have said Isnt that what was said about iPhone As I recently recounted in Apple Watch Putting A Dent In The Swiss Watch Industry Apple Watch does seem to have put the Swiss into crisis mode Swatch also is developing its own smart watch which will have payment capability but no health monitoring due to Hayeks professed privacy concerns Market research firm Canalys recently announced its conclusion on November that Apple had shipped a total of million smart watches since launch Given that as of the September quarter cumulative watch sales could have been as high as million the Canalys number probably isnt too far off The important takeaway from the Canalys report was that Apples Watch volume was far greater than competing watches of comparable price Canalys stated that Apple was the only smart watch vendor to ship more than units in calendar Q My estimate for the quarter is in the range of million units Based on the decline in sales reported by the Swiss watch industry the sorry state of initial competing products such as the Carrera Connected its becoming clear that Apple has another successfully disruptive product on its hands As I stated in my previous article on Apple Watch the annual unit sales of electronic watches of million in represent a huge addressable market for smart watches I foresee all electronic watches becoming smart watches eventually But not all of these will be Apple Watches The majority will be lowcost plastic bands such as the Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Band Apple will naturally migrate to the premium end of the market with a market share of probably for annual unit sales at the high end of the range of about million units The biggest uncertainty is how long it takes to get to that point By the end of iPhones first year of availability Apple reported shipping a total of million units In comparison Apple Watch is off to a roaring start possibly surpassing that number in half a year Unfortunately the numbers are still too small to make an obvious change in revenue and earnings that will excite investors Here Apple investors are ill served by Apples policy of secrecy about Watch sales Apple should report unit sales and revenue for Watch as it does for other important Apple device categories If Apple did that I believe investors would get excited about the growing momentum of Watch This would be a positive catalyst to get the stock price moving up again Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US
