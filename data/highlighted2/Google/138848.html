of the largest companies in the world in a variety of fields Embracing the fastgrowing world of robotics Echo wants to manage your household and make your life easier Think Amazon NASDAQ AMZN is just the worlds largest online retailer Think again As technology advances so does Amazons reach in the sector to the point where it now competes with some of the largest companies in the world in a variety of fields For example In Amazon Web Services it has a mammoth cloudcomputing business that rivals the likes of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and com NYSE CRM It operates streaming video and audio businesses that compete with Netflix NASDAQ NFLX Hulu and Apples NASDAQ AAPL iTunes And increasingly Amazon is developing its own consumer products rather than just selling other retailers goods Like its latest product the Echo Embracing the fastgrowing world of robotics Echo wants to manage your household and make your life easier Heres how Echo is a personal robot that understands your voice and can control much of your household if you let it The idea of personal robots or home assistants has existed for a while now and several crowdfunding campaigns have attempted to make them a reality But they havent caught on yet for two main reasons First weve never seen a personal robot with the capabilities of Echo and that has the backing of a giant like Amazon And second few people have smart controllable devices in their homes just yet But Amazon has raised the stakes by making Echo tap into the companys other business lines a development that allows it to do things that other personal robots cant do It Hears You Theres an ongoing debate in the tech sector about whether voice or touch input will be the dominant means of instructing devices in the future Smartphones have services like Siri and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Now but most of the apps are touchdriven and texting has displaced a lot of communication that previously wouldve been by voice Echo takes things to a new level in the voice recognition area While Apples Siri and other voicecommanded assistants require you to speak clearly and directly into the microphone Echos innovative system is equipped with greatly enhanced hearing abilities Its designed to hear you from a distance and can detect your voice from across the room even when the device is playing music This is merely the entryway into the other things that Echo does but it makes a strong case that voice will be the main way we communicate at least with machines It Shops Echo connects to Amazon and knows everything youve ever bought And as the saying goes Knowledge is power So if youre an Amazon Prime member you can reorder anything simply by telling Echo Its this feature that allows Amazon to market Echo so aggressively the company hopes Echo will boost its other sales across the board Its Your Morning Planner If youre like most people in the morning you want to know the news sports weather and traffic information Well Echo is like a radio station where youre the station manager It can deliver all this information on demand And instead of waiting for a commercial or a song to finish before you find out you can simply ask Echo for a traffic report Its Your Personal Assistant If you find it tough to keep track of your daily todo list Echo works like an intelligent personal assistant It interfaces with your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Calendar keeps shopping lists and more For example you can recite a shopping list while standing in your kitchen and Echo will send the list to the associated smartphone app so you can read the list in the grocery store It Entertains You For music lovers Echo connects to your Amazon Prime music account and streaming music service Pandora NYSE P It can also receive streams from your smartphone so you can listen to any other service youre subscribed to And it uses Tunein and iHeartRadio to provide hundreds of radio stations from around the country If your tastes run more toward a literary bent Echo will read to you if you like It uses a highquality speaker system to read audiobooks to you Much like the shopping feature this allows Amazon to sell more products through the device Echo Knows All Like Siri or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Now Echo taps into the internet to give you answers to any burning questions you might have Having a sports argument with friends in your den Simply ask Echo and it will tell you who won the Super Bowl It was the New York Giants and Phil Simms was the MVP It Controls Your House Ive written before about the Internet of Things IoT and the universes tech companies are creating that will allow consumers to control the growing number of smart devices in their homes Echo can control three of those universes Wink WeMo and Philips and you can count on it adding more over time So you can simply tell Echo from across the room to dim the lights in the den make the master bedroom warmer water the lawn or even start a pot of coffee The Future Will Be Brought to You by Amazon Adoption of smart devices in the home has been slow Part of that is down to the expense For example a Cree watt equivalent light bulb sells for under while its smart cousin sells for nearly and requires a hub that costs another or so Not very smart But in time and as technology improves prices will come down And its the huge diversity of tasks that Echo can complete that makes it such a powerful product Few people will want all the services of course but just about everyone would benefit from at least some of them The fact that Echo speaks several languages so it can communicate with various devices means it could be the innovation that jumpstarts consumer adoption The other barrier to adoption of smart devices in the home is that most of them dont really save any effort After all why would you track down your smartphone and open an app to turn off a light when the switch is right there But with Echo you simply say what you want done and its done Echo is always on its always in the same place and it keeps track of which devices are in which universe This level of simplicity is key to driving adoption of smart devices and everyone who makes IoT devices for the home should applaud Amazon for introducing this product As a result the consumer end of the IoT may be controlled by Amazon Source Amazon Echo The Worlds Smartest Assistant We only use your contact details to
