Amazon parties on some large fund managers take their leave Reuters Related Stocks Markets Mutual Fund Center Earnings NEW YORK April By David Randall NEW YORK April Reuters For many years investors have been very tolerant as Amazoncom has sacrificed profits for rapid growth in sales and as it built new businesses That patience may finally be wearing thin The average largecap fund that holds Amazon has percent of its assets in the stock down percent from this time last year according to the latest available Lipper data There are funds with more than billion under management that have either reduced or sold all of their holdings in the Internet retailer over the past months They include such wellknown names as Fidelity Contrafund Washington Mutual Investors Fund Touchstone Sands Select Growth fund and the T Rowe Price Growth fund Some investors and analysts said that such a drop in fund ownership in a period when Amazons shares have been climbing suggests that largecap managers increasingly see the company as overvalued particularly at a time when it is spending tons of cash branching off into everything from selling its own smartphone to producing a Woody Allen TV series Reuters contacted the mutual fund managers who sold the greatest number of Amazon shares over the last year and none of them were willing to be quoted by name for this story One fund manager who sold out of his position in the company over the last six months said This has the potential to be a phenomenally profitable company but the shares are rallying on no new news in our opinion so we thought we might as well step to the side for a while This is not the first time that investors have bemoaned Amazons predilection for plowing money back into expanding the companys reach rather than realizing it as profit Jeff Bezos the chief executive of Amazon has long said that he is more interested in satisfying customers to earn their longterm business than in shortterm earnings measures and has never set a date by which the company expects to turn a consistent profit What strikes some investors as different this time around is the widening divergence between Amazons valuation and that of its large technology peers like Apple Inc and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Inc both of which are growing at similar rates Amazon trades at times its book value Apple by comparison trades at times its book value according to Thomson Reuters data <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>another company which has expanded beyond its core business into lines as far afield as driverless cars is valued at times its book value The others made big profits last year while Amazon was unprofitable While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has posted more than billion in profits before taxes between Amazon has netted just billion over the same time frame according to Thomson Reuters data The cashflow is a better gauge of how the company is doing according to Robert S Peck an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey who downgraded the company to neutral on March because he views the shares as overvalued He estimates its free cash flow from operations will climb to billion this fiscal year from billion in yet nearly all of that additional cash is being used to expand into businesses like grocery delivery or web services The companys shares have rallied nearly percent for the year to date after its fourth quarter results beat Wall Street estimates Sales continue to grow at an abovemarket pace with analysts expecting it to post percent revenue growth in the first quarter of when it reports results on Thursday Its share price is up approximately percent over the past five years nearly percentage points more than the benchmark Standard Poors indexs gain The stock trades at a pricetoearnings ratio of based on earnings estimates against for the SP according to StarMine data Overall Wall Street seems to be giving the company time Management has earned the benefit of the doubt said Mark Oelschlager coportfolio manager of the White Oak Select Growth fund who has owned the stock for the last years Their core retail business remains to us the jewel of the company and they have this huge platform that would be difficult for any competitor to replace Just of the analysts tracked by Reuters who cover the company have a sell rating on its shares while recommend that clients actively buy shares The market overall is in a bull market and its giving this company a pass said Chaim Siegel an analyst at Elazar Advisors who downgraded the company to the equivalent of sell on April While high now the companys shares will likely plunge at any sign that the markets overall direction is turning negative he added Bill Smead portfolio manager of the billion Smead Value fund said he does not own shares of Amazon despite his funds overall bet that consumer spending will climb Ironically that is because he expects the companys shares to tumble once it finally does show consistent profits a sign that its growth days are over As long as its a spectacular sales growth story theyre fine but as soon as they actually generate earnings their valuation is going to be based on that rather than investors trust in Amazons strategy he said Thats when your mortality kicks into gear Reporting by David Randall Editing by
