video content subscription business Verizon is already offering a skinny package which hasnt been very successful Why would Apple offer a similar package There has recently been added speculation about the idea of Apple NASDAQ AAPL creating a video content subscription network The two reports are Apple is going to either create its own content like Netflix NASDAQ NFLX or bring TV networks together to form a pared down version of cable The speculation is ramped up because of the expected release of the new Apple TV product this week Prior speculation with this category involved AAPL making an actual TV This proved to be false Even though this topic deals with hypothetical situations it is reasonable to have a plan as an investor on how you would react to possible eventsventures if they were to occur For example Twitter NYSE TWTR investors should have a plan on how they would react if the CEO uncertainty resolves itself While selling an entire stake in a company would be foolish because of one poor move altering the size of your position is a prudent reaction to take If Apple were to get into the TV business I would recommend shrinking your position in the stock The first possibility is Apple releases a permonth subscription package that offers a slimmed down version of what consumers already have with their cable bill This is a move in the right direction as consumers are less interested in paying for cable at all However this initiative is more reactionary than it is an answer to the desires of future consumers With improved competition from Internet video consumers are finally getting closer to the a la carte model they have craved for years but it is too little too late The problem with this model is it is too expensive and consumer tastes are changing away from this type of offering A Apple subscription package would have a tough time competing with Sling TV which is only Sling TV has about subscribers and it isnt the only skinny package available Verizon NYSE VZ also has a skinny package that it released this year It costs per month and has the option to add two channel packs for The skinny package only added subscribers last quarter with most not opting for to additional packages The number of subscribers was low partially because Verizon couldnt advertise its packages in New York and Philadelphia for days because of contract disputes Verizon is still in a legal battle with ESPN over whether it can add the network to any of its custom bundles In summary Verizon has tried this skinny model It has been responsible for one third of the growth in subscribers for last quarter likely because it was the cheapest option available Consumers mostly chose not to add any extra packages This shows they are extremely price sensitive It isnt an innovative concept to charge less for fewer services it simply is a slow response to a lack of consumer interest in the product being offered This provides us with evidence that this is a terrible business to be in Networks are earning less money as packages shrink If Apple were to get involved in this industry it would have to squeeze networks even further if it wanted to make a profit on these packages I dont see how Apple has any competitive advantage over Verizon considering AAPL has never been in this business There is a reason why Apple has yet to get involved It is an industry in decline that even the company cant save Some older investors may not realize that there is absolutely no interest from millennials in ever paying for these types of packages With the advancement of the Internet there has finally been competition against the cable networks Linear TV used to be the goto source for news reports Millennials are now getting their news from social media which is quicker Trust in media news outlets is very low so interest in paying for their services is nonexistent Sports packages must be broken up because it makes little sense for someone who doesnt watch sports to pay a bill in which the most expensive channel in the subscription is sports related ESPN The other option for Apple in a potential subscription package is to offer some original content to differentiate it from other services This is the Netflix model I dont believe this would work out for AAPL either The industry is already crowded with Hulu and HBO GO also offering competitive packages While Apple has a history in copying other firms products eg Apple Music copying Spotify I dont consider this initiative to be the same type of brand extension Producing video content would be like Apple producing music which doesnt make business sense Why should the company get into the difficult situation of trying to predict which TV shows and movies will do well The only competitive advantage I hear investors mention is that Apple has a lot of cash to make it a successful venture I dont see throwing money at a new business to be a sensible opportunity Investors are underestimating the difficulty level of recreating Netflixs success Just because it gained its subscribers quickly doesnt mean it was an easy feat to achieve Netflix has found the correct mix of using the data it collects on its users viewing habits and using the knowledge and experience Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos has to pick the shows subscribers have come to love This has led to the success of shows such as House of Cards and Orange is the New Black I wouldnt bet on Apple recreating this level of execution and then beating out Netflix which is one of the most beloved brands of millennials Apple has also built up a similarly high level of brand equity with millennials but it doesnt guarantee success Consumers wont get excited by a new show just because it was produced by Apple Just as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL joined Apple in competing in the music business it is also planning to make a big push into subscriptionbased video content My speculation is YouTube Gaming was launched because Twitch has been able to gain paying subscribers YouTube wants to enter this business to get consumers comfortable with paying for other popular channels The earnings per advertisement are declining and YouTube is reaching the limit on the amount of ads it can show in front of videos Therefore charging viewers to let them bypass preroll ads is a natural progression for the business model This adds to the competition Apple would face if it goes through with the expanded Apple TV venture Apple TV has been hyped by media outlets to drive readers to their sites I have no doubt that Apple has considered creating its own subscription content business but I doubt it will go through with the idea because it has a low likelihood of working out Verizon has had a tough time offering a skinny cable offering which makes it difficult to see Apple succeeding Investors underestimate the execution greatness of Netflix Apple will have a tough time competing with Netflix because of this If Apple does go through with this initiative I would advise investors to shrink their position in Apple stock Disclosure Iwe have
