time an SMBenterprise focused update I believe video calling to be one of the next big things in tech a grossly under served and under developed market that is low hanging fruit for capture Video calling could and should lead to substantial increases to retention cross selling and potentially new line sales of hardware for the spatial winners Microsoft of course having a oneplatform goal as its primary strategic initiative understands this and is making Skype a focus for the future In midAugust I put out a tech industry note observing that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL had spunoff Hangouts to a standalone appsite and what it meant for the broader <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>platform I also commented on what it meant for one of the next big things in tech which I firmly believe is the capture of the videocalling market Yes the now aged videocalling market I believe that the capture of videocalling market share will be one of the major drivers of tech valuation over the next several years especially for tech platforms that can cater to nonconsumer markets I tried to explain this in longform within my <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>note and I tried to do this by detailing how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is highly focused rightly so I believe on furthering its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>for Work efforts by building out its video calling capacity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>I think clearly evidenced by the Hangouts appsite spinoff shares my thinking in how important this service is going to be in the future Put simply I believe that Apple NASDAQ AAPL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>andor Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT by getting to this market first can substantially lock in a massive user base and my focus will be on nonconsumer in this note that can also drive cross platform selling efforts Apparently Microsoft also agrees with me in finally launching its Skype for Business app The videocalling vertical of the general productivity niche for SMBenterprises is currently a mess Solutions like Googles Hangouts Microsofts prior Skype consumer and Lync largely SMBenterprise Apples FaceTime Citrix Systems NASDAQ CTXS GoToMeeting etc all work but none are ideally set up for nonconsumer high traffic use All have obvious problems The problems by the way run the full spectrum of the imagination Im sure many are familiar with the list Hangouts my current favorite Lag time and call quality even on a good connection Skype Username required antiquated user interface not widely used enough FaceTime Branded device limitations and pretty much limited to consumer usecases GoToMeeting Really difficult to get nontech familiar read older users to access use become comfortable with the platform All of these issues can be overcome individually and most SMBsenterprises I know that deploy videocalling often enough are using multiple solutions as a comprehensive solution But is that really the way this service should exist Can you see why disrupting the status quo might offer significant customer acquisition among other benefits like cross selling As noted above apparently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Microsoft can Skype for Business will have all the features of the old platform but with the additions of enhanced security integrations with Microsofts Active Directory updated dashboard features a better user interface more easily accessible and highly visible features and productivity suite access read PowerPoint and other Office application usage this will be made available in an update to come soon Basically this puts Skype for Business onpar with Hangouts from a tech capacityuse case standpoint When Microsoft updates Skype for Business to be inclusive of the productivity suite access this will then become my goto video app Thats going to be a game changer for me This also is the next important evolution of video chat to pay very close attention to the buildout of cross sell capacity Again this is where the monetization is going to be had and this is where I believe all the valuation addition will be created The actual video calling app buildouts taking place arent going to do much for the companies building them out I mean monetizing the app via ad space I dont think so Where the money will be made for the companies investing in the platforms is in retaining users within a broader product ecosystem and in cross selling productivity within the app itself Microsoft is another great example Googles scenario has been detailed in my prior note Microsoft by integrating the rest of its productivity suite into its videocalling platform can then use the videocalling platform as a sales tool in several ways It can use Skype for Business because of the ability to present PowerPointsExcel filesPower BI dashboardsetc as a way to sell the other platforms integrated This I believe is going to be a huge driver for Microsoft in that it owns such a large part of the SMBenterprise productivity market from a software standpoint Its software being the base platform for how so many businesses do business that should open the door for same ecosystem usage of Skype for Business and vice versa This is as defensive from a retention and ecosystem capturetrap standpoint as its offensive in securing new market share Rather than using GoToMeeting and using the Show Your Screen which has plenty of issues and imperfections function users can simply use Skype for Business and have the presentations pushed to their screen in full viewing presumably with less lagdelayfriction within the app Microsoft can use Skype for Business as way to sell hardware for instance using its Surface Pro Surface Book or coming Surface Hub as fully comprehensive inclusive of videocalling capacity productivity devices that can help change business outcomes especially with the productivity suite and videocalling capacity being tailor built for the device This is a market that Apple is just now trying to enter with its newest iteration of the iPad which is being built with nonconsumer use cases in mind The list goes on and on The bottom line here and really its the bottom line for the videocalling market in general is that solving the videocalling problem would allow Microsoft to unlock user value in terms of its broader product and software ecosystem This of course is the stated primary strategic initiative at Microsoft currently hence why the company is focusing on videocalling capacity buildout Videocalling in my opinion is the way of the future and is low hanging fruit for the companies that want to make it a focus We now have the technological capacity telecom capacity included to make video calling the new primary option of communication when applicable for nonconsumer use and those that have the ancillary ecosystems to make it worth pursuing like Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Apple is coming along will benefit immensely from doing just that Stay tuned for updates in the videocalling solution and market capture race Good luck everybody We only use your contact details to reply to your request
