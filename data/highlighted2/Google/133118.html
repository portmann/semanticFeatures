Well that may or may not be true but of one thing I am certain Money buys you options When youre looking for stocks to buy one thing to examine is the socalled war chest See a company with a lot of cash on hand can expand its business without having to borrow funds or dilute shareholders by issuing new equity And importantly they can also reward their shareholders with big dividend hikes or share repurchases Or they can simply sit on the cash and save it for a rainy day And its every bit as true for companies as it is for regular people But in any event its just about impossible to have too much cash on the books Today were going to look at four stocks sitting on a mountain of cash Some have been better stewards of their cash hoards than others but all have the options at their disposal that comes with being cashrich Given the size of Apples NASDAQ AAPL cash stash I feel obligated to mention Apple first Apples cash balance is the stuff of legend If AAPLs cash and marketable securities were a standalone company they would be just bigger than Walt Disney NYSE DIS by market capitalization and just smaller than AnheuserBusch InBev NYSE BUD Even allowing for punishing tax rates on Apples cash held offshore Apple has enough cash in the bank to sustain its dividend at current levels for years without earning a single dime in additional profit As of this weeks earnings announcement Apple had just under billion in cash and securities Thats about of its gargantuan market cap And the most amazing thing is that Apples cash hoard has continued to expand even while a disproportionate share of it gets dedicated to dividends and share repurchases Over the past year Apple has raised its dividend by and shrunk its shares outstanding by about And I expect plenty more to come Apples earnings release had disappointing guidance for the remainder of the year and sent shares sharply lower Id view any weakness here as a buying opportunity While the iPhone upgrade cycle was a oneoff event not likely to be repeated Apple shares are very reasonably priced and its cash hoard gives it a wide margin of safety Next up is Apples rival in the smartphone wars searchengine giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOGL While Apples cash stash gets more attention for the sheer size of the dollars involved Googles is nothing to sneeze at As of June <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>had just shy of billion in cash and marketable securities which amounts to about of its market cap <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>could take a few lessons from Apple on how to reward its shareholders Despite being an established tech company and one of the largest in the world by market cap <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has yet to declare a dividend or commit to a share repurchase I want to like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>I really do But the company seems to have very little regard for its shareholders The founders always had something of a stranglehold on the company via their control of supervoting B shares But following Googles reorganization last year which resulted in the creation of nonvoting C shares NASDAQ GOOG only cemented their control further There is a reason why Carl Icahn has focused his activism on Apple and not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Not even a billionaire corporate raider like Icahn can cajole an unwilling <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>management to part with their cash There arent enough voting shares for him to buy to make a difference That said Googles cash gives it options <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is one of the few companies out there that could make a legitimate bid for Twitter NYSE TWTR for example And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>despite its lack of discipline remains one of the most profitable companies in the world It also has what Warren Buffett would call an unassailable moat in its control of Internet search Virtually every site in the world including this one are built with the express intent of being optimized for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>search Rounding out cashrich Big Tech companies we come to Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Like Apple Microsoft had an earnings announcement this week that was something of a disappointment While Microsoft actually beat expectations for the quarter the outlook ahead was nothing to write home about The Nokia acquisition has proven to be a disaster and resulted in a massive writeoff And Windows sales remain weak due to continued sluggishness in PC sales With the postXP upgrade cycle now complete and Windows not yet available for sale the next quarter probably wont be much to look forward to Yet the news is by no means all bad Microsofts transition to a cloudbased business services company is progressing fasterthanexpected and the company is showing an innovative streak under CEO Satya Nadella that it rarely showed under former CEO Steve Ballmer And Microsofts cash position at billion remains one of the largest in the world It also represents a stunning of Microsofts market cap Like Apple Microsoft has come to be very generous with its shareholders Microsoft has upped its dividend at a clip over the past five years in addition to shrinking its share count by about over the past three years Expect more to come Stepping away from the world of tech we get to Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway NYSE BRKA Buffett is unlikely to ever retire from the investment business Hes a lot more likely to die in the saddle with his boots on But Buffett has indicated that he would like to hunt one last large elephant of a company before checking out to that big stock exchange in the sky and accordingly Berkshire Hathaway has been stockpiling cash As of its most recent filings Berkshire had about billion in cash amounting to about of the companys market cap I have no special insight as to Mr Buffetts last big acquisition But I can tell you that he has become a little more flexible with how his companys cash is spent Buffett has never paid a dividend arguing rightly that it makes more sense to retain the cash for reinvestment Considering that Buffett arguably the worlds greatest investor is the one doing the investing I would have to agree That said Buffett did authorize a share repurchase plan in something I never thought I would see It makes one wonder Might a dividend really be a possibility This article first appeared on InvestorPlace Disclaimer This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered specific investment advice or as a
