which is based on the life of Dr Dre Many had assumed the series was part of Apples attempt to join the streaming TV race but now it seems the series was designed to boost subscriptions to Apple Music Apple had been in talks to create its own skinny bundle but those discussions broke off after the company refused demands of the big networks Last year Dish NASDAQ DISH and Sony NYSE SNE were among the big media companies to unveil skinny streaming packages of cable channels These new bundles were a cordcutters dream as it allowed their favorite channels to stream online and at a fraction of the cost of cable Throughout everything though the elephant in the room was always Apple NASDAQ AAPL and the question of when it would make its move into the space Now analysts are asking a different question Last week respected industry trade The Hollywood Reporter revealed Apple was shooting Vital Signs its first scripted series Loosely based on the life of hip hop mogul Dr Dre the drama was assumed to be Apples entry into the marketplace Signs is a drama consisting of six halfhour long episodes each one supposedly tied to an emotion experienced by the lead character Although in the days since it has been speculated this series actually isnt tied to Apples advancement into the streaming TV market but as a continuation of its Apple Music rollout It is fitting Apple would use Dr Dre to launch its new TV division as the musician is also coowner of Beats Studio which of course was previously acquired by Apple Keep in mind Apple being Apple has not confirmed any details All of this is speculation but the more you think about it the more it makes sense Apple is still trying to build its streaming music service and this is a big way to draw in new subscribers Eleven million users strong Apple Music is a rising force but it does face heavy competition from Spotify Private MUSIC Pandora NYSE P and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL YouTube Anything Apple Music can do to gain an advantage will be helpful Its already teamed with Taylor Swift to release her documentary and is believed to have more deals in the pipeline Granted its rivals have a lot in play also but Vital Signs would be the most high profile and traditional in terms of scripted fare Now thats not to say Apple isnt going to make the leap to streaming TV eventually Though after seeing talks with the major networks stall out this was the next logical step Since it will air on Apple Music that means the ideal way to view it is through Apple TV which requires another consumer purchase its a cycle Apple users are quite familiar If this is the case and Vital Signs isnt the big entry play we all thought it would be Apple is playing this very smart The streaming field is crowded and the bundle field has a fair share of suitors as well so to wait until the company feels the time is right to enter is the best play One scenario Apple may be looking at is to merge the two types and give uses a place that has all the major channels plus a streaming network of sorts for its own programming Currently neither Dishs Sling or Sonys Vue have all of the major broadcasters on board Dish has ABC and its family of networks while Sony has the rest with some crossover from the cable channels between the pair That type of division is whats keeping certain groups of people from ditching cable specifically sports fans If you subscribe to Sling you get ESPN but if you choose Vue through PlayStations network you get NBC and Foxs sports networks Either way if youre a sports fan by choosing one over the other youre missing something big Yes you can subscribe to both but that gets more costly which defeats the purpose It also requires extra unneeded steps If Apple could marry all the key channels into one service it would be a gamechanger However there are two issues at play namely how much it needs to pay for the rights and if they can convince the networks to unbundle their channels One reported plan was for the service to cost a month and include only a dozen or so of the major top tier networks but to get ABC CBS NYSE CBS NBC and Fox NASDAQ FOX NASDAQ FOXA they would be forced into take all of their cable networks as well which is a sticking point All of a sudden a top becomes a top For Sling and Vue having those extra channels fills a need but Apple would want to stand out and be different and more streamlined We also know that Apple isnt going to do anything halfway and when its team saw negotiations werent going the way they wanted they walked away Now if Vital Signs takes off and provides a huge spike in subscriptions it could embolden them to restart talks or create their own full scale TV service Thats a while down the road though at least we think it is as with Apple they play by their own rules and thats never going to change Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
