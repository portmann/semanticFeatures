class='textDiv'>The Wonderful Wizard Of Omaha Seeking Alpha Negative Interest Rates are the next Big Short The SP is near a top get ready to play defense Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain The Wizard of Oz in The Wizard of Oz So that was neat Ive always wondered what the hype is all about regarding the annual pilgrimage to Omaha for Berkshire Hathaways annual meeting Since traveling to Omaha Nebraska is not on my bucket list and I can think of better things to do with half a week than wandering around a convention hall looking at booths from companies that have actual stores near home Ive never gone So it was great that this year the meeting was webcast for all to see because now I realize that I wasnt really missing anything Were there some interesting moments Most definitely I spent a large portion of my Saturday glued to the webcast Buffett has created a lot of wealth for a lot of people and built a very stable company There are worse ways to spend a Saturday But I was left wondering what all the hype is about simply because for of the people in attendance who spent decent money on flights hotels restaurants etc they have zero chance of replicating even poorly what he has done Especially since the only real investment advice he seemed to dispense was that most investors should simply put their money in an SP index fund and go home And hes probably right Most people dont have the time or the ability or the desire to spend most of their waking hours investigating potential investments and then waiting patiently for their thesis to come true or not But they flock there anyway to sit in an arena and listen to him talk for a few hours when the real lessons they want to learn are available in his annual letters books that have been written about him and myriad other sources that are basically free Who says people are rational The most interesting part was when he was asked why Berkshire had changed from investing in companies with high returns on capital and noorlow capital requirements to those that require massive amounts of capital like railroads and pipelines His answer because Berkshire is too big now to invest in those great lowcapital businesses even though they are superior to what he is buying recently and are what created the track record of which so many are envious My takeaway smaller is better in asset management because it opens up many more opportunities that are unavailable to investors that grow too large like Berkshire Hathaway Buffett hesitated before he answered because the answer revealed an uncomfortable truth that Berkshire is no longer able to maximize returns for its shareholders but Buffett is unwilling to return the capital to them to go and find other investments Ego Probably When everyone who you come in contact with is always telling you how great an investor you are it makes it hard to think that someone else could do a better job than you with shareholder money But when the alternative is to keep buying large slow growing capital intensive and economically cyclical businesses maybe its time to pull back the curtain on the Wizard Coroner singing As Coroner I must aver I thoroughly examined her and shes not only merely dead shes really most sincerely dead We are about twothirds of the way through the first quarters earnings season and so far the results have been decidedly mixed Last years darlings the cohort known as FANG Facebook Amazon Netflix and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>have had a poor start to the year although this week both Facebook and Amazon reported better than expected numbers sending their stocks soaring Netflix was fairly bad and the stock got hit for over as a result while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>was fine note my fund is long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>But the stock of the week was clearly Apple which fell nearly after reporting really lackluster earnings on falling iPhone sales We wrote about the issues facing Apple NASDAQ AAPL back in November detailing how its products were becoming hard to distinguish from its competitors and how its future reminded us of the oncegreat company Sony another consumer electronics manufacturer that was known for great design but missed a few product cycles and fell into a long slow decline It appears to us that the time when Apple is a mustown stock is really most sincerely dead Why Because Apple has a weakness that most investors arent talking about but which I believe has a significant nonzero chance of happening Whats the weakness Its substantial sales in China combined with its unyielding stance on encryption during its clash with the FBI over unlocking the San Bernadino bombers iPhone While CEO Tim Cooks unyielding position of putting Apples customers privacy ahead of the governments interest in protecting its citizens from terrorism may fly sorta in the US it definitely wont in China And no one is talking about that So what happens to Tim Cooks moral outrage when China demands that Apple make its phones accessible to the Chinese government Does he maintain his high ground Or does he capitulate because he wants the business And what happens to Apples stock when this debate happens To me this is not a question of if but when Dont think its gonna happen From the New York Times Last week the companys iBooks Store and iTunes Movies services were shut down by a Chinese regulator just six months after they started operating The rare aboutface by China suggests that Apple could face further pressure as the Chinese government increases its scrutiny of American companies operations within its borders Dont say you havent been warned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>already doesnt operate in China Neither does Facebook or a host of other companies But Apple gets about a third of its iPhone sales from China So being banned there or even just getting into a nowin fight with the Chinese government will leave a mark And by the way growth in the overall market for smart phones in China is expected to slow to under this year down from in So even if they dont end up in a battle over privacy they dont have the big tailwind from market expansion that they used to have Maybe thats what Icahn was referring to when he said he sold his whole Apple stake because he was worried about China Those still holding should be too Scarecrow I havent got a brain only straw Dorothy How can you talk if you havent got a brain I was fortunate enough to attend a long dinner with Vincent Daniel of The Big Short fame this past week Besides reminiscing about our days as research analysts at Keefe Bruyette Woods where we both used to work although at different times we spent some time discussing our favorite long and short ideas for our respective funds and the craziness that is happening in central bank board rooms around the world The worlds central bankers like to do a lot of talking but they dont seem to have a lot of brains I suppose this is what happens when you spend your whole career talking only to other career economists and bureaucrats instead of actually doing something like holding a real job or building a business Why our worlds policy makers are uniformly uninformed individuals who all believe more in their models than in rational thinking and problem solving is beyond dumb but thats the hand weve been dealt You cant invest based on what should be only on what is And right now the what is is crazy We both agreed that while the insanity that is negative interest rate policies NIRP will end badly the problem is that neither of us know when or how it will happen My fear is that NIRP in say Japan will cause depositors to flee if they are charged for holding money at the bank If they do and the outflow reaches a tipping point it could easily cause a liquidity crisis Or will NIRP cause dislocations in overnight lending markets in Europe In money market funds Will it create distortions in sovereign bond markets that violently unwind There are many potential outcomes I just cant think of one that ends well for someone holding a negative yielding bond so the trade is probably to short negative yielding bonds in relatively strong economies if you can since you are guaranteed a small profit if you can hold the short to maturity and a potentially large one if rates suddenly spike higher on a flight from safety Id also continue to avoid equities in general where the situation is so dire that central bankers feel the need to engage in negative rates because when the big unwind happens stocks are not going to be where you want to be unless youre short You cant trade on what should be you can only trade on what is Playing chicken with authoritarian governments usually ends badly for the chicken Stocks continued to follow our playbook the past weeks in the US as smaller stocks performed better than large cap but now were at the high end of the trading range while earnings are coming in soso at best Nothing has really changed Rightsize positions and get ready to play a little defense Macro issues have been quiet too quiet My sense is that the big move since February is rolling over As Art Cashin would say be wary and very very nimble SPY Trading Levels The market is still coloring within the lines The SPY stopped right at the resistance we mentioned last time as being a tough level to get through Moving a lot higher will be hard and I think were headed lower nearterm but if we do break expect a sharp spike as shorts rush to cover and cautious investors play catchup Support a little at and then Resistance A lot right here at then not much I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this
