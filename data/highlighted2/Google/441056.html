actually has a better product WeChat ARPU also has demonstrated enormous upside Facebooks NASDAQ FB most recent quarterly performance has been impressive Quarterly revenues came in at billion with billion net income More interesting and valuable than the financial results though are Facebooks usage stats Monthly active users MAU grew and reached billion while Daily Active Users DAU reached billion with a DAUMAU ratio at an enviable Note that the DAUMAU ratio is one of the most important metrics for product managers to track as its an indication of how sticky an app is Here are some DAUMAU benchmarks as reference Also Facebooks ARPU Average Revenue Per User is worth a closer look Note that revenue is almost entirely from advertising Clearly and not surprisingly Facebooks most valuable customers are in North America where incomes and advertising rates are highest AsiaPacific ARPU lags far behind As impressive as Facebooks performance has been Tencents OTCPKTCEHY WeChat actually has a brighter future and I argue this is largely due to the more compelling product vision and execution ability of Allen Zhang who launched WeChat in and currently heads Tencents recently formed WeChat Group As seen in the chart below WeChat has massive market share in China and still grew MAU at in the most recent quarter For those not yet familiar with WeChat or weixin in Chinese it started as Chinas WhatsApp a social messaging app However since its launch in WeChat has steadily added features and functionality to become the remote control for the lives of hundreds of millions of Chinese For example a WeChat user in China can and does book a car ride like Uber Private UBER transfer money like PayPal NASDAQ PYPL book plane or train tickets like Expedia NASDAQ EXPE buy goods online like Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and even make investments like WealthFront but all without ever having to leave the WeChat app Users can also use WeChat for booking doctor appointments paying electricity fees or traffic fines As of December WeChat has over a billion created accounts million monthly active users with million outside of China Much more impressively WeChats DAU is approximately million giving it a jawdropping DAUMAU ratio As evidenced by its DAUMAU ratio WeChat actually has a much stickier app that it is operating at scale with hundreds of millions of users This is because it is the first app to truly integrate onlineoffline capabilities of payment ecommerce and a host of other functions that for many tech companies in the West including Facebook are still a somewhat faroff vision One of the keys to WeChats success is Zhangs ability to develop viral features to drive adoption and usage A wellknown example of this was the introduction of virtual red envelopes in Chinese New Year to leverage the tradition of offering monetary gifts during the biggest holiday in China The introduction of this feature resulted in more than million users linking their debit cards to their WeChat account and billion virtual red envelopes being delivered this past Chinese New Year With respect to ARPU WeChat is estimated to be at least Furthermore analysts at Barclays estimate that WeChat is valued at about billion as a standalone business or about per user versus the billion and per user that Facebook paid for WhatsApp However because of WeChats doitall product philosophy its ARPU still has tremendous upside By way of reference Amazons ARPU is estimated to be while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL is Its also noteworthy that WeChat has not seriously begun selling advertising yet and its current ARPU is derived from games and other valueadded services stickers etc Despite a still relatively crude advertising platform WeChat is able to charge CPMs between to for Moments advertising with a minimum buy of about with brands such as CocaCola NYSE KO and MercedesBenz on board Zhangs product strategy already has demonstrated WeChats ability to achieve an almost unimaginable level of user engagement The revenue potential is also enormous as WeChats ARPU of over is not inconceivable However WeChat faces two key challenges to becoming the global leader in a mobile internet world How much profit can it wring per user and can its doitall product philosophy be successfully launched in markets outside of China Profitability seems to be the easier problem to solve and WeChat is on the way to doing so eg fees for certain money transfers more sophisticated ad buying platform etc The more interesting problem it faces is global expansion If it is able to replicate its ecosystem outside of China WeChat could easily be in the drivers seat with Allen Zhang crowned as king of the mobile
