SaaSPaaS revenue and a drop in hardware revenue constant currency revenue growth is expected in FQ with only a minimal forex hit On the other hand the mix shift towards cloud revenue is weighing on EPS SaasPaaS gross margin was exiting FY up from a quarter earlier but still easily below what Oracle normally gets for onpremise license and updatesupport sales The company promises SaaSPaaS GM will be much higher in a year and eventually reach Meanwhile strong FY bookings acquisitions and healthy uptake for a selfserve option for subscribing to cloud apps are expected to help drive SaaSPaaS growth in FY Not surprisingly coCEO Safra Catz suggested Oracle is open to more MA Though hardly a growth stock Oracle is doing enough right now to offset onpremise revenue declines with a cloud ramp

report appears to confirm speculation stemming from the near premium LinkedIn wound up getting that Microsoft had a rival suitor for LinkedIn NYSE LNKD With LinkedIns B sale price nearly equal to half of Salesforces NYSE CRM current B market cap a SalesforceLinkedIn deal wouldve required a large stock component By contrast the Microsoft deal is allcash Salesforce which Microsoft reportedly tried to

wafer fabs Chip equipment trade group SEMI expects of the chip wafer manufacturing plants to start construction in and to be based in China as Beijing backs an aggressive push aided by MA to turn the Middle Kingdom into a semiconductor powerhouse and lower the dependence of local manufacturers on foreign chip suppliers This effort bodes well for chip equipment makers who have been hurt by uneven capex from traditional Big clients Intel NASDAQ INTC TSMC NYSE TSM and Samsung Intel in particular has been spending cautiously as it deals with weak PC sales and extends the amount of time it takes

of cities globally CEO Travis Kalanick claims Uber Private UBER is profitable in North America EMEA and Australia not counting interest or tax expenses The remarks come with Uber still raising funds at a breakneck pace in large part to finance a noholdsbarred battle with Chinese ridesharing leader Didi Chuxing Private DIDI which just raised B itself They also come with Uber hungry to justify the

TWTR has been facing ad execution issues for a while the company remains willing to think outside the box as it rolls out one ad product after another Its latest offering lets marketers target users who have written or engaged with tweets featuring emojis one example given is a pizza shop targeting a user who tweeted a pizza emoji The option follows the launch of an ad format that can with a users consent leverage user tweets It has a bit in common with efforts by Facebook advertisers to use Facebooks new Reactions buttonsemojis to get a better read on how users feel about ads and other content and to deliver ads accordingly But in many cases Twitters solution will probably be less precise in gauging sentiment After all just because a user tweeted an emoji of a pizza a cake or a car doesnt mean heshe is looking to buy one IDC Wearables shipments will rise this year to M Thats decent growth but still a big slowdown from the estimated growth wearables shipments recorded in IDC also forecasts a shipment CAGR from to but a longterm forecast like that needs to be taken with a spoonful of salt Though now sizable the wearables market isnt quite living up to hopes it would be the next massive consumer electronics growth opportunity as smartphone sales growth falls to the single digits and tablet sales keep declining IDCs smartphone shipment estimate B is still over x its wearables shipment estimate Within the wearables market smartwatch sales are expected to rise to M with Apple still leading the way Fitness band sales a field where Fitbit NYSE FIT leads and Xiaomi Private XI
