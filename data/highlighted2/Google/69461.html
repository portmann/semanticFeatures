coming and the Powers That Be know it This is why theyre preparing by buying up Gold bullion Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Submitted by Veronique De Rugy via The National Review When has crony capitalism really gotten out of control How about when a major US corporation a huge defense contractor no less is publicly threatening government officials to leave the country if the federal government doesnt continue to boost their profits through government handouts Boeing is stepping up pressure on opponents of the US ExportImport Bank with threats to shift manufacturing abroad if the agency that finances purchases by foreign customers is killed off next month The threats come as a new push is being made in Congress to find ways of wresting reauthorisation of the bank from a committee controlled by one of the agencys fiercest opponents Scott Scherer Boeings head of regulatory strategy at Boeing Capital said the aerospace and defense group would not sit idly by if the ExIm Banks mandate was not renewed by the end of June Boeing is not going to let itself be hurt by the lack of an ExIm Bank he said in an interview with the Financial Times If it means sourcing to other countries who will support us we may have to look at that Other countries have more aggressive export policies We will find an alternative First let me state the obvious This basically sounds like blackmail to me and I dont think lawmakers should look at this kind of behavior favorably Second its time for Boeing executives to understand that its not the role of the federal government to guarantee that they can sell as many planes as possible theyve benefited from the USs relatively freemarket system they should have to live with it And finally I dont think Boeings threat is very credible Will Boeing really pick up its factories and move abroad if ExIm isnt reauthorized Is the possibility other governments might subsidize it really worth the transition costs and the risks of losing billions in defense contracts Thankfully Jeb Hensarling chairman of the House committee with jurisdiction over ExIm called Boeings bluff The Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee rejected reports that Boeing Co or other companies might move production overseas if Congress doesnt reauthorize the US ExportImport bank I doubt I believe it Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas said at a Washington press conference Tuesday about whether failing to extend the banks charter would drive major corporations out of the US I think its frankly a bit of bluster Boeing based in Chicago might move some manufacturing overseas if Congress doesnt extend the banks charter beyond June the Financial Times reported May It cited an interview with Scott Scherer head of regulatory strategy at Boeing Capital Hensarling said he and others who oppose reauthorizing the ExportImport Bank are trying to lead the party in a new direction that will give priority to free enterprise over individual business interests Letting the ExIm Banks charter expire will go a long way to show that Republicans understand the difference between being probusiness and being promarket even if Boeing doesnt Wed TeamDepends Wed AlaricBalth The largest beneficiary of ExIm subsidies is airline giant Boeing which has donated between million and million to the Clinton Foundation Another top beneficiary General Electric has given between and million Boeing can leave if it wants to as long as they take the Clintons with them Hillary recently went out of her way to endorse the ExportImport Bank a littleknown government agency that guarantees loans so that American corporations can sell products overseas While secretary of state she shilled for the ExIm Bank In she appeared in Moscow with officials of the Russian airline Rosavia to tout its pursuit of ExIm funding This is how she put it This is a shameless pitch for Rosavia Ive said what you wanted me to say Sergey to buy Boeing aircraft Right The ExIm Bank would welcome an application for financing from Rosavia to support its purchase of Boeing aircraft and I hope that on a future visit Ill see lot of new RosaviaBoeing planes when I land in Moscow Whoring for the ExIm Bank in Russia on Boeings behalf after Boeing donated millions to the Clinton Foundation The sleeze just oozes out of her every orifice I need to take a shower after just thinking about how sordid this is Wed Stackers I dont have a problem with ExIm bank as longs the loans are repaid Does anyone know what the NonPerforming Loan ratio is for the ExIm bank Make sure that the management gets their asses out of America as well No hangin around Chicago pimpin for bucks for blow Management ranks right up there with the politicians for their ability to screw American workers while making puffy nests for themselves Thu prmths Stackers Thanks for the link Page shows defaults at million for FY however it appears that the overall performance hasnt been that bad the real problem is the continued exposure of the taxpayer to risk Thu zhandax Look in Notes to the Financial Statements page Outstanding Defaulted Loans billion FY I think that mm is how much their lawyers spent on hookers and blow to not worry about it Thu lunaticfringe We can only pray that there is a special hell for the Clintons Perhaps when the Obamas arrive the four of them can sit down and play Bridge whilst taking turns cheating one another Thu lunaticfringe We can only pray that there is a special hell for the Clintons Perhaps when the Obamas arrive the four of them can sit down and play Bridge whilst taking turns cheating one another Wed TeamDepends Youre so right In Amsterdam you can board a plane with no identification whatsoever with a bomb in your boxers Wed JuliaS UK is similar or worse from personal experience In other countries it depends Went through the Czech republic during a terrorist scare The Prague airport that was typically quiet had MP equipped guards with german shepherds Thu cheech_wizard Back many years ago when being flown back to the states from the airport in Rome all indeed looked very peaceful in the terminal That was until you cast an eye upwards to notice the Italian military walking on catwalks carrying what appeared to be uzis Now that Space X has been approved to boost all but the largest DoD NRO payloads into orbit United Launch Alliance a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin suddently has serious competition The loss of revenue they are expected to incur over the next few years could be significant Next there is SIGNIFICANT pushback in Congress of ULAs reliance on the Russian RD engines for launch operations Each engine cost a cool million Considering the ongoing tensions with Russia this leaves ULA DoD NRO NASA in a bit of a pickle Further as the global economy continues to slide this all but assures that there will be fewer orders for commercial aircraft Wed Paveway IV Is that a rhetorical question or a joke Boeing and Israel go way back Wichita and Long Beach manufacturing jobs already went to Israel and were then outsourced by them to some other shithole Soon St Louis manufacturing jobs will be exported and next Chicago HQ jobs Mention this at Boeing and your career is instantly over Boeing probably already has the land picked out in Haifa ExIm and tax breaks are noise Boeing is headed to taxfree for them and armsexport psychopaths paradise Israel There will be laws passed in congress that force us to buy their Israelimanufactured crap for the next thousand years Israel is just as interested if not more in all the defense electronics crap as they are the aircraft manufacturing Theyll always keep some token manufacturing here mostly the big lines that are too hardto expensive to move But anything that they can unbolt and put in a crate to Haifa or some other thirdworld shithole subcontractor is for all practical purposes gone This is just the theatre for the HQ move You didnt think those dualcitizens in congress were there just to give away money and arms to Israel did you They want the whole industry They want to make sure the major arms manufacturers look nowhere else BESIDES Israel for their new tax avoidance homes Congress HAS to preserve ExIm for their businessprofits wherever they skulk off too Congresses job is to preserve ExIm WHILE Boeing is secretly bailing out of the US piecebypiece Congress is also expected to fight anything like the BoycottDivestSanction Israel movements to make sure the new Boeing isnt hurt financially by their association with Israel Wed rubiconsolutions Wed Mr Knockout I am making a good salary from home

Everyone Here is I started wwwjobsreviewcom Wed PhoQ Wed NoWayJose Wed WhackoWarner Wed WhackoWarner Wed Oldwood I can sympathize with the feeling that they are bullying or trying to pressure to get their way but to counter your argument Im sure you are aware that many many businesses have already left Our government has created a corrupt and complex set of rules that business has tried to rationalize through their planning and capital expenditures so I dont think it is unreasonable that they will resist change The system is corrupt and if anyone from Boeing on down wants to financially succeed they MUST participate in the CORRUPTION as we ALL are Wed i_call_you_my_base In a free market system without a baseline the most corrupt entitity sets the bar The upside is reinvested in defeating all others Wed Oldwood It seems that people fear the free market far more than corruption On a level playing field many feel pretty vulnerable Everyone seeks advantage to compensate what they see as their competitive weaknesses The little woman with a big gun in her purse Government is the source of power that we all rely on for protection be it in war or in legal contracts This power is corruptible and as such has been corrupted The constitution was an attempt to eliminate the source of corruption by limiting their power but like erosion it can be advanced or slowed but never stopped sadly it seems that a full collapse of confidence in government is the only thing that will allow us to start again Unfortunately this reset will likely be very painful Thu Augustus The Boeing problem is that other governments supply financing for aircraft sales from their countries If boeing does not have the same financing assistance for buyers it will have trouble selling planes The people posting that the loss of boeing operations in US would make no difference are full scope dumb asses Wed Dragon HAwk Wed WhackoWarner Wed Coke and Hookers Yes youre welcome to leave Youll never

around am arrest him and his cunt wife and they wake up in a foriegn prison tomorrow Lets see the next interview he gives to a foriegn news source Wed Pet Rock When the same federal government wont let them move from a strong union state to a right to work state to make more profit and have a better work force then why the fuck not Good for them Wed joego I wonder how much of Boeings Aircraft are actually made in the US anyway I heard a bunch of parts were made in China Wed Pet Rock Thu PhoQ There should be no reason for surprise when the first generation of Chinese airliners looks a lot like the last generation of Boeing Wed ThroxxOfVron IF millions of other corporate welfare recipients were cut off it might result in the US being divestedcleansed of phonyparasitic enterprises wholesale Maybe it would work with individual welfare recipients too True story I found and decided to adopt a feral kitten It took over two hours with a tub of water and a pair of tweezers to drown pick off and individually crushkill almost fleas on this poor little creature I found it a very satisfying exorcise The kitten was much cleaner healthier and happier after the removal of the parasites I postit that any organism is much cleaner healthier and happier without hundreds of parasites feasting on and defecated all over it I extrapolate that our economysociety will be much cleaner
