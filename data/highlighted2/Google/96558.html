cloud potential MSFT is hardly cheap trading at nearly x free cash flow MSFT has a strong history of dividend growth annualized over past nine years and will likely continue this trend MSFTs Office and Windows cloud initiatives are very promising and Azure is on a rapid growth pace MSFT faces the challenge of playing perpetual defense which may further erode margins Nadella has yet to prove himself as a competent leader MSFT has full fair value up to per share representing of upside I believe it should be considered a key component of a diversified bluechip portfolio This is another contribution to a continuing series in which I profile some of my favorite blue chip holdings I keep approximately of my assets indexed and in blue chips so this is a very important field for me As Ive stated before my focus is on quality companies at a reasonable price although I appreciate and prefer a strong bargain quality companies rarely go on a fire sale When they do theres often deeper concerns As Buffett and Munger best put it its far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT is one of these wonderful companies trading in a fair price range with potential upside of to its full fair value of per share MSFT is certainly not cheap currently trading at nearly x its threeyear average free cash flow FCF Although MSFT isnt a bargain I think it is fairly valued and should be considered a key component in a diversified blue chip portfolio MSFT has maintained a successful dividend strategy throughout its history and payout amounts have been very impressive even throughout the last decade of weaker growth The annual dividend payout has been raised an impressive annualized over the past nine years with no clear signs of slowing down Even with the strong dividend yield of approximately the dividend is covered more than x by current and average free cash flow Even if growth slows over the next few years MSFT still has ample runway to raise the dividend albeit likely at the expense of repurchases Strong but Inconsistent Share Repurchases While MSFT has boasted an overall strong repurchase program over the past decade with shares reduced by over the past decade the momentum has noticeably slowed since MSFT missed key opportunities to repurchase shares in the s and s and is now resuming share repurchases when the stock is more richly valuedclick to enlarge Although MSFT has resumed share repurchases after a nearly threeyear period of stagnation MSFT cannot be depended upon to heavily reduce their share count primarily due to the majority of their cash held overseas With the currently high FCF multiples close to x on average MSFT is likely better off investing in growth opportunities or raising the dividend Over the past years MSFT has spent B net to reduce the share count by approximately B shares or approximately per share While this looks reasonable based on the current share pricing the average cost per share has looked foolhardy in the past With MSFT resuming repurchases near peak pricing the average repurchase pricing might continue to appear questionable Microsoft is ubiquitous worldwide for both its Windows operating system and Office productivity suite Despite over two decades of assault from the likes of Linux Apple NASDAQ AAPL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Microsofts margins have remained steady and its dominance of these two markets has continued MSFT also has made key strides in the entertainment sector via its Xbox business which has arguably replaced Sony NYSE SNE as the primary source of living room entertainment Although the Nintendo consoles have higher total sales Microsofts platform offers a complete entertainment service whereas Nintendos offerings are far inferior on a technological basis Microsofts gross and pretax profit margins remain at very high levels but have declined steadily over the past decade Revenue growth has easily compensated for the decline in margins but the margin trend is a bit worrisome Microsoft has an enormous cash pile which will enable them to pursue potential growth opportunities but this is also a bit of a mixedbag due to the amount of cash that remains outside of the US Without some form of tax repatriation holiday MSFT will be less likely to institute large repurchases or acquire significant USbased companies The majority of tech firms are internationally based for similar tax reasons so despite the limitations MSFT should still be able to make good use of their cash hoard As of the latest Q quarterly filing current to March MSFT has over B in net cash and shortterm investments vs B in mid June th Despite an increasing dividend over B in share repurchases and B in capex during the past nine months the cash pile continues to grow Microsoft often takes a lot of flak from investors for not having more presence in the cloud computing environment While its true that the Microsoft Azure offering falls far behind Amazons NASDAQ AMZN AWS in terms of revenues AWS has approximately x the revenue as of spring MSFT is gaining growth averaging more than new customers per week The best chance in my opinion for Microsoft to truly capitalize on the Cloud is via its Office offerings and a future potential for operating system subscription licenses Office essentially changes the Office revenue stream from onetime licensing fees with potential addon service revenue fees to a recurrent annual or monthly service fee This shift is critical since it will continue to squeeze money out of businesses that previously were slower on the upgrade cycles Since Office updates in realtime companies will avoid painful lumpsum upgrade costs and instead will pay via a monthly quarterly or annual licensing fee Office is sold to residential consumers for per month or per year The business plans range from to per month based on storage needs and additional features including tablet functionality and HD video conferencing Enterprise plans range from to per user per month I believe the realtime update capacity and cloud storage tiein features of Office will further cement their dominance in the workplace I believe an enormous potential rests in offering operating systems via a similar subscription Windows already offers live updates but instead of relying on a new version every few years or even the annual update style that Mac users are accustomed to what if MSFT operating systems offered users realtime updates on a featurebyfeature basis This is essentially what both Apple and Microsoft are already doing but it could be sold as an annual license instead of a onetime sale This could both increase the quantity and consistency of revenue flows but would also cut down on piracy as the base Windows operating systems would be designed to require some form of subscription model and verification Users who didnt renew would continue to have a functional operating system but would lose access to live updates and all related cloud services Theres already been a lot of talk about this potential shift in the tech community and I believe the free Windows update is just the first step This isnt really a new challenge for Microsoft but competition is nibbling at all edges of Microsofts dominance from Amazon HewlettPackard NYSE HPQ and IBM NYSE IBM with cloud services to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Apple and Amazon with personal devices and products Microsofts push into mobile phones and the Surface tablet have been decent endeavors but like so many Microsoft initiatives in the s except for the wildly successful Xbox both appear to simply be mediocreatbest defense I believe MSFT is finally getting ahead of the curve with Office Windows Azure and the Xbox One integration but weve seen these false starts before The true risk to Microsoft investors isnt that they fail to recognize significant growth as they havent had significant growth since the late s but rather that their pseudo monopolies fall apart Having sampled nearly all of the alternatives to Office I think Microsofts grip on this market is as strong as ever but nothing is ever for certain I view the risk from continuing upstarts in a similar vein as the above discussion nothing will fundamentally challenge MSFTs dominance but many new products will eat away at the majority of future growth initiatives My largest fear as an investor is that MSFT will get caught in a cycle of acquisitions which are necessary to maintain dominance These acquisitions could result in expanding capex requirements that essentially eat all of the growth in operating cash flow from the aforementioned initiatives Office Azure and Windows I believe its very possible that MSFTs free cash flow could remain relatively flat for the foreseeable future Microsoft has approximately B in cash trapped overseas which has forced them to issue increasing amounts of debt to fund domestic acquisitions repurchases and dividend payments If a substantial tax holiday doesnt occur within the next few years this could lead to further inefficient purchase decisions President Obama has proposed a compromise of sorts that would levy a onetime tax of on offshore profits while setting the future rate at I believe both of these tax rates are unrealistically high and that this structure could lead to a massive exodus of US corporations Assuming repatriation is offered at cashrich firms are still incentivized to pursue foreign growth initiatives even if they are less attractive up to than domestic alternatives Theres a risk that MSFT will unwisely allocate their nondomestic cash in attempts to avoid further taxation Former CEO Steve Ballmer was in my opinion unfairly blamed for the performance of Microsoft stock but he was infamous for presiding over an unfriendly corporate culture and for stifling innovation through his repeated restructuring attempts New CEO Satya Nadella has promised to lead innovation in the Cloud and Enterprise sectors and he has a strong record of performance at Microsoft Nadella has made some key decisions during his first year as CEO including opening up Office Apps to iDevices and Android platforms note I commonly use Excel on my iPhone and have been very pleased with its functionality previously I had been looking into competing options Microsoft and Salesforcecom NYSE CRM announced a landmark deal in to integrate several of their products Microsoft also teamed up with Dropbox to enhance operability with Office note Dropbox is an essential part of my personal finance business I have managed to keep my costs at but I would be willing to pay for this quality in the future Despite the many promising initiatives Nadella has brought to Microsoft recent restructuring moves raise additional questions of leadership focus Nadella has cut nearly k jobs albeit mostly Nokiarelated and has lost seven key executives in the past few months Overall reviews of Nadellas success remain mixed and Im not personally convinced yet The majority of the stock performance over the past two years is due only to perceptions and not to any real fundamental improvements As Ive previously discussed in my other blue chip articles I prefer to utilize an average price to free cash flow ratio in my valuation targets My broad range is typically from x yield With a company like MSFT with a clear moat and global scale and nearly unsurpassed quality and staying power in the tech sector I am comfortable with a longterm fiveyear average multiple of x yield The threeyear average captures some of their higher capex flows due to a few key acquisitions including Nokias phone ops Yammer and Skype which keeps the cash flow picture more conservative MSFT pays a healthy dividend but FCF is the important metric to track The averages are shown in the chart below The five and threeyear averages are similar as higher recent operating cash flow has given way to higher capex primarily in the form of acquisitions Taking the more conservative threeyear average and applying a xx range results in a fair market capitalization of B to B With B shares outstanding as of April the fair price range for MSFT is to I believe this range is fair but it shows that Microsofts current price of is hardly a bargain at a relative FCF multiple of nearly x MSFT has a history of questionable management decisions on the macro scale primarily in terms of new product development and marketing but it is a wellmanaged firm overall in terms of market domination production efficiency and profitability Choosing the midpoint of my valuation range x y average free cash flow leads to a price target of roughly inline with the current market pricing I believe shares of MSFT are fairly priced and should be included as a component of a diversified blue chip portfolio but they are nothing to get excited about Im long MSFT at a basis in the mids I sold shares last year due to outsized portfolio exposure and cheaper alternatives but would consider adding more shares if they dip closer to a x FCF range I would be comfortable holding my current allocation of shares until the lowmid s The only trade Ive made in MSFT since is shown below Source Microsoft Attractive Investment
