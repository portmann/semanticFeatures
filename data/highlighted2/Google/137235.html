Facebook is going to be the advertising monster of Zac Moffatt Republican strategist Facebook NASDAQ FB shareholders have been quick to move from exulting over the companys fantastic Q earnings to worrying about costs and growth rates It is my opinion that revenues from the United States will soar on the wings of secular growth turbocharged by political advertising As we are all too aware the presidential political season has already begun State primaries and local advertising begin in February with the New Hampshire primary and the Iowa caucus In the presidential election cost billion The Hill speculated that the presidential campaign will cost twice as much inflation will have increased less than between The Washington Post weighs in with a more conservative estimate of only billion In the National Journal estimated of the Obama campaigns budget excluding PACs was spent on media they note that if campaign spending was flat digital advertising would more than triple to over million USA Today reported the conservative Koch brothers have budgeted million for the election cycle up from the million their Freedom Partners PAC spent in I think it is clear that political spending during the cycle should double from the then record amount spent in the cycle Source NationalJournalcom Interesting as a visual as the numbers are based on flat spending and continuation of digital medias growth not a projection taking into account growth in overall spending and digital medias greater emphasis Sinclair Broadcasting NASDAQ SBGI a diversified television broadcasting company with stations in markets in their Q conference call noted that fourth quarter net broadcast revenues were up versus the fourth quarter of political revenues were million as compared to million in the fourth quarter of we believe that about to of our political revenue was incremental in the fourth quarter and about for the year Political advertising increased SBGIs advertising by political ads ads expolitical in the Q Source Sinclair Broadcasting Q conference call And money being spent on socialdigital media is projected to increase The Huffington Post estimates political spending will grow by over in from Michael Palmer President of i a data company backed by the Koch brothers noted was really crude because our side didnt do so well Lindsay Conwell of i added Think of how much money is wasted running an ad during a sports program to people who arent registered to vote Elizabeth Wilner SVP of Political at Kantar Media Intelligence as reported in Media Life Magazine noted that the limits on net political spending on digital are only limited by availability of ad space theres only so much you can spend on digital you cant spend the same massive quantities on digital that you can spend on TV While the Obama campaign famously outplayed the Romney campaign in the election the investment in online media was relatively small If was proof of concept will see social media advertising The secret is out and both sides and any third parties will be aggressively utilizing a much higher percentage of a much larger campaign spend Facebook has the unique and highly valued ability to provide microtargeted With a database that includes zip code age sex education and interests and sometimes political leanings FB can offer candidates at every level of the political spectrum highly targeted advertising to those most likely to be impacted by a message From local school board elections to highly contested primaries FB will be a major player in what promises to be a record setting election cycle Both candidates their PACs independent PACs like National Association of Realtors and National Beer Wholesalers Association and special interests like AFSCME and the NRA promise to make a record year for political spending Facebook can add value to candidates of both parties and third parties in all contested elections Facebook also has the ability to microtarget test refine and tweak Facebook also offers multiple platforms including Facebook Instagram WhatsApp etc John Wanamaker was famously quoted as saying half the money I spend on advertising is wasted the trouble is I dont know which half Facebook has the ability to provide political and other advertisers with detailed feedback with respect to clicks time spent etc directly and in almost real time Beyond the United States Facebook with of its users outside of North America promises to be a potent force for political advertising throughout the democratic world In other words beyond the political opportunity in the United States in expect the rest of the democratic world to catch up to the targeted opportunities in digital media political advertising Borrell Associates as reported in MediaPost projects digital media will harvest about billion in political spending in The National Journal in an article titled Facebook The Vote that FB now offers a far more customized and sophisticated splicing of the American electorate and that contenders are already investing Zac Moffatt Romneys digital director now working for Rick Perry and a cofounder of Targeted Victory notes I can literally bring my voter file into Facebook and start to buy advertising off of that Wesley Donehue of the Rubio campaign and CEO of Push Digital was quoted as saying We use Facebook more than any single tool FBs participation in the election is more than theory The New York Times notes Facebook already a major player in past cycles has been working to expand its digital dominance in the political realm and has doubled since its government and politics team which includes a political ad sales group <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and GOOG unit YouTube are also expected to receive a good chunk of the political media dollar Though less targeted than FB GOOG has an expansive reach However as Zac Moffatt noted Facebook is the pound gorilla in the room Facebook is going to be the advertising monster of In light of the very strong positive response FB has received in US advertising and the very visible and vocal ways the existing campaigns are already using digital advertising I would suggest the billion estimate for is far too low billion to billion reflecting of total spend of all campaigns not just the presidential campaigns may be more accurate Assuming FB captures of total digital spending the Company will have million to billion in additional ad revenue in from politics excluding normal and exUS growth In Q FB reported billion in advertising revenue from its monthly active users in North America On a runrate basis that is billion per year Using the midpoint of my estimate million political advertising alone has the potential of adding to FBs North American advertising numbers and by definition a higher percentage in the US Assuming a margin on this incremental revenue and a wow tax rate FB would earn an additional share from political advertising Currently FB is projected to earn share in While I have found extensive discussion regarding the growth of expected political spending the growth of digital media spending and the expected oversized role FB will play in the elections I have found very little discussion regarding the economic impact of the election on the Companys earnings Therefore I can only assume the incremental revenue and earnings FB should garner from the next election cycle is incremental to most projections and represents a legitimate upside Further FB continues to impress as a source of advertising due to its unique ability to target and its relative costeffectiveness see this AdWeek article suggesting a further upside While up for the year and trading for a very expensive x forward earnings FB appears to have growth opportunities that suggest a higher stock price by the end of Source Facebook Political Advertising Will Drive Victory In Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any
