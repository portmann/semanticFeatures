recast mobile wallets as smartphone utilities Apple and Googles recent announcements focused everyones attention on the features and functions of their respective mobile payments application But what has gone unnoticed is the subtle shift that they engineered from asking users to take an action and download an app to giving them a wallet app outright when they power up their phones Apple NASDAQ AAPL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Android have just recast mobile wallets as smartphone utilities putting them in the same category as cameras maps weather the app store and any other app that comes preloaded on their smartphones Apple and Googles recent announcements focused everyones attention on the features and functions of their respective mobile payments application whether they enable private label cards or merchant loyalty programs at how many locations those wallets are accepted and how they may interact with other apps like Proactive and Now But what has gone unnoticed in the dozens of articles written about their respective announcements is the subtle shift that they engineered from asking users to take an action and download an app to giving them a wallet app outright when they power up their phones Naturally they are hoping that this will give them a leg up in winning the hearts and minds of their respective smartphone user bases A toe up perhaps but Im not convinced Because if just being present on a smartphone home screen were an advantage iTunes Radio default radio app for the iPhone would have been a smashing success instead of struggling to get past to percent penetration Ping would have hit a home run Apple Maps would have been a raging success too instead of causing iPhone users to scream for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Maps to be brought back Apples own weather app would also be killing it instead of ceding ground to the Weather Channel or Weather Underground apps And Passbook Apples initial foray into commerce would have seen far more merchant interest outside of the early adopters All iPhone users have had Passbook installed on their phones since when iOS was introduced And its of course the repository in which Apple Pay transactions are visible today But Passbook was never all that well understood by consumers It was intended to be a place for consumers to store anything with a barcode offers boarding passes etc so that they could be easily accessed and used And just like everything Apple when it launched merchants stampeded to develop iPass enabled offers that very few consumers ever used and therefore very few merchants bothered to devote resources to supporting It pretty much languished until now Rebranding Passbook to Wallet was a pretty brilliant stroke by Apple Its finally obvious what that icon is supposed to do serving as a visual cue that consumers with an iPhone now have a way to use that phone to pay for stuff One of the biggest issues that our research says gets in the way of Apple Pay usage is that people forget they have it and dont use it even when they are in stores that accept it Having an icon on the phone labeled Wallet is at least a step in the right direction to get consumers to remember that they have a mobile payments option available to them Android Pay is naturally hoping for a similar outcome Its acquisition of Softcards assets gave it access to the US carrier distribution deals Softcard negotiated That will stick an Android Pay icon on certain Android phones in the US Softcard of course had the same deal and came preloaded on certain Android phones and even claimed some monthly downloads at one point But being an icon on a phone didnt really do much to drive its usage otherwise thered be a Softcard mobile wallet in the hunt after years instead of a fire sale to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>earlier this year and a puppet mascot still looking for a home So success for both will mainly come down to the value these mobile wallets provide and the experience that these mobile wallets will deliver to consumers since even the apps that consumers take the trouble to download dont get consumer lovin for long Nielsen tells us that the typical smartphone owner has about apps on her phone including the ones that came with it They also discovered through their research that percent of those users access fewer than apps a day and about half say they use between one and four Nearly percent dont download any apps at all in any given month according to comScore Maybe thats because theyre too busy to look for apps maybe thats because they havent seen anything that wows them or maybe thats because they cant afford to or dont want to pay for the data associated with using more apps Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>are hoping to appeal to the percent of all consumers who for whatever reason dont bother with downloading apps by giving them one without them having to do anything at all But heres where a mobile wallet app is different than a weather app or maps or just about anything else that comes preloaded on the phone Consumers still have to do stuff to activate those wallets Theyll do that if they really think that theyll use them On the activation front both Apple Pay and Android Pay have done and are doing deals with the banks to get consumers over the hurdle of account provisioning That part is pretty slick and easy at least for the cards that are already provisioned in iTunes or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play Its unclear how the process will work for store and loyalty cards Usage then comes down to consumers believing that they will get enough utility out of the mobile wallet to make it worth any effort at all And that will all come down to how and where consumers can use their Apple Pay and Android Pay wallets Adding loyalty and store options for both Apple and Android Pay can only help since it is an important step to making the wallet more than just a substitute for a plastic card at a handful of brickandmortar merchant locations Locations that Apple says will soon total really million Since Googles Android Pay rides those same set of NFC rails Android Pay users can tap to their hearts content at those uh huh million locations too But getting real usage and adoption will mean being better than the form of payment that consumers are already hooked on and using digital mobile or plastic card Apple Pay and Android Pay will have to earn consumer adoption So too will every mobile wallet whose name begins or ends with Pay And that will come by having a stellar consumer experience that will get consumers using it which will in turn drive merchant interest which will in turn drive more consumer interest The challenge that Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>are up against is fragmentation fragmentation of merchants and platforms for both fragmentation of operating systems for GoogleAndroid and hardware handsets and NFC enabled terminals for both Being an icon on a phones home screen is one small step for mobile wallet kind Whether its a giant step for mobile wallet ignition is yet to be determined The mobile wallets game is still very much anyones to win We could use a little help
