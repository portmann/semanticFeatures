will be banned from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Two weeks ago well before the most recent Apple sellthru scare hit AAPL stock and pushed it into bear market territory or down from its recent highs we warned that the company faces a risk of inventory correction as a result of at least three channel checks and soon thereafter more confirming deteriorating iPhone sales indicative of either company specific or worse a broader drop in market demand for smartphones Today we get another confirmation just how bad Apple enddemand has become with news out of India that Apple has cut prices of its latest iPhone s and iPhone s Plus by up to just two months after their launch in India to boost flagging sales in what is historically its most crucial quarter as demand for the flagship devices nosedived from a Diwali high According to the Economic Times the price of the iPhone s GB model which was introduced at Rs on October has fallen by per cent and now ranges between Rs and Rs according to four large retailers who spoke to ET The price cuts are across all variants GB GB and GB of both models Apple had introduced the iPhone s and s Plus at Rs Rs about Rs Rs more than launch prices of iPhone and Plus The models wereRs Rs costlier than those available in the US Middle East and Hong Kong raising concerns that demand would be hurt The average difference in prices of all iPhone s and s Plus devices between launch time and now is about per cent a top executive at a national retailer said The reduction also narrows the gap with prices of iPhone devices launched in making an upgrade more attractive for customers The price difference between the iPhone and iPhone s was a lot so many customers are not willing to upgrade to the new model said a senior executive of another national retailer Highlighting the severity of the demand slump ET notes that this is the first time that the price of an Apple flagship has been brought down within two months of launch underlining concerns around the initial pricing said Tarun Pathak senior analyst at Counterpoint Technology Market Research Apple declined to comment on the matter The collapse in demand is evident not only at the MSRP level but in total shipments sent to the country Apple imported almost of the latest iPhones in October in India the worlds fastestgrowing smartphone market sparking hopes of its best ever quarter Shipments have slumped since then and the latest data suggests that imports of the new models fell per cent to in November It wasnt just the flagship product prices were also slashed on the iPhone s model for the third time in three months and its price now starts at Rs almost half its September price The price cuts indicate that Apple maybe trying to revive demand in the OctobertoDecember quarter which has historically been the strongest period for the company due to its flagship launches The ETs attempt to spin the glum data for Tim Cook as follows Analysts said the price cut could reignite iPhone s and iPhone s Plus demand in the coming months Now that they have aligned prices we can see some sales happening in future quarters which will also sustain Apple in the typically weaker periods of January to September Pathak added Alas with Apple the gating factor was never price In fact the higher the better as it infused the product with a coolness factor and showed that consumers would be willing to pay virtually anything just to obtain Cupertinos latest and greatest gizmo This is no longer the case and in fact the one worst thing that could happen to Apple is the admission that it too is a mortal company subject to the laws of supply and demand and price elasticity of demand The market appears to have already gotten the memo however and as the chart below shows as of Friday AAPL suffered its most recent bear market drop from recent all time highs Mon UndergroundPost Tim Cook is the reason Apple is fading Hes a
