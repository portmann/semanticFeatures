class='textDiv'>Apple Drops Becomes More Attractive As It Aims For Total Victory Over Android And Windows Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Apple is trading cheap to the market even though it owns the No global brand in the great secular growth industry of computingmobile telephony Part of the reason are fears about Chinas currency devaluation and what that might imply for its economy Part of the reason is just profittaking probably shortselling and nearrecord amounts of FUD Yet the reality is that Apple is firing on nearly all cylinders especially those that count Apple is now in striking distance of totally dominating the profit stream from smartphones and its getting close to that goal with its Mac division The laws of mathematics always win in the end Unless there are massive hidden assets within a company such as land holdings lower PE stocks beat higher PE stocks When the lower PE stock is associated with faster EPS growth than the higher PE stock theres no contest This is the situation with Apple NASDAQ AAPL right now My speculation is that the stock is being beaten down because the shortselling percentages had gotten down to one days worth of trading so the stock was ripe for selling and short selling But the belief in the stock ie that selling it short was mistaken was one of those cases where the majority was correct The point of mentioning my guess as to why AAPL was open to a selloff is that last point few money managers want to short AAPL because most of them own and like their iPhones as well as iPads Macs etc They all know which is the real true winner in the computing smartphone wars which company makes the best products with the best shopping experience and the best aftersales support They know the truth that once Apple saw the large screen smartphone light Samsung OTCSSNLF was toast All the trendsetters know it Samsung had its chance to create an iconic large screen brand while it had the field to itself but it simply did not have the chops <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL itself tried but has failed miserably with its own line of smartphones and was forced to admit defeat and sell them Its not just the trendsetters in business and finance who use iPhones Increasingly Android users are seeing the light This trend which Apple reports has reached record levels has been a global occurrence Apple has gained market share in smartphones in numerous countries on several continents Its not just clever marketing or herding thats causing this Its superior hardwaresoftware integration and more broadly the best ecosystem around As a confirmed Android user blogged just this week in two months with an iPhone I wrote perhaps my most popular blog post ever just over two months ago I talked about how I bought used and subsequently didnt like the iPhone I would be sticking with Androidor so I thought I was excluding the features that make using iOS great I didnt turn on iMessage I wasnt using Passbook or Apple Pay Handoff was something that was handsoff for me pun totally intended After two months fully immersed iPhone usage Im confident that this will be my primary device At least for the foreseeable future This means I have a lot of words I need to eat Ive been an Android user and a big voice for the Android Army since the first devices were available I will still have Android devices too I need them for testing But for everyday use I will be making the switch to the iPhone Heres why Then the blogger goes on to list improved battery life and other features including the ones listed above Nice to hear and an increasinglycommon story Since hes a techie Ill add one that makes all the difference to a nontechie such as myself outofthisworld customer support Thats with AppleCare and sometimes without Plus youre not talking to someone who sounds halfway around the world and of course is halfway around the world You actually can hear a pin drop with phone support with AppleCare and that makes for a much easier interaction especially when youre older and your hearing has lost a step or two And we all get there or hope to do so so its relevant even to middleaged people The FUD has reached bizarre proportions with the China story Apple sells large numbers of iPhones and all its other products in the EU the UK Japan as well as smaller populations in very affluent countries such as Canada and Australia Guess whats happened to their currencies the past year They have all plunged against the dollar much more than the retracement of the Chinese yuans appreciation against the USD of several years ago I dont remember any panic among AAPL shareholders that the stock had to plunge because foreign economies were weakening against the USD Despite these devaluations which Apple could not completely hedge against the companys sales have soared and have gained share in diverse locations Yet somehow the Chinese devaluation is cause for a freak out This is a classic misdirection by Mr Market His arithmetic is all wrong Ignore the costsaving offsets to Apples loss of income due to another adverse foreign currency translation out of China Just think instead of growing sales by yoy in Q sales growth in Greater China would still have more than doubled yoy if the yuan had been devalued at the beginning of Apples FY Q say on March Remember also that operating income grew faster than sales from B to B in the quarter These are astounding unbelievable rates They are not about to collapse because China is likely in a recession note that developing countries define recession as a major growth slowdown or worse and do not require negative growth to experience recession The Chinese devaluation has some offsetting advantages to AAPL One is that all countries have to compete and if China stubbornly stuck to its selfimposed USD peg at its recent historically high level it would have lost vast amounts of export business to countries named above plus South Korea Vietnam even India So by devaluing enough to stay competitive Chinas economy adjusts properly and lets it work through its internal economic dislocations which it will do in time Just as steel and cement manufacturing shipbuilding etc are going through a massive adjustment to reality in China its a hugely complex country and theres a new economy in China that continues to thrive and even boom In fact Chinese wages have already reached the level requiring China to outsource lowwage assembly work to its Asian neighbors Chinese companies have even begun setting up factories in the US If this story sounds familiar it should Japan did the same thing many decades ago Apple is positioned to grow rapidly for years in China which will have its business cycle fluctuations just as the US does But its going to go G and G with smartphones which favors Apple tremendously Now if AAPL had the PE that GOOGL or even Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT on a TTM GAAP EPS there might be some cause for adjusting the stock price down on the Chinese economic weakness But at a PE of under X TTM EPS compared with a median PE for much weaker companies of more like X theres so much relative margin of safety in AAPL that its quite likely that the whole China situation is already irrelevant to the longterm values inherent in AAPL shares Short term sure its an issue but a share of stock is a longduration asset and Apple is certain to stick around a long time probably growing on a global scale for many years to come even if neither of my suppositions below comes to fruition Another advantage that comes to AAPL shareholders from the Chinese and global economic weakness is that interest rates on high quality financial instruments drop and stay down for a while during and after global recessions This translates into higher PEs on highquality equity investments It also lowers Apples borrowing costs given its high credit ratings In other words Chinas economic issues are related to global economic issues which in turn lead to a longoverdue differentiation by both stock and bond investors of high quality and low quality issues AAPL shares benefit from comparison with flat or even lower interest rates and Apple benefits from lowering borrowing costs Now on to the evolving chance that Apple is about to go thermonuclear in its level of dominance of multiple critical and giant profit streams Is Apple on the verge of becoming a de facto monopoly in smartphones And is it also about to start really destroying the PC market Published data suggests that Apple may be on the verge of an historic business victory namely becoming almost the only profit center in smartphone manufacturing As we know Microsofts phone represented another gigantic complete writeoff Longtime Apple fans have lots of schadenfreude over MSFTs repeated disasters BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY has seen its tangible assets shrink from B to B in only two years HTC trades at net cash with few prospects to recover Lenovo OTCPK LNVGY is imploding in smartphones having purchased Motorola Mobility from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Xiaomi and Huawei work on very thin margins So that leaves our old friend Samsung As mentioned it had its one insight about the importance of large screen smartphones and phablets but it was unable to capitalize on it Basically this was because all it knew how to do was copy Apple When it temporarily actually went into the lead in the product category it had no creativity to take it to the next level All it had were some nice specs and trivial geewhiz features that impressed few buyers But it still had all the issues with Android such as fragmentation malware and a generally inferior OS as the Android fan who saw the light blogged about as quoted above As we all know Samsung is seeing its profits collapse Some slightly old data had the iPhone plus Samsungs smartphone profits equaling of total smartphone industry profits As Samsung is revealed as just a reactive increasinglydesperate AndroidTizen highendmidrangelowend manufacturer with no coherent vision to win the smartphone future Apple is getting close to being the only profitable smartphone manufacturer My guess is that its already almost there This would represent an enormous achievement and be a boon both to nearterm profits and especially to the sustainability of those profits This trend is just like the quip about markets getting ready to crash or a debtor falling irreversibly into legal bankruptcy If the market is the lordly US stock market or if the bankrupttobe is a wellrespected pillar of the community the amount of belief in the SPY or the debtor almost always is too high The same may be coming true in the reverse ie upward direction about Apples accelerating dominance in what matters namely profits Apple looks as though its winning gradually but really it may be about to run the profits table seemingly all at once Profits dominance without a sales monopoly poses a challenge to antitrust laws I wont go there in this article but my guess is that some of what has been going on with the scrutiny of Apple Music ties into a growing realization that Apple has become the big gorilla in smartphones though not in unit sales Just think what could happen if Samsung begins to cut back in smartphones The lowend Chinese manufacturers have little chance of challenging Apple in developed countries among upperincome buyers We will then witness a situation I have never seen before a de facto monopoly despite a minority market share Its beyond the scope of this article to speculate too much on the ramifications of this should it occur but one possibility is that Apple quickly gains very significant unit market share as other smartphone manufacturers fall to this juggernaut Im not predicting the future but I think its realistic to think that Apple can run the table in the global smartphone profits sweepstake and do so for years to come This would do wonders for AAPLs profits and PE In addition Apple is destroying the PC competition The key to further success here is the IBM NYSE IBM alliance A side note for some younger readers At the dawn of the homedesktop computing movement the two major players were Apple and IBM As part of its decline IBM had no idea how to make money from these little machines and ended up getting out of the business Apple on the other hand invented the Mac In introducing the Mac Apple created what is still widely viewed as the greatest TV ad aka Not many TV ads have their own Wikipedia entry More personally this ad shown during the Super Bowl is the only TV ad I can actually remember watching at a specific location and Ive been an Apple fan ever since Anyway the obvious villains in the ad were IBM and its robotic legions To make sure no one disputes the point there is this photo from back in the day Well business trumps hard feelings which mellow over the decades When Apple and IBM agreed to join forces last year it was obvious to some observers that the point of it was not simply to create a few apps or even one hundred apps At least that was my view The apps cover story was a way for the companies to date before going steady or to go steady for a while before consummating the relationship if one prefers an earthier analogy I believe that IBM is going to spearhead a full frontal attack on PCs its own child long grown up IBM itself is becoming a Mac shop Why Because of what all Apple fans and Mac users know The total cost of ownership of Macs is less than that of PCs Not only that Macs work better So its really a nobrainer What held Macs back for years were lack of economies of scale in manufacturing and lack of software Now all but some highlyspecialized software programs are Maccompatible and Apple is the worlds dominant single manufacturer of computing devices Both the major negatives to Mac market share growth are gone However what former IBMer Tim Cook knew was that to destroy Microsoft in the enterprise it needed an introducer an ally It needed the most credible savvy company around to sing Apples and the Macs praises For IBM to do this for its former antagonist will be impressive to many CIOs and other decisionmakers in the enterprise It has already been widely reported that Macs account for about half of all profits from PCMac manufacturing As Macs continue to gain global unit market share without IBM adding to their momentum that ongoing trend continues to disproportionately increase Apples share of profits IBM with its legion of consultants is a lock to accelerate the Macs market share gains What that in turn means is that probably sooner rather than later the Mac will reach of total profits from PCsMacs That will lead to a tipping point Go to a college campus and you see Macs but few PCs Every year that goes by people enter the workforce used only Macs and iPhones This trend has no obvious end As with the force of water dripping steadily on a rock this trend erodes Windows steadily month by month year by year If you have been an AAPL watcher since as I have you have seen in real time how Apple has made two immense innovations first in computers and then in smartphones only to be in the view of some sabotaged by breaches of faith by trusted persons or companies That the company is now in position to take command of what many view as its due is inspiring In fact I think that Apple as an entity is specially motivated to win one both for Steve and for the principle of it all What matters to stock investors though is that all this is occurring with AAPL valued like a secondtier bank stock or old economy company not the leading company in what remains a tremendous area of secular growth for many years to come Apple is executing a pincer movement Its moving ahead of its smartphone competitors like a tremendous machine pulling away with superior products tied into a superior ecosystem Along with the Chinese manufacturers Apple is getting close to finishing off Samsung as a serious competitor though of course thats just my hope and not yet a proven fact The Macs have begun to force the Windows franchise into retreat With this dual momentum the logical outcome is that the superiority of the single company model controlling the hardware and the software should win out MSFT is far too late to this game when it and Intel NASDAQ INTC were joined at the hip as Wintel it was a different story Viewed in this way and knowing what we all know about Apples functional dominance among actual tablet users who spend money via their tablets its increasingly reasonable to think of the following analogy from biotech In the treatment of HIVAIDS one company and only one company had a vision of creating a unitary solution to control this oncefatal disease That was Gilead NASDAQ GILD Methodically Gilead set out to revolutionize HIVAIDS treatment At first gradually and at some point suddenly it took over the market having started with zero market share This is what Apple is trying to do in smartphones and computers From its neardeath experience two decades ago it has created more important successful innovations than any company in many years It took all of them the surprise success of Apple Stores the brilliance of iTunes the iPod then of course the iPhone etc to get to this point When viewed against the potential that Apple may dominate the profit stream in a nearly irreversible manner for both smartphones and small computers all the FUD about China as well as a somewhat confusing software interface for Apple Music an allegedly disappointing launch for the Apple Watch etc fades away to insignificance On its own merits AAPL is simply an unduly cheap stock That the equity of the company with the No brand name in the world can sell at this discount to the market is a surprise and that alone would be good enough for me to want to overweight the stock However we can forget the myth of the law of large numbers Facts are facts and we must follow their logic no matter how surprising the conclusion Apple is once again attempting to break all the rules AAPL is a rare opportunity right now around per share In a richlyvalued possibly bubbly stock market shares of the most important corporation of our time are on the bargain counter And if current trends continue no guarantees it may be about to set corporate history and dominate the profit stream from two of the most important industries of the ComputerInternet Age In that case profits would substantially exceed expectations and AAPL would probably finally receive the PE it deserves The market is fearful about AAPL but its business is strong and strengthening Warren Buffetts admonition to be brave and bold when others are fearful comes to mind Might AAPL drop more Yes and so might the SPY No matter in the long run if there is no leverage involved Difficult economic times simply weed out the weak players faster so ultimately AAPL will emerge all the more dominant if a global recession is present and worsens for a while Apple Inc and AAPL shares are both unique phenomena that for some reason Wall Street cannot fully understand Thus I am markedly overweight AAPL with a very longterm approach waiting and hoping for one or more tipping points that would mean game over for the
