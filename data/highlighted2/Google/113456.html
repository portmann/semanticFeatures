class='textDiv'>Apple Lots Of Smoke FUD But Whats On Fire Are Earnings And Growth Opportunities Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Apple stock has dropped steadily in the face of negative headlines Yet earnings estimates continue to improve for both this fiscal year and next year Apple continues to introduce useful products that will improve over time and that are strengthening its ecosystem from the start Apple NASDAQ AAPL looks unusually well positioned for new money investment given its current price At any moment AAPL could and should act the way Gilead Sciences NASDAQ GILD did a couple of months ago and start ramping upward showing no mercy to the shorts or any latetotheparty bargainhunting bulls The more people wring their hands about the Apple Watch launch or another Great Depression in China the more investors should look past the FUD fear uncertainty and doubt throwers and reexamine the core of the longAAPL thesis this continues to improve even as the stock price droops AAPL below X TTM EPS exnet cash is truly cheap to the market NYSEARCA SPY just as GILD was in April and remains though its price is higher now The recent lesson of GILD is that you have to be in it to win it The reason to mention GILD with AAPL is that each is the stock of a dominant innovative company that is being valued far below the PE of the market The reasons why each has a low PE are different for each company But in each case that low PE provides a margin of safety that most high PE stocks lack And each especially Apple has many strengths that few other companies even other large or megacap companies have For example Apples famous brand name is an asset that is so exceptional that it alone could be worth several PE points But Gilead markets products solely on their merits Doctors and payors evaluate each drug on its merits Since stocks represent a claim on current assets plus future EPS the stock action of AAPL lately is perplexing After all Simply tracking the consensus for AAPLs EPS on Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO Finance has been a good way to track the real underlying sentiment changes on AAPL shares All year as well as in H last year they have been improving Here are the numbers from the most recent day period This trend is strong on its own merits It is even stronger when compared with the same trends for close competitors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT The latter has seen estimates for the September quarter drop from cents to cents in the past days Just within the past seven days estimates for the FY ending in June have dropped from to These numbers are before this weeks announcement that Microsoft is writing off the rest of its Nokia acquisition cost plus a large restructuring charge GOOGL which emphasizes nonGAAP earnings is following the same trends down in its estimates for the current quarter year and all of next year as MSFT Yet AAPL is being valued as the value relatively low PE stock relative to MSFT and GOOGL AAPL which reports GAAP EPS is trading at a notably lower PE than GOOGLs heavilymassaged nonGAAP earnings per share Using GAAP for each stock AAPL is trading at about a PE discount to GOOGL A Benzinga article recently reported In the report Pacific Crest Securities noted We believe the majority of people earning a year or more in the world will own an iPhone exiting F There may be no way to verify this but just the thought of it should send alphaseeking investor hearts atwitter This is an extraordinarily valuable fact or near fact And given the momentum of the iPhone it is likely that this trend is gathering force not even topping and almost certainly not waning If a company owns the high end and its flagship product is seeing growing sales and in the iPhones case old iPhones stay in use a long time it usually receives a premium PE not a shrinking and discounted one In the same vein browserbased ie iOS vs Android spending is overwhelmingly Apple So whats the takeaway here Realistically it means that any ecommerce professional has to focus on Apples platforms as first priority because they will generate more business this way This dominance did not happen by accident It did not happen from faddish behavior It occurs one user at a time It happened for example because Apple outcompeted numerous seemingly untouchable giants in various sectors Apple recovering from its neardeath experience in the s had the vision to lash the iPod iTunes and Mac into one coherent and exciting group of products Added to that was the great risk of opening a chain of Apple retail stores and the ecosystem was born Takeaway point The Apple ecosystem existed before the iPhone which took the ecosystem to a new level Now that the iPhone is the key the fulcrum for the Apple ecosystem accelerating or at least growing sales of the iPhone mean that the ecosystem is growing rapidly When an existing iPhone owner trades in a year old iPhone that device goes to some other owner somewhere in the world unlike some Android phones that get junked So the Apple ecosystem keeps strengthening with a growing number of owners and these owners continue to have unprecedented levels of user satisfaction What that in turn means is that it does not matter all that much exactly what the pace of adoption of Apple Pay Apple Music or Apple Watch is Every iPhone owner is exposed to these options Most evaluate these services or newer devices to see how they fit with their use of the iPhone and other parts of the Apple ecosystem Sales of the Apple Watch are especially difficult to predict Its a useful adjunct to the iPhone but its costly We all know that a secondgeneration Apple Watch will arrive Many iPhone owners are going to check out the Apple Watch now that it is in stock I think that many are going to realize the convenience it provides and wait to buy next year if they feel they can wait or if finances indicate they really should wait The Apple ecosystem increasingly is the dominant and stickiest one amongst its peers as Microsoft is acknowledging Microsoft compares ecosystems and Apple is the winner From Geekwire on March reporting on a Microsoft presentation Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>are doing a better job of connecting their respective products with usage of one more naturally leading to usage of another Thats the key takeaway from this Microsoft chart which was shown by the companys top marketing executive Chris Capossela during a presentation this week at the Microsoft Convergence conference in Atlanta But it also shows you that we dont have nearly the connectivity between our products that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has engineered and that Apple has engineered This is giving Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>a marketing advantage he explained The size of the circles represents the numbers of users of that product or service Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>have the larger volume assets Apple has the largest profits and is extending its lead Over time the iPhone may shrink or be replaced by some other device but what counts is that the ecosystem as a whole becomes more profitable The stronger the web of the ecosystem the easier it is to find other nodes that bring in revenue This is the core Apple advantage pun intended Beyond the above parts of the ecosystem Apple is relentlessly squeezing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Search out of iOS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has few growth drivers left the European Union is angry at it and Internet advertising is becoming mature Microsoft meanwhile goes through rounds of employee layoffs It is being forced to forgo income on Windows by offering it as a free upgrade to Windows and users AppleInsider has an article out that drives home the point of Apples superior ecosystem development saying It has become cliche among Apples critics to refer to iTunes as a terrible product but the reality is that Apple has attracted million users to sign up for iTunes Store accounts with their credit cards Despite a series of flaws false starts like Ping and growing pains iTunes has become the worlds favorite way to spend money on media And the second place is quite a ways behind it Apple makes the effort of building new things look really easy think Apple Pay or Apple Watch but to really appreciate the accomplishment involved in efforts like iTunes and Apple Music take a brief look at its competitors That means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Music is a lot like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Wallet years ahead of Apple but so poorly planned and implemented that it completely squandered its vast head start Microsofts very different approach to music and video also failed for reasons that are useful to contrast against Apple Music and iTunes When iTunes first appeared Windows Media Player had been leveraging Microsofts near monopoly market position for a decade So while Microsoft was building solutions for its partners that didnt solve problems for consumers Apple was building a product for its customersend users who were premium hardware buyers that attracted the support of media partners and content creators In other words Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>had their chance to develop superior ecosystems They did not and Apple did and now that Apple ecosystem means that AAPL deserves a higher relative PE than MSFT or GOOGL than the market is giving it Over time AAPL may even receive a higher absolute PE than those other stocks Thats good enough to make AAPL eminently investable so long as one assumes that China is not going into permanent depression just because its stock market sold off after rising AAPL is even more enticing if it can grow beyond its current large niches which will mature one day and are subject to unending deflationary pressures Apple is poised to grow profitably and reasonably organically into even larger business segments building on its current expertise Apple going beyond the current ecosystem to the next level At this point the stories about an Apple Car have become so routine that I believe we can assume that the company is making a serious effort to develop one If so that in turn could suggest that Apple believes it has made or has licensed improved battery technology And if thats the case it has yet another large business that it could enter Continuing the chain of possibilities improved battery technology could help power Apples entry into one of the worlds probably great secular growth industries solar power generation and storage Other great companies have made leaps such as this GE NYSE GE began corporate life impressively in electric power generation and light bulbs but over time had numerous innovations in other fields There are no guarantees but Apple is doing the right thing in following the model of longterm successes such as GE in looking hard at how to grow into new large fields An Apple Car effort is qualitatively different from Microsoft getting into the home electronics business with XBox or Kinect or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>getting into device development It is much bigger It is something that Apple should be doing for the longterm benefit of shareholders even if as is reported it is creating some personnel issues at Apples existing divisions One basis of the lowerPE argument is that AAPL a device manufacturer subject to unpredictable consumer whims and ongoing deflationary pressures has a less stable and predictable earnings stream than software developers tied into business MSFT or advertising GOOG Ive never thought that was correct Apple after all does lots of software to go with its hardware And it is not valid even if it was accurate What counts is product quality and innovation and Apple has that over its major competitors To summarize the above aided by a focus on a growing ecosystem and rapid sales growth from hardware the iPod softwareservices iTunes and retail stores Apple cemented its ecosystem lead with the iPhone and iPad in and Now that Apple has gotten with the trend to do largerscreened iPhones its ecosystem lead over its major competitors is reaccelerating The EPS revision trends shown above are consistent with that premise being correct Lower PE stocks with rising EPS estimates tend to be outperformers as GILD and many other stocks tend to show All the concern about how the first iteration of the Apple Watch is doing and the fears that China will break badly amount to garbage in garbage out so far as giving AAPL an ultralow PE In fact Apple Pay and Apple Watch are the immediate leaders in their fields and set the quality standard Thus they strengthen the Apple ecosystem Their day will come To be clear Im not expressing a negative investment opinion on MSFT or GOOGL They are financial powerhouses that have leadership positions in growth parts of the US and global economy The key point relative to them is that AAPL appears to be seriously mispriced relative to them The path of least resistance for AAPL is higher for this reason and for several other
