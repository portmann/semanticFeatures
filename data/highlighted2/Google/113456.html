They did not, and Apple did, and now that Apple ecosystem means that AAPL deserves a higher relative P/E than MSFT or GOOGL than the market is giving it.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Over time, AAPL may even receive a higher absolute P/E than those other stocks. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That's good enough to make AAPL eminently investable, so long as one assumes that China is not going into permanent depression just because its stock market sold off after rising 150%. (Uncertainty) </span>AAPL is even more enticing if it can grow beyond its current (large) niches, which will mature one day and are subject to unending deflationary pressures.Apple is poised to grow profitably and reasonably organically into even larger business segments, building on its current expertise.Apple - going beyond the current ecosystem to the next level?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At this point, the stories about an Apple Car have become so routine that I believe we can assume that the company is making a serious effort to develop one. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If so, that in turn could suggest that Apple believes it has made, or has licensed, improved battery technology. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And if that's the case, it has yet another large business that it could enter. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Continuing the chain of possibilities, improved battery technology could help power Apple's entry into one of the world's probably great secular growth industries, solar power generation - and storage. (Uncertainty) </span>Other great companies have made leaps such as this.GE (NYSE: GE ) began corporate life impressively in electric power generation and light bulbs, but over time had numerous innovations in other fields.There are no guarantees, but Apple is doing the right thing in following the model of long-term successes such as GE in looking hard at how to grow into new large fields.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>An Apple Car effort is qualitatively different from Microsoft getting into the home electronics business with X-Box or Kinect , or <b>Google</b> getting into device development . (Google: Uncertainty) </span>It is much bigger.It is something that Apple should be doing for the long-term benefit of shareholders, even if as is reported, it is creating some personnel issues at Apple's existing divisions.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One basis of the lower-P/E argument is that AAPL, a device manufacturer subject to unpredictable consumer whims and ongoing deflationary pressures, has a less stable and predictable earnings stream than software developers tied into business ( MSFT ) or advertising ( GOOG ). (Uncertainty) </span>I've never thought that was correct.Apple after all does lots of software to go with its hardware.And it is not valid even if it was accurate.What counts is product quality and innovation, and Apple has that over its major competitors.To summarize the above, aided by a focus on a growing ecosystem and rapid sales growth from hardware (the iPod), software/services (iTunes) and retail stores, Apple cemented its ecosystem lead with the iPhone and iPad in 2007 and 2010.Now that Apple has gotten with the trend to do larger-screened iPhones, its ecosystem lead over its major competitors is re-accelerating.The EPS revision trends shown above are consistent with that premise being correct.Lower P/E stocks with rising EPS estimates tend to be outperformers, as GILD and many other stocks tend to show.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>All the concern about how the first iteration of the Apple Watch is doing and the fears that China will break badly amount to garbage in - garbage out so far as giving AAPL an ultra-low P/E. (Uncertainty) </span>In fact, Apple Pay and Apple Watch are the immediate leaders in their fields and set the quality standard.Thus they strengthen the Apple ecosystem.Their day will come.To be clear, I'm not expressing a negative investment opinion on MSFT or GOOGL.They are financial powerhouses that have leadership positions in growth parts of the US and global economy.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The key point relative to them is that AAPL appears to be seriously mispriced relative to them. (Uncertainty) </span>The path of least resistance for AAPL is higher for this reason and for several other reasons.Source: Apple: Lots Of Smoke (FUD), But What's On Fire Are Earnings And Growth Opportunities Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, GILD.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: Not investment advice.I am not an investment adviser.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
