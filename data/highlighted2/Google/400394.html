class='textDiv'>Apple And Googles Next Big Thing Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Its no secret that Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>are developing autonomous cars But its not the simplicity efficiency pleasure safety or costsavings of the autonomous automotive experience in which they are interested People spend a lot of time in their cars and particularly driving their cars And everyone knows time is money Apple NASDAQ AAPL and GoogleAlphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL want to take control of that time By freeing up driving and related passenger tasks like navigating and looking around for landmarks these companies hope to gain access to your eyes ears and wallets Think about how much value there is in online mobile entertainment and websurfing activities like accessing iTunes viewing YouTube and watching TV shows for everyone in the car Not just the kids on a family trip solo drivers too Targeted ads associated with specific people like Facebook NASDAQ FB provides built on specific preferences but now also combined with travel data like moving location correlated with the time of day This is very very valuable to certain industries An automotive data bank would be a useful tool for advertisers it could hold both your travel history and your travel plans This would provide a glimpse into your future thereby enabling the provision of narrowly targeted ads as you go on your way How much will McDonalds NYSE MCD be willing to pay to push out an ad to a traveling family between amnoon on a highway in the vicinity of one of their restaurants especially if someone in the family is known to like to eat there Yes theyll know its a family traveling based on the types of electronic interactions in the vehicle or even some builtin car diagnostics They could identify ages sexes and weights from this data and signins If they know whos specifically in the car theyll already know everyones meal preferences and if they dont they can make demographicbased estimates Highly tailored ads to traveling carloads So how much time are we talking about For this estimate Ill assume autonomous car travel is equivalent to humandriver travel time What could be different Well will autonomous cars be allowed to speed Will they be required to come to a complete stop at stop signs and lights Both of these factors could increase travel time On the other hand automated traffic flow optimization might reduce travel times in congested areas so maybe its a wash overall Okay back to the estimate On average American drivers over the age of travel for minutes per day With million drivers the total onroad travel time is million hours Now thats a lot of cumulative time but the spans arent always very long But theyre ideal for short video content like YouTube and some TV shows music videos etc Im sure perfectlength original content will be developed by the likes of Apple Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA Netflix NASDAQ NFLX etc to fill these time slots With a hour perperson average time on connected devices the extra road hours adds about to the potential total device time usage For the following estimates Ill utilize current corporate revenues to assess the impact of the additional travel time access Apple makes about Byear on B iOS devices for services which includes iTunes and the App Store That averages out to device per year Ive seen as high as device in the US but Ill stick with the lower value for my estimate here If we assume sales are proportional to time that translates into device per year or Byear If we just consider the US thats maybe half of total sales and would come in around B This is of Apples B revenue a drop in the bucket in comparison Even at double my estimate the value of the extra automobile time is just of revenue This result highlights the need for Apple to either greatly enhance their service offerings or have their devices built in to get a significant bottomline impact from the autonomous vehicle market On to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Googles B annual revenue comes nearly entirely in the form of online service value such as ads and apps Consequently the increased car usage time assuming its also proportional to sales implies a B increase in revenue If roughly half of that is US my estimate is around B annually Thats of Googles revenue a meaningful amount Knowing that of Googles revenue comes from advertising we can check this estimate using ad impressions per hour Using two different methods Ive estimated that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>can get impressionshour which seems reasonable Something less than impressionminute depending on what youre doing Assuming an average cost of per impressions puts the market value of the travel time at over B annually The actual value is probably higher based on the reasoning I provided earlier being some multiple of this Nevertheless this result agrees with my prior estimate On an absolute basis the time value of the autonomous car market is at least x more valuable to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>than it is for Apple On a percent of revenue basis its at least x more valuable to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>As things stand now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>will benefit much more significantly from autonomous cars than Apple These results are likely the reason <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is openly and aggressively pursuing autonomous vehicle development as it works to expand into new markets Another positive is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>can benefit from any autonomous vehicle implementation even if its Apple supplied Apple on the other hand appears to be stuck needing to get their devices integrated within autonomous cars to generate impactful revenue unless they come up with an associated service value driver To conclude lets think about the future In when you first testride an autonomous car take a look at the electronics layout around you its integration and how it calls for your attention Then when you forget about being too scared to stop looking out the window youll relax and start acting like youre in your own living room Youll be enamored by the convenience and experience at your hands Not tethered to a steering wheel but instead to an integrated electronic device that engages you during your trip Thats when you should start paying attention to the commercial aspect of it all Sure its a good thing but its not entirely about you its about surrounding companies your wallet and your time Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google
