success continues with its multiyear winning streak with another series of topbottom line beats coupled with strongerthanexpected revenue guidance in the face of extremely bearish sentiment and market conditions Management emphasizes abundant IoTrelated revenue opportunities across not only the US but also China as well further hedging its Apple dependency by establishing strong relationships with fastgrowing Chinese OEMs Huawei has grown unit sales over YY quickly stealing market share with of the geographic footprint presenting future issues for Apple while Skyworks remains hedged against current competitive Chinese revenue contribution grew YY with rapidly evolving IoT opportunities and LTE expansion worldclass integrated connectivity solutions will be required at the system level leaving SWKS perfectly positioned The outdated misrepresenting price sensitivity to Apple may continue in the medium term to pressure the stock but various growth opportunities will eventually change the markets perception of Skyworks Apple Skyworks Solutions NASDAQ SWKS has delivered yet another strong earnings report reflecting continued growth both on the top and bottom line coupled with soft but betterthanexpected forward guidance relatively speaking in the face of the worst cyclical downturn for semiconductors in at least half a decade The new year brought even more pain with an YTD price drop of over leaving the company down a miserable from its alltime high of back in June The ecosystem of Apple NASDAQ AAPL suppliers have had their market values in many cases cut almost in half over the last six months after experiencing massive multiyear growth with firms like SWKS tripling from until sentiment reversed in June In turn it has resulted in massive amounts of financial resources to expand product lines lease and build additional fabrication space hire top talent to retain a worldclass reputation for their solutions as well as expanding into new markets across the IoT space As hardware innovation progresses so does the need for more complex integrated solutions in the RF space as the demand on bandwidth continues to provide plenty of growth potential for worldclass suppliers like SWKS which focus on integrated solutions rather than discrete components Unfortunately regardless of how many bullish catalysts exist or subsequent positive results SWKS produces Mr Market is having a serious semiconductor indigestion resulting from slowing iPhone unit sales Guilty by Apple Association accurately reflects the behavior and relationship between the stock price of SWKS with respect to Apple along with similar weakness battering other marquee members of the supply chain ecosystem such as Broadcom Limited NASDAQ AVGO and NXP Semiconductor NASDAQ NXPI Regardless of size various niche markets outside of Apple logistical resources past financial performance or the percent of revenue solely dependent on iPhone sales Apples stock price is often swayed by investors trying to use supplier numbers to estimate product growth not to mention associated upgrades for new features in upcoming cycles The ecosystem of suppliers in turn trade like leveraged Apple derivatives instead of standalone companies This effect is usually much stronger during periods of extreme sentiment with the market correcting the divergences once those periods calm down or find balance Despite strong overall multiyear growth including YY growth in earnings of the performance of SWKSs stock price has been nothing short of frustrating This is a function and combination of negative sentiment related to slowing iPhone sales fears of a saturated global smartphone market and an unpredictablecontracting Chinese economy In return the market places heavy emphasis trying to predict iPhone sales through the guidance and performance of players like SWKS ignoring each firms true exposure and ability to manage that portion of their revenue stream If Apple makes up of SWKSs revenue does a potential decline in iPhone sales really warrant an almost drawdown measuring from week high to week low Five years ago there may have been a stronger case when SWKS had less than half the current OEMs half the revenue and mobile opportunities were the only real growth driver The SWKS of today is one of the most financiallysound firms in the sector with strong barriers to entry and an extremely diversified portfolio of customers This is a direct result of the companys marquee integrated RF solutions at the system level that can meet extremely complex and dynamic customer designs A cash position relative to its total assets ROA with ZERO debt ROE while cutting its iPhone dependence in half over the last three years from to through pure organic growth and significantly expanded margins in the process reinforce the perspective that SWKS should command a much higher earnings multiple to reflect strong barriers to entry solid growth in RF component demand and continued growth even while others suffer under the circumstances Ultimately SWKSs long history of solid results excellent management worldclass products and its wide spectrum of different clients not only in mobile but also its growing presence across various IoTrelated niche markets will balance any potential longerterm weakness in iPhone sales through strong client diversity in China essentially playing both sides of the market while maintaining premium design wins in the next generation of the iPhone and Galaxy lines With all that in mind we will see in the below analysis how this divergence caused by a variety of factors one mainly being an outdated correlation to Apple is really an opportunity for the right type of investor while also observing forward guidance and the increased betadriven risks investors face in todays new market environment I maintain a BUY rating with an adjusted mo price target of a potential upside reflecting my position on the unfair systemic riskrelated discount applied to what are historically low earnings multiples x ttm which clearly are irrespective of anticipated multiyear doubledigit runrates at the top and bottom line not to mention a spotless balance sheet affording them tremendous financial flexibility to adjust as the competitive environment evolves Since Skyworks is a company I frequently write about on SA I will refer the reader to a supplementary article that focuses on a variety of important items when considering SWKS as an investment Skyworks Solutions The Secret Sauce To Its Success discusses what I believe are most of the core qualitative strengths and unique management strategy that has driven immense shareholder value for the longterm investor even though the recent secular decline has left many who came late to the party deep underwater Patience and conviction are required to stay the course and ride out what will down the road prove to be a prudent move The following are just a fraction of the key items I have repeated throughout my coverage that make SWKS worth consideration for investors Previously Covered Positive Catalysts Topoftheline technology and fabrication capabilities Worldclass logistical system and efficient midteen tax rate Integrated solutions as opposed to discrete components Diversification of revenue as well as balanced and diverse OEM portfolio Close relationship at the design stage with many OEMs Strong barriers to entry established through years of market share growth Besides Apple Huawei and Samsung OTCSSNLF among many all use SWKS Diversification integration and financial discipline would be my three key descriptions in terms of strategy for CEO David Aldrich It was only just a few months ago that the market had priced SWKS as a bestinclass solutions provider with multiples on its earnings far higher than they are today The justification for the praise continues as the company executes through tough waters treading waves of bearish secular sentiment and cyclical factors surrounding important end markets with strong results When you have a broad selloff there is little you can do especially in higher beta sectors such as technology Expectations of a prolonged secular weakness are heavily priced in the stock after breaching the previous week low multiple times this year currently This type of decline is being seen across the board in the sector and amplified as iPhone worries reached a peak when suppliers Qorvo NASDAQ QRVO and Cirrus Logic NASDAQ CRUS came out with early revenue warnings confirming much speculated potential YY weakness in iPhone sales in general SWKS on the other hand had already let investors know of the headwinds it was anticipating in its Q CC Even with some weakness YY was to be expected after Q Mr Aldrich assured that growth in other areas of the firm would sufficiently balance aboveaverage seasonal weakness related to Apple Lets see how those promises turned out NonGAAP Net Income million YY The impact of the million received as a termination fee making YY comparisons a bit skewed for the quarter GAAP net income came in at million which represents on a GAAP basis a YY increase of We can see from the above reconciliation the termination resulting from the failed acquisition attempt of PMCSierra NASDAQ PMCS provided a onetime breakup fee of million representing an additional to nonGAAP EPS if one were to add it back to the reported figure Since there was a real economic benefit in cash paid I believe keeping this additional amount of benefit in consideration without using it in any comparisons or price estimates is worth noting because it is rare when adj EPS for a quarter is less than GAAP reported EPS which makes comparisons with consistency requiring more judgment For our price targets PT we will be using since this was a onetime event but for the purpose of evaluating the FULL economic benefits received and bringing to the attention of investors that SWKS received a cash payment equal to of adj net income this quarter I included the above chart The immense growth in EPS YY with or without the termination fee is extremely impressive Furthermore if this chart were to be extended you would see the average adj PE multiple is somewhere around over the last three years with a rather wide dispersion March was the peak at nearly x now trading at just above x current EPS without including the massive billion cash balance which would lower this figure even more when taken into consideration ie ex cash For the March quarter SWKS expects million in revenue and in adjusted EPS On the revenue side that comes in just slightly above last years Q revenue of million while adj EPS is expected to grow YY thanks to an expected Bps increase in GM over the same time For all the noise the billions in market cap lost the endless selling and pessimistic outlook referring to SWKS as significantly dependent on the iPhone the company manages to come in with very respectable forward guidance Lets remember SWKS has a tendency to beat and even if it does slightly that will make a significant difference Flat revenue growth still will yield at worst an increase in earnings while inventory channels clear and the world turns its attention to the iPhone I expect EPS growth for the full year to land somewhere between and with revenue growth in the mid to upperteen level Commenced steady volume shipments of telematics solutions at Volkswagen AG OTCPKVLKAY Secured first mass production of vehicletovehicle communications sockets at General Motors NYSE GM Supported <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Chromecast and Roku settop boxes for streaming applications Ramped microcell radio subsystems at a leading infrastructure OEM Launched IP security camera solutions at Nest Powered Huaweis Mate flagship LTE platform Enabled the DJI Phantom drone with a suite of semiconductors Captured key smart fitness watch design wins at Fitbit NYSE FIT There is no denying the companys strategy of expanding into a variety of different niche markets specifically smart home technology the connected car wearables such as Fitbit drones and even some defense applications is just the beginning stage precluding a shift in revenue mix that should over time be less reliant on mobile and even less reliant specifically on the iPhone The above design wins with leaders in their respective niches are a testimony to SWKS and the integration capabilities its product lines offer OEMs By getting involved with OEMs early in the design stage SWKS continues to execute its strategy of building barriers to entry very few competitors if any in most cases can penetrate In addition to the above last month Business Wire highlighted the expansion of SWKSs marquee SkyLiTE suite of frontend solutions for LTE devices I advise readers to take a quick look at the article which also highlights a couple very bullish estimates with respect to the total addressable market for IoTrelated connected devices Here are three figures worth noting The total number of connected devices is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of to one billion connections by Automotive market will see million cars shipped by with connectivity up from million today LTE will represent nearly of all mobile devices in up dramatically from in as China and EMs continue to expand These figures above highlight the gigantic Broad Market applications and opportunities that fit directly into SWKSs core strengths reinforcing its strategic evolution as a company with respect to its overall business model In addition to the above design wins and business updates from the press release below are some key points from the latest earnings call Huawei and Xiaomi Private XI saw accelerated growth as revenue consolidation begins to occur as toptier Chinese OEMs continue to gain market share of China still on G transition to G leading to YY growth in Chineserelated revenue despite the broad economic contraction TCSAW integrated capabilities are considered bestinclass even in the face of Qualcomms NASDAQ QCOM new venture competing in the RF space SWKS has one very impressive book of business with the worlds top OEMs in its respective markets and a variety of other players that make up a large majority of all mobile devices sold in the world A very important item to keep in mind is back in the US and Europe were largely the only viable smartphone markets leaving China and the rest of the world playing catch up in turn fueling much of todays growth as the US becomes even more saturated evident by flat YY US sales for Apple When investors consider that now a strong portion of Chinese citizens will also fuel IoTrelated growth the combination with expanding G LTE availability is a serious growth driver that potentially will drive years of growth for SWKS as it continues to be a global leader in the space of all things connectivity In an article by Reuters we got a look into how powerful of a client Huawei is for SWKS China makes up of SWKSs sales and Huawei has become a serious competitor for Apple growing unit sales to over million which represents a whopping increase of YY and roughly of the global market compared to AAPLs share of This is absolutely crucial to the basis of our thesis as we point out the immense opportunities in both mobile and IoT in China not just the USA and EU as well as India down the road As Apple faces its own companyspecific competitive growth issues while companies like Huawei are clocking in massive gains SWKS providing content for both OEMs allows it to hedge out a significant amount of individual product risk We see how revenue diversity for Skyworks is working in a harmonious fashion as major customers face intense heat while other customers face intense growth After months of speculation built up drama the usually emotional bipolar views heated investor debates about the future ability of Apple to sustain growth and the overall life cycle of the global smart phone market AAPL finally reported results on with a mixed bag of outcomes that only further stirs the pot in this often emotionallydriven complexfornoreason investment outlook For the sake of brevity I will assume everyone on the planet knows Apple so I will be brief with my overview of its results and focus more on how they will affect SWKS As we can see inventory sequentially hasnt changed in total Instead a more than drop in raw materials about drop in workinprocess and a increase in finished goods represent a builtup backlog with production runs significantly lower making less chips to clear inventory and meet lowered demand which in turn impact the top line Mr Aldrich repeated that this should clear by the crucial back half of the year as Apple will be entering most likely its iPhone cycle Thanks to worldclass logistics capabilities and very deep market insight SWKS is able to effectively manage its inventory without letting the total figure grow much larger on the balance sheet As expected Apple met its Q guidance but at the same time finally had to admit that rumors of slowing iPhone sales were true especially mid cycle into Q guiding toward the worst quarter on a YY basis since the iPhone release The drop from best to worst quarters exhibits why so many pundits are pointing at a potential longterm top in growth for the company Since smartphone sales globally are expected to still grow in the midsingle digits Apple will have a low hurdle in terms of expectations and the room to surprise to the upside by just coming in slightly higher than expected is also a good thing for SWKS If the company manages to show the slightest bit of YY growth I expect once again the saga to make another zag in sentiment iPhone revenue of total revenue YY to billion billion total revenue YY iPhone units up fractionally to a record million Services iTunesApp Store Apple Music Apple Pay AppleCare to billion Other products Apple Watch iPod Beats Apple TV peripherals to billion China grew YY constant currency India YY albeit small but growing quickly large upside potential March quarter first ever YY drop in revenue expected since the release of the first iPhone million devices expected Revenue drop next quarter could be up to So here is where the analysis comes together and paints a much different picture than how the market has treated SWKS Thanks to Statista above we have a detailed breakdown of the global smartphone market by OEM Since this article isnt focused necessarily on individual OEM success but rather how how much will a decline in iPhone sales potentially impact SWKS and how Skyworks has cast such a wide net that Apple has become a lot less significant compared to the last cyclical downturn in I elected to focus on where we stand today Above we see that SWKS has components that span across over of the global market with most likely a fair share of RF content in the others categories as well This balance with expected total growth globally still expected on a fullyear basis Apple can continue on a path to slower growth while SWKS can in turn easily find a way to make up the difference Most likely AAPL would need to lose in the Chinese market to local makers thus lost Apple revenue being paid out of the competitions success Without having to even bust out a calculator one can easily see that as long as smartphone sales meet their expected midsingledigit expected growth rate for the year double the growth rate for LTE enabled smartphone revenue then SWKS will not only continue to grow but also it may end up benefiting in some ways from slowing iPhone sales especially when considering the kind of growth we just saw out of Huawei and China Risks In a Competitive Environment for RF Components SWKS produces worldclass TCSAW filters years ahead of the competition in terms of integrated system level capabilities Its chips ensure the highest quality connectivity in a world where increasing bandwidth due to streaming music and all the other functions we perform with our smartphones is rapidly driving filter complexity For this reason regardless of future price competition that may drive hardware ASPs down and force OEMs to make manufacturing decisions RF components are most likely going to hold their value Why would a firm sacrifice the quality of your connection thus hindering the performance of the mobile device especially when the cost is generally very low compared to say a processor In a fiercely competitive and maturing market not only SWKS but competitors like AVGO are forecasting steady doubledigit growth in RF dollar content per device as bandwidth demand continues to drive the need for the most integrated and highestquality components This ensures continued design wins from Apple which despite a potential peak in iPhone sales will continue to move massive amounts of units The same theory in terms of design holds true for Huawei and other Chinese OEMs which are converting G customers to G LTE by the droves as we saw in their most recent results and many times beating Samsung and Apple by meeting a very fine line between expected functionality and retail price QCOM for years has been trying to meaningfully enter the space and recently announced a JV with Japans TDK OTCPKTTDKY to begin producing integrated frontend modules and RF filters which is a testament to the continued expected growth in the space Personally I am not worried as I dont believe OEMs will want to add further content space to QCOM diluting the competition and providing Qualcomm with too much negotiation leverage at the table SWKSs management also claims QCOM wont nearly be able to match the quality that Skyworks produces at the system level in time before it comes up with its nextgeneration chip Mr Aldrich had these answers to questions from the conference call Question But could you just refresh our memory before the JV was announced were you seeing Qualcomm in any of the competitions for any of the RF in any of the major players I know theyve been doing RF for like three years now And so I just want to get kind of a snapshot before we lose our minds on the JV on what was going on with Qualcomm and before then Answer TDK and Qualcomm have been working closely together and fielding designs for a long time Weve competed very successfully against those designs So there hasnt been a lot of traction in the sweet spot of what we do There have been other RF components of that system in which we dont compete where theyve had success But these decades of gallium arsenide performance and driving switch technologies and multichip module technology and beginning to put our own highperformance filters has really given us a systemlevel performance that has not been easy for competition to replicate We know TDK very well Weve used them in the past in mostly SAW Theyve got some limited capability in BAW But remember I think as your question alluded to our customers are wanting business based purely on performance and on configurability and what it does at the system level And we have a clear advantage at the system level over anybody Weve not seen the combination of Qualcomm TDK to be any meaningful threat over the last three years So there you have it folks since Mr Aldrich can say it better than I can he laid out the likely result of QCOMs move at least in terms of disrupting SWKS What this may do is result in an attempt down the road to flat out acquire SWKS since QCOM cant seem to do anything right these days Personally I feel SWKS is preparing for another go at an acquisition In a future article I will discuss various competitors I feel are up for grabs and can add significant accretive earnings while helping further cement the strong barriers to entry that Skyworks has created around its integrated solutions in the connectivity space My gut feeling comes from SWKSs lack of buybacks this quarter after repurchasing above its FCF payout target last quarter I criticized the move as I believe growth companies like SWKS should be using cash instead of paying it out in order to keep the moats around their business somewhat deep Well this quarter SWKS avoided buybacks while management had this to say about future MA and the lack of buybacks at such low levels We didnt do any buybacks this quarter I mean we also balance it about whats going on in potential MA activity what were looking at and those things And bottom line is that will continue to do So stay tuned I think its safe to say SWKS realizes that its squeaky clean balance sheet while a great item for value investors is viewed as underutilizing your resources in the tech world Returning value to shareholders is important but after heavierthanguided buybacks at the end of Q SWKS may be shopping and it couldnt be doing so at a better time with many targets trading at discounts if otherwise at these levels SWKS would have been buying back stock hand over fist A sizeable acquisition for Skyworks after missing out on PMCS would make it more difficult for QCOM or any other player to then come in and buy SWKS out We are looking at a company with a solid fiveyear outlook investors dont need to be bought out at this point to earn a healthy return on their investment but the possibility always remains the case at least until SWKS makes a move that leverages its financial resources Weve Seen This Before Remember Semiconductor stocks are notoriously cyclical so as one would guess this isnt the first time SWKS has experienced this kind of pain There is no question that the companys investors have taken significant hits with their hopes getting smashed after both quarters after delivering their usual top and bottom line beats staying the course of a near perfect multiyear report record In this article we discussed why there are so many different factors that will dictate the future success of SWKS that are not directly related to the iPhone If someone were to look at a chart of SWKS from to they would notice a very similar looking chart as the one from present If historic data has any relevant significance and if cyclical businesses ever actually go through cycles then the above chart certainly paints a pretty clear picture for us in terms of expectations SWKS has been through this exact same type of cycle for different reasons of course no time to get into the details of each time period but nevertheless came out the other side twice as strong Both cycles have max drawdowns of around from their respective highs and also collapsed after strong multiyear runs where the value of SWKS more than tripled each time in the bullish phase of the cycle only to see them significantly pull back around the same time we saw significant weakness across global equities seem familiar After its acquisition of SiGe whose frontend RF Module technology became the stepping stone upon which SWKS built its topoftheline integrated solutions platform it was off to the races gaining one design win after another leveraging the explosion of the smartphone world With some hints that a future acquisition could be in the works for SWKS I would expect it to leverage whatever technology it can to ensure it has the same success in the IoT space as it has had with mobile RF solutions Deja vu to come I think so after surviving this long and growing in value from over x your dollar its good to know statistics are on your side Based on a comparison of the two time periods it looks like SWKS has a downside that can reach about a share already reached just a couple weeks ago I believe the majority of pain has already been significantly priced into the stock with the remaining downside just a function of market mechanics Due to the powerful combination of a growing dividendpaying stock with a market cap exceeding billion a member of the SP index and valuation metrics that would certainly put it in the value category alongside growth characteristics that also paint a robust fiveyear outlook it is on a lot of trading desk radars To say the least it is a fit for a variety of fund strategies both index and managed and as a result I am sure a lot of the downside we have experienced is partly due to a short float mutual fund and hedge fund liquidity as well as an easy shortterm target to ride as markets show no sign of stability As many say this too shall pass leaving investors at these levels with a solid riskreward ratio and immense upside potential for undertaking a rather volatile and a bit risky shortterm outlook If prudent investors buy in increments and exhibit patience both in terms of buying and in terms of holding then chances are in the long run youll be rewarded generously To arrive at my price target I apply the midpoint of my bottomline growth expectations to annualized adj EPS of and arrive at by this time next year At a conservative x multiple you arrive at the midpoint of my price target by end of Q At its alltime high the company trading at x earnings and now at its lowest point roughly x so a slight expansion in the earnings multiple and PEG ratio significantly under somewhere close to I believe a new longterm average PE of x earnings is very achievable when market conditions improve especially in the last quarter of the fiscal year September Since market conditions in my opinion will remain choppy at best with a fullyear personal estimate of at best midsingledigit growth for the SP I am keeping my estimates rather conservative anticipating an earnings multiple of x with an expected growth rate of on the bottom line I expect earnings multiples to remain weak unless there is a change in market sentiment With all that in consideration I reiterate my Buy recommendation with a oneyear price target of I anticipate the back half of the year to show continued strength resulting from the various catalysts discussed throughout the article Caution should be used in determining if the nature of SWKS as a company suits your investment profile With volatility potential disruption outoffavor sentiment the ride wont be smooth back to redemption and isnt considered a low risk investment Investors need to have a very longterm outlook past the current weakness that will at some point reverse Where SWKS trades will largely be a function of the overall markets performance sentiment related to the iPhone cycle and executing on its growth initiatives in the IoT space while expanding G LTE customer bases globally With out of analysts giving it a Buy recommendation and average price target of according to TipRanks a decline since my last report from an average of in November it seems that the majority of Wall Street including most recently Goldman Sachs NYSE GS maintain a Buy Rating on the stock The below says it all as we see SWKS has been on nothing but a steady decline with widening gaps between moving averages while also making newer and newer lows for the year There is no shortage of shortterm selling pressure and it doesnt look like it is going to reverse overnight Instead I believe we will see a choppy recovery over the course of the year resembling closely the recovery seen post where a similar cyclical downturn cut SWKS in half over the course of a year more to come on past cycles So far the price has bounced off the support level after making an attempt to recover now that the market has seen the latest earnings report and guidance To be fair the likelihood it recovers quickly without the overall market making a miracle reversal is very low The above downward trending price channel is pure testimony to the associated sentiment related to both micro and macro specific factors which in turn also have a significant influence on indexes including the SP Technology is trending downwards overall markets are trading one day gains for three days of losses and the fundamental global macro concerns are all indicating pain It takes courage and conviction in your core thesis the fundamentals of the company your belief in management capabilities and the longterm outlook for its growth story in order to stick with a difficult investment Watching long periods of price deterioration wondering if the markets will ever turn is where good investors make their bread and butter Good news is if you believe that markets eventually get it right semi efficient then right now the above chart is nothing more than a great company with solid fundamentals trading at significant discounts to historical levels Theres no question market conditions these days are downright brutal There are very few places to find safe growth My basic underlying thesis stated that the correlation between SWKS and Apple is overrepresented in the price when taking into account the abundance of different positive catalysts SWKS continues to show quarter after quarter outside of iPhonerelated revenue Yes if Apple were to end their relationship with SWKS it would have a devastating impact but not fatal SWKS isnt as Apple dependent as the price reflects but yet it continues to trade like the future is solely based on AAPLs overall success especially related to the number of iPhone units sold when in reality its diverse customer base allows it to make money either way and LTE expansion couldnt be healthier By covering such a large portion of available OEMs SWKS not only has a deep understanding of the competitive environment but also the necessary technology and abundant resources to further develop breakthrough solutions It is very important SWKS maintains design wins across as many segments as possible and in addition to which should be done through MA especially with its balance sheet and a low rate environment The future looks bright behind the clouds from my perspective as I solely focus on results and my personal interpretation of managements strategy and overall success in its market I maintain my buy rating and suggest investors consider options as way to hedge There are many different strategies from covered calls to buying or selling puts as a way to hedge or take advantage of temporary downside weakness The bottom line is that regardless of the prolonged weakness in the sector semiconductor companies are the backbone of our entire future We see where technology is heading and there is a chip for everything that needs to be done especially chips that connect things At the end of the day SWKS remains a fundamentally sound example of a great company with solid results reflecting strong current and future growth potential suffering from bad association syndrome in return creating opportunity for those who understand the trends of the future Bravo To Avago Solid Q Results GameChanging Merger and Key Insights Into Other Companies NXP
