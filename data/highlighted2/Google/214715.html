more before the stock hits my fair value I recently wrote an article on my opinion of Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT as a DGI This was before the Q results It provided a detailed overview of all things Microsoft If you are a new investor looking to buy shares of the company I would recommend starting there I determined that the shares were worth roughly I got a lot of feedback in the comment section for the article and the Q reporting details and I wanted to provide an update There are going to be a lot of news outlets and other writers here on SA who can provide you with a writeup on the various aspects of yearoveryear performance in various categories of the business as defined by Microsoft and reporting in Q earnings I will let you read those if you want to know about Q What I am more concerned about is a core question that any investor should ask relative to the company that he or she is invested in or is considering investing in How does company X make money Microsoft is interesting because we all like to point out areas of success and failure that we know and that we are comfortable with without noting where all the money comes from each quarter What is a little harder is taking the step back and trying to learn about the things that we do not see everyday That is the area that is key to Microsoft We all know about Xbox We know about the failure of Windows phone The Surface has been huge recently Taking a step back do those products even matter to the future success of Microsoft at growing EPS That is what I want to answer in this article Before we dig into how Microsoft makes money we have to do a little refresher on the changes going on at the company and its recognition of revenue This is going to be the boring part of the article and I want to remind folks that I am not a CPA Microsoft is transitioning both Office and Windows products and their respective revenues to a service logic Historically a consumer or business would buy a license for OfficeWindows for in year Q That would be recorded in the quarter that it was earned The consumer would use the product from year Q and year Q and Microsoft would not recognize revenue from it That is how accounting works when you sell a product When you sell a service things are a bit different Instead of accepting in year you spread out that revenue over multiple years Microsoft estimates the life of the service and spreads revenue over that life If the estimate were over years then the company would account revenue as in year with a line item of unrealized revenue of The next year it recognizes more and reduces the Service Revenue Unrealized Source April Financial Analyst Briefing Why is this important If you look at what happens in year revenue in a product model is and in a service model it is only When you are comparing yearoveryear numbers you will think that revenue declined by When in actuality the revenue is the same it is just being accounted for differently This does have the advantage of smoothing out earnings over time No longer will you see a onetime bump in revenue from a new launch of Office or Windows Instead you will see a nice smooth level of revenue each quarter that will subtly move around with each additional subscriber As customers transition from product ownership to services you will see revenue recorded a bit differently at Microsoft For confusion the company reports the revenue in different categories just to add to the fun Also think of it in terms of what this does for the sales team Which would you rather spend year or upfront The lower price point gets you in the door of the CIO a lot easier than a multimillion dollar cost upgrade for the latest version of Excel The value proposition of a subscription model is a little more attractive lower cost upfront and always uptodate software It takes one more decision off the table So Where Do Microsofts Earnings Come From Now that the account fun is over lets dig into the meat of the article Microsoft breaks down its revenue in various categories for investors understanding There are a total of categories that it uses in each quarterlyannual report Here is what the breakdown looks like for margin dollars from to This is done very specifically without category labels or value lines The thing that is important to remember is to focus on only what matters most If this were your business would spend the time looking at Group If someone told you revenue was down in Group would you care Should you care My thinking is that you should not Instead lets spend of our time understanding the drivers of the big categories of earnings When you look at revenue this way there are two categories that stick out hopefully I might have also given you a hint from the way that I laid out the chart Group and Group are where Microsoft makes the majority of its money In fact in those two accounted for almost of earnings In previous years it was more was was Now we are seeing a trend The only other thing I would note is that you see a spike happening in Group It has gone from of Microsoft earnings in to in That is important when we look at what these three groups are made up of It is also important to remember the section above on accounting I mentioned that the company reports service revenue in a different category from product revenue This is some of the goofiness that happens from that Commercial Licensing This is Office Windows on a volume licensing agreement to Businesses Governments Universities etc Devices and Consumer Licensing This is licensing for computers that are not on volume purchases This is where revenue hits when you walk into Best Buy and purchase a Windows desktop computer Commercial Other Commercial is broken down in Licensing and Other This is all other revenue that comes from nonconsumer business customers This includes the growth areas that we as investors want to watch This is Commercial Cloud This is Commercial Office Group Commercial Licensing Group Commercial Other I am going to lump Group and Group together This makes up Commercial reporting As mentioned above Group is volume licensing of Windows Office and other corporate purchases Group is anything else that is sold to corporations most importantly for comparison Commercial Office I point this out because you see a little dip in Group and a spike in Group If you remember from the accounting section above I mentioned that Microsoft reports Product Sales and Service Sales in different categories Historically Commercial Office Product sales would be part of Group Going forward Commercial Office Service sales are in Group Looking at these two groups together makes sense when comparing longer trends So why focus on this group This is the big dog in the fight What happens in this category is what directly impacts the performance of Microsoft more than any of the other categories It is also the piece that is under attack When you and I go out and walk into a Best Buy to buy a desktop computer sounds antiquated to think of people actually walking into a store to buy a PC or order one from the HP NYSE HPQ website the revenue Microsoft receives falls here What do we know about Group People are not buying as many PCs Shipments are down OEMs are working hard to create new devices but it is not getting through to the consumer as well as it did many years ago Instead individuals are increasingly looking at some of the consumer products from Apple NASDAQ AAPL or Alphabets Googles parent company GOOG GOOGL lowpriced Chromebooks The other thing to keep in mind is that this group historically contained licensing revenue from Windows Phone to Nokia When Microsoft buys Nokia the revenue associated with licensing software to Nokia goes away This all makes logical sense What does Microsoft do strategically It attempts to revitalize the category by making new products that create a desire for Windows software through Microsoft hardware So while producing Surface Pro means a hit to the margin and huge RD costs it is necessary to attract the attention of consumers The funny thing about the tech world in my view is that each of the companies in the circle has a core competency Their competitors are each trying to win that group over but each has historically failed For example Microsoft is great at Office and it is great at selling to corporations As we saw above the company is doing great at making money off those relationships and has done so for years This makes up the majority of its business So what do Alphabet and Apple do they go after those markets Alphabet is recently trying to win people away from Office to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Docs With its partnership with IBM Corp NYSE IBM Apple is trying to push to get into more corporations with Mac and iPad All of that is interesting but Microsoft is still the king of Corporations This remains a small piece of the pie for the other two On the other side Alphabet is great at Search What did Microsoft do It made Bing Bing is cool It is another option that mimics the functionality of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>The company is trying pretty hard with things like Bing Rewards you get points for your searches which then translate into items like gift cards But in the end it doesnt account for a whole lot All of that is interesting but Alphabet is still the king of Search It remains a small piece of the pie for Microsoft Last there is Apple It has its phone The company makes a lot of money off selling those phones So what do the other two do They try and make phones one of them more successful than the other Alphabet giving away its Android system which means that Android revenue is small Microsoft pretty much had a disaster with Nokia and the Windows Phone program All of that is interesting but Apple is still the king of Phones It remains a small piece of the pie for Microsoft and Alphabet What results is this each is spectacular at one thing and spends a lot of time trying to win over customers in the other categories in which the competitors are currently king When looking at the potential of the organization to grow its revenue it is important to focus on where that organization makes its money and not on what is flashy It is easy to beat down Microsoft for failing at phones Had it adopted mobile earlier and done a better job who knows it could have been huge and something that I would be writing about today But it did not We are left with a Microsoft that makes money from licensing Office Servers and Windows primarily to corporations and secondarily to us little people How it converts those customers into a growing revenue stream is what matters Everything else is just noise First as a DGI I must point out that Microsofts dividend went up from to That is a solid raise that was announced earlier in the quarter Still seeing it in writing is always nice The company released two sets of numbers The GAAP numbers represent the accounting adjustments I mentioned above The nonGAAP financial results exclude the deferral and recognition of revenue primarily related to Windows It even provided the table below to help those of us who are not CPAs Microsoft reported EPS growth of to per share in Q That is all I am going to cover in the generic readout of its performance Lets dig into the components that matter Office commercial products and cloud services revenue grew in constant currency terms with Office revenue growth of nearly in constant currency terms seat growth Revenue in Intelligent Cloud grew up in constant currency to billion Source Microsoft Q Report Q Slides Just to throw me off Microsoft did not release net income figures with its Q results Instead the company released Operating Income figures The figure is different in excluding taxes and any other line item that falls outside the reported incomecost figures Standard figures that are included are Salesmarketing Research and development GA and impairments ie writeoffs The two numbers are close but denote that there are some differences So what does the update to the chart look like for Q You will notice that our groups went from down to Microsoft changed the categories that it reported from its Annual Report to its Q Report Groups and that I grouped together in my argument above have been split slightly different into Productivity and Business as one group and Intelligent Cloud as a nd group Group has swallowed up the majority of the tinier groups that were reported above Group Note the giant purple line on the far right is the writeoff of Nokia impairment My Unique Take on Things Where Does Microsoft Sit Now I have provided a lot of background on Microsoft over this article and the previous one Hopefully at this point you have a good understanding of all the things that the company does and where the money comes from for shareholders Here is my perspective on what we want to see over the next few quarters and next few years Windows was a failure in terms of corporations Adoption was horrible Alphabet and Apple have been knocking on the door pointing this out Corporations were able to use Windows with current applications just fine so they did nothing Instead of making a decision corporations have been waiting on the sidelines to see how Windows performs before making decisions on upgrades Now is the time that Microsoft has to do something Here is the big takeaway that can let you skip the next couple of paragraphs Microsoft is in great position to continue to protect its business with corporations How does it do that when Apple is kicking down the front door to get Macbooks on desks and Alphabet at the back door trying to get Microsoft Office kicked out for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Docs Lets take a step back and understand what value Windows and Office bring to corporations First at this point the programs are familiar to employees If I install Excel as a replacement to Excel I do not have to offer employees training of the functionality remains the same and of efficiency remains I can take out one system and put in another and an employee will not notice Second it is already there It is a huge effort to replace the computers of a large organization I am talking about a wide sweeping platform change The US government is a great example paying to keep support of a legacy system because it current works and because it would cost more to upgrade everything else to be compliant with new systems It is easier to do more of the same than something new What is the advantage of Apple and Macbooks They cost more upfront but they have a longer life The operating system upgrades are free and the hardware quality is better than the race for price points of Windows OEMs The downfall is that they are not in the hands of employees today As people transition at home they will learn how to use the systems and that lowers the barrier for transitioning in the office Microsoft needs to make sure that people keep using Windows at home How do you do that You make a sexy device or have your OEMs create it that competes directly with Macbooks The Surface Pro and Surface Books are great in that space It is also a compelling offer that aligns with the current needs of corporations familiar software highquality components that will last longer always uptodate and in a similar cost category Plus I do not have to replace all the company computers to keep everyone on the same OS making it work with all current systems Microsoft doesnt need to make money on the hardware as the revenue from licensing Windows is what it wants to protect What are the advantages of switching to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Docs It is cheaper It is in the cloud What are the disadvantages It is not what we use today and that means employee training This is where Office comes in lower the advertised price of Office and put it on the web Microsoft is in a good position there Last switching from a product revenue stream to a service revenue stream will subtly allow Microsoft to make more money over the long run It gives the company greater ability to raise prices over time This will be a minor but necessary add to growth Microsoft needs this base to be solid and consistent in order to be successful and grow EPS Since the old guard is protected where does growth come from First while the devices are what we feel and are attracted to the margins in those products are not good enough for Microsoft to grow EPS in a meaningful way by selling more and more Surface Pros If it was the only one selling Windows computers then there would be enough growth maybe That wont happen Microsoft cannot turn its back on the OEMs The growth comes from the Commercial Cloud It is the only REALISTIC thing that Microsoft offers that has the scalability and margin to impact EPS This space is what you see HP Amazon NASDAQ AMZN IBM and many others fighting for This space is going to get bloody This space is where you will get some good MA going over the next few years If Microsoft can be smart about where it grows in this space then shareholders will reap the benefits If not then you will see stagnant earnings over the next few years In Q we saw some growth here The trend needs to continue Below is a chart that shows what success looks like in the future When the Intelligent Cloud is the largest Operating Earnings division you know the plan is working well You can see below that it is headed the right direction Something to keep an eye on will be the decline in revenue from Productivity and Business This is partly from moving from product to service revenue on OfficeWindows You should see this declining trend continue throughout but start to grow in when you see true YoY comparisons Microsoft makes money by licensing software to corporations The company will grow revenue by its success in defending the territory it has plus expanding the Commercial Cloud How do you know this is important to Microsoft It is on the first line of the quarterly report The Commercial Cloud now has a revenue run rate of B Q results were up To warrant a more than PE in my books the company needs to grow a heck of a lot faster The Q results make me update my entry price I would look to start a position around Right now the market looks to be giving Microsoft a huge premium for this quarter The shares are up roughly in afterhours trading to I will keep my eye on the shares to see if I can pick them up on a dip As I am looking for a decline I do not see that happening anytime soon Alternatively Microsoft could show fasterthanexpected growth
