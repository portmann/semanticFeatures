an excellent logistics network international experience and backing of Amazoncom which gives it an edge over local Indian firms like Flipkart and Snapdeal Its return policy also is excellent making

cloud business and other segments also performing quite well Amazon has been expanding frantically in India as can be seen from the last years numbers The total revenues from Amazon India jumped to INR billion with losses amounting to INR billion The company has been spending heavily on marketing and logistics FY s corresponding sales and losses amounted to INR billion and INR billion

different strategy of pursuing growth at all costs This has meant that the companys profitability has not been high as the company has invested in a diverse set of business segments While some have proved to be a failure smartphones others such as its cloud business has proven to be a spectacular success Amazon has been similar to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG
