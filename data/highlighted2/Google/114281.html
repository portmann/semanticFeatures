This means that advertisers will be rewarded with cheaper click costs if their ads are highly targeted which in turn will have high click through rates.The thing now though is that advertisers will easily be able to see if they are getting a return on their advertising dollars.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The cost of each clink is predicted to go up in price as now Facebook won't be charging for the internal clicks (likes, shares, etc). (Uncertainty) </span>Nevertheless here's the skinny.Many advertisers have it already worked out what they can pay for a lead.A lead generally is a prospect interested in the advertiser products and has provided his contact details.If Facebook can provide cost effective leads to advertisers (which now can be calculated to the cent), the sky is the limit for this platform.When you couple the above point with the following chart, you begin to feel less bearish about this stock even considering its relatively high valuation.The chart above shows that $103 billion is expected to be spent on online advertising in 2019.In total, $37 billion of this (compared to $23 billion expected this year) is expected to be spent on display advertising of which Facebook is the dominant company in the US.However, it gets even better when you look at mobile ad revenue projections (see below).Facebook is expected to increase its mobile revenues next year by over $1 billion which again should increase earnings substantially.However increasing revenues also are going to come with increasing costs.Facebook's headcount has ballooned to more than 10,000 and the company continues to invest relentlessly into its platforms to try and keep eyeballs stationed there for longer.Investment also has been ploughed into its advertising programs as it tries to attract new advertisers to its platforms.Other huge investments include virtual reality and Internet.org where the latter's goal is to get more people online in developing countries.Furthermore huge money is being spent on servers and data centers which again should increase Facebook's active users going forward.That's the end goal here - more users.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The advantage a social media platform has over a search engine for example is that once a user starts using Facebook (connecting with family and friends, etc.), it's improbable that this user will leave. (Uncertainty) </span>This company is definitely setting itself up nicely.The revenue growth will be there and over time the cost of this revenue should decline.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Do I see risks? (Uncertainty) </span>Yes.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>New privacy regulations may hinder user growth. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Also the US economy (where Facebook derives the vast majority of its income) may enter a new recession. (Uncertainty) </span>Nevertheless, this company is at the forefront of the information age and should do well going forward.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Yes it may be trading at almost 100 times net income but it's still a very risky short at this moment in time.
