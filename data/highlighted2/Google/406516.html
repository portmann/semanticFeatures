class='textDiv'>Microsoft When Do Investors Get To See The Beef Microsoft Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Microsoft despite its size and intense analyst coverage remains an enigma to many investors The company is in the late stages of completing its transition to annuity revenues from traditional perpetual licenses MSFT is just starting to enjoy the extra revenue potential that the success of the Azure cloud offering makes possible The company is enjoying far more growth from Office than many observers think possible It has an excellent chance to significantly exceed current analyst forecasts for both revenues and EPS I think Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT shares are a buy Not because the company pays a dividend That may appeal to many readers and investors I frankly prefer companies that have opportunities to invest their operating cash flow into highreturn projects that will ultimately enhance growth and profitability I think Microsofts shares are a buy here because of the rather significant relative share price underperformance since the start of this year and in particular since the latest earnings release last month MSFTs shares are down about since the companys latest earnings release while the IGV software index is down about over that same time period I think the shares are a buy because of the relatively unfavorable sentimentrecommendation consensus amongst analysts The concomitant of that is that analyst consensus estimates for both revenues and EPS have reached a level from which they can readily be exceeded I even like the shares because Jim Cramer thinks that the company is not pushing into the cloud fast enough and he recommends his viewers to stay away from the shares And I think Microsofts shares are a buy because the company is reaching the tipping point in several of its multiple transitions I think that this is not well understood by much of the investment community And I think the success of the transitions is going to lead to another period during which Microsoft regularly beats consensus expectations not just for EPS but for topline growth as well The surest way to achieve positive alpha from an investment is to find a reasonably valued name that regularly beats the consensus forecast When Microsoft completes its current round of transitions that is what I expect to happen And all of the transitions I am going to be discussing are well underway They arent nascent or conjectures about future strategy The strategies that are going to restore this company to growth are happening now To be fair the cyclical trend that is retarding growth primarily the very constrained IT spending environment particularly in emerging countries is also happening now Timing in investments as well as in life is everything I cannot attempt to call the specific quarter in which the success of Microsofts multiple transitions becomes clear and becomes received wisdom across the board But because of the relative underperformance of the shares I believe now is a good time for investors to either add to positions or to establish new ones and to overweight the shares in any tech portfolio run on anything other than a trading basis I think most readers realize that the software industry is essentially all about transitions Software companies have to reinvent themselves regularly or they will lose relevance and stagnate A few years ago Microsoft was in danger of becoming one of those companies Without a lengthy exposition of the styles of the three men who have been CEO of this company I think it seems apparent that current CEO Satya Nadella has done a lot to shake up an aging dinosaur And I think that the fruition of many of his efforts is in the process of being realized And that is why I think Microsofts shares are a buy Most readers heard of and read about the transition to cloud through which almost all older software companies and some new ones as well are going through Probably many readers are having sensory overload about now in reading yet another article about a cloud transition But the fact is that the cloud transition story has had a significant impact on Microsofts reported results But there are other seemingly less obvious transitions that have been happening as well As these transitions which will likely go on for several years more become significant they will positively impact reported results in a meaningful fashion It is the combination of the multiple transitions rather than any single one that is likely to restore growth to this company and to foster the achievement of positive alpha for the shares Microsofts transition The skin molting process is well underway Microsoft today is really a transition story on many fronts One transition that is easy to understand and is probably the most significant is the transition from revenues derived from perpetual licensing to revenues coming from ratable models But overall the company is actually going through multiple transitions on a simultaneous basis that have at least partially obscured what is really happening at the company Are the parts that are rising large enough when compared to the parts that are falling primarily PCbased revenues or stagnating to make this a decent investment The purpose of this article is to analyze the multiple transitions carefully to get a better sense of what success or failure really means There is no realistic way I might cover in a single article all the issues and all of the debates that make up the dialog about investing in this companys shares An allencompassing article would be far longer than what most SA readers want to read So if you are looking for a discussion of the Surface laptop and tablet business or an analysis of the companys Lumia phone operations it isnt going to be here Just for the record however the companys phone business declined by year on year and sell through was weaker still leading to a buildup in channel inventory If you want to read speculation as to whether MSFT will soon exit the phone business in the wake of that performance as it has exited the display advertising business you will not find it here either I have even had to exclude Xbox from the overall analysis just to keep the length of this article somewhat reasonable and maintain the focus I will mention that MSFT has achieved more than a little success with Surface whose revenues grew year on year to over billion That is impressive and in most companies a product line that achieved billion of quarterly revenue ought to be considered as a significant business driver But for this company which did billion in quarterly revenue during the March quarter it is just of the total And I doubt if anyone thinks that Surface growth of even double digits is likely to continue in the context of the overall PC market Perhaps more interesting was the comment during the conference call that the success of Surface is being driven by commercialenterprise customers and might be seen as a validation of leveraging the entire MSFT stack And interesting as it may be I have to exclude discussions of the relative success of the Microsoft Windows free upgrade promotion and what will be the impact of its termination I personally am not all that sure about how Microsoft is going to have billion copies of Windows running when it took free prices to get million copies installed but again in the context of what I am trying to look at it really doesnt matter all that much But overall the reason to look at MSFTs shares now as a vehicle to find positive alpha is that the shares have underperformed for about a month and have become misunderstood and even somewhat neglected In many areas within the IT space might be viewed as a minor perturbation But for a name like this an share price decline is a significant event and one that investors should take advantage of Microsoft is a company that has really been in transition since Bill Clinton was in the White House since before iPhones were developed and before social media was a dream in Mark Zuckerbergs dorm room The company did two things in those years and did them very well Microsoft Windows was the operating system used on almost all PCs shipped and Microsoft Office had a similar quasimonopoly position in the market for personal productivity tools As founder Bill Gates gradually withdrew his genius from running the company it began to stagnate and to make some very bad asset allocation decisions Mr Gates stepped down from the CEO position at Microsoft in but remained chairman and chief software architect until Hindsight to be sure is and Microsofts stagnation wasnt total At the time it surely didnt quite seem as though Microsoft was stagnating The Xbox console was first released in November The company had a database product that was codeveloped with Sybase that dated back to the late s Many observers believe that the SQL Server release in actually marked the companys arrival on the enterprise data base scene In Microsoft bought Great Plains software in order to enter the market for packaged ERP solutions primarily sold to the SMB market The next year Microsoft bought Navision a Danish software vendor which had a significant position in the European ERP market at the time Microsoft started to offer primitive BI capabilities as part of its SQL Server release at the end of the s By the release Microsoft had a reporting service that looked like a primitive version of modern analytics solutions In Microsoft bought a company called aQuantive and attempted to enter the digital advertising space to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL The lest said about that foray the better other than the company finally exited the business last year But the fact is that other than XBox none of these forays into the enterprise world really moved the needle or became competitive with the major applications vendors and Business intelligence vendors of the era And so the share price remained more or less constant for years and years The company needed to transition from heavy reliance on the PC for its growth but proved unable to do so The shares made their alltime high as long ago as and for years and years thereafter the stock price essentially stagnated with the exception of their reaction to the business climate during the Great Recession Things started to change in and the shares appreciated by about in what proved to be the last year of the tenure of former CEO Steve Ballmer There are many observers who feel that Ballmer was an inept and nonvisionary CEO This really is neither a good time nor a place to join that debate Today the company is led by Satya Nadella and as I have written earlier it has emerged as the competitor in the world of the public cloud with revenues for Azure its competitor to Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Web Services AWS estimated at a current run rate of about billion billion is not all that much revenue for a company forecast to do billion in its current fiscal year But it is a huge amount of MSFTs growth Overall the company is forecast to shrink billion this current fiscal year ends during which Azure revenues will probably more than double Next year consensus estimates forecast revenues to increase by or billion Almost certainly the growth in Azure revenues will be all of that or more We will get to that transition which is far broader than just the growth in Azure revenues later First lets take a look at the transition from Microsofts perpetual model to what the company calls its annuity revenues It used to be that it was relatively simple to put together a forecast for Microsoft growth During its years of slumber it was merely necessary to look at the growth of the PC market Oh the company sold enterprise software but not enough to matter and it even sold some BI software which contributed even less as a percentage of total revenues And it had Xbox as well But MSFT has become a far more complex company at which to look as some of its transition strategies begin to reach meaningful levels It is more difficult than might be imagined to measure the pace of the companys multiple transitions I am not sure to what extent the lack of transparency is deliberate or has some other motivation but it most certainly exists For example the company doesnt break out revenue between cloudsubscription and perpetual revenues on a global basis where those numbers can be analyzed and projected We intuitively realize that cloud is rising and everything else is falling and we know some bits and pieces of how that transition is progressing but we dont know what the entire picture looks like I think by now that most users of Office do so on a subscription basis but I would really like to see the numbers It isnt that hard and many other transition companies such as Adobe NASDAQ ADBE or Autodesk NASDAQ ADSK and others make it simple About the only significant statistic we have in the earnings press release which likely speaks to the transition to a ratable model is the change in deferred revenues As it happens the growth in deferred revenues last quarter was significantly stronger than it had been for some time but is that a trend We really have to speculate and speculate on what that means in terms of the completeness of the companys transition The companys CFO Amy Hood commented about the transition as follows Were continuing to expect a strong mix to the clouds Were continuing to expect ARPU Annual Revenue Per Unit increasesand installed base growth So really in that segment its the PC weakness in our traditional transactional Office business thats impacting the segment In Intelligent Cloud its a very similar dynamic And in More Personal Computing the largest change in that segment is frankly the phone In other words Microsofts revenue issues arent those associated with overall demand but those associated with a switch from perpetual license to what the company is fond of calling its annuity business It is far better from a forecasting viewpoint for Microsoft to have an issue with its transition than to have an issue with demand or market share It would be perhaps more helpful in assessing its transition if the company chose to be more transparent but that is not going to be the case But here and there management does talk about some significant numbers For example on this latest conference call management talked about its Office commercial seats growing at year on year while consumer seats of Office grew by The company within Office has recently rolled out E which costs month up from for the soontoberetired E The new plan includes such things as Delve Analytics and Advanced Threat Protection Really no need for readers to concern themselves about the featurefunction improvements of E except to note that it is going to foster a significantly greater dollar volume of bookings growth all of it of course in the cloud ie ratable than what it is replacing Indeed last quarter the company saw a quarteroverquarter growth of monthly active users of its premium information protection service that is part of the expanded capability of E And contrary to the belief of some investors the TAM of Office is far greater with E than with came before Office is a growth proposition for Microsoft even if it is not showing up just yet in overall topline numbers In an answer to the question of an analyst the CFO said In terms of overall rough orders of magnitude the Intelligent Cloud segment has the least exposure to the transactional business It is But that right tends itself in quarter to the volatility you see The Productivity and Business Process segment has a bit more transactional exposure So to an extent we do have some quantification regarding the progress of MSFTs transition It is certainly in later innings but the perpetual tail is still large enough to wag the larger dog I do think it is fair to point out that Microsoft does have to contend with macro headwinds This is a large company and it certainly has exposure to worldwide macro trends If server shipments in lesser developed nations decline significantly because of global economic growth issues MSFT is going to be impacted But overall as the CFO put it Our annuity numbers and renewal numbers were very good in Intelligent Cloud And in fact they came right where we expected in terms of unearned balances ie deferred revenues Beyond the impact of the transition to cloud in terms of revenue growth the transition is also impacting reported gross margins Gross margins at least initially are lower for cloudbased solutions than they are for traditional transactional business Microsoft is a huge company with plenty of old business so the companys gross margins arent impacted all that much by this transition GAAP gross margins in the latest reported quarter declined from to Overall management is forecasting that nonGAAP gross margins are to decline bps this year and bps next year None of that is really going to be lost in the sense that by definition annuity revenues are just thatannuities Much of the gross margins that arent getting reported this year or next year are sitting in the various deferred revenue accounts Ultimately the companys gross margins are likely to increase as annuity revenues grow as a percentage of the total and more of them are made up of products that are on renewal rather than on their first lease cycle Summing up the first major transition that of moving the preponderance of this companys revenues from perpetual to ratable is nearing an end There will be quarters as the March quarter in which the companys perpetual revenues fall short and that will take a toll of some kind on expected margins and growth but that exposure is lessening quarter by quarter as the companys revenue model transitions to a new paradigm Business segment reporting One of the issues that tends to conceal more than it reveals at Microsoft these days Microsoft for the last few quarters has chosen to report its revenues in three new buckets Obviously it isnt that the businesses represented are new but just the classifications These are Productivity and Business Process Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing None of the titles are exactly congruent to what investors might think they mean For example while it seems logical to include sales of Surface in More Personal Computing it seems far less clear cut that Bing search advertising sales might reside in that bucket Certainly the intelligent cloud bucket while it contains Azure also contains many other revenue streams that are only peripherally cloud related If you think that More Personal Computing is the location for all of the revenue associated withwell software sold by Microsoft that is used on PCs you would have to guess again And again if you thought that Office was revenue related to the More PC Category you would have to modify that expectation because it really is reported as part of productivity and business process I have no intention of trying to review what is going on in each of the three reporting segments of the company In my opinion there simply arent uniform demand drivers in any of the segments I liked the old segment reporting scheme much better but this is what we have It was far more interesting at least to this writer when Microsoft chose to break its revenue into buckets that have more consistent growth rates While this company does sell lots of revenue to consumers like myself the growth parts of its business ought to be in the revenues that come from increasing its market share in the apps area and from the explosive current and longerterm growth of Azure The issue I have with the way that Microsoft reports its revenues is that it makes it almost impossible to quantify some longterm growth rate expectations with any degree of specificity Each of the companys three business segments is made up of some slowgrowth areas and some fastergrowth areas and each of the segments has more or less revenue company from annuity streams Overall while Microsoft has been able to grow revenues to some extent over the past three years from billion in fiscal to an estimated billion this year over that threeyear span it has not been able to increase its gross margins they were billion in fiscal they rose to billion last year and this year they will probably be around billion this year I dont imagine that any growth investor or even GARP investor is going to be excited about a topline growth per year even if part of the explanation of that number lies in the strong dollar and another part of the explanation lies in the transition to more of a ratable model over the time period The company has bought back enough shares to reduce diluted outstanding shares from billion to billion over three years That is just less than a decrease in outstanding shares but that doesnt get the sales per share growth rate above Overall operating income in FY was billion and it is likely to be a bit more than billion in the current fiscal year Operating cash flow growth was from billion in fiscal to a projected billion for fiscal But the business transition that I am most interested in and which is seemingly the least heralded is the market share opportunities that this company has in what it calls the intelligent cloud where more and more applications will run either natively or on some kind of hybrid basis Microsoft has had an applications business and a data base business now for many years as I commented about earlier And it has painfully built up an offering in the Business Intelligence space as well such that Gartner recently ranked it as the company in the space although some of the commentators on past articles I have written who themselves are users of the technology disagree with Gartners conclusions But that is not the real point either The real point here is that Microsoft for the first time ever so far as I can tell is leveraging the move to cloud computing to sell its entire suite of database and application products We know for example that with the success of Azure has come a comparable success of Microsofts SQL Server whose revenues on Azure more than doubled last quarter We know as well that the companys CRM seats doubled last quarter and of those seats deployed in the cloud Why it is that cloud deployed CRM is not part of the intelligent cloud is a classification question well beyond the ability of this poor writer to quite understand An example of what I see happening is the ability that Microsoft had to grow its Dynamics AX revenues from ERP by double digits last quarter That is not a shabby achievement and is far more of an accomplishment than many readers might appreciate in that the two leaders in the space Oracle NYSE ORCL and SAP NYSE SAP have shown declining revenues in that product area or so one infers On MSFTs conference call the company talked about new use cases for Dynamic AX that are based on its stack of IoT business intelligence and advanced analytics capability The real point I am suggesting is that for the first time in perhaps a generation there is an opportunity for a vendor to take market share from Oracle in the relational data base area And also for the first time in a great while as users transition to the cloud some of them are rethinking their relationship with their traditional software suppliers and are migrating to an all Microsoft paradigm Someone asked the CFO if she would comment on the companys new longterm growth outlook and of course she declined to answer And if she isnt forecasting anything I might write about longterm growth prospects for the company would be in the nature of a gratuitous guess But this company does have a significantly higher longterm growth potential than the that is currently the analyst consensus expectations The additional growth will be both a product of completing the companys migration from perpetual to a ratable model And that growth is likely to be a product of the companys accelerate success as it uses the massive adoption of Azure to pull through many other applications That alone is a dramatic transition from past practice These days IT spending is extremely constrained Gartner says it is growing at this year That is a fierce headwind for a company like this with operations in most areas that are impacted by IT spending I think the net of what I wanted to point out is that from being a share donor when it comes to overall IT spending this company is in the process of becoming a share gainer as its transitions finally bear some fruit I dont think that it will come as a surprise to readers that MSFTs shares are not nearly as cheap as they were in before they more than doubled through the end of last year As I pointed out most financial metrics for this company have made very unspectacular progress over that time frame At this point the company has an EVS of X Its PE based on forward earnings estimates and what I believe to be highly conservative guidance is X The companys best valuation metric is its free cash flow yield which is in the range of The company has a current dividend yield of and it has returned billion to shareholders last quarter in the form of both dividends billion and repurchase of shares billion net out of operating cash flow for the period of billion On most valuation metrics MSFTs shares are priced as though they were in the GARP category I think that the transitions discussed above are starting to have a visible impact on enough components of the income statement to suggest that next years consensus growth forecast of can readily be beaten and with the leverage this company has through constraining OpEx it can easily beat the current consensus of in EPS for FY And I see the company being able to do that even at its scale for several years to come And that in short is the case for positive alpha for Microsofts shares Microsoft is in the midst of multiple transitions that are masking the real health of its operations It has been transitioning its revenue model from perpetual license to subscription for the time now and that journey is nearly complete Indeed in the last quarter in the companys commercial business segment its annuity revenue mix reached of the total up bps from the year earlier quarter The companys commercial cloud business which includes a variety of revenue streams as well as Azure has reached an annual run rate of billion and its revenues have again been forecast to double by management over the next two years It seems likely that few analysts or investors actually believe that the company is going to achieve that kind of goal Were that to happen and nothing else changed in the companys revenue generation achieving that forecast would yield annual revenue growth Like many other companies in the software space transitioning from perpetual to ratable revenues gross margins have been under some pressure and they are decreasing by bps this year and are likely to contract another bps in FY These gross margin declines will almost certainly be made up over future years as the base of revenues coming from the balance sheet starts to grow significantly In addition to the impending completion of the trend toward annuity revenues growing as a proportion of the total the company appears to be on the cusp of a transition in which it uses the advantages of the success of Azure to improve the performance of its data base ERP business intelligence and analytic products For the first time in perhaps a generation some of that business is up for grabs as users migrate to the cloud much of which is not coming from their historic vendors While I fully expect the majority of Oracles customers to wind up using Oracle data bases and Oracle ERP products as they migrate to the cloud some will not and many of that cohort are targets of opportunity that Microsoft is already starting to win And what is true of Oracle will likely be true for SAP as well Further as Microsoft develops a far more significant relationship with partners through the use of open APIs for its cloud it is building a far more robust and competitive ecosystem than it has heretofore developed Expectations for this company are quite low with fiscal revenue growth forecast to be less than and EPS growth forecast to be just much of that coming from its significant level of share repurchase I believe that both estimates will prove to be significantly conservative Beating estimates and raising guidance for a reasonably valued name is absolutely the best way to achieve significant positive alpha And that is the course on which Microsoft appears to be sailing Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions
