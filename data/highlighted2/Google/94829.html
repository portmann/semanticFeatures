wearables market Fitbit NYSE FIT has sold million devices since its inception in This includes million last year and million in the three months ended March While thats very impressive for a company so young its nothing more than a starting point for a company like Apple NASDAQ AAPL that reportedly sold million Apple Watch units in its first two months a company that has unlimited resources and the worlds most advanced ecosystem Given the rate at which the Apple Watch is expected to penetrate the wearables market and the high expectations surrounding Fitbit investors really should take everything that Fitbit has done to this point with a grain of salt and be very skeptical of its stock longterm With that said IDC expects Apple to ship million Apple Watches this year a number that Apple would achieve in less than months This would represent remarkable penetration into the wearables market one that IDC expects to ship a total of million devices That million shipments is the combination of basic and smart wearables The former consists of devices like Fitbit IDC defines smart wearables as anything worn thats capable of running thirdparty apps The smart wearables market is expected to grow at a compound annualized rate of through and IDC expects that Apple will maintain a market share north of from on Up until this point basic wearable devices and fitness bands like Fitbit and Xiaomi have dominated the wearable market but smart technology from the likes of Apple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Microsoft present a new challenge that Fitbit and company have yet to encounter Last year basic wearables accounted for nearly of the entire wearables market according to IDC This year that number will be until smart wearables are highly penetrated into the wearables market Personally I expect the transition to occur much faster than that and for Apple to be a big reason why That said many investors who are buying into Fitbits prospects seem to buy the into the idea that it and Apple Watch are in two different markets However as I explained in my last article consumers who want lowend services can use cheap fitness apps on any smart wearable device In other words now that the technology is present for smart wearable devices and from Apple I thoroughly anticipate that consumers will be deciding between Apple and fitness apps and then Fitbit not buying one to complement the other Also as explained in my last article the rapid growth of Fitbits GPS enabled wearable suggests that consumers want more from a wearable than single functions Up until this point Fitbit has grown without a competitive threat like Apple but given the fact that Apple will produce as many unit Watch sales in its first year as Fitbit has in the last seven years suggest to me that Fitbit will experience an effect of Apple being in the wearables industry regardless if its basic or smart wearables In many ways Fitbits current growth momentum and Apples superior product brings back memories of BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY Back when the iPhone was first introduced many thought that BlackBerry and Apple werent direct competitors one for work and the other for play but Apples superior software and multifunction capabilities quickly begun to have an effect on BlackBerrys hardware sales I think the same effect could be seen with Fitbit Right now Fitbit is the king of the wearables mountain selling million units in an industry that sold just million last year While million units may be a sustainable number for Fitbit its going to be difficult for the company to ship million units when Apple is new to the industry and is on pace to sell million devices itself Combined that would be a substantial share of the million total shipments expected in the wearables market this year and leaves little room for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOGL NASDAQ GOOG Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Nike NYSE NKE and Fossil NASDAQ FOSL to make their mark All things considered its Apples history of penetrating markets causing turmoil for past leaders in those markets and the high expectations for million Watch shipments that I see as problematic for Fitbit When you incorporate Fitbits enormous postIPO stock gains thereby pricing in high expectations the opportunity to disappoint is rather high While research firms like IDC many investors and apparently Wall Street all think that Fitbit is safe from the Apple Watch thanks to its basic label in the wearables market be sure to remember what Apple did to competitors in other industries where it wasnt an obvious threat Its this premise that seems to have been forgotten Investors must remember how iTunes disrupted the music industry how the iPod eliminated CD players and MP players how the iPhone crushed BlackBerry and cell phones and how the tablet disrupted the PC and laptop industry These were all instances of smart versus basic and as you can see Apple more than penetrated each market to cause a real nightmare for the companies that became its competitors I expect that Fitbit will be next on its list and no different from all those other examples Source Why
