opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article We believe Messenger will soon act as a consolidated communication forum connecting merchants and consumers Consolidation in this space is logical because it creates convenience and simplicity by funneling all commerce requests through a single platform We expect the phone number to disappear over the next few years and likewise expect Messenger to replace traditional SMS as the most common form of text communication Messenger recently launched an Uber ride hailing feature and we expect most of Facebooks million active business network to become equally active on the Messenger commerce forum by We see this as part of a greater initiative to transform Facebooks multipleapp ecosystem into a onestopshop destination for all parts of the commerce process We believe Facebook NASDAQ FB is transforming Messenger into a consolidated commerce request marketplace Messenger CEO David Marcus recent blog post confirms that Facebook is thinking along these lines At Messenger were thinking about how we can help you interact with businesses or services to buy items order rides purchase airline tickets and talk to customer service in truly frictionless and delightful ways We recently wrote on why we felt Facebook had the potential to launch a Yelp NYSE YELP substitute We believe launching this Yelpsubstitute and transforming Messenger into a consolidated commerce marketplace are two disruptive moves within a greater plan of making Facebooks multipleapp ecosystem a onestopshop destination for all parts of the commerce process We believe will be a transformative year for Messenger and further believe that we are no more than a year away from Messenger users being able to order everything from a pizza to a pair of jeans through Messenger We will first discuss why consolidating all commerce requests on a single platform is logical and a worthwhile initiative for Facebook Chris Messina independent product designer and former user experience designer at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL says that one of the truisms in the smartphone industry is that a lot of people buy smartphones but dont download that many apps He says app engagement is a very difficult thing to achieve and more importantly retain This is why applications flood users with push notifications constantly reminding the user to engage with the application The problem therein is that users view the overt usage of push notifications as intrusive and end up deleting the app This is more commonly known as the app enigma People love smartphone applications but dont download new ones Around of smartphone users do not download a new app every month As makes sense data suggests that consumers load up on a few favorite apps when they first get their smartphone and then just stick to those apps According to Julie Ask principal analyst at Forrester an average phone user spends of his or her time in just five apps Those five apps are most normally dominated by social media and messaging apps so this is problematic for commerce brands trying to build an app presence Ask adds Brands are realizing that people just arent spending time in their apps so the companies are trying to engage you in places like Facebook because they know you spend a lot of time there Source Wall Street Journal Technology If you stop and think about this very simply it makes complete sense that the user only wants a few apps It is not ideal to have multiple apps for multiple different things Multiple different apps mean multiple different app interfaces to learn multiple different app notifications to filter through and multiple different programs eating up memory This creates an unattractive cluttering effect Foldering helps the problem of visual cluttering but doesnt appease much of the information cluttering Moreover there exists the issue that some apps do not run in the background YouTube is one such app If you close an app like YouTube to respond to a text YouTube stops running Even if the app runs in the background multiple apps still create the inconvenience of switching between apps Depending on the app and time between apps it can take awhile to load different apps This is a notable inconvenience The more apps to switch between the bigger the inconvenience For these reasons we believe consolidation in the app space makes sense Fewer apps that do more individually is ideal for the user The user is required to learn fewer interfaces has less visual and information cluttering and is able to perform multiple tasks without the inconvenience of switching applications All of the users data is also stored in one central location as opposed to being scattered across several different databases and the user will limit the amount of times they have to login As it relates to commerce consolidation makes even more sense because of the elevated cluttering currently in the space The market for commerce is especially confusing and inconvenient for consumers Some commerce giants are fully omnichannel with an app presence others are quasiomnichannel with only an online presence but no app presence while some new ones are onlineonly or apponly Some commerce players are grouped into quasiconsolidated apps like GrubHub NYSE GRUB but others have their own application Overall what this creates is an augmented sense of cluttering Consumers are left asking themselves what is the best way to order from this restaurant or retailer Consolidation here will prevail because it will attempt to universally answer that question for all retailers and restaurants It creates convenience and simplicity by funneling all commerce requests through a single platform As David Marcus put succinctly in his blog post It is so much easier to do everything in one place that has the context of your last interactions as well as your identity no need to ever login rather than downloading apps that youll never use again and jumping around from one app to another Firstly people spend a lot of time texting and instant messaging so smartphone users are likely most accustomed to a conversation thread In other words the learning curve for conversation platforms isnt steep at all Making a consolidated commerce platform conversational in nature will further cater to the convenience of the user Secondly a conversation thread keeps track of prior interactions The user can reference their transaction history with a company in the same way they would reference a conversation with a friend A conversation thread creates natural filters in this sense Thirdly it fits with the shift to mobile shopping Mobile shopping soared this Holiday season and this shift to mobilecentric shopping is likely just beginning Making a consolidated commerce platform conversational in nature will fit in with a natural trend of people shopping on their phones and merge this trend with the fact that the user is comfortable with conversation threads Messengers leverage over other IM applications is largely sizerelated Facebook already has of the world on it on a daily basis and m people using Messenger When discussing consolidation of services and applications it seems a natural and logical step to make the largest and most popular platform available the marketplace for that consolidation Messenger is the dominant platform in the IM space A recent US survey found that of its respondents used Messenger while only of respondents used the second most popular IM platform WhatsApp Messenger is further leveraged by being Facebooks IM tool Facebook already has a diverse network of businesses on its platform so it is a natural step for these businesses to use Messenger as a consumer communication tool for both orders and queries Messenger though does not have size leverage over traditional SMS or phonetophone texting As of more than billion people had access to SMS capability based on the number of phones in the world Three years later Facebooks daily population is still only of that figure We think though the bigger trend at play here especially among Millennials is the disappearance of the phone number David Marcus emphasized this in his blogpost We believe we are approaching an era of communication dominated by Messenger wherein phone numbers have become mostly obsolete The prevailing argument backing this thesis is that as WiFi becomes increasingly available everywhere and Messenger grows in size SMS and phone numbers are becoming increasingly irrelevant As David Marcus pointed out in his blog post the disappearance of the phone number is a secular trend According to Marcus it is simply an outwiththeold inwiththenew shift that makes sense as our smartphones become more capable machines than just phonetophone communication devices He says First lets set some context Think about it SMS and texting came to the fore in the time of flip phones Now many of us can do so much more on our phones we went from just making phone calls and sending basic textonly messages to having computers in our pockets And just like the flip phone is disappearing old communication styles are disappearing too With Messenger we offer all the things that made texting so popular but also so much more Yes you can send text messages but you can also send stickers photos videos voice clips GIFs your location and money to people You can make video and voice calls while at the same time not needing to know someones phone number You dont need to have a Facebook account to use Messenger anymore and its also a cross platform experience so you can pick up where you left off whether youre on a desktop computer a tablet or your phone We would like to add to Marcus statement by arguing that the increasing availability of WiFi will accentuate the phone numbers gradual disappearance Not only is complimentary WiFi becoming a popular and common instore option but WiFi is also becoming an intransit option as well With WiFi at home WiFi in the car and WiFi at the store the argument to save money by using Messenger instead of texting becomes compelling Verizon NYSE VZ charges per text if you dont have a texting plan and if you use mostly Messenger that total texting cost could be quite low WiFi availability also means that you dont need a large data plan to support heavy Messenger use in various locations The percent of a users day spent being connected to WiFi will grow consistently over the next several years Messenger also lends itself more appropriately than SMS to international conversations Phoning and texting someone internationally gets complicated depending on your carrier but Messenger universally allows for international communication Messenger unlike SMS is predominantly geographically indifferent Being able to contact someone without having their phone number is also a benefit of Messenger In sum we believe Messenger is a far more convenient simple costeffective and intuitive messaging system than traditional SMS We expect the phone number to gradually disappear over the next few years and likewise expect Messenger to replace traditional SMS as the most popular and common form of text communication Uber Is The First Others Will Follow Suit It is already possible to order a Uber using Messenger and Facebook has managed to make the process quite simple and intuitive You simply create a new message type in Uber to the recipient bar and click on the car icon below the message bar You sign in to Uber and then are ready to order a Uber from Messenger When ordering the Uber the interface is very similar to the Uberapp interface You use GPS to set your location select the type of Uber you want and enter the destination Uber is the first of what we expect many businesses to join the Messenger commerce platform this year Facebook recently announced that it has more than million active business pages that collectively receive billion comments each month We expect almost all of these million active businesses to create some sort of chat feature with Messenger in the next years so that the customer can either order goods or query management through Messenger The thing about consolidation is that its beneficially cyclical The more businesses join the more users make use of the commerce platform The more users make use of the commerce platform the more businesses will be compelled to join We would also imagine Messenger would implement a separated filing feature where personal conversations are filed separately from business conversations This would alleviate some of the cluttering that could occur as a result of mixing personal conversations with business ones We believe Facebook is creating a marketplace where you can discover order and review servicesproducts all in one multipleappintegrated ecosystem Facebook Messenger The meshing of Places and Services will serve as the discoveryreview side of the platform the Yelp substitute while Messenger will serve as the commerce side of the platform Facebook is creating a new world of commerce Uber was the first company to join this movement and other services will follow suit in domino fashion The result will be that in the nottoodistant future Messenger will be the consolidated communication platform connecting merchants and consumers This is part of a much bigger move to turn the Facebook multipleapp ecosystem Facebook Messenger into the appworlds version of a comprehensive onestopshop for all parts of the commerce process We are long Facebook because we think the company is just at the seedstages of realizing the full monetary potential of its billion DAU user pool We see as the year Messenger transforms into a commerce marketplace and view this as a significant step for Facebook Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
