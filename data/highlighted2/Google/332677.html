has Ride sharing autonomous cars new competitors and emission standards drive this uncertainty Throughout my training as a value investor Ive been told repeatedly that in the shortterm the market is a voting mechanism but in the longterm a weighing mechanism Ive taken this maxim as gospel For the past few years as an owner of Ford NYSE F Ive been absolutely flummoxed by as to why the markets opinion has deteriorated following improvements in financial performance However Ive come to realize that the market simply has no idea how Ford should be valued because of the various factors driving the auto market into flux Fords current valuation of about x earnings and somewhere in the ballpark of x FCF implies that the company has a terrible future ahead Lets take a look at the main concerns at Ford and why I think investors should limit their Ford positions And that conclusion likely isnt far off Even though the US is about million people larger than it was the last time it peaked I think its safe to say that the market will peak some time in the next two years Sensational headlines about borrowers falling behind on car payments are not very telling or indicative of the current auto market Defaults remain below historic highs and low interest rates will continue to bolster demand However from a profitability perspective I think we will see a highly promotional Overall incentive spending was up mm in January and dealers across the board are finding it difficult to move carsthough demand for SUVs and light trucks remains robust Though Ford would love to capitalize on this trend as SUVs and light trucks tend to carry stronger profit margins high gas prices over the past several years have created a relative glut of fuel efficient platforms I suspect Ford and GM NYSE GM will attempt to shift production to SUVs as much as possible but it will be difficult for plants that have been equipped for the production of much smaller vehicles to pickup the supply slack Getting back to factors driving a market peak is the simple fact that much of the pentup demand built during the financial crisis has likely been satiated As well low fuel prices will make the economics of upgrading to a more fuelefficient vehicle less attractive likely destroying some demand Ultimately with incentive spending accelerating dealerships stuffed with inventory and some normalizing of demand the US auto market is probably near its peak especially from a profitability perspective Uber Private UBER and Lyft Private LYFT have undeniably changed the nearterm landscape of the auto market While bearish prognosticators believe these car share services will eliminate the need to own cars the inexpensive transportation may actually cause vehicle miles traveled VMT to increase As a result we could see an uptake in the replacement rate for cars as a new class of professional drivers puts significant wear and tear into their vehicles VMT soared in above and Ive even noticed some interesting trends with regards to public transit usage Overall commuting public transit use seems to be on the rise likely the result of the millennial urbanization However Ive noticed a stark decline in weekend bus usage as pooling with the shared ride services is often cheaper than public transit Thus while urbanization sounds like a trend that could curb car ownership and it may as a percentage of the population Uber and Lyft are likely to counteract this trend In addition to ride sharing selfdriving cars represent a great unknown in the future of the auto market and will likely play a role in shaping demographic Selfdriving cars currently require driver intervention and the timeline for their arrival differs Some estimate strong adoption within the next years whereas others think adoption is at least years away Not only does the variance in timeline predictions add an element of unknown but also I think the changes in behavior and societal housing formation is also quite unpredictable People could abandon the urbanization trend unlikely in my view sending the demand for vehicles soaring as travel are no longer seen as a barrier Regardless it seems likely that it will be another catalyst for VMT growth While that sounds positive there is no clear idea of who the winner will be Will it be an established OEM like Ford or Honda NYSE HMC Will Lyft and Uber purchase fleets of selfdriving cars creating pricing destruction as the OEMs fight for share on one or two platforms This leads to my next point Googles NASDAQ GOOG selfdriving car is a wellknown project but there is no evidence that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>wants to become an auto OEM Frankly I wouldnt want <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>to become one either when you compare the ROIC of Internet advertising companies to that of vehicle manufacturers Still theres a great possibility that intellectual property will play a significant role in the autonomous auto market If GM Honda Toyota NYSE TM or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>owns the right IP it could mean steep licensing fees for other OEMs As a side note I do not think its in anyones best interest to retain fully exclusive IP as it could prevent broader market adoption On top of IP the elephant in the room is the potential gorilla thats entering shortly The poor return profile of the industry has not prevented Apple NASDAQ AAPL from becoming a candidate for the auto market Apple CEO Tim Cook continues to hint at the development of car and frankly Apple is one of the only companies in the world large enough to greenfield its own auto OEM operation nearing scale If Apple enters the market it will no doubt grab some market share though I imagine the company will focus on a niche luxury product offering Electric cars present a serious threat to the traditional auto OEMs at gasoline but I think the threat is much less present with the prevailing price environment Consumers have shown an inability to think longterm as they tend to demand more SUVs when gas prices are low and switch to small cars when prices are high Ford intends on adding four new SUVs to its fleet but by the time the products reach market gasoline might be higher driving weaker demand Thus there is a change Ford completely whiffs on its new product decision and consumers want to drive electric cars Yet another wrinkle into the competitive outlook is the change in emissions standards Near parabolic increases in miles per gallon will cost OEMs billions in RD depressing ROICs Ultimately it is difficult for me to find fault with Fords valuation Shares are not expensive by traditional earnings metrics but I think the future of the auto market is unclear and hard to predict With its high dividend yield and cheap valuation I think Ford makes sense as a smaller investment position betting that the auto market looks a lot like it does today in the next decade I
