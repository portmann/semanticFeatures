Doubling Down On Facebook Facebook NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha I polled the SA audience on why theyre long in FB and got an exceptional number of positive responses User growth a vibrant ad platform and future ancillary revenue streams led the conversation The remaining concerns are relevancy and a high valuation relative to competitors I polled the Seeking Alpha comment board last time around on why individuals chose to be long in Facebook NASDAQ FB and one thing became blatantly clear there is no alternative to Facebook No tech company has the user base the expansion potential or the profitability that Facebook has and thats where the relevancy concerns get diminished rather quickly Now I was itching to pick up more shares of this company earlier last week but was waiting for just the right time Today Tuesday is perhaps the best day in a longtime considering the stocks retraction Monday and Im buying in because I believe in their expansion potential multiple ancillary streams and I even believe their high valuation is justified Since I last wrote about the company on September Ive seen a lot of unwanted volatility I saw a brief rise in my shares before the plummet yesterday but this is a stock Im about to have for the longterm Id honestly argue that selling now is a horrible mistake Below you can see the YTD performance of Facebook and notice the difficult trading that August and September have given us Before fully delving into my opinion on the significance behind their growth catalysts its worth noting that of total revenue now comes from outside the United States making these markets ever so crucial For example the initial statistics reported out of Africa were quite good but also leaves a lot of room to run The keys for Africa right now are Kenya South Africa and Nigeria If Facebook can start expanding to a fourth and fifth country by the end of Q Id say theyre moving at an incredibly quick pace The stats as of now Id say growth targets would be to push Kenya to million push Nigeria to and South Africa to Again if we can see that by Q then the stock should adjust nicely Some very notable catalysts are beckoning me to invest more Autoplay video in the News Feed now with the personalization key Suggested Videos video is a huge catalyst especially when we think about VR as a new market I played with the Star Wars video that was on my timeline and I actually felt it had a valueadded component The Oculus Rift will soon be priced and available to consumers est Spring and will add a nice boost to the topline estimates vary widely and are highly dependent upon the price point however Im led to believe that this could potentially be a multibillion dollar annual revenue stream Instagram just passed the million MAU mark which is better than Twitters NYSE TWTR million altogether The app is expected to generate over billion in revenue in the next year alone furthermore the ad revenue is extending to thirty new countries several of which are emerging markets The Gear VR was just priced at in partnership with Samsung OTCSSNLF this is an excellent transition for Facebook into the VR market When WhatsApp gets monetized million users will now become profitable for Facebook the user base has increased since September Understand that this is billions in potential revenue in future years In the same scenario when Messenger becomes monetized capturing profitability from its incredibly high MAUs is going to be quite simple this is arguably a very undervalued area of Facebook to the investing community Facebook also threw a large majority of investors for a twist yesterday with new tools for advertisers to use on mobile devices rather than on televisions The reality is that the million and growing active advertisers on Facebook can have their ads specifically tailored to suit the individual users interest better than a generic television ad can I personally believe the shift is already underway and that large TV advertisers are going to need to have a fully mobile ad platform to capture larger amounts of consumers Now mcommerce is going to grow at a rate of by the end of this year and if we take this to be the case all we can realistically think about for Facebook is potential potential to capture a large piece of this market now that instant buying is a reality on the network Even if MAUs and DAUs grow at a slower rate for the social network this opens up an entirely new area to surge into Another kicker China accounts for of all mcommerce transactions so furthering the push into this demographic is vital for Facebook This is excellent considering Facebook reported MAUs from the AsiaPacific segment in Q Granted pushing into China means heavier competition from players like Alibaba NYSE BABA and JDcom NASDAQ JD as well as dealing with the various restriction currently placed on the site in China Yet advertising revenue in the AsiaPacific segment for Q stood at million and ARPU was at an alltime high at Theres been concerns about the relatively high PE of the company Resting at with a PEG of investors have every right to be scared Below is the comparison to competitors OCF million in Q FCF million in Q Its worth noting that OCF and FCF for Twitter have experienced wide fluctuations in the last several quarters and are not stable Weve yet to see positive EPS from Twitter giving them an unavailable PE That company is also lagging on its MAU targets as noted earlier Transitioning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is about to have its mobile ad revenue succeeded by Instagram and while Microsoft looks like the most attractive out of their group their LT debt is up nearly billion in the last six months and is creating a heavy burden on the company Microsoft to me is synonymous with maturity and while their company has provided an excellent history of good returns Facebook is the cataclysmic brainchild of the Silicon Valley that is going to outpace Microsofts first decade of returns on a comparable basis Facebook has had increasing OCF the last four quarters up from billion to now billion In the same time frame the company has gone from million in FCF to now billion Nearly doubling FCF in just four quarters is quite impressive and is really going to enable them to continue making acquisitions and fund a growing Capex to support expansion Why is this so important Think about the end game adding more revenue streams ie WhatsApp Messenger Oculus Capex has increased roughly million since end of Q last year and theyre on track to remain within the billion budget Ive heard a few minor concerns with the companys ability to grow EPS as well as revenue per user Last Q the company posted EPS of with Q and Q being notably lower at and respectively however last quarter they recovered to Now estimates are varying widely on what next quarter EPS will look like but in my research and understanding I fully believe an EPS above is likely There are very few reasons in my opinion not to double down on Facebook I dont believe there is an alternative to being long in Facebook and I dont believe this is a shortterm position
