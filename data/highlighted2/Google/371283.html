class='textDiv'>Microsoft Is Playing Dangerous Games With The Gaming Industry Microsoft Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Microsofts new Xbox strategy is the first step in a series of moves designed to bring billions to its top line The company is tapping into a billion gaming market thats growing at YoY But is its approach essentially a monopolistic one that will alienate certain significant pockets of the games development community Some in the know seem to think so The way Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT is going at it it seems the company wants to challenge the status quo on as many fronts as possible Following hard on the heels of its acquisition of Xamarin which I covered recently in Microsoft Makes A GameChanging Acquisition the company has once again shaken things up with the announcement of its latest gaming platform that can literally blur the lines between multiple devices In a recent article by SA author Jimmy Lamz he spoke about how Microsofts new plan for gaming could catapult the company in the PC gaming space and move a step ahead of Sony NYSE SNE which was the clear winner of the console wars I do agree with him that the move will allow Microsoft to break the closed ecosystem of console gaming and move into a more PCstyle format that may or may not have more appeal depending directly on the portability of the content with the console framework However I wanted to extend that analysis into what I think is the real motivation behind Satya Nadella and Phil Spencers recent strategy decisions on the direction of XBox technology and the Universal Windows Platform fronted by the Windows operating system Nadellas agenda is clear mobile first cloud first The first part of that is what the Xbox upgradeable console technology is all about Microsofts notsosubtle move to unify platforms so that everything that you enjoy on your PC your laptop or your console can now be accessed through mobile devices And not just any mobile device one that runs on Microsofts crossplatform OS Windows Within the gaming industry this kind of crossplatform compatibility is unheard of Until now PC gaming and console gaming have been estranged cousins with online gaming being a completely different species altogether With this new move users will be able to play the same games across their PC their Xbox their tablet and their smartphone But the company is far from achieving that reality The challenges of creating such a platform are many not the least of which is the ability to entice games developers to create and possibly recreate games for the new crossplatform application I believe the Xamarin acquisition is also one piece of the puzzle but the significance of that is yet to be ascertained From a practical standpoint one of the biggest challenges I see Microsoft facing is getting the voluntary buyin of independent developers and companies that are well aware of the problems with a seemingly open but practically closed proprietary system such as the Universal Windows Platform Even if they crack that code there are a host of technical issues to resolve I dont see all games being available on all devices purely because of mobile devices inherent limitations that will prevent graphicsheavy games from running on them From the companys initial promotion of the concept above it looks extremely attractive But is it realistic Think about that for a minute The sheer processing power required for some of the worlds favorite console or PC games will eliminate mobile devices from having access to them wont it By streaming content to your mobile device from your Xbox you get the processing power of a hardwareupgradeable Xbox along with the mobility advantages of your device You may have to deal with inferior graphics and a different feel for each game but Microsoft hasnt even gotten as far as to consider that yet Or at least it hasnt made its plans known publicly The challenge here is to see through what Microsoft is saying and finding out what its really up to But before we get further into the subject lets see whats at stake for the company As of Q there were million active Xbox users Thats a full million over the same period last year which translates to growth In terms of revenue Microsoft despite its lost war for console dominance is still firmly in second place ahead of Sony and trailing behind Tencent OTCPKTCEHY the Chinese company of League of Legends fame Growth on that front is in the range the highest among the giants of the gaming world Despite having such a huge control over the mobile operating system market share Apple NASDAQ AAPL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>GOOG GOOGL stand at sixth and seventh positions respectively Thats understandable because only a portion of the companies respective reservoirs of games actually make them any money Even so their billion revenues arent that unimpressive especially when you look at the fact that both of them are growing gaming revenues at over year over year With the billion gaming market expected to grow at rate for the next few years none of these companies are going to take their foot off the gas pedal This is a good thing because it forces competition and benefits the end user tremendously And you can clearly see that China and the United States are the biggest generators of this revenue This means Tencent and Microsoft are in direct competition with each other even though they operate in completely different gaming segments I believe this is really what Microsoft is after On one side the company wants to create a closed environment within the PC games market to dominate it and on the other it wants to create a technology far beyond the capability of any consolebased system This is Nadella and Spencers positioning for the Microsoft gaming business but it comes with a plethora of problems The main problem is with Microsofts Universal Windows Platform itself Although the Xbox to PC gaming blur is merely the companys first step in that fight against Tencent and Sony many believe it will stifle competition and force the hands of developers Microsoft has launched new PC Windows features exclusively in UWP and is effectively telling developers you can use these Windows features only if you submit to the control of our lockeddown UWP ecosystem Theyre curtailing users freedom to install fullfeatured PC software and subverting the rights of developers and publishers to maintain a direct relationship with their customers Strong words coming from the founder of Epic Games which goes back to and is one of the pioneers of online gaming as well as provider to the Xbox Incidentally Epic is also an associate of Tencent But thats not all Sweeney goes on to say The ultimate danger here is that Microsoft continually improves UWP while neglecting and even degrading win over time making it harder for developers and publishers to escape from Microsofts new UWP commerce monopoly Ultimately the open win Windows experience could be relegated to Enterprise and Developer editions of Windows Essentially hes saying that developers and publishers as well as users of the UWP will be forced to comply with whatever Microsoft decides to allow They will not be able to install thirdparty software without an indepth knowledge of how to tweak the settings This is eerily similar to what most perceive Apples tightly curated App Store to be but surprisingly Sweeney alleges that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>pretty much follows the same methodology for Android Most people are under the impression that the base code for Android is essentially open source meaning nonproprietary and thats true in theory However this is what Sweeney says is the reality Android makes it possible to install thirdparty applications outside of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play store which is required for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>to comply with the Linux kernels GNU General Public License However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>makes it comically difficult for users to do so by defaulting the option to off burying it and obfuscating it This is not merely a technical issue it has the market impact of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play Store dominating over competing stores despite not being very good Go figure So what hes telling us is that Microsoft is essentially headed in the same direction as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>in order to gain monopoly over the PC gaming industry Microsofts intentions must be judged by Microsofts actions not Microsofts words Their actions speak plainly enough they are working to turn todays open PC ecosystem into a closed Microsoftcontrolled distribution and commerce monopoly over time in a series of steps of which were seeing the very first So now Ive laid out what I think is Microsofts strategy to dominate the gaming industry without resorting to anything that would set off sensitive antitrust triggers The company has already been in that fix before but that was limited to certain contracts with PC manufacturers and to specific competitors If what Sweeney says Microsoft is trying to do is true then the ramifications of that are on a scale never before imagined The UWP has come under a lot of microscopic analyses and intense criticism from major players in the gaming industry but what the company is trying to do here is completely legitimate and therein lies the problem If Microsoft is successful at it the company could close down open PC as a platform for all practical purposes and bring everyone under the UWP umbrella That means independent PC games developers as well as companies that publish using Microsofts platforms Thats going to be great for Microsofts Xbox and its entire gaming divisions top line but the whole idea seems to be carrying a ton of unpleasant baggage on its shoulders I dont think Microsoft is looking at this from a one game fits all perspective simply because thats not possible at all Consoles will take the premium positioning for now squarely aimed at avid gamers who rate gaming experience higher than cost And whenever they cannot access their console they can just open their Xbox app on their laptop and keep on playing This will also help Microsoft attract the online gaming and mobile gaming communities to its fold As Ive said before the biggest bump in the road is how the developer community reacts to this Its a bold and risky bet that can only be successful if Microsoft aggressively pursues and woos game developers to embrace the idea and helps them every step of the way If the company manages to do that then Microsoft has all the ability to take the lead position in the console online and mobile gaming markets as well as the premium and mass market segments If you enjoyed reading this article
