article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Firstly the past month has seen a period of significant volatility in the markets with the SP testing the previous highs in early December to fall by to date This marketwide correction has opened up opportunities to enter into positions that present good value Throughout December McDonalds NYSE MCD continued its strong rally higher that began in October after a long period of stagnation for the stock This rally has pushed the valuation of the company past the limits I have allocated for the functioning of the portfolio which can be seen by clicking here Although I think MCD has been a great company for income seekers I dont see much growth in sales over the next couple of years to warrant the valuation we are presented with In addition the dividend yield has fallen from the initial I managed to secure at purchase to the current Better riskreward scenarios are available The sale at presented a appreciation exdividends in my position since late January of this year The position was eliminated entirely as it presented only of the portfolio and it was not economical to just reduce the stake IBM NYSE IBM has been a stock that has been nothing less than unforgiving to investors since mid with continuous earnings declines which has caused a dramatic slide in the share price Although this gives the impression that IBM is seriously struggling as a company in the last few years this is far from the truth IBM has been strategically evolving as a company selling off parts of its business to reduce hardware operations and is focusing more on enterprise solutions such as big data cloud and engagement This is all helped by the investments in Artificial Intelligence and Watson Although Watson has several uses IBM CEO Ginni Rometty describes its moon shot as being Watsons opportunities in Healthcare With US healthcare currently an t market with up to t in inefficiencies it is hoped that Watson will be a game changer in this area These enterprise solutions now represent of IBM revenue and are growing at YoY Now hardware represents only of IBM so it is by no means the company that many remember it to be This is summed up in this minute interview with Ginni Rometty which you can access by clicking here Rometty shows clear vision with where the business is going and this should be a sign of confidence for investors Dividend yield of highest since with a very conservative payout ratio of Last quarter showed free cash flow up YoY In addition it has worked to increase cash and reduce overall debt which can be shown from the chart below Berkshire Hathaway BRKA BRKB I dont think this company needs an explanation due to how widely it is covered However the important point to note is that the pricebook value is just above the point at which Buffett said that the company would repurchase shares If any company could share the same DNA as Berkshire Hathaway it would be Markel Not only is its roots in insurance the money from insurance premiums are invested in stocks and bonds in a tax efficient manner and the company does not pay a dividend as the proceeds are used to cumulatively grow the business On the investing arm of the company is Tom Gayner who has provided consistently exceptional returns of annually over the past years which has helped to propel significant growth in the share price Although this is not as good as the early days of Berkshire Hathaway the companys market cap is only b which allows for easier expansion than Berkshire Hathaway Gayner is definitely inspired by Buffett and follows the same teachings of Graham in investing I found this Youtube video of a speech of his at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>a great insight into the company and their values My only concern with the valuation on this company right now is the pricebook value standing at approximately This is a little over the historical average and higher than Berkshire Hathaway but I believe that being a smaller company allows easier access to growth than Berkshire Anyone following me on Seeking Alpha knows that I am very bullish on Apple currently having of my portfolio allocated to Apple Even after increasing my stake this coming week the allocation to Apple will actually decrease in percentage terms compared to the rest of the portfolio The past few months have created a situation quite similar to that seen in For months analysts claimed that Apples growth story was over and we were frequently bombarded with doom and gloom analyst reports More recently we had a report from Nikkei suggesting that Apple had ordered a cut in production of the latest models of their iPhones This was followed by profit warnings by a couple of Apple parts suppliers Cirrus Logic NASDAQ CRUS and Qorvo NASDAQ QRVO I wont go into too much detail on this part as I think Mark Hibben has already provided us with much needed analysis on this area which shows that things might not be as bad as they seem However I would like to add a couple of points which I dont believe were covered which should ease the worry of Apple investors Samsung Electronics OTCSSNLF recently reported fourth quarter earnings that fell well short of analysts forecasts The Financial Times reported that Samsungs smartphone businesshas seen its sales and margins slashed by competition from Chinese peers Samsung also uses both the companies mentioned above for parts for their devices so this is not specific to Apple which makes the decline in orders uncertain to be completely a result of Apple Cirrus Logic states in their earnings report that despite this lower outlook for the short term we expect our full FY results to reflect meaningful yearoveryear revenue growth and further foresee strong growth for FY based on several anticipated new product introductions This corroborates the long term growth story of smartphone demand Qorvo stated in their most recent earnings report that for calendar Qorvo currently expects abovemarket revenue growth based upon customer forecasts and existing customer design wins at Qorvos largest customers Notwithstanding that most expect the s phones to have less demand due to the less significant upgrades I expect this drop in share price to be temporary and for it to recover significantly throughout and Once again Apple trades at the valuation of a subpar company with declining earnings at a pe ratio of The performance of this company should rationally carry a much higher valuation Many investors note that iPhone revenue stands at of Apple revenue and that there are concerns about the future growth of the iPhone Personally I am very skeptical of a growth iPhone sales for the past year turning flat for YoY rise in spending from the App Store Apple music reaching m subscribers in the first months At month this equates to b of revenue number of shares for new positions are using Fridays closing prices Thank you for reading If you have enjoyed reading
