Company As all of you know Fords execution over the past few years has been truly impressive The Company were just talking about how the Company has radically transformed its product portfolio They have achieved very impressive improvements in profitability They have entered new markets And over the next year just going around the world in North America the business should continue to benefit from one of the newest product portfolios in the industry with new and significantly refreshed products including the Mustang the Transit The Focus The Edge and continued ramp up of the Ford F Europe accounts for around of the Companys volume The Company is still loss making but they believe that theyre on track to turn profitable over the next year or so which would result in its fairly significant improvement in profitability and cash flow for the overall Company Joining us from Ford today Im very pleased to welcome Jim Farley Jim is President of the Europe Middle East and Africa Thank you Rod Im thrilled to present to you our plan and to give an update My background is I spent almost years with Toyota including here in Europe and responsible for Lexus and then left Toyota eight years ago to join Ford and management team And I was Head of Marketing Sales and Service for the Company and Stephen Odell the Head of Europe and I switched jobs about nine months ago And Im relatively new to Europe but not my first chance as Ive being here So I am going to spend about minutes just taking you through our status and then leave the rest of time for QA So I think all of you are very familiar with our One Ford plan maybe you are not but our idea is pretty simple aggressively restructure the business to operate profitably accelerate the development of products that people want and financial plan and improve our balance sheet and improve our balance sheet and work together as one team The key tenet for us is deliver products with passion which we think is a difference maker for us I know everyone says that but Ill highlight that more and also innovate in every part of our business which is increasingly a focus for us as the leadership team And heres our key longterm objectives We want to be a plan in the global automotive business in terms of share and topfive sales company more balanced in our regional profits as Rod said so Europe is a very key part of rebalancing our risk in company operating margins of eightplus and also be a top quartile TSR company and as well be highly regarded by our view and all of our stakeholders To do that we believe we have to bet on strong brands And we have a different brand philosophy than other companies Weve simplified the portfolio of brands in the Company And we believe the Ford brand is quite flexible actually where we can sell Serve all markets that mostly mean expansion in Middle East and Asia and compete in all key parts bestinclass products across the whole competition patch The other area that I would like to emphasize is Smart Mobility I am sure all of you wondering what this means for a car company This is an area we really want to leaning on We were very affected by the SYNC experience in North America And this is something that were thinking about on much larger scale now how the digital world would change our business and how Ford will be ahead of that And the last area is just improve our margins obviously topline revenue and our efficiency and Ill talk a lot about that in Europe So lets talk about the Europe business the Company announced the strategy to improve after a few years of very challenging losses in Europe We focused on three areas Since a lot has changed These tenets havent changed but we have launched new products in Europe a whole host of products across segments as Rod mentioned And some of the real highlights for us is our commercial vehicle business which Ill touch on in a moment And weve learned a lot but the good thing is our products are generally very well accepted and weve been able to deliver the pricing and other positive revenue along with that Weve also closed a very large manufacturing facility in Belgium and in South Hampton so continued to rationalize our capacity in Europe And weve taken those products and redistributed them among the remainder on our plants We have a very efficient operation at Turkey very large operation where we make all of our commercial vehicles So here is some of the key developments I mentioned the products really leaning to the performance space Weve learned a lot from the learned from competitors in this area of derivatives so listed transaction price of our mainstream products I think this is a real chance to improve not only the brand but really drive higher transaction prices and were really starting with the performance line up Were now that number one brand in Europe on a number of models with five star ratings which is great We did get recognize the most innovative volume brand this year by the German Center of Automotive Management The brand has been getting healthier We separated ourselves from the other mainstream brands We still have a very large gap to Volkswagen And more and more were competing directly with the premium brands in almost every segment So the brand is very important to us We launched Ford Stores Its a very large wellfunded digitally enabled dealership in all the major markets across Europe Were on the way to of them weve about done and this is very important for our brand initiative Weve also launched Vignale Weve a very high mix of our high series now Titanium on our higher transaction price vehicles We want to retain those customers Were not trying to steal customers from Audi or the premium brands We want to make sure we retain our loyal customers make sure to give them more than just a normal high series We have a very different dealership experience from Vignale same make own our cars which is very unusual in Europe even for the premium brands We have dedicated dealership people And even Vignale is sold through a much narrow distribution channel compared to normal Ford Were also doing it for Mustang and other special products I am happy to say that in August we became the number one brand in commercial vehicles in Europe outselling both Mercedes and Volkswagen Three years ago we were number seven We have a complete line of commercial vehicles B and C size in great advance a and Tonne Transit and a very successful Ranger import from South Africa Weve also redone our whole distribution network for commercial business And its a real signature part of our profitability going forward On cost I mentioned the changes in consolidation of our manufacturing operations We also continue to work with our union partners to get to more efficiency out of labor and overhead We just finished last year labor agreement in Cologne You may not be aware of this but ironically where we make the Fiesta in Cologne we have the most efficient plants in the world the lowest labor overhead of any place but thats a very benchmark facility for us and for the industry and even with that we are able to getting new labor agreement Well see how that impacts our performance What we care about the Ford in Europe is profitable healthy share growth We recognize the importance of scale but were not going to do that and deteriorate our margin So we have been growing the business for two years in a row now And yeartodate were as you can see about but probably more important for you than the share itself is the kind of quality of that business and Ill touch on that in a second And its very linked to the changing European general mix as well here We pay a lot of attention to the channels we sell our product into And that is important in fact more important than our share growth So here is I would like to touch on that biggest meaning question I got Hey Jim the industry is getting healthier in Europe what does that mean for Ford and your profitability When you really dissect the business by channel there is four distinct channels for the OEMs in Europe on the passenger cars side We have of course retail we have fleet and fleet goes from user chooses this all the way to very volumes fleet owners in CD business But you have two very important channels one is rental which is some markets in Southern Europe is very large could be a third of the industry and also dealer demo self registered products sold from the OE directly to their dealers who in the course of maybe two months or three months most of the programs turning to used cost And I just want to emphasize to all of you that our strategy in Europe is very different for each of those channels and our share is by far the lowest in the last two Contribution margins are very different for all brands And I think this is a key signature part of our profitable growth on the revenue side I really wanted to highlight the importance of our CD business Its something we dont talk a lot about and its a very important part of us competing with the luxury brands here in Europe And the success has really been fueled by all of our new products essentially came out in the month period but the Tonne Transit which is vehicle not sold in the US is the red Transit that particular vehicle has been incredibly well accepted And we make virtually all these vehicles in the low cost locations The Transit Carrier the top white vehicle and the two Transits the middle larger vans both made in Turkey the Transit Connect is made in Spain and the Ranger is made in South Africa imported to Europe These are very important high transaction price products customers are willing to pay for future content and capabilities The environment here I think you know it as well as everyone Obviously the key things were watching is the real strength of the growth the currencies very carefully as well as the upcoming regulatory changes that was in the board meeting this morning and we spent most of our time talking about the upcoming regulatory environment here in Europe and very important topic for us as a business I wanted to talk about the growth in the industry this year to emphasize the different cycle of growth across Europe As you can see the leading markets for yearoveryear growth have been in Portugal Spain Italy the austerity markets off a very low base are dominated by being CCARs And as you can see Northern Europe the growth has been much more modest Even though overall Europe is up the mature markets are much less And a lot of that growth in mature markets is actually the rental and self registered products So the retail and fleet the key parts of the markets are growing Its really exciting to see the organic growth in Europe Its just not its not nearly as high as yield on industry You saw I think August we just reported while we were here its about increase for the industry Just think about little bit more complexity about that growth there is definitely growth thats happening in retail and fleet but its not happening everywhere And its very important to pay attention to the channels themselves Russia Im sure is the big part of your question to us to any OEM Ford has made a particular bet in Russia Right now Russia is running at about units that we put it fourth or fifth and in terms of size in Europe still very significant market Fords been on Europe in Russia couple of years ago and actually had winning operation and we did a couple of key things We found a really good partner Sollers has very good relationships with the government and that has proven to be very beneficial to us as a company The second thing is we decided to refresh all of our products So we have seven products in Russia they are all essentially brand new Weve launched four just this year So going into tough market we have very very fresh products And that allows us to manage the capital over time And obviously the market right now in unit operations the units of the industry are down kind of also biggest issue is of course the euro to ruble exchange rate Weve heavily localized but we still import some parts and that currency is very important to all of the industry and every brand has a different pricing strategy Were very focused on managing shortterm through this by looking at our pricing our cost our investment our structural cost to make sure that were as efficient as we can but we manage the opportunity on the upside And we really believe that were still at that industry that can be above million units like it was in the past Our pretax results for the first half in Europe as you can see we lost about million that carry over from last year but there is two very important things I would like you to look out on this chart As you can see very positive about million of top line revenue growth in terms of improved profitability but we destocked the business as you could see about million And also pricing were seeing is not just top line pricing for our new products we have a lot of new products just coming out now All of our large cars are brand new Mondeo is brand SMax Galaxy they are all brand new And as theyre coming out were getting feature content but really what were getting is mix and rates People are buying much nicer Fords And that is really flowing into the bottom line banks in a way we anticipated The industry is up our share is up Thats good to see profitability ph holds up but whats really important is that pricing line The other thing when you go to the cost contribution cost has been largely a carryover yearoveryear Our pension costs of course with discounts were lower as we got a million headwind yearoveryear Id like to ask you to look at the prior year reserve release we renegotiated with German Union a beneficial contract and that was abandoned to us last year not this year that change that reversal so to speak plus the stocks are more than almost million million So the point is the business is getting healthier If we take out those long repeating items the underlying European Ford business continues to get healthier yearoveryear We broke even despite those very significant financial impacts Our outlook for the business Ill try to just make this very quick Were really focusing on the profit pools in Europe Looking at those segments that not only have volume but more importantly provide really healthy contribution margins were oriented our cycle plan on those And that will require a lot of adjustments and we can talk about that in QA We really want to expand our performance lineup not because we are gear heads but because we found that in mix and rates this is a really huge opportunity The people that own those vehicles we compete very successfully with luxury players We launched RS today its cheaper than the equivalent Audi And we can do better volume than them and very good margins even on a mainstream product like Focus And we will continue to expand this area I think the luxury players have done a great job You can buy an ANG ph badge by itself And I think how we democratize this for the higher transaction content will be a key part of our future business here in Europe And obviously we want to continue to expand and invest in the commercial business because of our success our reputation and our capability On the brand side we want to really move to brand much more to emotional space In the past weve been trying to compete on technology And although thats very important for customers in Europe its become less of a differentiator in the space that is unique to Ford In the Smart Mobility space that may be the exception but for the brands this is more emotional heavily utility support derivates that are higher transaction place that have more of an opinion This is the area where were going to move the brand more and more On the cost side we have a lot of activity going on Site reviews product line reviews commodity reviews with our suppliers the cost and being fully competitive with our competitors or even better than them in Europe is a key part of our management teams effort And we have many energy rooms and crossfunctional teams working on every part of our cost And so on key part we want to be a benchmark cost competitors here in Europe and theres a lot to do SUVs is a big part of our story here And in Geneva we committed to having five new SUV or Crossover products to compete in those spaces over the next couple of years And thats a big shift for us Its also an area of competency for Ford globally Believe it or not our share in these segments in Europe underrepresented compared to our overall share I mentioned performance all the way from GT down to a Fiesta ST We feel this is territory that we can own thats unique to us that we can continue to move those mix and rates up not just for these products but for also the content that we develop uniquely On Smart Mobility I dont want to give you a lot of a lot of time on this because its a company initiative and I think its important what we do not what we say Were in the pilot phase all over Europe with were actually running our own peertopeer service in London were trying to do that to learn frankly Were actually doing same thing in Germany where weve got cars in our own fleet And its been very important learning for us as a company But I think that theres complete uniqueness in Europe on the Smart Mobility space BlaBlaCar is a very important company to watch They have I think million users and unlike Uber and in US its a very different model It started as nonprofit and its a car pooling service And it works really well I think that kind of service really fits in ease of Europe uniquely Second was connected commercials vehicles offering fleet management to small companies there is a lot of opportunities in Smart Mobility space because those customers are willing to pay for those services So the key takeaways Were continuing make progress yearoveryear and on our financials thats not enough Obviously we want to take advantage of the Smart Mobility space in Europe and maybe slightly unique here We are just launching our CD products I didnt take a lot of time to explain that but these are high revenue products that just coming to market now So in the second half of year will be a good revenue lift for us because of those products to continue expand crossover and SUV lineup and continue to take advantage of our leadership in commercial vehicles including the enough of pickup product here in Europe the Ranger and is doing very well And in summary is the year of growth innovation for us and importantly financial progress Our guidance I think you know very well In Europe I think the guidance is twofold first we are committed to improve profitability yearoveryear and second of all we see the market between and thats is kind of where the third quarter seems to be playing out so far Why dont we kick it off with a couple of questions I was hoping to ask you kind of a longer term question If you think about the way the business is going to change over the next and years and if you maybe highlight indiscernible use Volkswagen as an example in terms of how your ASPs track and what is that gap today There are so many categories in the market particularly in Europe that are very competitive Is that expected to change and if not how are you expecting to do well in that context And then lastly we keep on hearing about Smart Mobility shared mobility the ability of automakers to mine data that automakers have But no one really in our position thinks about Ford in the same context as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>or Uber or any of these other opportunities that are valued very highly So could those things actually be financially material to Ford and how would you get there Great question I think you covered the real essence In the shortterm the regulatory contents that we have to look at including electrification is of course probably one of the biggest issues for our industry and I think we have a good plan there and we can talk about in more detail But if you look a little bit longer horizon I think there are couple of key things For mainstream manufacturer like Ford you have to pick where you compete very very carefully I think in Europe this is a particular point and important decision for the leadership team and the business I think CD is a great example of an area where we as a component thats an area where the Company has some natural competency But its hard to not invest in other areas So I think being smarter and more objective about where we put that investment is really key trend for us as a company And as I said thats going to play out here in Europe especially I really think that Smart Mobility is very large space Of course it covers so much from automated cars and data analytics as you mentioned the connected regular car to so many other things But really there is a couple of key points I think that transportation wallet a big transportation wallet buses public transportation people buy their own cars The part that is an individual customer buying an individual car is a big wallet is a big number So the opportunity I think for Ford is its very well positioned in the space I believe because of the management team has this experience we think and maybe a small example of North America But I saw it personally change our brand image and the feature change the content the preference of purchase to Ford And I think this is the same leadership team We really lean into the space because we have that specific experience And I believe on the commercial for example in Europe there is tremendous topline revenue growth for us that I dont see a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>or an Apple or others doing But we have to be again smart about deploying our capital on our course smart about where we compete in that space and who are our partners which will be increasingly important And there is a lot to talk about on that space I think if you transform our fixed marketing investment because of the ownership If we make the ownership experience to a mobile phone we almost never talk to an owner once they own the vehicle If we can transform the frequency of interaction with the customer which is very realistic with the connected car and a great set of feature content we can really change a loyalty model in our company and that will really change the fixed marketing and marketing paradigm And then there is I think Rod there is a lot there so I dont want to go on too long The other thing about Smart Mobility when you think about as the economics of the electric car weve always thought about the electric cars one person buying in But Smart Mobility can give us could be a game changer on electrification ownership Multiple people use it are renting it That cost can differ of the more people and investment is just different And I think weve seen that in houses where theyre paying ph and a lot of things So I think this is especially for us as a brand this is a very important to understand for our electrification lineup frame competing in our space I would say those are the key regulatory costs or something that were right on the horizon right now And we see a bit of a different reality in commercial vehicles in terms of pricing versus passenger cars And really thats another reason why we are so good on cost Because we have to do everything we can on noncustomer facing content to get that cost down so we can absorb that cost thats coming our way a portion of which the customers may not be able to willing to pay for we should at least approach to the business that way I guess in terms of I did ask about this bridge of perception also Ford brand and Volkswagen and there was a lot of there is a fairly dramatic transformation of where the Ford brand was positioned versus Toyota and the Japanese OEMs and North America Is that something that is quantifiable You can give us some sense of what is the opportunity I think you are looking at now that could Its a great question that one I was personally involved in Obviously situation is a little different here but we track of metrical favorability brand favorability is probably the highest correlation to revenue whether you are taking a pricing or share or whatever Brand favorability which is the people or the percentage of people have a very favorable opinion of the market itself not a nameplate but the brand And it comes to life and also its a way as you can see then research when we reel the brand and what happens with the pricing we know with the new model And weve been managing the brand health through that metric for eight plus years now And our beat financially in the US was a lot on pricing side as you know And we had a pluspercent increase in favorability and completely separated ourselves from where we have been and actually beat Toyota during their crisis around their quality In Europe we saw a similar improvement in favorability but the gap is not as large its not doubledigits but in Germany and its different in different countries In France we didnt see the same lift in the UK were absolutely the leading brand in brand inventory right now actually equal to Volkswagen And so each country is different Germany is probably one of the ones we watch the most and in Germany weve spirited ourselves but GM has gotten better but were still much above GM but still a large gap to Volkswagen For different brands that plays different just as Volkswagen and Skoda you can trade off different brands as well on the favorability But weve seen an improvement and weve seen improvement in our price position because of it not only on the commercial side but also in the passenger car side with fresh product Question is what do we do next So we got a lift there is still a gap what you do now And I think for me and the organization Im especially focused on the inventory gap to the semipremium players like Volvo and even the premium players because the reality is were competing with them And so we challenge ourselves since Ive been here for nine months is whats the brand direction from our product or services thats going to get us competitive with I know it sounds crazy but with premium brands And I think its important to have the aspiration out there because to move favorability to the next level we really think based on our research that that will be more on the emotional territory And I know every brand says that but Ive been doing this a long time And to emotionalize the brands in reality is a very tricky thing but it can be done When I look at the intensity of our sports performance customers and this is not a small business in Europe If you look at Audio or Mercedes or BMWs mix of their sports series it is not a small mix It could be plus percent of their business in some vehicle lines When you look at the favorability of Ford customers who want one of those kind of products and luxury competitors there is no favorable gap Its interesting utilities very similar phenomenon very similar phenomenon on CDs So for smarter than investing in derivatives of our mainstream products and choose the right segments where we can compete successfully with them I think Rod we can improve our favorability but it requires some tough choices on our capital Does that mean that Ford youre aspiring to be a higher market share company It seems like theres a bit of a disconnect if youre saying that youre going to be picking your spots and focusing on the areas where you can really distinguish yourself versus all these other mass market areas that you need to compete and their different business models that youre looking at for attacking the more competitive segments or is there what sort of the plan in ensuring that Its a great question and very logical one I wish I could you give you all the details but I think its for another day because were soaring through But I absolutely think theres I know from experience that theres a way to do it I think on the volume products this derivate strategy is very important for us On the utility thats a capital allocation opportunity for us And those are high volume segments in Europe Look at Captur Qashqai and Kadjar even within premium look at GLA these are mainstream segments for the competing volume with B and C sized monthly volumes And then the commercial side is also very high volume product So dont want to get in all the details but I think Rod theres I think if were very smart when were very smart about allocating our capital and going to market and the way we invest our capital on how those products come to life in the services I do believe theres a way for us to accomplish both things Do you think that theres an opportunity to achieve you talked about plus margins for companywide does that something that youre aspiring to in Europe as well Well I think the key thing for us is just first step is for us to get the profitability which is the key milestone for us The next step is to make sure that were attractive within the company for capital I really believe that the European business for a lot of reasons should contribute to the overall company in a way beyond just the profits There are things to learn here that are good for the overall company And its important for us even to have a return thats attractive enough that the business wants to invest in Europe And so we have the specific number in mind I wish I could tell you about that The teams laser focused on that number And were going to get there one way or another And its critical because we want to be a vibrant part of Ford globally Okay If any of you who want to a drive a Mustang here in Europe just let us know Its a really fun thing to do Thanks a lot for your attention Ill give it back to you Rod Copyright policy All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha However we view them as an important
