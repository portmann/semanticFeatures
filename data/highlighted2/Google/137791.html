lower the pricepoint of mobile subscriptions and create a negative competitive dynamic for mobile carriers However Apple can provide a reasonable retail distribution model via its stores and has technologies that it can create to mitigate the threat from overthetop apps The regulatory environment following the FCCs ruling in favor of net neutrality has led to rampant speculation over price ceilings and heavier regulations The environment may allow Apple to create a MVNO The incremental revenue opportunity is around to billion in the initial stages I think Apple could play a key role for mobile carriers assuming Apple can reduce the overhead of operating a direct sales channel and creates competitive features to OTT services For the most part the report from Business Insider could be true Apple NASDAQ AAPL might become a mobile virtual network provider but how this benefits the carriers goes well beyond me Sure to regulators it may increase competition or create a mechanism for keeping pricing in check so lower income households can benefit from more reasonable data pricing but aside from the regulators gaining a more favorable impression on the telecom oligopoly theres really not much more to gain for telecoms If Apple launches an MVNO theres no doubt pricing compression would occur as MVNOs are notorious for competing on price after securing wholesale agreements for data and minutes The markup is mitigated and subscribers are accumulated on the basis of lower pricing However due to recent changes in the regulatory environment theres at least a logical pathway to rationalizing further consolidation in retail distribution The major carriers are splitting hairs amongst each other to gain more market share as the United States is a saturated market Verizon NYSE VZ and ATT NYSE T have extended their presence into traditional broadband which requires frontend investment into more expensive fiber to the premises and has questionable implications for the return on invested capital going forward Maintaining revenue growth and an adequate return on invested capital is a delicate balance and I see no way for telecoms to appease their shareholders by introducing another competitor into the marketplace Every major telecom saw a material decline in their ability to create an adequate ROIC Typically I tend to pay little mind to this metric but given the CAPEX heavy nature of telecoms it makes sense to weigh their return relative to their longterm assets over time In this case I see even more sensitivity to market pricing going forward as a combination of lower margins and further investment into infrastructure has made this industry much more sensitive to competition Personally I would prefer to buy a mobile plan directly from Apple especially if it were to come with better features and lower pricing I think anyone could agree with my sentiment here as the various technologies that Apple could provide will improve the mobile experience in the face of various alternative applications like Skype for phone calls and WhatsApp for messaging The telecoms cant counter overthetop services and perhaps MVNOs or more specifically Apple could be an effective counter to a much bigger problem However the bigger challenge for Apple is gaining the infrastructure that various telecoms have spent billions into building out In fact its not easy to enter into this marketplace unless if you have the resources to build a viable mobile network and knowing this companies like Verizon and ATT have been able to squeeze less viable competitors for quite a while now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL wasnt able to secure wireless data from Verizon or ATT and had to go with the lowertier networks ie Sprint NYSE S and TMobile NYSE TMUS to rollout Project Fi However there could be an opportunity to offload the selling of mobile services to third parties like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Apple which could impact the margins of the major four carriers favorably if they can get Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>to be the major distributors of all mobile services in the United States I make this case because net neutrality rules have created much more regulation for mobile telecoms due to common carrier classification which makes the telecom industry a utility This may lead to pricing controls and various other regulations that will dissuade longterm investment Already the case for investing into mobile infrastructure has dwindled in the face of lower ROIC and this trend will likely continue as price ceilings may eventually be established To mitigate damages from price ceilings or prevention of alternative monetization models ie charging for interconnection the FCC plans to offer tax subsidies and various tax incentives to invest into infrastructure This will increase cost for mobile subscribers Its not clear whether this will be effective because regulation has broadly been interpreted negatively among investors The investment implication for investors For Apple investors this could create a meaningful revenue opportunity depending on how sensitive telecoms are to FCC reform If a worst case scenario occurs MVNOs could be a cost effective alternative for telecoms which implies that Apple would gain a small share of the total revenue for the entire telecom industry over time Apple could absorb a bit of a retail markup for selling a subscription service to iPhone owners in the United States and perhaps Europe as well US telecom operators in generated billion in revenue If Apple were to gain a couple percentage points of the annual subscription revenue from US based mobile carriers I could imagine Apple generating perhaps billion to billion in incremental revenue on top of what it generates from selling handsets Of course this implies that mobile carriers offload even more of their retail footprint to alternative carriers as a cost saving move The reason why I arrive at this figure is because Apples mobile share in the United States is around to If Apple were to gain to of telecom revenue on half the mobile subscriber base the figures vary at around billion to billion I think is a realistic figure but depending on how Apple prices its service it could squander a huge chunk of its wholesale markup Furthermore penetration into the mobile space is going to be really slow so I anticipate adoption to come from early adopters and Apples MVNO will not reach the mass market for a considerable number of years For the most part the stock continues to pullback as there havent been any meaningful earnings related catalysts The MVNO rumors isnt enough to generate immediate excitement from investors the incremental upside from mobile service revenues which tend to have higher margins could add some upside to a business segment that has historically grown in the upper single digits The big four carriers will have to come up with creative strategies to lower their cost of servicing mobile subscribers This may involve integrating MVNOs as a part of a longterm strategy to further consolidate the sales channels in which smartphones and various services are sold I only think of Apples opportunity of becoming an MVNO a distinct possibility due to the broadening regulatory authority of the FCC and the negative implications it has on broadband and wireless services in the United States Integrating alternative channels could be advantageous to telecoms at this specific juncture in time but had net neutrality not created a more tenuous environment for telecoms Apple would never have been given an opportunity to launch its own MVNO I think the incremental revenue opportunity could be material for Apple shareholders going forward however the incremental revenue opportunity is similar to that of Apple Pay or Apple Music Its certainly not another consumer electronics device Source Whats The Likelihood Of Apple Becoming An MVNO Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions
