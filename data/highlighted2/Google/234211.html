iPhone in recent Fiksu data As we proceed through the December quarter Apple NASDAQ AAPL investors are understandably a little antsy about iPhone sales So much depends on how well iPhone does and the comps with last year could prove difficult In this article I give my assessment of the data currently available for this quarter Originally I intended this article to be a straightforward rebuttal to SA contributor Michael Blairs most recent bearish take on Apple focusing on iPhone sales for the December quarter It turned out to be not quite so straightforward In the article Mr Blair uses data from mobile marketing firm Fiksu to arrive at the conclusion that iPhone s and s Plus sales are slower than last years sales of the and Plus for the same amount of time after launch days His data is based on a chart made available on an interesting Fiksu page that has a lot of information on iOS devices The problem with trying to conclude anything from the Fiksu data is that its all presented in terms of percentage of the active devices that are using Fiksu client apps If we assume thats representative of the overall iPhone population the number of iPhones in use theres still the problem of figuring out what the current population is in order to arrive at a specific number for unit sales of the various iPhone models Mr Blair handles this by providing guesstimates of the iPhone populations as of the iPhone launch million and iPhone s launch million I was immediately a little suspicious of Blairs population values since Apple sold a total of million iPhones in the interval from the end of calendar Q to the end of calendar Q I therefore expected the yy increase to be greater than million The problem of determining how many iPhones or Android phones are in actual use rather than just cumulative sales is very difficult For instance another chart that Blair shows from Statista almost certainly overstates the Android smartphone population as of the end of At Googles September event CEO Sundar Pichai stated that the total number of Android device including smartphones and tablets day active users was billion So it seems unlikely that the total number of Android smartphones in use as of the end of could have been million greater than the number Pichai quoted This is just to show that this is a difficult question to answer accurately I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Apple know with the greatest accuracy how many users they have so I believe Pichais statement and I wish Apple would make a similar announcement Lacking such guidance from Apple any estimate of device population is necessarily a guesstimate But I decided to try to arrive at my own estimate I have a spreadsheet that tabulates all iPhone sales from Apples quarterly reports going back to the initial iPhone release To arrive at a population estimate I somewhat arbitrarily exclude iPhones too old to be compatible with the iOS version in use before the release of the newest iPhone Up to the Q release of iPhone iOS was the most current version and iPhone was still compatible So the estimate of current population as of Q excludes iPhone models before the iP Applying a attrition rate yields an iPhone population as of calendar Q of million Applying a similar logic for the Q release of the iPhone s excludes all iPhone models before the s and yields a population estimate of million Applying the Fiksu percentages yields the following sales estimates summarized in the table below which also shows Blairs estimates Even though my numbers came out roughly the same as Michael Blairs theres so much uncertainty in the estimation process that I dont think investors should be overly concerned For one thing the Fiksu data shown above only covers sales performance of new models from time of launch It doesnt say anything about continuing sales of iPhone and Plus I expect the iPhone and Plus sales this season to be larger than for older generations in the past because they are larger screen iPhones that have most of the features of the latest iPhone s and s Plus but are heavily discounted This may serve to explain the statement by Tim Cook during the September quarter conference call that iPhone was the number one smartphone by model in Mainland China Not the iPhone s despite the fact that Mainland China was included in the initial iPhone ss Plus release Fiksu has some data to support this at least qualitatively in another chart on the same page the iPhone Usage Monitor which shows the percent of the total population of iPhones for each model going back to iPhone Note that the percentage of iPhone devices in use stays almost constant from the time of the iPhone ss Plus release This is probably an indicator of continuing strong sales of iPhone Plus after being discounted To maintain the constant usage percentage sales of iP Plus actually need to accelerate in order to keep up with iPhone ss Plus sales I believe that sales of iPhone Plus will more than take up any slack in iPss Plus sales especially among valueconscious consumers in China where Apple saw nearly yy revenue growth in calendar Q There isnt much else for investors to base expectations on for iPhone sales in the December quarter Theres the rather pessimistic estimate of million iPhone sales by KGI Securities analyst MingChi Kuo And theres the Credit Suisse report of November that iPhone component orders are down Down compared to what exactly Last year last quarter last week Who knows But whatever the order decline it doesnt even bear on sales for the December quarter since the iPhones that will be sold this quarter have already been produced But Credit Suisse saw fit to lower their EPS estimate for the entirety of fiscal by despite the fact that we dont even have results from fiscal Q Given how inaccurate and misleading supply chain reports have been in the past this is not what I consider datadriven analysis I commend Michael Blair for taking a datadriven approach in his analysis Its the right way for the bears and bulls on any given stock to engage in constructive dialog But certainly I dont agree with his fundamental outlook Im still long Apple hes still short And I suspect never the twain shall meet I see reasons to be more optimistic about Apples December results despite Kuos estimate and the Credit Suisse report Based on the Fiksu data all the data not just what Blair focuses on Im confident that Apple will exceed last years iPhone sales figures by at least a few percent Combined with improving sales of Apple Watch and the newly released iPad Pro and Apple TV Im confident that overall revenue growth will exceed the top end of Apples guidance Under the circumstances I now consider Apple a Buy
