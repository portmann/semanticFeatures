story is maybe probably nearing an ending As youve certainly heard Yahoo has agreed to terms with Verizon on billion sale of its Core assets ie the stuff that may or may not be worth salvaging from a onceproud web portal behemoth With the two companies moving into the actual nitty gritty of finalizing the deal well hear about all the violent nature of MA in which the conquerer tears apart the conquered to seewhat it wants to keepand what it doesnt One major part of that process will be what becomes of Yahoos lightning rod CEO Marissa Mayer Before we forget while Mayer has taken a beating from a certain snarky finance blog in recent months she deserves no small amount of credit for hauling in billion for her decrepit company and for increasing Yahoos stock price more than during her fouryear tenure Its been something of a nightmare run for Yahoo shareholders but they are walking away with something and thats not nothing But that said almost immediately upon Verizon signing on the dotted line Marissa Mayer will be shoved out the Moon Door of the tech executive penthouse Mayers departure from the new entity is certain for a number of reasons not the least of which being that it should happen Sure Mayer inherited a former mansion that had been reduced to a rickety house but while trying to shore up the foundation she proceeded to fill it with airplane fuel and set it on fire She has become the face of Yahoos struggle so she needs to go away if this acquisition has any hope of success Mayer staying on at Yahoo under a Verizon regime would not be unlike if Angelo Mozilo had been handed the title of Vice Chairman of Mortgage Lending at Bank of America So its more than a little sad to hear Mayer tell anyone who will listen that she intends to stay on in the Purple Kingdom Heres what Mayer said in an internal memo to Yahoo staffers obtained by Kara Swisher The teams here have not only built incredible products and technologies but have built Yahoo into one of the most iconic and universally wellliked companies in the world One that continues to impact the lives of more than a billion people Im incredibly proud of everything that weve achieved and Im incredibly proud of our team For me personally Im planning to stay I love Yahoo and I believe in all of you Its important to me to see Yahoo into its next chapter These kind of memos are tough and shes trying to make everyone feel okay Maybe she just got over her skis and said something she didnt mean But heres what she said to CNBC later this morning She said AOL CEO Tim Armstrong and I are old friends and colleagues and I very much respect him and am looking forward to working with him again Again a nice postannouncement sentiment but also only half honestat best We have yet to see an account of Mayer and Armstrongs time together at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>that paints them as anything butbitter rivals who worked together about as well as Bill Gross and Mohamed ElErianAOL is Armstrongs kingdom and Verizon is buying him Yahoo as a shiny new toy one that he will not be sharing with anyone Mayer does not want to work for Armstrong and Armstrong is does not want to deal with Mayer That is not a great starting point for a new relationship Perhaps Mayer is negotiating in public and hoping to get axed in order to pick up her platinum parachute and pile on a few more tens of millions onto the more than million shes believed to have scooped up in the Yahoo sale But thats literally the best Mayer can hope for here Perhaps she thinks that she might forge a relationship with Marni Walden the Verizon exec in charge of putting this thing together Walden who is sort of Armstrongs boss might share the most superficial of traits with Mayer hair color caucasian not men but she appears to be the antiMarissa in almost every other possible way Walden is a career telecom exec with a flintyeyed revenuebased realism She is not the type to be swayed by Mayers Silicon Valleyinflected philosophizing about staying on at Yahoo to keep making the world a better place One can only imagine Walden taking one look through the details of Marissas Tumblr acquisition and giving her the full Shark Tank treatment We want to congratulate Marissa Mayer on the sale of Yahoo we really do But how can we respect her if she wont go away Banker Who Walked HSBC
