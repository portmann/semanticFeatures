the technology sector which Buffett has largely shunned apart from a poorly performing investment in IBM IBMN Shares of Apple rose percent on the news closing up at Berkshire made its investment in the first quarter before the iPhone maker in April reported its first quarterly revenue decline in years The investment was announced amid an increasing view among investors that Apple may deserve a lower valuation because its heady growth days may be over However Apple has a strong balance sheet and management attributes long favored by Berkshire It makes sense because its a consumer company disguised as a technology company with a great business model strong cash flow and a cheap valuation said Jeff Matthews author of books about Buffett and a principal at the Ram Partners LP hedge fund Its not a leap of faith In a regulatory filing detailing most of its stock holdings Berkshire said it held million Apple shares worth billion as of March The value of the stake has since fallen to about million even with Mondays gain Berkshires largest technology bet has been Buffetts roughly billion stake in International Business Machines Corp an investment now more than billion in the red Apple stock is stunningly cheap and it has a massive pile of cash said Steve Wallman founder of Wallman Investment Counsel in Middleton Wisconsin who has owned shares of Berkshire since and Apple since Apple is not getting credit for research and development it is doing behind the scenes The Apple investment was made by one of Buffetts two stockpicking deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler his assistant said in an email to The Wall Street Journal Combs and Weschler who ran hedge funds before joining Berkshire each invest about billion and usually make smaller wagers while Buffett known as the Oracle of Omaha makes bigger investments such as IBM Investors said Combs may have been the Apple buyer He invested in chipmaker Intel Corp INTCO for Berkshire in Buffetts assistant did not respond to a request for comment In April Apple said revenue for the quarter ended March declined as an increasingly saturated smartphone market hurt iPhone sales which fell for the first time Chief Executive Tim Cook is looking to develop other technologies for the Cupertino Californiabased company and last week unveiled a billion investment in Chinese ridehailing service Didi Chuxing Apples market value last week dipped below that of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>parent Alphabet Inc GOOGLO even though Apple generates roughly triple the revenue and profit Before Monday shares of Apple were down by a third from their April peak Synovus Trust Company portfolio manager Daniel Morgan noting that Buffett is known as a value buyer said That kind of puts the icing on the cake that Apple now is probably considered more of a mature technology company like we would think of Microsoft Intel or Cisco I dont think we can put them in the same bracket right now as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Amazon AMZNO or Netflix NFLXO said Morgan said who owns Apple because of its low priceearnings ratio and high dividend yield Its a value stock that has the potential for a big growth said Steve Chiavarone a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York who also holds Apple stock Hedge fund manager David Einhorn is also a fan and his firm Greenlight Capital on Monday said it boosted its Apple stake by percent in the first quarter Other prominent investors have retrenched Last month billionaire Carl Icahn said he sold his Apple stake on concern about the companys relationship with China David Teppers Appaloosa LP sold its stake in the first quarter while Ray Dalios Bridgewater Associates and Chase Colemans Tiger Global Management slashed their stakes Leon Coopermans Omega Advisors also shed its Apple stake a person familiar with the matter said Despite his traditional aversion to technology sector Buffett told CNBC on Monday that he offered to help Dan Gilbert the chairman of Quicken Loans and owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team finance a bid for internet company Yahoo Inc YHOOO Reuters first reported Buffetts involvement on Friday While Buffett told CNBC he would not be an equity partner he could collect dividends or interest on the financing and perhaps take an equity stake later Buffett has always restricted himself from investing in things he doesnt know or understand and staying within his circle of confidence said Richard Cook cofounder of Cook Bynum Capital Management LLC in Birmingham Alabama which invests percent of the million it manages in Berkshire The Apple investment may have been made with proceeds from the sale of ATT Inc TN stock as Berkshire exited what had
