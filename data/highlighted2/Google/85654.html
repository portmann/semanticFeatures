<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Express is a simple yet brilliant concept There are two solid reasons local stores want <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Express to expand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL has its hands full these days between selfdriving cars <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Drive YouTube <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Maps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Photos and more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Express seems like an odd fit given everything else the company is involved in However the company is planning to roll out Express to many more cities soon If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is successful this business could change the relationship between online and physical retail <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Express is an online shopping destination thats designed to bring customers their favorite local stores selection with sameday or overnight delivery The service currently is available in around cities which is comparable to Amazoncoms NASDAQ AMZN city sameday delivery option for Prime members The basic premise is simple if you live in an area that Express covers like San Francisco you order through the site from the participating stores in the area You choose the items you want from the local stores selection and add them to your cart You check out using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Wallet and you then choose your delivery window <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>then gets your items from the stores and arranges with a courier service for your delivery The fee for Express is a year or a month whichever you prefer and theres no commitment Since you use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Wallet to check out you can choose any major credit or debit card as your payment method You pay the same price as you would in the store but unfortunately you cant use coupons or store only credit cards and there is no price matching option If this sounds eerily similar to Amazon Prime thats intentional Of course for Prime members their per year gets them Prime Music Video and much more However Express gives customers the option of getting sameday delivery on orders of or more while Prime sameday delivery requires orders of or more There are two sides to the reasons that local stores would choose to sign on with the service For national chains like Target NYSE TGT Kohls NYSE KSS or Walgreen NASDAQ WBA this is a way to fend off Amazon Prime and offer a sameday or overnight delivery program For local stores like Palo Alto Sport Shop Toy World the company benefits from a significant online shopping presence that might not be possible on its own For Target in particular Express seems like a natural extension of its growing online presence In the last three months online sales jumped almost annually Targets REDcard is held by just over of its customer base and one benefit is free shipping on any size online order However where Targetcom falls behind its competition is offering a free speedy shipping option Many orders have a delivery window of as much as five to seven days If customers can get the same item from Amazon in two days this puts Target at a disadvantage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Express seems to fill this void nicely However Express carries two disadvantages to Target First <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Wallet doesnt support the Target REDcard This means these customers miss out on their REDcard discount For Target to gain the full benefit of Express the company needs to find a way to work around this limitation Second since Express doesnt allow coupons customers may miss out on deals they could have received in store or on the Target web site This could lead to dissatisfaction later if the customer realizes they missed out on a better deal That being said local stores want <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>to expand Express as quickly as possible With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>arranging the orders and delivery the stores stand to benefit from increased sales that might otherwise go to Amazon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Express is the companys attempt to ward off Amazon Amazon has become sort of the de facto search engine for goods The company is also expanding into services with Amazon Home Services With tens of millions of Prime members and the companys domestic electronics and general merchandise sales growing at annually last quarter Amazon is a force to be reckoned with If customers use Amazon to search for goods and services <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>loses directly As Amazon takes sales from local retailers those retailers may be in less of a position to spend money advertising on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>sites In addition larger profile advertisers may choose to shift their advertising spend to Amazon because of its increased presence On the other hand the more customers that use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Express the more information the company gains about what products those customers are purchasing This detailed purchase information can be used to target advertising more successfully In theory this leads to better response rates and more lucrative advertising deals for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Considering that Googles paid clicks dropped from annual growth last year to just growth this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>knows its search business has weakened Amazon is pulling product searches away and weakening brick and mortar stores that advertise on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Sites The race is on between Amazon and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>to see who can expand sameday or overnight delivery to more cities at a faster rate If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>can outpace Amazon the companys search and advertising growth may ramp back up <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has its hands in a lot of businesses but Express may be the key to dealing with the Amazon threat Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>An Express Route
