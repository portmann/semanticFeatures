dominance is due in large part to the greater vertical integration of the companies relative to competitors The differences in approach to vertical integration in the two companies indicates that Samsung will never overcome Apples advantage in mobile device profitability Samsungs OTCSSNLF June quarter earnings release contained a steep yy decline in its Internet and Mobile IM division operating profit of while IM revenue declined by Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Samsung are considered the dominant players in smartphones due to their vertical integration But the difference in profitability between the companies demonstrates that not all vertical integrations are created equal Based on Samsungs decline in smartphone unit shipments that I wrote about in Samsungs Glancing Blow it was evident that revenue for the IM division was going to be lower IM includes some Internet related equipment sales but the bulk of the revenue comes from Samsungs smartphones tablets and feature phones In this article Ill use IM as a proxy for its mobile device business What wasnt clear was how much operating profit decline IM would suffer as a result In the table below I summarize the relevant results for Apple and Samsung for the June quarter Here Im using Samsungs reported IM revenue and operating income Actual mobile device revenue and income would be slightly lower For Apple I combine reported iPad and iPhone revenues for the Mobile Device revenue category Actual Mobile Device revenue and income would be slightly higher if the iPod Touch was included For operating income I apply Apples corporate operating margin percentage to estimate operating income for Mobile Devices This is probably conservative as the iPhone is generally considered to have higher gross margin than the corporate average From the above results it appears that Samsungs Galaxy S and S Edge not only delivered an ineffectual blow against Apple to some degree the blow ricocheted damaging Samsungs mobile device profitability Judging by Qualcomms NASDAQ QCOM recent earnings call both Apple and Samsung are considered dominant in the upper tier of the smartphone market This is arguably due to the greater level of vertical integration that these companies have achieved relative to their competition Both companies design and engineer their own smartphones and tablets Both companies go beyond this to design and engineer their own systems on chip SOCs that power these devices Custom SOCs constitute an important discriminator for both Apple and Samsung mobile devices Beyond custom SOCs the vertical integrations of the two companies diverge in important ways Samsung has long maintained its own semiconductor fabrication capability and builds its own SOCs Apple is dependent on outside foundries among them Samsung itself Apple deploys its own mobile device operating system based on Mac OS X Samsung has developed its own mobile device operating system Tizen but mostly relies on Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Android for its smartphones and tablets Does the competitive advantage conferred by Samsungs foundry capability outweigh the competitive advantage of Apples selfdeveloped iOS The table above clearly indicates that it does not The mobile device operating system is the key to the user experience The mobile OS brings together all the fundamental elements of the modern mobile device ecosystem including apps services and entertainment content Samsungs dependence on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>for Android is in many ways a carryover of the commodity PC paradigm The OS developer for commodity computing devices develops a generic OS and then throws it over the fence to the hardware makers The resultant user experience is less than optimal In the PC world users put up with it because it lowered the cost of owning a PC Obviously thats still true in the commodity mobile device market but the usability penalties for the approach are more severe Partly this has to do with the greater variety of mobile device hardware platforms Partly this has to do with the technical challenges of tinkering with a mobile device operating system Most mobile device users never tinker with either their hardware or OS but simply live with what theyve bought In assessing Apples competitive position going forward the advantage conferred by iOS is often overlooked Apple critics continue to maintain that Android or Windows Phone is just as good as iOS If that were really true surely Samsung would be in a much better position than it is Part of the problem is really not the fault of Android as a mobile OS but is due to the structural relationship between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and its manufacturing partners To some extent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>siphons off profit from the manufacturers in the form of Android advertising and services revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>keeps the profit from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play for instance and Samsung gets nothing If we accept that Apples control of iOS provides it a competitive advantage then this says something very important about Apples longterm prospects in mobile devices This is because the situation with respect to Android is unlikely to change The current Android device makers are unlikely to successfully develop and deploy their own operating systems or even switch to an alternative Android device makers have made Windows Phone devices but these hardly constitute a viable alternative to Android in terms of sales volume The device makers are pretty much stuck with Android for the foreseeable future This means that no manufacturer in the Android ecosystem has a path forward to overcome the iOS advantage Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks
