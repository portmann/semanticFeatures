class='textDiv'>Introducing Project M Achieving M With Growth Stocks Seeking Alpha Ive created Project M to try and attain a M capital base from growth stocks in years Ill be starting from a base of and trying to attain an annual return rate of just under My approach to investing has been primarily directed at building up a portfolio of established dividend paying stocks and regularly investing in these stocks Ive sought out what I believe to be best of breed companies those with an established track record of paying dividends defensible barriers to entry and superior returns on equity The full criterion behind this portfolio and the key stocks that it is comprised of are listed here Ultimately the aim of this portfolio is to be able to be able to generate a meaningful defensible dividend stream to enable a comfortable retirement and also generate sizeable capital appreciation I also have the ambitious goal of being able to outperform the SP over the long term It has occurred to me however that there are many highquality widemoat stocks in the investing universe that do not pay dividends or pay minimal dividends that have delivered consistent outperformance over a long period of time Many of these have tailwinds which are propelling their businesses forward that my traditional dividend stocks dont have Examples of such tailwinds include the shift from offline to online advertising ie Baidu and the shift from cash to credit ie MasterCard An investor who picked up these businesses at various points would have derived significant returns from such an investment To this end Ive maintained a growth portfolio that has been focused on trying to attain some capital appreciation and which has featured names like MasterCard NYSE MA Visa NYSE V Facebook NASDAQ FB Baidu NASDAQ BIDU and others However Ive never really had any goals or focus for this portfolio It has just really coasted along I happened to recently come across some comments from Jack Bogle the other day where he indicated that the next decade was likely to bring subpar growth for index investors His expectations were for growth or just growth when netted for inflation Based on these things I believe it is prudent for me to more seriously evaluate the existing set of growth holdings that I have and look to structure something that has a good chance of outperforming whats likely to be a fairly modest return from large indexes I also want to bring about a little bit of focus and direction to the portfolio To that end I have set a target portfolio value of M which Id like to attain in years starting from a base of approximately My hope is to achieve an annual rate of return of just under each year over the next decade Of course its entirely possible that I dont achieve this goal but I wanted to give myself a stretch target to aim for I already own almost all the stocks in the portfolio but Im giving myself some time to get the desired amounts and weightings that Ive outlined below That time will also be used to lock down the final holdings I want the portfolio to represent businesses that have strong barriers to entry and are also seeing rapid growth These businesses should have the best chance of being bought and just held onto for at least years while seeing strong capital return I dont envisage much if any active trading in this portfolio once Ive locked down on my core holdings Once finalized I dont anticipate adding additional capital to any of the businesses that have been included in Project M on a regular basis Rather I will only be adding to the holdings in the event that any of these stocks happen to be trading at values that get them a star stock rating by either SP or Morningstar to the extent applicable In addition to companies with wide moats and strong barriers to entry I set a specific focus on companies with high returns on invested capital and that were generally achieving doubledigit growth with respect to net income and earnings per share My thinking here was that these types of companies would be likely be able to continue earning above double digit earnings while maintaining their market multiples and thus generate strong rates of capital growth I want to introduce the first set of names Ive chosen for Project M These companyies are MasterCard Visa Priceline NASDAQ PCLN Baidu Mercadolibre NASDAQ MELI and Facebook MasterCard and Visa While the level of cashbased purchases has been steadily declining in developed economies MasterCard cites a global credit card penetration of just There are likely years of growth to come in addressing the of global transaction volume that is still cashbased MasterCard and Visa are going to be the biggest winners and biggest beneficiaries of this trend in my view Baidu My central thesis behind my decision to include Baidu within my growth portfolio is that Baidu is the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>of China Typically search engines with the largest scale tend to dominate searches and ad revenue This is the model that has played out in the US and I expect the same to occur over time in China Baidu controls close to of the search market in China today The market for search grew almost in Baidu will benefit from the continued move of Chinas population online and the ongoing trend for advertisers to shift offline advertising online where people are spending more time As disposable incomes in China accelerate so too will online advertising spend Baidu should be a net beneficiary of these trends Baidu has also launched a number of new mobile services recently including a mobile cloud offering and mobile navigation all of which should increase the stickiness of mobile search users if not contribute to incremental revenues Priceline provides one of the largest travel commerce portals globally While online travel services seem like they have been around for quite some time we are still in the early stages of a revolution in online travel Online travel agents still account for less than of global travel booking although the trend is strongly accelerating towards online Of the online travel agents Priceline is the dominant player in this space and has close to of total market share The global travel market is a very large yet highly fragmented space and is valued at over T in size So even though Priceline has a B valuation my feeling is that the company can continue moving higher particularly given recent growth has been in excess of annually Facebook offers advertisers the ability to get cross device insights on a large user population with just one media buy That should lead to compelling monetization for Facebook over a long period of time Facebook is and will likely continue to be a highly relevant platform for advertisers well into the future People spend more time on Facebook than any other platform Facebook has roughly B monthly active users and over B daily active users which make it relevant from the perspective of a regular and engaged user base Worldwide major ad spend topped B in and onlinebased ad spend still only captured a relatively small of this spend Facebook will likely continue to be the advertisers choice for engaging with users online Mercadolibre is emerging as the Ebay of Latin America conducting a greater volume of ecommerce than Ebay or Amazon in the region Ecommerce is in its infancy in Latin America and accounts for just of total commerce in the region or a market of about B In fact internet penetration in Latin America runs at just However I expect internet penetration to steadily increase in the region over the next few years as will the user propensity to purchase online Increasing incomes per capita should also see steady growth in transaction size and total basket size of online commerce in the region Compounded year revenue growth for Mercadolibre has been in excess of recently with return on equity consistently in the midteens or higher These are trends that I see continuing With that said here is how the portfolio currently looks I will provide the rest of the trades and portfolio composition
