mitigate some of the impact The tax issue is occurring on multiple fronts which raises questions about whether Apple will continue to report its current tax rate going forward The market is discounting the stock due to taxes trouble with iPhone shipments and weakening market sentiment Given all of these factors I remain bearish on companyspecific fundamentals and find little reason to anticipate a recovery in Apples valuation Without product refresh and improvement to gross margins the companys fundamentals will not recover As such I remain bearish on the stock I guess one must begin to wonder when Apple NASDAQ AAPL will eventually confront international tax issues given its low effective tax rate in FY And yes this issue of Apple mitigating taxes is somewhat politically contentious which isnt really the nature of my article However what I do want to suggest is the reality that Apples effective tax rate will eventually increase given the changing EU regulatory climate which is another negative headwind facing Apple shareholders going into FY On minutes with Charlie Rose Tim Cook blew up with regard to the topic of international taxation In a sense I can understand Tims frustrations because quite frankly no one wants to pay more in taxes and he does have a fiduciary duty to shareholders to lower the tax bills whenever possible Nonetheless the issue of taxation has been looming over the heads of Apple shareholders for quite a while now and its worth mentioning that Tims response was somewhat juvenile when he said that is total political crap in response to Charlie Rose citing some of his notes Of course Tim could have gone into a more elaborate explanation on his responsibilities as a fiduciary but instead he pulled a quick jab Is it just me or is the CEO of Apple starting to get more irate these days He also fired back at analysts on the Q earnings conference call as he denounced the conservative forecasted assumptions of every major investment bank analyst on the call Not a really smart move In fact it prompted me to reexamine the credibility of Tim Cook as hes quick to criticize the products of other competitors and had even more optimism for the iPad coming out of FY than what was realistically warranted Sure we can acknowledge that Apples CFO does all the number crunching and he does a pretty good job However were confronting a higher probability of weakening iPhone sales and fullproduct maturation given the broader weakness in handset shipment growth on aggregate At this point longerterm replacement cycles could become the new norm as Ive encountered numerous people wanting to wait a while before replacing a handset Of course this is all anecdotal but its worth thinking about Furthermore these patterns have yet to be set in stone and could quickly change depending on the types of products Apple is currently developing in secrecy from the public eye However before becoming sidetracked on the topic of whether Tim Cook does have enough foresight to run the business he does need to address to shareholders what additional steps need to be taken in order to address broader tax issues The US Congress is pretty incompetent so holding out for some tax break for money brought home seems like a fantasy we all dream about before we wake up the next morning In a recent note from Credit Suisse they elaborate on broader international tax reform I cite the highlights of the report However it looks like companies are facing a tougher tax environment and its coming at them from a number of different angles including the OECDs effort to tackle base erosion and profit shifting the UKs diverted profits tax ie the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>tax Ireland shutting down the Double Irish the EU going after sweetheart tax deals the Treasury department chipping away at inversions tax reforms disputes with tax authorities negative media attention public scrutiny increased transparency etc But keep in mind even if the US were to continue to sit on its hands when it comes to tax reform US multinationals would still be impacted by all the changes taking place overseas Its simple countries around the globe seem to be fed up with profits being shifted to tax havens and they could use some additional tax revenue As a result it should get harder and harder for companies to have their profits taxed in just the right lowno tax place ie tax haven In other words Apples tax rate will likely go up given their historical presence in Ireland and the usage of the Double Irish tax loophole While the tax rate has remained stable over the past couple years I cant imagine Apple being able to mitigate taxes as effectively in years past The company also mentions inside of its annual report that things have gotten a little tougher in Europe as of late According to Apples Annual Report The Company is subject to taxes in the US and numerous foreign jurisdictions including Ireland where a number of the Companys subsidiaries are organized Due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change The Companys future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the US and Ireland For example in June the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Ireland with regard to the corporate income tax to be paid by two of the Companys Irish subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid If the European Commission were to take a final decision against Ireland it could require changes to existing tax rulings that in turn could increase the Companys taxes in the future The European Commission could also require Ireland to recover from the Company past taxes reflective of the disallowed state aid However there is some good news as the Double Irish phase out period is six years giving Apple until to fully maximize the tax code On the other hand Apple could end up owing taxes to the Irish government upon the full phase in Thankfully Ireland has a relatively low corporate tax rate of but with the loop hole it was estimated that Apple was paying a minimal tax rate So the tax jurisdiction still offers some relief when compared to the United States However the sustainability of the current tax rate does put some pressure on Apple to sustain top line expansion which I had alluded to earlier The company needs to sustain a healthy top line growth rate to offset the impact as the OECD average tax rate is currently according to Credit Suisse analysis Given Apples international sales mix and Europes composition of the total mix all international revenue is essentially taxed at a lower rate I could imagine a basis point impact on the corporate tax rate which corresponds to as opposed to the current corporate tax rate From what I understand Apple should be able to maneuver earnings into Ireland but Im assuming that they cant report Irish earnings using the lowered provisions for royaltybased income In other words Apple may mitigate some tax increases going forward but the effective tax it pays to governments around the world will likely increase If I had to model my FY estimates using a tax rate my EPS estimate would end up being which would translate into a price target Now Im not changing my price target but it seems the market is already pricing in the impact as Apple will have to pay back the Irish government for owed taxes in future years I continue to reiterate my sell recommendation
