bids due next week on the purplehued tire fire that is Yahoo potential buyers are learning about another bizarre and potentially costly deal struck by Marissa Mayer during her tenure as CEO According to Kara Swisher over at Recode Evita Breadsticks made a deal with Mozilla back in that appears to be transcendently lacking in both foresight and logic Under terms of a contract that has been seen by Recode whoever acquires Yahoo might have to pay Mozilla annual payments of million through if it does not think the buyer is one it wants to work with and walks away Thats according to a clause in the Silicon Valley giants official agreement with the browser maker that CEO Marissa Mayer struck in late to become the default search engine on the wellknown Firefox browser in the US Basically Marissa outbid <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>on a contract that Yahoo maybe shouldnt have even gone after considering it had pivoted away from search before Marissa came aboard and was chock full of terms predicated on the notion that Yahoo would never sell itself Now with Yahoo basically still a speck in Googlesrearview on the search engine highway and up for sale in the most desperate of circumstances Mayers Mozilla deal looks spectacularly bad for an even more amazing reason But dont take just our word for it According to the changeofcontrol term in the agreement Mozilla has the right to leave the partnership if under its sole discretion and in a certain time period it did not deem the new partner acceptable And if it did that even if it struck another search deal Yahoo is still obligated to pay out annual revenue guarantees of million Thats right Mozilla can essentially back out of this thing if it doesnt feel Verizon or TPG or Warren BuffettDan Gilbert are going to make search a major priority for the New Yahoo Who owns Yahoo would indeed be a big concern for Mozilla whose business depends on a robust search partner and the payments it gets from them for making it the default option for users of Firefox About percent of its revenue was due to its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>deal for example which paid Mozilla an annual guarantee of million Spoiler Alert Aint no one buying Yahoo going to make search a priority So what Mayer is left to explain is why companies are bidding in the rumored range of billion to acquire a former search giant that is no longer a search giant Based on that one would thinks that Yahoos remaining suitors are going to maybe cut back on those final bids and thats not even taking into account Marissas moves on Yahoo Japan Alibaba patents or whatever else hasnt come out yet Under Mayer deal Mozilla could walk away and still get more than billion if it doesnt like Yahoos buyer recode If This
