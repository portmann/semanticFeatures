maturity in the US Valuation at current levels assumes continuous strength in the US and rapid growth overseas with increasing profit margins despite a more challenging environment Netflixs NASDAQ NFLX apparent success has attracted competition from tech giants and similar OTT over the top platforms Subscriber growth has stagnated and content has become more expensive to license and produce Netflixs pioneering service has made content cheaper and more convenient for users However the structure of the home entertainment industry remains the same content owners license their property to intermediaries that deliver it to viewers Netflixs technology and content delivery platform is now being readily copied putting Netflix in a weaker position relative to content creators Netflix is no longer unique and it is hard to justify its current valuation in its current form Netflix has announced it is going to spend bn in alone to beef up its content split between producing and licensing shows and movies Company data supporting that hours of viewership in increased in absolute terms is misleading When adjusting for subscriber growth and investment in content which were increased significantly viewership per subscriber for a given number of shows actually fell in a proof that the companys return on investment in content is not paying off The reasons for that are multifold Further we had just finished watching season three of NFLXs leading original content show House of Cards which appeared to be scripted to compete with Ambien David Einhorn Q Letter to Investors First each Netflix original has not been and is not expected to be a slam dunk While viewership shortfalls do not directly create additional costs they will mandate additional production spending Creating more originals in order to keep up with subscriber preferences would be a significant challenge to the companys content development and financing plan It is worth noting that out of the original series Netflix has aired as of year end only one has exceeded the viewership threshold all episodes and only seven more have managed to allure of the viewers chart below Source UBS Evidence Lab Nov survey While Netflix has been investing meaningful amounts to expand its originals library it seems unable to impress its viewers by launching series with higher viewership than Orange Is the New Black and House of Cards shows it launched in and which are now in their third and fourth seasons respectively Second Netflixs main viewership strategy of limited free content that relies on viewers bingewatching is not a sustainable growth strategy Although it appears successful in the case of a handful of hit series these cannot last for more than another years putting pressure on the company to create the next blockbuster In addition by giving the subscribers the option to select their watching windows the company risks losing those that paypermonth only to watch a specific season In contrast Amazon is on a stride to allure viewers through a broad offering of movies and shows Through its Prime membership members get access to select free content or have the option to payperview for a vast library of nonPrime content Other competitors such as HBO Showtime and Starz own broad libraries of premium proprietary content that can be leveraged through their OTT platforms at minimal cost Finally licensing instead of creating content is not a better alternative either As more players enter the internet TV market competition for content becomes fiercer The costlier element in Netflixs supply chain content is also the most vulnerable to pricing pressures Owners of content while restrained by multiyear contracts have the negotiating power and will try to maximize their value through the highest bidder Notably in each geography that Netflix airs a show or a movie it has to negotiate a separate license agreement when it does not own the rights making economies of scale harder to realize For example in January Netflix launched in countries globally without offering House of Cards its crown jewel in many of them because it does not own the rights in every geography All of the above help explain why a staggering of streaming revenues per year is spent on content While one would expect that content cost has a fixed element it takes a given amount to create or license it and each incremental viewer does not warrant additional costs the companys constrained content strategy has given it no other option but to spend aggressively on proprietary content creation Internet TVs growth has led established media and tech players networks internet companies cable providers to consider it their natural space to expand to Netflix will not be able to compete with tech giants entering aggressively the streaming TV market and subsidizing their streaming platforms with piles of cash from their core businesses Prime started as a membershipbased loyalty program for Amazons NASDAQ AMZN online retail business has now surpassed Netflix in terms of content availability and subscriber engagement charts below and with its new standalone streaming TV platform is expected to quickly catch up in term of memberships Contrary to Netflixs newly established subscriber base firms such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Apple NASDAQ AAPL can leverage their vast customer bases and brand appeal in order to attract viewers to their video streaming and internet TV platforms YouTube has recently entered paid streaming with YouTube Red Apple is expanding its music library to video leveraging its large iTunes and Apple TV customer base Either through original content licensing or usercreated content these deeppocketed tech players are posing significant competitive risks to independent platforms like Netflix Netflix is supplementary not competitive to cable and is not in a position to benefit from cordcutting Until recently a cable subscription was required for access to premium network content such as HBO Showtime and Starz On top of the cable cost subscribers had to pay extra every month to gain access to these networks premium content of original shows and new releases In response premium as well as mainstream networks have recently launched their own streaming platforms While seemingly an opportunity for streaming TV in general cord cutting mostly benefits above competitors in particular In other words people would cut the cord for standalone platforms with strong recurring content offering such as CBS or HBO but not for a show they can bingewatch during a weekend While not the main beneficiary of cordcutting Netflix is going to be the primary victim of traditional cables fight against it Cables competitive price and bundle offerings continuing consolidation and promotional efforts and direct offering of its own OTT services such as SlingTV would all pose significant threats to Netflixs allure making its product irrelevant to subscribers needs Finally international expansion while presented as an obvious opportunity is a means to an end that will eventually come at a significant cost Since the company lacks competitive advantage in the core area of content it is striving to create a competitive advantage in the face of global reach that could potentially help it negotiate with suppliers or utilize its proprietary content That is proven by the companys rush to launch in multiple geographies In many of the new markets Netflix has failed to provide subtitle service which in essence makes the product useless for parts of the population Cultural differences have not been taken into account either when launching abroad According to a recent survey by RBS in Japan a key international market only of the subscribers are not at all likely to cancel their subscription and the comedy genre doesnt travel as well as action and drama Valuation driven by longterm contribution margin target The recent announcement of price increases for new and existing subscribers supports the argument that the only viable path to realizing the promised contribution margin by is through pricing The US contribution margin structure we have chosen is to grow content spending plus marketing slightly slower than we grow revenue increasing our contribution margin to by We think we can grow to million members in the US based upon our trajectory to date and the continued growth of Internet TV Netflix Investor Relations Longterm View January As discussed the companys content utilization will not be able to contribute to margin improvement Therefore management is not pursuing domestic expansion as aggressively anymore Instead of pursuing a costly expansion with diminishing returns management prefers to harvest its existing base through a meaningful price increase Given the low penetration of existing competitors Netflix is able to milk its existing subscriber base to prove its ability to improve contribution margins before a price increase can have adverse effects to its revenue and profitability Consequently management sees price increases as the only viable strategy to realize the longterm target of for contribution margin In sum the company is cashstrapped limited by a highly unscalable business model Without the recent price increases its profitability would be at best anemic this year and the target of in overly ambitious Heavy spending for content and customer acquisition in the US as well as variability of international operations constitute the price increases unavoidable Considering all factors discussed we conclude that recent valuation levels are not taking into account specific business and market risks of an evolving competitive industry Wall Street research target prices assume undeterred subscriber growth and operating leverage at increasing ASP average selling price levels However as reality has shown when competition steps in all these factors will tend to deteriorate In a scenario where competition to attract and maintain subscribers intensifies producing and licensing successful shows becomes more challenging and economies of scale are harder to achieve Netflixs stock price could face significant pressure I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions
