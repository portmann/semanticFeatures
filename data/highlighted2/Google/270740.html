class='textDiv'>Why China Is So Important To Microsofts Future Microsoft Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Microsoft made the big concession of allowing the Chinese government to get a custom Windows operating system This goes to show that Microsoft puts a lot of importance over its future in China In spite of the rampant software piracy in China Microsoft still needs that country of billion people to stay loyal to Windows China banned Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Windows for governmentrelated procurement last May The ban was part of a state directive over energysaving measures It was definitely an angry reaction against Microsofts decision to end support for Windows XP The old Windows XP OS was still used by more than of all computers in China Microsofts discontinuation of supportupdates for Windows XP clearly exposed Chinese computers to virus and hacking attacks The Chinese government did not like this and made its displeasure felt Microsoft was previously in danger last year from Chinas antitrust allegations over the Windows operating system Chinas government even helped create its own homegrown OS NeoKylin that it wanted as a replacement for Windows The antiWindows sentiment of China even inspired American PC vendor Dell to sell many of its computers in China with NeoKylin OS preinstalled The obvious threat was that Windows was going to become ostracized in China The screen shot below reveals NeoKylin looks a lot like the old Windows XP operating system of Microsoft NeoKylin therefore was a stern warning against Microsoft that Windows dominance in China is open to government intervention As a Communist country the government still dictates what products that its citizens can buyuse The possible global implication of Chinas mighty government machinery giving away a free Englishfriendly Linuxbased NeoKylin operating system that looks like Windows XP was also little worrisome Windows managed to beat all other Linux OS distributions like Ubuntu before However a China governmentdistributed Linux OS with the aesthetics of Windows XP could potentially reach million PC users within a few years Investors should therefore feel relieved that Nadella is now doing his best to placate the irate Chinese In a marked departure from Microsofts grand Universal Windows design Chinese government institutions will get a special custom Windows OS This deal with Chinas government is different from the distribution deal with Baidu NASDAQ BIDU Microsoft only modified the Windows for Baidus distribution in exchange for using Baidus search engine instead of Bing Partnering up with the omnipotent Chinese government is a likely more beneficial move for Microsoft than the partnership with Baidu Stateowned China Electronics Technology Group Corporation CETC will setup a joint venture with Microsoft for the purpose of licensing and deploying a customized version of Windows CETC is the premier corporation in charge of integrating advanced civiliancommercial technology to improve Chinas Rich Country Strong Army ambition The partnership with CETC is a bigger win than Microsofts previous win to provide custom cloudbased services for stateowned institutions in China throughout its local partners Vianet and Unisplendour It is still best for Microsofts future in China if the computers accessing its custom cloud services are running Windows not NeoKylin My point is that we should all thank Nadella for being the perfect ambassador that finally won the approval from the Chinese political overlords Unlike Cisco NASDAQ CSCO and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Microsoft again enjoys great guanxi with China While it is true that piracy is rampant in China CETCs licensing of Windows could have profound longterm economic benefits for Microsoft A governmentinitiated move to control and deploy authentic licensed Windows could lead to lesser dissemination of pirated Microsoft software in China Windows is important towards Microsofts future CETCs help could go a long way towards improving Window s superslow adoption in China Let us not forget that Microsoft gave Windows an antipiracy feature that could disable pirated or illegal software In spite of its million users Baidus assistance will not help much towards increasing Windows adoption in China Sad but true the ordinary Baiduusing PC owner likely fears the antipiracy feature of Windows The Middle Kingdom has always been a problematic market for Microsoft because of its pervasive software piracy problem The government sector therefore is the better avenue for Microsoft to increase adoption of Windows in China By collaborating with CETC Microsoft investors could expect that the majority of Chinas public sector agencies and stateowned corporations will use a licensed paidfor Windows OS and possibly Office Office Unlike the regular Chinese PC user at home CETC deals with government firms that are unlikely to use pirated software Like in other countries government firms have allocated budgets for their IT hardwaresoftware requirements There were no specific details leaked about this deal with CETC However I believe that China is paying money to license a special customized Windows Microsoft still charges a fee to OEMs to preinstall Windows on new computers The same nofreebie thing could likely be involved with the joint venture with CETC Microsoft would never have acceded to a third party entity getting a modified Windows without money involved CETCs people will likely only customize Window to remove spyingrelated features that Microsoft recently implemented in its latest operating system The CETC joint venture meant Chinas people would accesstest the customized Windows code to check if it meets their security requirements Without this concession Nadella would not have landed this important win for Windows This collaboration with CETC is similar to International Business Machines NYSE IBM decision to allow the Chinese Government to review the proprietary source code of its software products Microsoft is also allowing the joint venture with CETC to offer direct technical supportupdates for governmentowned Windows computers This should help Microsoft save money from aftersales overhead in its China operations China also obviously benefits from this deal with Microsoft I suspect that many private and government Chinese firms created and still use custom legacy software that are dependent on being fully compatible with Windows operating systems With direct access to a custom Windows CETC customers have little need to rebuild or risk breaking their existing software library to work on NeoKylins platform MSFT remains a Buy Without the deal with CETC Windows would have suffered the same ban that Windows incurred last year Nadella is a pragmatic leader that knows how to adapt to political winds Kowtowing to the biddings of Chinese politicians is just part of staying successful in China Even if Microsoft only charges per government computer installation of Windows the partnership with CETC could lead to hundreds of millions of potential annual revenue Googles search engine and core software products are also still banned in China Microsoft could leverage its newly acquired great guanxi with Chinese politicians to get involved gradually in Chinas onlinemobile advertising industry As far as I know the CETC deal did not mention Microsoft removing Bing or Skype for the governmentcentric custom Windows version The issue of Chinas rampant software piracy problem is not that important compared to the possibility of Windows being replaced by NeoKylin OS in consumer and government computers Going forward a user of pirated Windows is still a great potential pair of eyeballs for Bing Ads or Skype Ads A Chinese computer whether using licensed or pirated Windows OS remains a potential gateway for Windows App Store
