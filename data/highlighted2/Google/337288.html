taken recently in San Francisco California Apples new offices in San Franciscos highrent South of Market neighborhood is shown in this undated photo taken recently in San Francisco California SAN FRANCISCO From ApplesAAPLO earliest days executives insisted that employees work from its headquarters in sleepy suburban Cupertino The thinking championed by Steve Jobs was that a centralized campus would put the CEO within walking distance of everyone said Steve Wozniak who founded the company with Jobs That stance may finally be softening as Apple prepares to open chic new offices in San Franciscos highrent South of Market neighborhood which has spawned scores of promising startups Apples decision to plant a flag in San Francisco trafficchoked miles north of its headquarters comes years after similar moves from rival tech firms such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>GOOGLO and LinkedIn LNKDN and marks a turning point in Apples willingness to accommodate workers according to recruiters and former employees The move is one sign of the intensifying war for tech talent and of the overwhelming preference of younger tech workers to live and work in the city with its vibrant nightlife and public transportation The two floors Apple has leased in a building mostly occupied by CBS Interactive offer abundant open space and exposed ceilings the preferred tech aesthetic As Apples Silicon Valley rivals dangled perks to woo workers in the latest tech boom the iPhone maker mostly held firm the company still does not offer free lunch and it was among the last companies to operate shuttles to and from the city Those companypaid charter buses to the valley appeased workers for a time but the novelty has faded said recruiter Andy Price of executive search firm SPMB With rising competition for talent from a new wave of private companies with skyhigh valuations such as Uber and Airbnb Apple must do more recruiters and former employees say Apples attitude has always been that you have the privilege of working for Apple and if you dont want to do it theres someone around the corner who does said Matt MacInnis a former Apple employee who worked on the companys education business and is now CEO of Inkling an enterprise technology company Now MacInnis said they have to compete Apples footprint in San Francisco until now has come largely through acquisitions of companies already based there including Beats Music and Topsy Labs a social media analytics firm After Apple acquired Topsy in workers were surprised that the company did not move those employees to the valley a former Apple employee said Topsys space was large enough for about workers but other Apple employees soon began dropping in to work from the city crowding the office The iPhone makers new office will be in about square feet of rented space at Second St Apples presence in San Francisco will remain modest especially compared to rival Silicon Valley firms such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and LinkedIn The new office is big enough for about workers Apple has said that it had more than employees in the Santa Clara Valley where it is headquartered Apple could opt to move some employees already in San Francisco into the new space such as those from Topsy or Beats The company has advertised for a variety of jobs in the city for workers in machine learning and big data two of Topsys specialties and digital music Beats domain The space is currently under construction suggesting Apple might be ready to move in late summer real estate experts say Demand for desks there could be intense After established tech firms open up shop in San Francisco they often have more workers wanting space there than they can accommodate said broker John Lewerenz of real estate firm Cushman Wakefield <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has struggled to keep workers from swarming its San Francisco office particularly on Fridays The company quickly leases additional floors in its main San Francisco building when they are vacated by other tenants Lewerenz said Apples new San Francisco office appears to be just a small adaptation to some tech workers disdain for the commute of at least minutes to the South Bay said former company executive JeanLouis Gassee But some former employees say an official Apple office of any size in San Francisco was once unthinkable even though the city is home to percent of its workforce second only to San Jose according to a company report For a graphic showing where Apple employees live in the Bay Area see tmsnrtrsQwRZY Apples stance on centralization turns off some job seekers said recruiter Amish Shah founder of Millennium Search who has run across some candidates who rule out the company because of the commute Younger tech workers he said put a high premium on quality of life San Francisco residents now have more options to dodge the commute with a growing number of tech companies in the city recruiters say If companies want to stay competitive and have a shot at hiring the best available talent theyre going to have to be flexible said Jose Benitez Cong a former Apple recruiter who is now launching a startup Before leaving Apple in MacInnis spent three hours a day commuting from San Francisco to Apple headquarters Now he uses Inklings location in the city to his advantage systematically recruiting San Francisco residents tired of long commutes to the valley Russ Heddleston cofounder and CEO of document sharing company DocSend says he has also found an edge by planting his startup in San Francisco He previously commuted to the valley to work for FacebookFBO a notable exception to the trend toward satellite offices in San Francisco They have the social clout to get people to commute he said But if they werent as cool could they afford to have their office in San Jose and get talent to come in Its a real problem Another factor may be that the company has little room left to grow in Cupertino It occupies about percent of the office space in the city of about said Angela Tsui the citys economic development manager The sheer size of Apples work force has prompted the company to grab space in neighboring towns such as Sunnyvale and North San Jose The diffuse office structure has dimmed the allure of commuting to the South Bay said one former employee who requested anonymity to protect professional relationships The old appeal was if you were an engineer at the mother ship you could go to the cafeteria and theres Steve Jobs ordering sushi he said Those days are gone now In Wozniaks view spreading out the teams could infuse new creativity into the company In a recent interview he recalled being a lonely voice of dissent on the companys philosophy of centralization I was the executive who always opposed that he said I felt that you should distribute your divisions and let the teams think more independently Thomson
