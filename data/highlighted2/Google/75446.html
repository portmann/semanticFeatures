plan is necessary because Windows Phone is failing Microsoft buys email app Acompli reportedly for M Do you see whats happening here Ill tell you whats happening Microsoft is preparing to pull a fast one on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL This is Microsoft readying its Plan B for when Windows Phone fails And as it is Windows Phone is failing already its been losing market share since early and now stands at just of the market which is basically nothing Plan B seems to be about taking over Android from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>That is the fast one I am talking about here Android is seen as open source and indeed it is open source in the sense that theres an Android Open Source Project AOSP and anyone can use this version of Android for free in their smartphones However there is an exception to this which is both proprietary not open and paid not free I am talking about the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Apps as well as the licensing to use the Android brand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Apps have turned into a significant part of the Android experience and indeed at times are necessary to provide compatibility to other apps which require their presence to work These apps include These apps make the foundation of the Android experience Many people couldnt even conceive of Android without them But as it turns out theyre not a central part of the free Android OS though they can be necessary to use it to its fullest This is where Microsoft might be trying to come in Its quickly building its own Microsoft apps alternative And indeed there are already clues that it plans to deploy it that way as seen in an agreement with Cyanogen Furthermore in a way the market is still wide open for this Microsoft strategy This is so because the Chinese market which represented of the worldwide smartphone market in still doesnt receive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>apps That is this large market is served by Android but not by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Instead theres a plethora of different app stores included apps etc Thus the Chinese market can serve as a beachhead for anyone trying to establish a credible set of alternative apps And Microsoft seems to be trying exactly for that angle The one problem this strategy faces is that there are many apps which rely on using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>API calls which are proprietary to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Thus those apps can have a problem working with any alternative That said if any alternative captures enough market share its certain that those apps will be rewritten to work with both large constituencies There are a few predictions which can be drawn from this thesis Microsoft will officially bundle these apps instead of just presenting them separately And it will try to have more companies install them in their smartphones at inception However there is a backlash against bloatware in the West and having duplicates for every app is unfriendly As such Id expect Microsoft to first make a large push for a ChinaIndia installed base with its strategy Bing Maps will be a thing APP Presently its included within the Bing app Nearly every <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>app will see a Microsoft equivalent Email to do calendar search launcher with integrated search <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Now etc This is nearly complete Lumia Camera presently on Windows Phone will see an Android version There will also be a gallery app together with Lumia Camera The one thing which remains to be seen is whether Microsoft will forego licensing fees at this point In China and India licensing fees would be a barrier to entry And even elsewhere theyd be a problem before Microsoft has a large market share The priority for Microsoft at this point is to regain a beachhead in mobile where it failed miserably Windows Phone has failed and Windows is unlikely to revive it I believe that the recent urge by Microsoft to set up a credible suite of mobile Microsoft apps is Microsofts plan B This plan includes pulling a fast one on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>by taking advantage of the open source nature of Android to provide a credible alternative to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>apps This might be a risk for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>over time If Microsoft manages to take significant share from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>on Android over time this will allow it to also reinforce its Bing franchise among others As for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>smartphones where Microsoft takes share will be smartphones less prone to do <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>searches It remains to be seen how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>will handle this if Microsoft gets traction for this strategy The answer might lead to a larger component of Android becoming proprietary over time Source Microsoft Is Pulling A Fast One On <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google
