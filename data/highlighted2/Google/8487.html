announced it is working with Xiaomi to test Windows on the Mi Android phone Microsoft will create a custom Windows ROM that will let Xiaomi Mi users replace the Android OS in their phones I think this is a superb killer move by Nadella to infiltrate and profit from the billionstrong user base of Android phones Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT revealed two days ago that Chinas No smartphone vendor Xiaomi has signed on to test the Windows Technical Preview Microsoft will deliver a custom Windows ROM for a select number of Xiaomi Mi Android phone users The said users could then use the said Windows ROM to replace the Android OS of their Mi handset The procedure is very much similar to what Cyanogen Mod and Xiaomi does They create custom ROMs so Android device owners can use them instead of the official Android operating system from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>According to TechCrunch Xiaomi Mi users will need to flash their phone using the Windows ROM from Microsoft Flashing a smartphone means reformatting everything to do a full reinstallation of a phones operating system and system apps This is not a dualboot system that Intel NASDAQ INTC tried to popularize during the CES January event Microsoft and its nemesis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL hated and killed the dualOS venture of Intel and Asus OTCASUUY last year Judging by this latest deal with Xiaomi Nadella is a ruthless and shrewd leader who is directly aiming for GoogleAndroids jugular Creating custom Windows ROMs so that Android phone users can easily replace the Android OS in their phones is an easy way for Microsoft to hurt Googles search and mobile advertising business Letting more than billion Android phone users switch to Windows for free is a faster way for Microsoft to put Bing Skype OneDrive and its mobile ads in more mobile devices than selling Lumia Windows phones The massive lead of Android OS in the global smartphone market means Microsoft has little hope of ever catching up As of Q Windows Phones share was only while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>had Even if Microsoft uses contra revenue free Windows licenses marketing support free Office most top OEMs today will continue to prioritize making Android phones In spite of its best efforts to recruit industry support Microsoft still accounted for of Windows phones sold last year The chart below illustrates why selling Lumia phones is a hopeless tactic against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>The Android ecosystem is too deeply embedded to be dislodged It makes sense therefore that Nadella would try a backdoor attempt to make more people use Windows Microsofts freemium strategy of giving away free software and services is now akin to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Mobile advertising is where Microsoft can make up for the lost revenue from giving away free software The mobile advertising industry where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>dominates is already a billion industry this year and will grow to be a gold mine by The Xiaomi experiment of allowing Mi users to easily install Windows to replace the Android OS on their phones could be a precursor to the final strategy of Nadella The money in mobile ads is just too big to presume that Nadella will not exploit this custom ROM method to steal users away from Googles services and mobile advertisements I speculate that once Windows gets released in countries this summer many custom Windows ROMs for different Android phone models could also be available for download Microsoft is now trying to outGoogle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>with its new freemium strategy The chart from Microsofts chief marketing officer Chris Capossella illustrates this freemium business model Control of the smartphone ecosystem made Apple NASDAQ AAPL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>super successful Consequently the more smartphones that use Bing Skype and Windows the better it will also be for Microsofts overall business growth Nadellas platformagnostic strategy for Microsoft means playing by the rules first set by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Give away free software to attract mobile users engage the users mine the data of recruited users and then monetize them through advertisements However giving away free Android Office Apps is still not the best way to realize Nadellas vision Making sure that people get the ability to use their current Android phones as Windows devices is the best way to do it Nadella doesnt want to rely on sales of Windows phones he wants the buying public to betray <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and eliminate Googles search engine apps and services inside their Android smartphones Microsoft is a nofactor right now in mobile advertising because of the low number of Windows phone users Custom Windows ROMs might change the names on the chart below when eMarketer reports in MSFT is a Buy Nadella can make Microsoft better than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>He is not only putting custom Windows ROMs inside Android phones he will also allow hundreds of millions of people with pirated Windows and Windows software to upgrade for free to Windows The more eyeballs to deliver advertisements to the better it is for Microsoft With or without Xiaomis help the charts below should be enough evidence that MSFT
