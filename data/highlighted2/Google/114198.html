(Uncertainty) </span>Comcast has a movie coming out today called "Minions," testing whether a spin-off cartoon of "Despicable Me" has legs on its own.Comcast has been fairly innovative in marketing this movie, essentially sticking the characters into others' ads, which delivers more bang for the buck.They've even bought Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) boxes.If Minions is a hit, I'll bet Comcast stock gets a bounce.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The problem with shorting a popular stock is that you might have to wait an unreasonably long time to be proven right.
