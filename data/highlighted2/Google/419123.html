shares have delivered solid profits to investors over the past year as the month return of AMZN is And so far in the stock has advanced year to date Shareholders are pretty happy about this as their investment in Amazoncom appear to be paying off in a big way In an attempt to capture some of the profits some of these investors who made big bets on AMZN are selling their shares For example Bridgewater Associates headed by futures trading expert Ray Dalio sold more than billion in Amazon shares recently which works out to of its holdings three months earlier Overall more than institutional investors sold off a total of billion of Amazon holdings last quarter Some analysts believe that future competition will make it more difficult for Amazon to grow its market share so
