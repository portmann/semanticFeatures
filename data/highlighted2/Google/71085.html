Intel NASDAQ INTC at a Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY tech fest in Beijing represents the struggles that all former PC giants are facing and how each is looking to China in a bid to reverse its slide Its not often that anyone uses the term Wintel anymore which refers to the duopoly of Microsofts Windows operating system OS and central microprocessing chips from Intel that dominated the computing world for decades But Wintel was center stage this week in Beijing in a rare case where the CEOs of both Microsoft and Intel shared the stage with the CEO of Lenovo the worlds largest PC maker which was holding a bash to launch a wide range of new products Lenovo has been steadily hyping this event that finally took place on Thursday where it unveiled a wide range of new products like a dualscreen smart watch and laser projector smartphone all of which looked interesting but not too exceptional I wasnt planning on writing about the event at all for that reason until I spotted the photo featuring Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing taking a selfie of himself with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich at the Lenovo Tech World event in Beijing The photo itself was very cute but also quite revealing for its inclusion of CEOs of companies that are all grappling with fading relevance in the fastchanging world of hightech gadgets Whats more Microsoft and Intel are both heavily invested in Beijing the former with a highprofile RD lab and ongoing Chinese investigations against it for tax evasion and unfair competition and the latter with a major new local joint venture in the mobile chip space For all those reasons it wasnt too surprising to see this rare meeting of of the worlds most powerful PC executives on a single stage in Beijing The trio each gave speeches and demonstrations on a wide range of new products and technologies and were also joined at the event by Robin Li CEO of leading Chinese search engine Baidu NASDAQ BIDU Ironically it was the same Baidu that lured away the longtime head of Microsofts large RD Beijing lab last fall showcasing the growing lure of homegrown Chinese Internet giants and fading attraction of global names like Microsoft previous post Wintel was once a feared name in the world of hightech gadgets as the pair of Microsoft and Intel dominated the space through their decadeslong control of the PC market But neither company was very adept at making the move into mobile technology that has become the latest hot computing trend That left Microsoft to lose out to Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Android OS and for Intel to be overtaken by British chipmaker ARM Holdings NASDAQ ARMH and its partners like Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and Mediatek Taipei Intel has been trying to fight back by boosting its efforts in mobile technology and is placing big bets on China through its recent investment in a major chip design and manufacturing venture connected to Tsinghua Chinas leading science university previous post Microsoft has been a heavy investor in China for years and has a major RD center in Beijing but more recently has been dogged by an antritrust investigation and allegations of tax evasion by the central government previous post Obviously its too early to write off either Microsoft of Intel and it would also be quite premature to dismiss Lenovo which is trying hard to parlay its leading position in PCs into the crowded mobile space No one Ive talked to is very impressed by Lenovos nonPC products most notably its smartphones which have still managed to find a big market in China because of Lenovos local clout If I were making predictions I would say that when historians look at this photo of the CEOs years from now they will say the trio represented the fastfading world of tech names associated with traditional PCs which were ultimately replaced by a new generation of companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and ARM Disclosure Author has a
