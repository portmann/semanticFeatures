GMs keynote will have the biggest market impact of the automakers present at CES Expect Ford and Volkswagen to make headlines as well Anton Wahlman is one of Seeking Alphas top contributors on the automotive sector with the occasional authoritative dabble into technology A former analyst with UBS Needham and Think Equity covering the telecom infrastructure industry Wahlman now focuses on researching the automotive industry Ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show CES which will take place January in Las Vegas Seeking Alpha asked Wahlman what he thinks investors should be paying attention to in the new year While the CES floor days are the th through the th Wahlman points out that Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA and Faraday Future host events on the evening of January Ford NYSE F Kia and Volkswagen OTCPKVLKAY are up on the th with General Motors NYSE GM is set to make headlines on the th SA Editor Rocco Pendola RP With that in mind heres what Wahlman expects from GM and the rest of the big three in Anton Wahlman AW I think the GM presentation will have the biggest market impact followed by Volkswagen and Ford The other press conferences are likely to have less significant market impacts Mary Barras January press conference should be epic Its the first time a GM CEO has keynoted CES And in many ways GM has the most interesting nearterm agenda for In terms of what we know the best its all about the Chevrolet Bolt This or less before tax adjustments mile range pure batteryelectric vehicle BEV will be introduced on January and is widely rumored to enter production in the fourth quarter of The Chevy Bolt will be the first practical family mile range BEV sold near this price You may remember how Teslas NASDAQ TSLA investment thesis has evolved over the last year As of the thesis was Tesla would have a multiyear timetomarket advantage in making a mile range EV for As of the thesis becomes Tesla will be at least one full year behind GM in delivering a mile range EV for Thats huge but the story doesnt end there GM has said very little for this purpose practically nothing about building a longdistance DC charging network to compete with Teslas supercharging network Will be the year when GM presents such a plan That would presumably be in cooperation with other automakers One the regular car front there are five major cars entering production Cadillac CT This is the sedan flagship made in both Detroit and China Cadillac XT This is the smalltomidsize SUV Buick LaCrosse This is the new Buick flagship sedan Chevrolet Cruze This is GMs bestselling small sedan Ford just announced in December that it will be investing billion in developing electric cars by in addition to the models already decided upon Its not clear whether any of these models will enter production in probably not but perhaps before is over we may begin to see some hints about whats in the pipeline Ford looks ready to unveil in its January press conference the refreshed Fusion midsize sedan and it will of course come in a plugin hybrid PHEV version perhaps with a muchimproved battery to better compete with the Chevrolet Volt Ford is also likely to unveil on January its upgrade path to Android Auto NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Apple NASDAQ AAPL CarPlay for its infotainment system SYNC which entered production in five nameplates over the last six months The second quarter of also brings the next version of SYNC which will include an embedded G LTE modem so that these updates can be done in the future over the cellular network instead of WiFi model year Ford Escape This is the bestselling small SUV FiatChrysler Automobiles NYSE FCAU FCAU starts off with a longoverdue Bang The allnew Chrysler Town Country minivan will be introduced on January and it enters production shortly thereafter The current Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town Country minivans are very long in the tooth and while they continue to be practical and represent a good value they have fallen behind the competition from Toyota NYSE TM Honda NYSE HMC and Kia in design and technology Perhaps near the end of Chrysler will also make available the plugin hybrid version of the Town Country minivan having it compete against the Tesla Model X Of course the Chrysler will be half the price and have a larger interior It will also carry a normal roof rack for those who want to use one and have no range anxiety The doors will be proven and reliable The fetish inside FCA right now is the return of Alfa Romeo Theres a sales target of cars per year by which pretty much everyone looks at as pure fantasy The first Alfa sedan model the Giulia is scheduled to arrive in US dealerships late I think every auto enthusiast is naturally rooting for Alfa to succeed but I have yet to meet any auto journalist who believes it will actually be successful Whats saving FCA right now is Jeep For the first eleven months of sales were up in the US and in Europe just to mention a couple of choice geographies With that it seems strange that we are not seeing more new product to replace some of Jeeps aging product portfolio The same thing goes for RAM I think FCA should invest in order to not lose their grip on those two brands RP Outside of the big three Wahlman thinks all eyes will be on Volkswagen for two reasons AW The swing factor on the dieselgate scandal is huge There are geographical differences Europe versus USA And there are different costs related to the physical recallsrebuilds as well regulatory fines and the cost of the numerous lawsuits For starters it will matter a lot whether the recall will mostly be a matter of a software update as proposed for most of Europe or whether there will be some heavier rebuild required I cant think of a bigger headache faced by any large automobile vendor in at least a generation Volkswagen has talked so much about its plans for various electric cars in recent months its hard to keep track of what constitutes the latest and greatest longterm plans One day its models by another day its another models for So I guess that makes I think I cant be blamed for any confusion here given the lack of clarity in the messaging We obviously know that VW will introduce the new hippie bus minivan on January and that it will likely enter production as early as late if all goes well Furthermore there is the question of whether VW will rely on privately held Kreisel for a new family of EVs that will launch by before VWs allnew electriconly platform starts production in late or Volkswagens premium brands Audi and Porsche have been much clearer about their plans We know the Audi crossoverSUV eTron Quattro will enter production by early as a fairly direct Teslacompetitor and miles of range We also know that Porsche will enter production with its fourdoor allelectric sports car in either or RP Now onto Tesla specifically a company Wahlman follows closely and writes about most frequently on Seeking Alpha Given that his Tesla articles trigger some of the most spirited comments sections on SA we challenged Wahlman on his TSLA bearishness In particular we wondered if electric vehicle competition even matters to Tesla given that it knows its market rich people on the coasts and as long as those people remain loyal Tesla will be the Apple of the EV world AW Thats obviously true But there are shades of gray here Clearly Tesla is today a highend brand and every new car wont be considered with it That said there are at least three counterarguments to that in turn There are actually a whole bunch of people who crossshop and EVs The reason is simple and in no ways analogous to any other car crossshopping psyche Someone wants an EV perhaps to get into the carpool lane They have the means to buy a Tesla but dont really want it too wide too sensitive with the aluminum too flashy just against spending on principal whatever However the EV just doesnt have the range they need So they buy the Tesla But if the had been just a little bit better or miles of range instead of or they would have gotten it instead So in that sense they very much compete for the buyer Tesla is a car today But the bulk of the companys valuation comes from the promise of delivering a car by the end of They will show it this March Im sure it will be beautiful As such it very much matters when competitors show off new EVs because they will compete headon with Tesla in about two years from now And in GMs case theyre one year ahead assuming Tesla delivers on time They will swear they will but in the end you saw what happened with Model X Two years late The competition isnt ONLY sub cars Two years from now early Audi will deliver the first headon direct competition for Tesla with a mile range crossover It will surely be more than perhaps around And then a year after that BMW Mercedes Jaguar Infiniti Lincoln Jaguar Land Rover and Volvo among others will too RP So with all of this is mind doesnt a large EV market particularly with viable options and wellknown brands in the mix benefit Tesla Pandora NYSE P likes to say that all of the competition it faces validates its business model Fitbit NYSE FIT might argue maybe it has that the Apple Watch is a good thing because it draws attention to wearables and upon closer inspection consumers will realize that Fitbit is the better choice for a healthfocused smartwatch Cant we apply the same arguments to Tesla AW I think there is some truth to that but I think its dwarfed by the other side of the equation Increasing competition will also expose the longterm margin expectations for this business If industry net margins are it will be increasingly difficult to base longterm Tesla projections on or net margins And thats when playing against competitors who have greater scale economies Ultimately it comes down to profitability not having won a profitless victory in some small segment of the market prestigious as it might be RP You talk a lot about incar entertainment systems I thought Ford had an entire team of tech guys working on this But it seems its all about integrating somebody elses a tech companys platform Do we ever get to a place where across vehicles there is a reliable and uniform solution Or is it simply I plug in my iPhone and Car Play works or I plug in my Android and Android Auto works So the car becomes an extension of these existing operating systems were familiar with and nothing is proprietary to the automaker AW This one is easy All car companies are throwing bigger resources on this Some very much GM Ford VWAudi and Mercedes Others less FCA comes to mind choosing instead to rely on suppliers In the end the result will be all the same Every car will have three buttons for the infotainment experience The Automakers own button the Apple button and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>button The automaker needs its own space for things where it does not give access to Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>such as vehicle health diagnostics and management The automaker is also likely to replicate services also offered by AppleGoogle such as maps and multimedia Remember <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Apple are not nearly as strong outside the US and more or less banned to varying degrees at least for some services in some countries China You also have to be prepared for what to do if things change BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY exited Pakistan perhaps India too and perhaps some country will effectively ban <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Apple too You can imagine conflicts over anything from encryption to liability for all sorts of crazy things Neither the iPhone nor Android existed years ago Automakers plan to keep these cars on the road for the next years They cant make their cars be dependent on what happens to Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>What if they start making their own cars and stop supporting GM Ford Honda or Volkswagen So the automaker needs to retain its own safety valve even if its consumers end up using AppleGoogle
