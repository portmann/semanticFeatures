market over the past few years Unfortunately the company that was at one point in time on top of the smartphone industry is now struggling to make smartphones sell Now it seems as though the company is now taking another big hit from Facebook and Whatsapp However should you be interested about this Today well talk about the news that we heard from Facebook and Whatsapp how investors reacted to the news and whether or not BBRY investors really should be worried about this change Early this morning it was announced that BlackBerry received word from Facebook that Facebook and Whatsapp will no longer support the BlackBerry operating system Essentially the updates required to keep the apps running on the OS simply arent worth the time since there are few phones that actually operate on the system when compared to the overall market Considering the fact that Facebook is the worlds largest social network and that Whatsapp is the worlds largest mobile instant messaging app many believe that this will be a huge blow to the smartphone business at BBRY However is that really the case Considering the information above investors are worried that the fact that Facebook and Whatsapp wont be supporting the BBRY operating system However in my opinion the concerns are not validated The truth is that BlackBerry realized late last year that its operating system simply wasnt making the cut Sure BBRY had incredible technology and the security offered by the smartphones is great However the QNX operating system needed work and simply couldnt keep up with the popular operating systems like Android and Apples iOS As a result last year BBRY launched a new product known as the BlackBerry Priv This was a smartphone like nothing else on the market The Prive includes the incredible hardware and security that BlackBerry users have fallen in love with and is run on the Android operating system Discover the secret to uncovering the most profitable stocks When the Priv was first launched orders came in at such a rate that BBRY had a hard time filling them In fact BBRY was forced to delay shipments of the Priv because of the overwhelming demand for the smartphone As a result it has been announced that the company will be creating more phones along the same lines BlackBerry will be using its own QNX operating system in areas outside of the smartphone industry and taking advantage of the Android operating system for future smartphones As a result the fact that Facebook and Whatsapp will no longer run on BlackBerrys QNX operating system is essentially null when it comes to BBRY sales As mentioned above some investors are concerned that Facebook and Whatsapp will no longer run on the BBRY operating system As a result were seeing slight declines in the market today Currently the stock is trading at per share after a loss of or thus far today What We Can Expect To See From BBRY Moving Forward Moving forward I have an overwhelmingly bullish opinion of what we can expect to see from BBRY The reality is that the company has unlocked the door to smartphone sales with the Priv and since they plan on continuing with the Android operating system Im expecting to see more strong movement in that area On top of that you would be surprised to hear that its QNX operating system is being used in traffic lights medical equipment manufacturing equipment and more At this point it seems as though the company has come up with a plan that will help to drive profits Where do you think BBRY is headed moving forward and why Let us know your opinion in the comments below
