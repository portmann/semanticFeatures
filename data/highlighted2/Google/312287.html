were share well above the the Street was looking for and a whopping more than Q Paid clicks rose by more than a third while FCF rose to for the period In short just about everything looked great with the possible exception of CPC which dropped The stock jumped AH and just like that Alphabet was the worlds most valuable stock surpassing Apple As we noted at the time this happened on the same day that FaceBook blew past Exxon as the third most valuable stock Everythings working in Googles favor right now James Cakmak an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt Co said Since Monday Apple regained the top spot in terms of market cap but given the fanfare its worth taking a look at how the two most valuable companies in the world stack up to the rest of the field on a variety of trivial things like revenue and net income Thats FactSets topic of the week and as youll see below when it comes to raking in money nobody does it like WalMart This past Monday after the bell Alphabet reported EPS of for Q which was above the mean EPS estimate On Tuesday Alphabet closed the trading day with a market value of billion which vaulted the company above Apple for the largest market value in the SP index Since Tuesday Apple has regained the top spot in in the SP index in terms of market value However the companies are ranked and on this list based on yesterdays closing prices at this time Given their

billion Alphabet is ranked on this list with total revenues over the past four quarters of billion In terms of net income over the past four quarters Apple holds the top spot for highest net income at billion Alphabet holds the ninth spot on the list with total net income over the past four quarters of billion At this point in time Apple is a larger company than Alphabet in terms of market value
