class='textDiv'>The FacebookDriven Rally Seeking Alpha Why is the SP constantly stalling Will the market crash This is on the mind of everyone Let us look at the sentiment courtesy of StockTwits to get an idea Sentiment seems negative for the SP NYSEARCA SPY Usually that is an indication that the shorts will get their heads ripped off but lets keep going Ah this is an interesting observation Why are people bullish on the Nasdaq NASDAQ QQQ but bearish on the SP Something does not click What stocks are propping up the Nasdaq Well one of the primary culprits is Facebook NASDAQ FB but we will get into more of this a bit later With a five percent weighting it has been one of the major stocks propping up the Nasdaq So here is the concern Can the Nasdaq continue to climb higher while the SP continues to struggle along Below are two charts of Nasdaq and SP Usually Nasdaq will lead then SP will follow Dont interpret these as technical signals because they are not In order to get back to previous levels Nasdaq needs to move close to points However the SP is at its previous levels This pretty much aligns with the above sentiment of the indices but it is an incomplete picture Those who voiced their opinion really did not take the time to understand the correlations of both indices and how they impact one another Now an interesting fact you might not know is that for every two points the Nasdaq moves the SP moves one point Its not exact its an approximation Now it begs the question can the SP move an additional points This would take the index from its current level of approximately to This would drive the SP to new alltime highs My conclusion is something is going to crack When we dig a little deeper we have economically sensitive stocks such as Caterpillar NYSE CAT continually declining Now if the SP is a measure of the economy and the GDP has been declining then the index should mirror Caterpillar Unfortunately that is not happening The index level is being held by rising Nasdaq stocks such as Facebook However if Facebook is rising does that mean the SP is being propped up by the famous FANG stocks These four stocks make up nearly a third of the Nasdaq weighting As you can see only Facebook and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL seem to have some life in their stock Netflix NASDAQ NFLX and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN appear to have lost their luster Yes correlations break down from time to time and it appears this correlation has run its course Out of Facebook and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Facebook appears to be the outperformer Given its weight and outperformance in the SP it appears that Facebook may indeed be one of the primary culprits of this divergent market behavior Thus I can conclude that the SP is perhaps being propped up by the Nasdaq stocks with Facebook being one of the prominent ones The rise and weights of these stocks are canceling out the effect of the decline in the economically sensitive stocks of the SP which is creating a slow grinding market A select few stocks cannot continue to prop up the market for an extended period of time If Facebook cracks and other stocks that have similarly risen such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>crack as well the fall will be nasty Thus it appears that the Nasdaq having room to run up points is a facade as well There is no possible way for Facebook to contribute a majority of the points necessary to boost the index by that amount I have to reiterate that something has got to crack On the bright side it will realign the indices so you will not have such a divergent market behavior Im not sounding an alarm but urging caution Cracks are starting to show so it is better to be in the markets with caution Now do I think the rally will end in the coming weeks No my reason is a simple one In a few days we begin earnings season and typically stocks will get a boost Facebook has done phenomenal in the past few quarters Even if it misses earnings the stock will still rally because it is has been in a sustained uptrend I would continue to be cautious through the remainder of the year given that this is an election year I do not suspect the markets to topple this year because the Fed appears to have some political pressure on them to calm the markets even though it is not their job to give a hoot Note for the StockTwits I used the ETFs because they had decent number of followers For the rest of the articlementions of the indexes refer to the futures because they trade hours and I feel are better representative of the market Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article </div></body></html>
