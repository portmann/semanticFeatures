are unwilling to upgrade to newer models and pay extra This is a trend that threatens the likes of Apple This trend might explain why between Q and Q Samsung Apple and Lenovo saw their global smartphone market shares decline on average by and respectively It also explains why lowcost smartphone newcomers such as Huawei and Xiaomi increased their global smartphone market share by and respectively This is why we believe in Apples direction with the iPhones SE pricing It will allow Apple to grow in emerging markets and to expand its ecosystem Competition in the global smartphone market especially for emerging markets has intensified in the last five years As new technological innovations for smartphones plateaued key smartphone vendors Samsung OTCSSNLF and Apple NASDAQ AAPL failed to create enough value proposition for current users to upgrade to new versions Because of being lowpriced competitors with great technologies new players such as Huawei and Xiaomi Private XI have managed to gain substantial global market share at the risk of Samsung and Apple If this trend is allowed to continue Samsung and Apple could see their market shares plummet as consumers move to cheaper but advanced competitors But we believe Apples recent announcement of the lowpriced iPhone SE will help Apple mitigate its market share deterioration by tapping into new markets as it expands its Total Addressable Market TAM and brings more people to its ecosystem Apple has been losing global market share because of lowpriced competitors such as Xiaomi and Huawei In the last three years companies like Samsung Apple and Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY have seen their worldwide vendor market share decline by an average of and respectively Click to enlargeOn the other hand average market share growth rate for Huawei and Xiaomi between Q and Q is and respectively This decline in the global smartphone market is a threat to Apples longterm growth Q is usually Apples best quarter but its portion of global smartphone shipment volume fell from in Q to in Q as shown below In the same time period some of Apples competitors such as Samsung Huawei Lenovo and Xiaomi saw their portion of global units shipped increase Samsung and Apple losing market share Huawei and Xiaomi gaining it The Huawei and Xiaomi threat is real and imminent Samsung Apple and Lenovo are losing popularity to new cheap and advanced players The popularity of Xiaomis products is growing Xiaomi has already set a Guinness World Record for the most mobile phones sold in a hour period During their Mi Fan Fest promotion Xiaomi sold million smartphones smart appliances power strips fitness watches wifi units and smart televisions all in one day This shows how much interest there is for Xiaomis products Huawei is rapidly grabbing market share from the big players Samsung and Apple In FY Huawei became the fourth mobile phone vendor in history to ship over million smartphones in one calendar year In addition Huaweis units shipped grew by in FY Huawei has consistently expanded its presence with affordable handsets in emerging markets But one would wonder why should Apple investors care about lowcost smartphone competitors such as Huawei and Xiaomi since Apples products are premium and not discount products First this is important for Apple because it cannot repeat the Samsung mistake of underestimating Huawei and Xiaomi in a market that accounts for of Apples total sales By Q Samsung was capturing of total global smartphone market share Samsung tried to compete against Apple and neglected the small players This mistake has cost Samsung more than in market share in less than three years In Q Greater China accounted for of Apples total sales Because of how important China is to Apples projected future growth Apple needs to pay attention to Huawei and Xiaomi because they threaten its estimated growth prospects in the mainland For instance Xiaomi hardware has created a lot of attention The Mini Note was in such high demand that it sold out in under three minutes and that is after Xiaomis VP revealed that the sale received over million reservations Xiaomis phones offer the best features of a smartphone at half the price Xiaomi is planning to grow by targeting iPhone users with rumors of a tradein program for the iPhone s and iPhone for Xiaomis Mini Note and Mini Note Pro Besides Xiaomi is not an ordinary startup Three of top nine positions in Xiaomi are occupied by former <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>employees It was the third largest seller of smartphones in the world by mid and it overtook Samsung and Apple to become the largest smartphone seller in Asia But the total number of consumers upgrading is growing smaller For instance there are respectively and of Apple customers still using the iPhone and the iPhone S models This decline in new iPhone adoption is likely because people do not see the reason to upgrade their phones There is no real innovation to justify higher prices for newer models This has made startups like Huawei and Xiaomi with cheaper smartphones but as technologically advanced as Apple and Samsung very common iPhone SE Opportunity to expand TAM and grow ecosystem in emerging markets The growing popularity of competitors such as Huawei and Xiaomi in Greater China the lack of new innovations on smartphones and the declining adoption rate for new iPhones threatens Apples longterm growth rate This is why we believe that Apples announcement of the lowpriced inch iPhone SE is a step ahead in the right direction The iPhone SE price tag allows Apple to expand its Total Addressable Market TAM in emerging markets without diluting its brand image The starting price for an iPhone SE is This price tag is still expensive in emerging markets but it also broadens the number of people who want to own an iPhone but cannot afford the current prices We believe that this opens up new markets for Apple and has the ability to expand its TAM because of Xiaomi Xiaomi is often referred to as the Chinese Apple because its products all look like Apple products One of the major differences between Xiaomi and Apple is that Xiaomi sells iPhonelike gear for a third of Apples products But Xiaomis phones are as technologically advanced as any smartphone in existence They manage to provide cheap smartphones because they price just above cost This implies that the market for Apples products is there but most people cannot afford Apples prices Therefore although the for the iPhone SE is still relatively high it is below Xiaomis Mi prices giving Apple a competitive edge with price sensitive consumers who would prefer the original iPhone rather than the copycat This is why we believe that the iPhone SE has potential to aid Apple in expanding its ecosystem in emerging markets like China But Apples lowpricing might have some problems moving forward First we expect Apple to experience deteriorating margins moving forward because the price reduction shifts its net income dependency from higher markup prices to turnover But since this is a new initiative it is possible that the turnover from the low iPhone SE prices might not be enough to compete for Apples lower prices Secondly Apple still lags behind in its effort to penetrate and effectively compete in the lowcost market with the likes of Xiaomi and Huawei on phone size The iPhone SE might set a foundation for Apple to appeal to the lowcost market but it will still lose market share from people who prefer a bigger but cheaper phone Nonetheless we believe that the new opportunities that the iPhone SE lowpricing will bring to Apple in Q and beyond will outweigh the aforementioned disadvantages This is because a low price point has the potential to tap into new markets in Apples strong markets such as America Europe and China Furthermore even if we see lackluster sales growth in iPhones if Apple manages to expand its ecosystem with the low price it will be able to sell more of its products to newcomers Consequently the iPhone SE has the potential to help Apple grow its global market share as it expands its TAM Disclosure
