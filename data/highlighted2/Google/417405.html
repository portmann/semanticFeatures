algorithm Cheetah Mobiles revenue would be growing like usual Cheetah Mobile now is working more closely with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>AdMod the biggest rival of Facebook Audience Network This will minimize the impact of Facebooks algorithm change Revenue up and Net Income grew since IPO CMCM is currently trading at only IPO price was In Q earnings Cheetah Mobiles NYSE CMCM revenue and EPS both beat consensuses however Cheetah Mobile cut revenue guidance for Q and the whole year of Stock price plunged about in a few days after posting earnings All the evidence point to the change of algorithm from Cheetah Mobiles partner Facebook Cheetah Mobiles CEO stated in the Q earnings call in his mother tongue Frankly speaking there was a negligence of management We thought the decrease of revenue in Q was because of seasonality until April In April we found something went wrong seasonality is not the reason He also talked about the return of growth in the future Generally speaking as long as we get rid of the dependence on some big partners I believe our revenue will grow again based on our user base and total traffic CEO Sheng Fu didnt say the big partners name but we all know its Facebook because Facebook is the only one that has the capability to influence Cheetah Mobiles revenue that much We dont know what algorithm exactly has been changed to kill the growth of Cheetah Mobiles revenue but we do know therere two significant changes that may have possibly caused the influences On March Facebook announced its mobile ad platform Facebook Audience Network partnered with thirdparty mediation platforms including Twitterowned MoPub Fyber and Opera Mediaworks App publishers only need to use one thirdparty integrated ad mobile platform for monetization and millions of Facebook advertisers only need to access this integrated platform too This was obviously not great news for Cheetah Mobile It will have more competitors in the new integrated platform and the advertisers from Facebook didnt change Namely the demand doesnt change but the supply surges This results as CPMs decrease which Cheetahs CEO mentioned multiple times in the earnings call The partnership of Facebook and other platforms is definitely good for advertisers however its not the best news for ad publishers Ad publishers would face more intense competition and receive less revenue Last October Facebook launched Advertiser Outcome Score AOS AOS is a measurement system that evaluates the effectiveness of publishers ad placement to drive outcomes for the advertiser In short a higher score means stronger performance and higher CPMs for publishers The rumor said Facebook recently changed its AOS algorithm and the score for Cheetah Mobile was lower than before This made Cheetah Mobile less attractive as a publisher and they got much lower CPMs Because of this Cheetahs revenue from Facebook decreased dramatically Im not quite sure which one killed Cheetah Mobiles guidance As far as Im concerned the combination of both has the highest probability If the guidance cut was because of the algorithm change then the problem now is plain and simple Monetization Cheetah Mobiles products have no problem The Research and Development Team has no problem The traffic and user base have no problem I believe those are the fundamentals to Cheetah Mobile If the fundamentals are okay we may not worry too much If theres no algorithm change from Facebook will Cheetah Mobiles revenue grow like usual To answer this question lets see the composition of its revenue By Q of total revenue was Online Market Service was Internet Value Addon Service and was Security and Others Obviously the most revenue of Cheetah Mobile is from Online Market Service Online Market Service revenue heavily depends on the Monthly Active Users MAUs and downloads of Apps In Q Cheetah Mobiles MAUs had a yearoveryear growth rate of In terms of app download the critical app from Cheetah Mobile performed well in Q and even better in Q Given MAUs and downloads of apps Cheetah Mobiles revenue should keep growing in Q like usual but in Q guidance revenue didnt grow at all Given all these conditions Im here to make a bold assumption Because of the change of Facebooks mobile ad algorithm Facebook will be able to take more money from Cheetah Mobiles apps In the meantime Cheetah Mobile receives way less money via Facebook In other words without the change of Facebook algorithm Cheetah Mobiles revenue is going to grow like usual According to the data from the world leading App analytics company App Annie Cheetah is the rd largest company in term of downloads The core business model for Cheetah Mobile is pretty simple they develop apps and if the app becomes popular they call it the Critical App Critical apps will serve as entry points to get users Once they have enough users the apps will be monetized by inapp purchases and online marketing services The Critical apps developed by Cheetah Mobile can be divided into two categories tools and games At the moment the top tools are Clean Master CM Security Photo Grid and CM locker The top games Piano Tiles and Rolling Sky Chart made by author All information is from App Annie In Cheetah Mobiles critical apps have been performing well even in April when Facebooks algorithm heavily affected the revenue of Cheetah Mobile Globally Cheetah Mobile still stably ranked rd in terms of downloads Thats why Im confident about this companys value As soon as monetization is fixed growth will get right back By Q Cheetah Mobile has million MAUs According to April and most of Mays download data I dont think there will be a drop in Q At the moment Cheetah Mobile has a PEG of according to Yahoo Finance Cheetah Mobile reminds me of another Chinese internet company Qihoo NYSE QIHU I believe a lot of people consider Qihoo as a strong competitor of Cheetah Mobile and usually compare each other They do have a few similarities Strong growth in revenue and profit Trading around or even below the IPO price after going public for a few years until the true value appreciated They both have similar product lines They even had similar troubles when the growth of MAUs of Qihoos core security tool Qihoo Security slowed down investors started doubting the profit and margin would clash soon too But people forgot what a big user base Qihoo had What Qihoo did was improve its capability of monetization It acquired the advertisement platform company MediaV After two quarters Qihoos monetization capability has improved significantly Since then the doubt about growth and profit has gone Does it seem familiar Cheetah Mobile has almost same trouble now Revenue guidance cuts due to the lack of monetization capability As CEO Sheng Fu said in the Q earnings call that theyre now building sales force and may see the growth come back in one or two quarters We all know improvement of monetization takes time In the first few years after Qihoo went public investors did not seem to appreciate the true value of it very much lots of people doubted if the high growth can continue Qihoo went public on March with an IPO price of Before the huge breakout of stock price the share was trading at to On th March Qihoo released its Q earnings At that point TTM earnings growth rate was TTM PE ratio is TTM PEG is Such low PEG virtually means this stock was highly undervalued And we all knew the story after that Qihoo never went back to s Improvement of monetization needs time for sure especially when you need to get rid of the dependence of the big former partner Cheetah Mobile needs to build its own sales team for monetization Thats what Cheetah Mobile is doing right now It will be difficult and timeconsuming but once the sales force has been armed sustainable growth can be expected On th May Cheetah Mobile announced the successful partnership with Googles NASDAQ GOOGL NASDAQ GOOG AdMob AdMob is one of the toughest rivals of Facebooks NASDAQ FB Audience Network This was actually quite a nice move by Cheetah Mobiles management Working more closely with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is definitely helping generate revenue in the current situation where Facebook significantly dropped CPMs for Cheetah Mobile Since the IPO Cheetah Mobiles revenue was up and net income grew However the stock price now is trading at around and the IPO price was This is ridiculous Table made by author All information is from companys investor relations Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful by Warren Buffett For Cheetah Mobile we can tell now most investors are definitely fearful but is it the right time to be greedy Significant negative changes to the management or RD team To sum up based on the current situation if the companys share is still trading under its IPO price of I believe it exposes a truly rare investing opportunity in a highly undervalued company with huge potential As long as they fix the monetization and get the growth back the share price would soar I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Technology
