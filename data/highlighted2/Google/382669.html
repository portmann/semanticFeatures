valuation metrics Apple is indeed attractive If you want to make a naive investment there are cheaper alternatives On a few basic valuation metrics it is clear Apple NASDAQ AAPL is attractive which compelled fellow Seeking Alpha contributor Erik Bergseng to call the company a slam dunk Apple Is Grossly Mispriced I disagreed with Bergseng in Apple Be Careful However Bergseng is not to be deterred and continues his love affair with Apple Is Grossly Mispriced A Rebuttal If you want to buy Apple thats fine Just do it after seriously considering the bear arguments and not solely on the naive bull case With that said Ill clarify why Bergseng is wrong to dismiss my arguments point by point Yes revenues are forecast to decline for FY if you consider to be a decline I consider this revenue decline to be revenue stagnation from a practical standpoint If one considers this consensus decline relevant however you will also notice revenues are expected to grow for the following year Lacking a theory why the market possibly misunderstands Apple to such an extent he considers it a slam dunk investment Id say its a good time to carefully assess what the market implies Why does the market assign Apple a PE multiple of Why do consensus estimates point to a decline with consensus estimates trending downward Similarly EPS is forecast to fall slightly next year but jump to the following year So again a decline in EPS is not necessarily the end of the world Most investors have a time horizon that extends beyond a year An EPS decline isnt the end of the world but its hardly a good reason to suggest everyone go overweight Apple immediately as Bergseng recommends I have also included free cash flow figures in the image above to address this point Yes free cash flow figures are expected to dip and stabilize at around the bn mark for this year and the next In other words Apple is only forecast to generate a free cash flow yield for the next two years while the rest of the market currently sits at Apples sales and revenues are fragile The company is racing and lapping competitors lately to constantly deliver products that are better than those of its competitors Im sure it can outspend any rival oneonone but its up against a cast of them Unfortunately with all of its products fairly vulnerable to disruption In addition there are a couple of industries with fairly depressed cash flows where the market probably accurately expects a rebound sometime in the future There is something to the ecosystem defense but Ill get to that later Apple on the other hand has shown stable and consistent margin growth beginning and has shown no signs of slowing down ever since Bergseng doesnt want to face the fact Apples margins are a product of a small product portfolio produced at an unrivaled scale You may not like the BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY example but there are countless others Nintendo OTCPKNTDOY Dell Sony NYSE SNE Eastman Kodak NYSE KODK Industry leaders with dominant market share tend to post reams of terrific numbers year after year Until they inevitably lose their position Next thing you know its numbers are just average In a business with short product cycles this can happen real fast In retrospect it will be obvious what happened and commentators will come up with a narrative making it look all but inevitable Today it looks unimaginable Its incredibly hard to predict what will cause it Will the company broaden its product portfolio too much Introduce too many choices Will competitors introduce products that are so much better all but the loyalist will defect Will capital be destroyed in a flurry of spending on visionary products that instead fail Read up on the history of dominating companies awash with cash and the latter is executed as routinely as doctors write out Synthroid prescriptions Second and most importantly Apple has developed a sophisticated ecosystem compared to BlackBerrys nonexistent ecosystem The convenience the integration of multiple products delivers to consumers not only makes it harder for them to leave but it creates multiple crossplatform revenue generating opportunities There is something to the argument Apples ecosystem functions as a competitive advantage through customer captivity Several of Apples competitors Amazon NASDAQ AMZN <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT also exploit strong ecosystems of products Their individual ecosystems are almost equally impressive but as they allow more freedom to their users they are ultimately more robust If only Apples services business were larger Through services Apple can and should carve out a wide moat around itself I dont think its quite there yet as I discussed in a focus article about the Apple service business To help ensure a large market share for the iPhone even in cycles when it brings out a relatively weak product is to increase customer captivity through added services Apples management is acutely aware of this and because its service business is now starting to become meaningful at the same time the device business is flagging they took the opportunity to draw some attention to it at the earnings call Source Q supplemental materials I think Apple has plenty of ideas what to do with their cash but they have been constrained due to the tax inefficiency of repatriating cash from abroad This is certainly one of the largest negatives to Apple I can think of However it could also result in one of the largest potential share price catalysts at some point in the future Imagine for a moment what would happen to Apples share price if it were to negotiate a more tax effective cash repatriation strategy with the US Government I would not invest in Apple on such a speculative basis but it is worth keeping this possibility in mind If Apple truly had a lot of opportunities to invest at a high rate of RoIC it would have borrowed against the overseas cash Alternatively some of those ideas should be able to be realized overseas The repatriation tax limits the firms options to return cash to shareholders but even if the Government allows for a tax holiday or something I dont think such a onetime event would do much for the companys value on the long term It would be a positive for shareholders but hardly a game changer Bonus chart SP Constituents Free Cash Flow Yields Vs Net Cash as a of Market Capitalization I have a beef with Bergsengs bonus chart see above Accompanied by the following explanation Essentially this is a matter of return vs leverage It is easy to find stocks with a low PE but you will usually find they have a lot of debt relative to their market capitalization Conversely stocks with strong net cash positions can attract a PE premium as they still have the ability to use their cash position and debt facilities to create growth As you can see Apple is to the right and above the vast majority of constituents on this chart a combination of both larger returns and less leverage than the rest Again there are not many alternative investments as attractive as Apple considering its current PE relative to the SP When you take free cash flow and net cash to compare Apple against the SP it looks to me like you are cherry picking two metrics to make Apple look good Everyone knows the company is a sick hoarder and currently generating terrific cash flows The problem with value above book is that its based on future cash flows With Apple thats the crux Bergseng failed to come up with credible arguments why Apples future cash flows are safe Let me reiterate I do not hate Apple as an investment I do want to caution against a naive bullish equation like Apple is awesome Apple trades at a low PE Slam Dunk There are real risks with Apples business model with lots of operating leverage embedded and short product cycles The past ten golden years have coincided with its global expansion but now pretty much everyone who can afford an iPhone owns one Finally its mountain of cash adds some stability to its stock price but there is the risk management will spend it in a foolish manner like a value destructive acquisition In addition the cash lowers the overall return of your investment dollar put in Apple Bergseng ends his piece on the notion there are not many alternative investments as attractive as Apple considering its current PE relative to the SP but let me shower you with choices General Motors NYSE GM Banco Santander SA NYSE SAN Bayerische Motoren Werke OTCBYMOF Mizuho
