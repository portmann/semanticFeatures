class='textDiv'>Carl Icahn Was Right Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha The Beijing patent ruling further validates Carl Icahns warning about Chinas hostility to Apple By our count this is the rd recent warning about Apple thats been validated We detail the other two warnings one about Apples sales and another about it falling behind <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Amazon in AI We also present updated hedges for Apple shareholders who want to stay long but limit their downside risk in light of these recent warnings We now have at least three warnings about Apple NASDAQ AAPL over the last few months that have been validated by recent events In April before Apple released earnings we noted that social data aggregator LikeFolio had put out a sell rating on the stock based on their analysis of social media data and we presented a couple ways for concerned shareholders to hedge if they wanted to stay long Hedging Apple Ahead Of Earnings As LikeFolio cofounder Andy Swan summarized it at the time When we plot purchase intent mentions for Apple on a day moving average we see a steady erosion over the past months We also have seen FAR lower purchase intent mentions surrounding Apples new product releases than prior even comparably minor product releases In an article last month Apple The Next BlackBerry we shared Marco Arments warning about Apple slipping behind in AI artificial intelligence Arment as you may recall is a prominent software developer entrepreneur and commentator He was the lead developer of Tumblr which was acquired by Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO and the creator of the Instapaper app In a blog post last month Arment raised the possibility of Apple going the way of BlackBerry BBRY If Googles Right About AI Thats A Problem For Apple Arment explained that BlackBerry didnt fail because it started to make worse smart phones but because Apple shifted the expectations of what a smart phone could be and BlackBerry didnt have the staff or expertise to catch up Arment wondered if Apple was in a similarly precarious position with respect to artificial intelligence given investments by Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG and Facebook NASDAQ FB Today Amazon Facebook and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>are placing large bets on advanced AI ubiquitous assistants and voice interfaces hoping that these will become the next thing that our devices are for Amazon Facebook and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>especially <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>have all invested heavily in bigdata web services and AI for many years prioritizing them highly iterating and advancing them constantly accumulating relevant data developing effective algorithms and attracting developing and retaining tons of specialized talent But if Googles right theres no quick fix It wont be enough to buy Siris creators again or partner with Yelp for another few years If Apple needs strong AI and bigdata services in the next decade to remain competitive they need to have already been developing that talent and those assets inhouse extensively for years They need to be a bigdataservices company Their bigdata AI services need to be far better smarter and more reliable than they are And I just dont see that happening Becoming a major bigdata AI services company doesnt happen completely in secret and suddenly get released to the world completed in a keynote Its a massive undertaking spanning many years many people and a lot of noticeable interaction with the world Its easier to conceal the development of an entire car than a major presence in AI and services Apple effectively validated Arments warning at its Worldwide Developers Conference earlier this month when it announced it would open Siri to outside developers as Forbes reported Apple Opens Siri To Fight <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Amazon Opening Siri to outside developers suggests Apple hasnt been building a big AI capability inhouse in secret which as Arment pointed out would have been unlikely Back in April Carl Icahn announced hed dumped his Apple stake due to concerns about China As the Financial Times reported over the weekend free to read with FT registration Apple locked in latest fight with China as iPhone is ruled too like a local brand municipal authorities in Beijing ruled that Apples iPhone designs infringed on the patents of a Chinese manufacturer called Shenzhen Baili The FT noted that Apples phones were still available for sale as the company appealed the ruling But the patent fight is emblematic of the struggles Apple has faced in a market that until recently has been its most important source of growth amid a global slowdown in smartphones Sales of the iPhone fell in China last quarter compared with a drop worldwide Earlier this year billionaire investor Carl Icahn once one of Apples largest outside investors said he had dumped his entire stake in the company citing the Chinese governments hostile attitude The FTs Tim Bradshaw went on to point out that the latest ruling against Apple has come on the heels of other moves against the company in China In April its iTunes Movies and iBooks services became unavailable after the new government restrictions on publishing online material Last month it lost a trademark case in Beijing allowing a fashion accessory maker to use the iPhone brand Bradshaw didnt refer to it in his article but his colleague Charles Clovers article also free to read with FT registration on Alibaba NYSE BABA chairman Jack Mas recent comments might concern Apple shareholders in light of Apples recent troubles in China Counterfeits often superior to luxury brands says Ma Clovers article didnt specify the products Ma was referring to but consider how Mas comments might apply to Apple in light of the most recent ruling against it The problem is the fake products today they make better quality better price than the real names They are exactly the same factories exactly the same raw materials but they do not use the names With its recent travails in China Apple has another reason besides Donald Trumps threat to consider moving more manufacturing to the US For Apple shareholders who want to stay long while limiting their downside risk over the next several months but without capping their upside these were the optimal puts as of Fridays close to hedge shares against a greaterthan decline by late January screen capture via the Portfolio Armor iOS app As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above the cost of this protection was or of position value A few notes about this hedge To be conservative the cost was calculated using the ask price of the puts In practice an investor can often by the puts for less for some price between the bid and the ask If you are willing to risk a larger decline threshold in the apps terminology you can potentially lower the cost of hedging in this manner The threshold is based on the intrinsic value of the puts so they may provide more protection than promised if the underlying security declines in the near term when the puts may still have significant time value For Apple shareholders looking to hedge with the same threshold but willing to cap their potential upside to by late October this was the optimal collar to hedge shares as of Fridays close As you can see at the bottom of the first part of the collar above the cost of the put leg was or of position value But as you can see in the second part below the income generated from the call leg was or of position value So the net cost here was negative meaning the investor would collected an amount equal to or of position value when opening the position Two notes about this hedge Similar to the situation with the optimal puts to be conservative the cost of the optimal collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls In practice an investor can often buy puts for less and sell calls for more again at some price between the bid and the ask so in reality an investor would likely have collected more than when opening this collar As with the optimal puts above this hedge may provide more protection than promised if the underlying security declines in the near future due to time value for an example of this see our previous article on Apple However if the underlying security spikes in the near future time value can have the opposite effect making it costly to exit the position early for an example of this see
