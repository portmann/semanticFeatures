as privacy is always valued While Apple products remain prized by consumers the company still has work to do earning enterprise clients who remain more price conscious Capitalizing on the good press AAPL should expand into data security via acquisitions Apples NASDAQ AAPL stand against the FBIs All Writs Act request for a version of iOS that would bypass security encryption isnt new to most shareholders While it remains a divisive issue for many my goal here isnt to debate the merits of that decision What I will say is that Ive always been of the opinion that any press is good press and this entire situation gives Apple an opportunity to forcefully propel itself into a new multibilliondollar business opportunity data security Such a move targeted towards enterprise clients could mean the current case in San Bernardino could provide Apple a monetary boost rather than simply being yet another instance of a company taking a stance on governmental policies and procedures Market Opportunity In Enterprise Clients I can draw parallels of Apples stance here to the position of Swiss banks over the th century Swiss law made it a criminal offense to reveal a clients identity in and in the following years Switzerland quickly came to be known as the safest place to park your money offshore illgotten or otherwise If you wanted to keep your accounts safe secret and away from prying eyes Switzerland was the place to be for nearly one hundred years Not one to miss an opportunity Swiss banks fostered this relationship and as a result of the implicit backing of the Swiss government that led to repeatedly denied requests for account holder information deposits soared This privacy above all else viewpoint lasted for decades and did nothing but increase the allure of Swiss banking accounts to the worlds wealthy It wasnt until the United States put its foot down in recent years through FATCA and other heavyhitting regulations that the government was able to claw the information out of bankers hands very unwillingly I might add Now why did so many of the worlds affluent park their money offshore in Switzerland Because they felt both the banks and the government had their backs and would fight toothandnail for their privacy Once those expectations were crushed client money outflows began to the next best places where clients could find that secrecy Singapore Hong Kong Luxembourg Shift back to mobile data and we can draw some parallels Apples quest for privacy isnt inherently different than that of the public and large corporations Market perception now is that Apple has its users backs when it comes to the safety and privacy of their data even if the mighty US Government comes calling looking for incriminating information Who wouldnt want the worlds largest company on their side with respect to security It took a onceinalifetime situation for Swiss banks decimated by the global financial crisis to cave on client confidentiality Apples financial position makes it even more unlikely than the Swiss to break its stance today tomorrow or years from now Apples current proprivacy stance runs directly against public perception of other players in the industry As a whole consumers remain deeply suspicious of technology companies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL for instance does not sell personal user information but it does collect analyze and monetize nonpersonal information For some consumers the concept of even nonpersonal information like their recent browsing history being used to help better target advertisements is almost as unsettling as a company selling their name and birth date BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY has managed to maintain a small foothold in the enterprise device markets despite Apple making significant inroads and companies increasingly shifting towards bringyourown device BYOD policies With that said BYOD pushed for extensively by employees can significantly complicate how enterprises deal with data and security issues This creates market opportunity BlackBerry Enterprise Server BES a cloudbased software offering for device management that is available across multiple operating systems was a great step by BlackBerry to help stem the tide of client outflows driven by BYOD but it wont be enough in my opinion The offering simply isnt good enough in its current form to tempt business clients using nonBlackBerry devices AAPL given its already immense smartphone penetration with workers could significantly benefit from expanded privacy offerings targeted towards protecting and managing iPhone and other Apple product data through a similar cloudbased software network We all know that Apple needs huge growing markets to make investment worthwhile Make no mistake data security is a humongous market Gartner believes that worldwide information security spending will have reached B in This is lower than some estimates with some forecasting the market will reach B by at a CAGR of from to While these numbers are staggering in reality this is just a fraction of the damage cybersecurity attacks cost businesses yearly These breaches continue as a result of weak links in the security chain which include employees falling for ageold phishing tricks malware and other common methods of attack As such most companies are willing to fork out large sums of money meaning big margins for competing companies for the best and most userfriendly data security solutions This is a space Apple has not currently invested heavily in Acquisitions in the security space make sense to me as a means to both expand revenue enter highgrowth businesses and make Apples devices more palatable to enterprise clients Apple has shown some interest in acquiring companies in this sector before It paid M for AuthenTec in but I suspect this was mainly for its NFC and fingerprintsensing technology not its computer and mobile security offerings Nonetheless that technology still is held within Apple The company also recently announced the acquisition of LegbaCore in November a firmware security consultancy firm Details remain thin but this acquisition was likely done to acquire talent in fleshing out security offerings given the companys prior work A team at LegbaCore built Thunderstrike the first worm that was able to infect Mac computers at the firmware level which makes the malware highly difficult to remove from infected computers While many publiclytraded data security firms are not profitable in many cases this is an issue of scale From a business model perspective security is now in the industry shakeout stage As growth rates start to moderate we will enter the survival of the fittest portion of the business cycle Competition is intense and some businesses will exit the market This is the prime time for AAPL to make some targeted purchases in the market by being a leading consolidator Buy the cream of the crop consolidate operations into a strong suite of product offerings and push out the rest of the competition This business strategy isnt foreign to Apple This is a multibilliondollar industry that Apple has not really targeted and we are now at a great position in the business cycle for the company to make some moves in the space Ive always been one that advocated for companies to not lose focus of their core product and vision I dont believe a move into security would hurt Apple in the long term or spread company assets too thin An Apple expansion into the datacybersecurity space would in fact be complementary to its current business lines Enterprise clients are just as valuable for Apple to win over with its product offerings A stronger more visible security offering could help boost sales of its core products while also contributing to the bottom line The current situation with the US Government just makes the timing all the better as the case plays out over the coming months Peak iPhone is a tiring argument but it is one that needs to be had Sales growth among consumers is slowing but as the slowmoving corporate world continues to come around to mobile devices Apple can and should expand its product offerings beyond fit and function to attract enterprise clients Expansion into security is a perfect means of doing that and the timing couldnt be better I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long
