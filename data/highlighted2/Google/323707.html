iPhone Shorting Apple North Of Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Mark Hibben and Paulo Santos offer widely divergent views on Apples outlook and iPhone sales There is solid empirical support for both views making it challenging to call the trend Apples robust resale market implies a downward trend in sales of new devices as the iPhone installed base stagnates at about million units The implication is for weakness in iPhone sales and AAPL stock Seeking Alpha articles by Paulo Santos and Mark Hibben regarding iPhone sales showcase extreme views on collapsing sales of this key element of the Apple NASDAQ AAPL portfolio Santos argues the deterioration in iPhone sales is worse than feared Hibben contends the bull case hanging onto the untenable position that lower iPhone sales will not adversely affect Apple margins The hard data support Santos Apple had a solid beginning to with iPhone and Plus in strong demand as the company finally entered the phablet market But by yearend the lackluster enhancements to iPhone S and iPhone S Plus saw the needle turn sharply lower as Apple conceded market share in most markets with only China showing a gain Apples reported sales of the iPhone have been overstated by growth in carrier inventory for several years with that inventory now over million devices While consistent with Apples target of to weeks of sales in inventory looking backwards that carrier inventory is definitely a problem for Apple if iPhone sales decline materially Like Santos I think they will The change in the key US market is quite dramatic In Apple and Android were neckandneck in terms of market share Apples US misfortunes were somewhat offset by its gains in China without doubt but an eightpercentage point drop in share of US sales is hard to ignore as a harbinger of things to come As you might expect as one of the worlds largest companies and perhaps second only to Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL in terms of enterprise value Apple gets a lot of ink and views are widely divergent Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White says iPhone sales in January were the best on record based on his assessment of Apple suppliers and calls for a price target That bullish view is supported by the elegant projection model developed by Frank Bass in which when applied to iPhone predicts an installed base at peak of million users and annual sales of million units in steady state Those sales are largely replacements with new users estimated at million a year offset by defections The Bass model has been a reliable tool for forecasting technology product sales since its inception It is nonetheless victim of its assumptions and in the case of iPhone those assumptions are a twoyear replacement cycle and new users each year Both are suspect in my opinion Smartphone technology is reaching to the point where incremental advances may not compel upgrades and the assumption of sustained new users is without foundation The Bass model is in its essence a Riccati differential equation with constant coefficients It is a reliable tool for forecasting providing the external world conforms to the coefficients There is plenty of evidence that the trend in iPhone will diverge from the past in my opinion The average replacement cycle for iPhone users is months with Chinese users replacing their device more often than Americans In my opinion the dramatic success of the larger screen version of the iPhone accelerated the cycle on a onetime basis The Bass model forecasts an equilibrium installed base of iPhone users of million as described earlier I think that is a reasonable estimate What the Bass model does not account for is the life span of the device and what becomes of devices when first time buyers upgrade to a new iPhone According to the Consumer Electronics Association the average life of a smartphone is years Given the Apple reputation for quality Apple fans might agree that number would be a bit longer in the case of the iPhone Purchases of resale iPhones must tend to distort the Bass model overstating demand for new phones The Bass model is an empirical approach to fitting a curve over actual results to forecast future results In the early days of the iPhone the model was very accurate but of course there was a very small secondary market As the product developed with explosive growth the secondary market has no doubt burgeoned and is now substantial Apples month replacement cycle is the beneficiary of a strong resale market allowing users to sell their existing phone to trade up to the latest one The old phones are not taken out of service but sold to other buyers who prefer an iPhone If you assume that one quarter of those users who replace their iPhones either sell or tradein their old one and adjust the forecast unit sales of iPhones by the sales of used iPhones you arrive at annual iPhone sales in an equilibrium at million devices annually That is about where iPhone sales are today That estimate would be fine but is also victim to the assumption of net new users annually In my opinion Apple pretty well shot its bolt when it introduced the largerscreened iPhone <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play has now passed the App Store in terms of the number and breadth of applications Premium Android devices now outclass the iPhone on virtually every metric And my sense is that iPhone users are simply tired of short battery lives limited expansion ability and very little integration with the Android world which makes up over of the global smartphone population Accordingly I foresee continued weakness in iPhone sales over the coming quarters with a few upward blips as Apple flails away with its fading strategy by introducing a new smallscreen device and a HailMary pass with its new iPhone this fall Investors should avoid the stock I will short it on any move north of Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a short position in AAPL over the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
