CEO Jack Dorsey said it best An answer to why Twitter must be articulated clearly and felt everyone throughout the service The company seems to be at a crossroads Its not a question of will the service continue to grow but at what pace Clearly investors were not pleased with Twitters recent results as the stock plunged roughly on the news With a significant decline in the stock price comes the question Jack Dorsey wants to answer why Twitter In the world of social media and connecting individuals there are essentially two big dogs that Twitter must contend with Facebook NASDAQ FB is the lb gorilla and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL specifically through YouTube is the lb cousin When it comes to monthly active users Facebook grew this number by annually and Twitter reported an increase of Of course when Facebook gains with a monthly audience of nearly billion it means a lot more than Twitter at around million On the advertising front mobile is the watchword of the day <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>said its results were driven by two things mobile and YouTube Facebook reported that of its advertising revenue was generated from mobile Twitter actually gets more advertising dollars from mobile at In fact this partially explains why Twitters revenue isnt growing faster Mobile ads simply dont command the same type of pricing that desktop advertising does Facebooks advertising revenue grew by annually excluding currency while Twitter grew this same number by Googles paid clicks are probably the closest comparable number to these advertising figures Googles paid clicks grew by overall versus last year The point is Twitter isnt doing terrible The company is growing its user base revenue and advertising clients The problem isnt growth its a problem of expectations Realtime news with a more personalization the future of Twitter Years ago when Facebook was far smaller and YouTube wasnt the dominant video platform these two services had very simple missions When people signed into Facebook for the first time the service immediately suggested friends they could connect to YouTube was and is a video sharing service You can send a link to people and share the video on Facebook or other sites These two simple services garner on average about to minutes of usage per average day at this point Twitter wants to articulate what it is used forrealtime news is the services competitive edge Project Lightning that comes this fall is part of that vision but much more is needed To convince the mass market to tap into this realtime new service a few changes are clearly needed First users need to be able to select which people to see first in their timeline Facebook recently implemented favorites in its Newsfeed and YouTube subscriptions serve the same purpose Second Twitter needs to make individuals pages more Facebooklike Expanding profile information and adding a photos section with albums are two obvious missing pieces Expanded profile information would help Twitter gain more information about its user base Users love to share photos and Twitters lack of organization in this area limits its mass appeal For existing users of Facebook or YouTube they may be askingwhy cant I do more with Twitter Twitters CFO Anthony Noto gave voice to one of the biggest perceived issues about Twitter it seems challenging to use This isnt a criticism that Facebook or YouTube face YouTubes watch time grew by yearoveryear and Facebooks daily active users are of monthly active users Active daily users and increased usage suggests usability isnt an issue for either of these services If Twitter seems difficult to use there are two primary changes that would resolve a lot of confusion for new users Whether its the use of the symbol user names or the character post limit these issues create a learning curve that drives potential users away The best answer for Twitterchange them Users dont need to be told how to communicate they need a platform that lets them do so Moving to real names would greatly simplify the use of the service Moving the character limit up to maybe would keep the conversation flowing without making users feel limited If the CEO and CFO both know the service seems difficult to use investors should be asking what are you waiting for There is a lack of a sense of urgency to make dramatic changes to the core of the service As long as the services usability is limited nonusers will continue to askwhy Twitter The bottom line is Twitter has a treasure trove of power users that generate great content every hour of the day The service is growing but if it wants to move into the mainstream some of the core functions need to change Twitter also must realize that the mainstream wont use the service if they cant do on Twitter what they can do elsewhere Expanding the profile section and adding photo albums would increase the usefulness of the service Until Twitter is willing to make big changes it will likely stay a limited audience service Investors have one simple mission look for these core changes to occur and then consider investing If the company continues on its current path potential investors will be the ones askingwhy buy Twitter Unfortunately at this moment there isnt a good answer Disclosure Iwe have no positions
