class='textDiv'>Apples China Problem Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Icahn sold out of Apple highlighting its PRC relationship as a key concern I suspect Icahn just came up with an excuse for making an away from his Apple bullishness After rereading the history of how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>ultimately chose to exit the PRC I understand his position At first I thought Carl Icahns China excuse for selling out of Apple NASDAQ AAPL was kind of weak and insincere However as a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL shareholder Im familiar with the story of how the company decided to get out of China in Rereading Steven Levys In the Plex specifically section six titled GUGE Googles Moral Dilemma in China and looking at the iTunes Movies and iBooks shuttering Icahns worries start to make sense In the Plex takes you chronologically through Googles difficulties with the Chinese government starting as early as years before the company finally decided no longer to cooperate censoring its cn operation and I believe its a bit of history thats extremely relevant to Apple today The first time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>encountered real difficulties the PRC Peoples Republic of China blocked its Chinese website from China Cofounder Brin apparently believed the government did so in support of the emerging native search company Baidu NASDAQ BIDU Unfortunately the government isnt necessarily forthcoming with information on why it chooses to shut down services of a company or what the rules are exactly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>elegantly solved the problem of determining what the government expected it to censor through automated probing of competing services and determining what it had censored This didnt prove to be enough as the government kept demanding more specific cases of censorship Throughout the decade <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>spent in China its service to consumers was handicapped by the government intermittently pulling the plug or making it difficult for the company to operate a reliable service and one time even straight up redirecting its Googlecn traffic to Baiducn Quoting directly from In the Plex If you frame the issue from that perspective and examine the current market share the odds Apple will conquer a lot of market share with its move downmarket through the SE model go down You will find more statistics at Statista Until Icahn made this a top of mind issue it didnt occur to me to heavily factor in government agendas while forecasting Apples sales Could there be an artificial market share cap It seems naive to expect Apple to easily manage its relationship with the PRC better than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>did After initially approaching it somewhat lightheartedly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>did appoint a government relations official the company set up a giant Beijing operation led by a highly respected Chinese leader The company also cooperated with lots of requests by the government but the PRC kept pushing on Ultimately the company decided to stop censoring its cn website completely after suffering a successful attack by hackers for which the company deemed the Chinese government responsible Im not worried about Apples lost revenue from iBooks or iTunes movie service for a second Im worried about the PRC consistently undermining Apples competitive position In the time it took me to research and write this article a Chinese court ruled a small maker of iPhonebranded leather goods could continue to sell its goods Source Legal in China company website I understand a court ruling is different from a government decision but with the PRCs checkered history of frustrating Western US technology companies these could be clues to what further awaits Apple The recent shutting of iBooks and iTunes in China could be the first signs of the PRCApple relationship seriously souring Perhaps Icahns on Apple compared to his previous bullishness isnt insincere If we see more moves mirroring the way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>got pushed out over the next months thats really something to worry about iBooks and iTunes are not a big deal but not selling any iPhones in China would be a disaster for Apple Given the company recently published a public letter explaining it denied requests for access to iPhones by the FBI its difficult to see how the company will stay out of conflict with the Chinese government Sure you can argue Apple has some leverage through its suppliers like Foxconn OTCFXCOF Indirectly Apples business supports a large amount of jobs But even if the PRC were to ban iPhones Apple wouldnt be able to retaliate by pulling its business At least not within a reasonable time frame The supply chain is of such a vast size it would take a lot of time Even if there is only a small probability of China kicking Apple out the outcome is potentially devastating Meanwhile the risk of staying out of AAPL for a couple of months to observe the health of the Apple PRC relationship seems fairly limited I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from
