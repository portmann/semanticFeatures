class='textDiv'>Theranos Facebook And Unicorns Why The Real Problems Have Just Begun In Earnest Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site It has become clear that there is a shift away from the expensive allinone type of financial solutions for realtime traders passive investors and those tangentially interested in financial Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Currently there are two stories emanating out of Silicon Valley First there is the Theranos debacle where its been reported that basically everything you thought about the company from both its founder right down to the technology has been more of a sham than breakthrough The other is the current brouhaha concerning conservative media and Facebook supposed willingness or intent as to suppress it Whether selectively or passively Although the basis and the charges for impropriety are different From my viewpoint the consequences of both companies actions may have far more similar consequences in the end than some realize Let me explain I have to start with Theranos for this latest revelation helps put into light the overall meme of what has been transpiring throughout much of what we now generalize as Silicon Valley and inparticular the tech space and its unicorn stable of future IPO derby candidates There has been far more written as well as to be written about Theranos However in a nut shell what weve learned over the past week has been nothing short of breathtaking ie Its all but a complete sham I use all but for a reason for as its been reported out of the or so tests that were supposedly made available via their Edison machines only or so were done via this method The rest Outsourced to companies using current technology and accepted practices As far as its unicorn valuation metrics I have a feeling sham will be a term used heavily in what can only be assumed a litany of upcoming SEC investigations Not withstanding what usually follows the criminal Remember its one thing to mess with andor lose peoples money its quite another to do the same with their health where lives are at risk This story is important to the whole because of what it brings to bear for helping others to better understand the whole Silicon Valley narrative or meme eg Its founder and spokesperson Elizabeth Holmes and the fawning over not only her but the seemingly unquestioned jettisoning of business inquiry to the metrics and replacing hard numbers or facts with fairytales and rainbow type thinking or examples as its legitimate replacement To get a glimpse into just how far what I like to call breathing rarefied air turning into ones own exhaust fumes you need only look back just under years ago when she was the darling of not only The Valley but also media in general No where is this more apparent in her demeanor but also her story telling then at her TEDMED talk I believe its important to watch this talk inparticular for two reasons First Knowing what one knows now you cant watch it without being aghast at the level of not only insincerity but and this is a very big but the outright peril she may have in fact placed the pregnant woman she described that came to her facilities for testing And second Now that you know what you do is it not more obvious that people wanted or needed to believe for the sole purpose as to keep the dream IPO alive Now I give talks and speeches for a living I also know what it is to be asked and put on stage infront of some of the largest global corporations in ones field and deliver news that none of them want to hear ie The medical field does not look kindly to outsiders telling them they have a better way TEDMED or not And I know from first hand experience the one thing you do not employ to get your point across is some canned speech with all its story note markers canned hand movements and eye contact You look about as phony as phony can get And an audience can sense it a mile away Unless they dont want to And by looking at the subsequent press articles and talks given by Ms Holmes since that speech didnt want to seems to fit the bill most accurately for those wondering I was asked to give a speech years ago at a national conference when I was then running a company and making news that caught their attention At the conference I warned of the possibility of an impending market crash in my field After my speech I thought I would need armed security to reach my room For if stares were daggers I was the proverbial pincushion on stage Just weeks later the market did crash wiping out Billions in value and more forcing some of the very attendants into outright bankruptcy I say this because I now want you to think about every other speech youve watched as of late given by many of The Valleys tech crowd Hint They are all just about the same In other words formulated prepared gobbledygook that says nothing and means even less Remember Watch the Ms Holmes speech or however much you can stomach then go to your searchengine of choice and watch one of Mark Zuckerbergs or any other Valley high flyer of late What is almost impossible to move past once you do is the uncanny resemblance they all have in both presentation as well as story telling They all have the same formulation as well as stage presence To my eye theyre so similar it would not be unreasonable to believe they were all schooled by the same speech coach if they were at all for I dont know its just an assumption Now Im not trying to say the Theranos scandal and Facebooks current conservative issue are the same However what I am trying to do is present some very striking more often than not overlooked details which not only get missed but also may hint at some insight of what might also portend once things things being accusations with the weight of law hit certain stages For the way they handle subsequent accusations and more give ever more clues than may otherwise be first noticed But you have to watch with fresh eyes rather than just blindly accept as has previously been the case Currently Facebook is in an all out or at least what they want to be seen as public relations dilemma with Conservatives In particular to the calls of censorship There has been quite a few stories written and told about the whole fiasco This week also saw what was touted as a meaningful meeting between some of the more known conservative writers or speakers What transpired and what was resolved is anyones guess for its also been touted there was a rather specific nondisclosure agreement needing to be legally bound to in order to attend And it is precisely here I am going to make a statement which Ill explain as we go on and it is this If you think this is where the offending argument lays you just arent paying close enough attention This in my opinion is a look over here part of both misdirection as well as to help build any evidence for defense that may be needed if the real conservative nightmare plays out in a way of charges which Facebook itself thought or acted as if it was immune to ie Accusations of underhanded business practices which effected businesses unfairly as well as adversely that may need to be both defended against in court Andor monetary damages to plaintiffs are possibly awarded The more I looked at who was invited where and the format the more I saw PR textbook damage control which is really useless when administered in such fashion and more discovery and narrative setting for Facebook if or when needed in the future Without being coy Ill state precisely how I saw it Whether you agree or not is up to you I saw the attendees in this light if I were at Facebook Glenn Beck he knows probably better than anyone else if what we say is believable or not We need to see how he takes what we say as credible or not And why Next A Trump official Were on the record in particular Mark himself as not caring for Trump or his message We need to know how theyre taking this And just how much we need to possibly worry about retaliation if he does get the votes Dana Perino We need to know what are the instinctive reactions of a press secretary for a republican if they may hold the office next The others in my view were just filler no disrespect to anyone intended just a bigger picture view thats all to maybe add more weight to already existing thoughts And it was based out off this reasoning for if Im Facebook and I grasp what truly might have the potential to snowball and playout I want to know the following as quickly as I can Will a media guy with true insights into media love him or hate him his media accomplishments have weight a former republican press secretary as well as a highranking official from the potential republican nominee which now has shown a real possibility of winning believe our story If so its possible we might have a chance to show or demonstrate We didnt intentionally do anything wrong and when we found out Well by golly we invited these people right here up to our offices to help us figure out how something like this should never happen again by golly gee whiz In my view this is the real reason for if or when any court discovery sessions need take place as to possibly help cut this all offatthepass before it gets ahead of them Again this is where the real trouble for Facebook lies And its just beginning again all in my opinion Forget Facebook and the whole conservative censorship narrative for the moment Its only relevant to the bigger picture or trouble Facebook may face for its just the straw that broke the camels back or said differently the straw that brought the light as in spotlight No the story here and its implications to watch is the one being brought forth by comedian Steven Crowder This is where Facebook could find itself in real hot water And the current real problem Facebook would love you to either not notice or forget So dont look for it in your news feed or trending topicsjust saying Now why do I say this one may ask Well its for this reason As I see things Crowder used Facebook for business purposes He also paid as in actual monetary payments to Facebook for the sole purpose to help grow or maintain his brand He paid that word paid is where everything changes and hinges Facebook for that help If Facebook was taking his money while simultaneously suppressing either his content or the viewership that was implied he would reach All while he was being told or sold something different Theres a term for that and its called a criminal offense Now theres more to this story and is explained by Mr Crowder himself on his website heres a link directly to it Here he also explains how he could not get an answer about his account or his payment history That issue is also very contentious because it puts both your business credit at risk as well as possibly your personal life causing a sea of nightmarish paperwork filings and affidavits to resolve If you can in a timely manner and better hope one didnt have a pending loan approval process open at the same time either The issue here as insinuated by Mr Crowder nobody could be reached as to resolve He basically found himself connected to a disconnected phone when it came to trying to contact Facebook I feel for him and understand his frustration for I had a similar issue years back with another of these platforms Its one of the reasons as I explained during the incident why I would no longer use these platforms and warned others of the same Getting hold of someone as to try to resolve an issue makes getting answers at the DMV look instantaneous and friendly by comparison If you get one at all that is So again here is where the real issue lies for Facebook and where this once seemingly small incident may have far larger implications And its with questions or observations such as this What the Crowder suit opens up is a Pandoras box of discovery claims that will surely come forth by others And by others I mean entities that may have spent extraordinary large advertising dollars with Facebook Not withstanding everyone else that ever spend dollar It is wellknown that advertisers have been less than enthused with the results theyve received via Facebook advertising runs Dont take my word for it you can find story after story across the web I have posited Facebook has been more of the nothing else is working might as well go there recipient as opposed to This platform is an advertisers dream come true Much like AOL was at the tail end of their dominance as an eyeballs for ads player And here is where the word discovery correlates into an impending headache more like severe migraine for Facebook And I believe Facebook may not in fact yet grasp just how much trouble may be on the horizon For this isnt about some free service user agreed boilerplate sign off indemnifying them from potential oops sorry about that but dont forget you signed off in saying we cant be held responsible No the difference here is for the possibly that Facebook actively sold then required payment as in money for that access to a potential audience If they did that all while knowing that audience as well as the payee themselves were being suppressed Do you see my point here How many lawyers do you think are lining up or burning the midnight oil contemplating how theyll attract others for a class action Think about it Is it unreasonable to think you wont start seeing ads on latenight TV or business channels stating things like Did you pay money only to see no results on Facebook You may have a legal right to join our See what mean And thats just the beginning in my opinion Think about if youre a large organization that had little to mixed results with a recent or number of ad campaigns with Facebook Do you sit there and look at all that red ink left in your advertising budget from a poor showing of results in corresponding sales because it was the cause of your poor ad design Or was it because you now believe whether correctly or not your ads were possibly not shown to what you deemed was your target audience conservatives Or even others For if it is proved they suppressed or adulterated one group why could they not have done the same with another which you paid to be in front of Only one way to find out sue for discovery See how easy it is to escalate or conflate Again a class action or just plain business lawyers dream come true in my opinion Im also of the opinion those inquiries will come even faster if any said wronged parties just happen to have their own inhouse counsel or on retainer I cant stress this point enough remember If someone is selling you an audience and making claims about your ability to reach that audience then charging you and accepting payment for precisely that And at the same time there are people employed by them actively suppressing content and more within that very group even if it is only a portion which could affect the results for cost and benefit without it being openly disclosed What else have you told or sold me that I need to find out about that might have harmed me See what I mean This is business And once you make a claim accept money for that claim and deliver what a court may find different Everything changes And this is where the real story is to watch in the current FacebookConservative story Not whether they should would or did suppress Theyre within their legal right as a private company to do that regardless if anyone likes it or not But if you take payment for something and deliver something that is not exactly what one may have described ie access to XYor Z because you are fiddling with those parameters inhouse And not stating that potential clearly to those paying customers Its a class action lawyers dream come true is all Im saying Which brings me back to the third leg in this Silicon Valley run for the roses saga involving another type of equine Unicorns I took a lot of heat from many a Valley aficionado when I called out the lunacy of what I felt was more of an investor based decision as opposed to an outright business decision when it was announced Jack Dorsey would headup both Twitter as well as Square as their CEO simultaneously Heres an excerpt to wit The only reason any company with potential for either real growth let alone possible explosive styled growth which in the Valley is the only metric that still matters would pick if not outright beg an executive that can only devote of their resources to run a once highflying song bird which desperately needs direction reeks desperation No one else in all the world let alone Silicon Valley was up to the task A multiBILLION dollar publicly traded enterprise on the forefront of all that Silicon Valley represents cant attract any other CEO talent who could devote of their abilities This makes absolutely no sense what so ever unless the board as well as many investors are panicstricken on just how bad things are behind the scenes and figured the best they could do was to bring or convince a person such as Mr Dorsey back on as CEO spin the narrative as much as humanly possible and pray Wall Street buys it Literally Second How does Square do the same to that circle where it itself is getting ready to IPO I can not imagine for the life of me any serious business person of any stature that would postulate it would be a good idea to let its CEO devote of their resources away from their now chosen organization at such a critical juncture Not only that to then reach back and devote the remaining and try to mend the broken wings on a clearly fumbling entity Unless the decisions were all driven by intermingled investors between the two In other words This is all about saving stock or IPO values or cashing out valuations Not about saving or revitalizing a company Or for that matter what Square will or might be after its IPO debut Something here just isnt right Within that excerpt is what I feel is the underlying issue that is about to be fully exposed as well as destroyed in the very near future ie Many unicorns have ceased to have been race worthy a long time ago but the narrative has been desperately held up reminiscent of a Potemkin village for these last months or more with hopes prayers and breathtaking fairytales bordering on outright fraud in hopes that maybe just maybe theyll make it to an IPO and shed all that dead weight of having to holdup this houseofcards pretension any longer Its quite possible not only is that race never going to restart It may be found that in fact unicorns no matter how vivaciously curated a narrative have been lying dead in the gates longer than many even realize For if there is one thing this whole Theranos and Facebook debacle has unleashed it is this As Ive stated many times before The damage isnt in only what someone does too you Its the way you now have to treat everyone after is where the real damage lies And the questioning of how and why a unicorn remains one along with how and why one spent money with todays socalled eyeballs for ads platform leader have only just begun And the resulting damage to a whole lot of unquestionable narratives are about to see something they havent possibly seen ever A whole lot of tougher questions followed with a demand for answers that have the weight of law and monetary consequences behind them Mon Grandad Grumps There always seems to be some connections between the banks deep state and the overly promoted and overvalued dotcom companies Mon Miles Ahead Remember its one thing to mess with andor lose peoples money its quite another to do the same with their health where lives are at risk Mon NoDebt Im so terribly tired of com collapses Not so much that it keeps happening over and over again but that they dont even bother changing the narratives the language or the measurement metrics Name ONE difference between this com implosion and the one that happened years ago You cant can you They didnt even change the words Its like they plagiarized the whole damed thing straight out of an encyclopedia for their homework assignment Eyeballs Clicks Advertising dollars Monetizing their user base Its all bullshit UNCHANGED bullshit Its one thing to collaspe its another to bore the shit out of me while its collapsing Watching this movie wasnt even all that entertaining the first time Mon Vampyroteuthis The Silicon Valley libtards backed by Wall Street money actually believe they are bullet proof like all libtards and refuse to face the fact that the lie is crubling around them They believe they are entitled to the big payoffs for garbage companies because they are special It will bankrupt them because the facade is over and their credit limit is reached If they would have pawned the companies to IPOs earlier they would have handed to back to common stock investors Instead they got greedy and live in denial and will lose everything Game over Mon A Pimps love i Mon Shizzmoney Yeah all of the people employed by the deep state own the dotcom stocks and the pension funds of the various state agencies own the dotcom stocks and the banks not only own the stocks but also bankroll the VCs of the dotcom companies and the buybacks of the dotcom stocks Mon Snpir_Ag_Obair Mon Miles Ahead Huh Of course they looked Then they jumped on it and tried to ride it as long as they could to get theirs This is how we do it around here regarding financial fraud Didnt you notice with the Bernie Madoff scheme You think the participants didnt know And then pre with MBS et al Here in the US of A you see a scam in finance if you can jump in without getting burnt you go for it Conscience cost Butchie The Wire Mon pound the vix We have a new generation maybe that have been taught that anything is possibleif they believe it Unfortunately you first have to do the hard work put your research up for peer reviewfail many times search for new answers and keep trying and use science not liberal arts You cant just claim it will work make a slick speach and go public at a billion dollar valuation Mon BanginPoundCocks Facebook is a very profitable company Just a bit different than Theranos Facebook has made more pure profit in like years of monetizing than Amazon has made in fucking years as a pure retail company Not sucking Zuckerbergs little aspbergers weenie here just stating the facts Mon i_call_you_my_base Margin on advertising is almost always better than retail particularly if you can exponentially grow inventory without increasing overhead This is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has been so profitable You get more users and more money with very little need for addtional input cost Its not a bad business if you accept it for what it is Mon _ConanTheLibert Mon SoDamnMad When I read and article and wish to comment on it and there requires a signin to Facebook Iquestion the credibility of the article knowing my commentgets forwardedto the Ministry of Truth Mon i_call_you_my_base In the case of Theranos all of the claims of innovation were obviously bullshit A complete fantasy What I take from facebooks content curation is the same but from a different angle Frankly I dont care that much if they are censoring content whats interesting is that they are desparately trying to become a straightup content provider Their ability to make money and grow has always been suspect Theyve been trying to make deals with content providers for a awhile juice trending articles etc and it just isnt working The only thing they have is what theyve always had which is looking at your aunt pegs cat photos This idea that they had the eyes and just needed to monetize them was always bullshit It was always a fantasy just like Theranos Edison machine Ive been saying for a long time in the end Facebook is just a display ad site with a lot of users Its nothing special And they are basically proving the point in the end Facebook is just a display ad site with a lot of users Its a front for the NSA for citizen data gathering Like <span
