event at the Flint Center in Cupertino California September CHICAGO In a January earnings call with investors Apple Inc AAPLO Chief Executive Tim Cook made a confident prediction will be the year of Apple Pay he said Since then the company has aggressively courted retailers and claimed significant success Weve spoken to all of the top merchants in the US andabout half will accept Apple Pay this year with many more the following year a company spokesperson recently told Reuters But interviews with analysts merchants and others suggest that Apples forecast may be too optimistic and that many retailers remain skeptical about the payment system The service is one of Apples biggest bets a chance to tie customers more tightly to its phones and its new smart watch as well as to take a tiny bite from every retail transaction To assess Apples progress Reuters worked from the National Retail Federations list of the top US retailers surveying the that had brickandmortar outlets two of the top sell only online Eightyfive supplied detailed responses and others supplied information only about whether or not they accept Apple Pay Two did not respond While some of the countrys top merchants said they use and like the mobile payment system fewer than a quarter of the retailers said they currently accept Apple Pay and nearly twothirds of the chains said categorically they would not be accepting it this year Only four companies said they have plans to join the program in the next year The top reasons retailers cited for not accepting Apple Pay were insufficient customer demand a lack of access to data generated in Apple Pay transactions and the cost of technology to facilitate the payments Some merchants said they were holding out because they plan to participate in a new mobile payment system to be launched by a coalition of retailers later this year Reliable statistics on mobile wallet payments are difficult to obtain Neither the companies offering payment systems nor credit card issuers will disclose detailed data about usage But analysts agree that they are used for only a tiny percentage of US retail transactions An online survey conducted by Verifone PAYN and Wakefield Research released in January found that mobile wallets accounted for about percent of the overall payments market for instore retail transactions in the US How that market is divided up among the major players is not entirely clear An ITG Investment Research study conducted in November soon after Apple Pay was launched found that the service accounted for percent of digital payment dollars while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Wallet accounted for percent Since then analysts agree Apple Pays market share has grown dramatically In the last six months or so there has been more acceptance of Apple Pay said Steve Weinstein senior internet analyst for ITG <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Wallet has kind of stalled out In January Apples Cook citing internal data said Apple Pay accounted for two out of three dollars spent in contactless payments but the company did not provide data to back up those numbers Still it is clear Apple Pay has made considerable progress in signing up vendors with more than sites as of March the last time Apple updated its numbers including selfservice terminals such as vending machines laundromats and parking meters Interviews with retailers suggest that the company has relied on aggressive marketing to recruit participants They have been pushing hard and its been that way for months said the representative of one large retailer that has no plans to accept Apple Pay They have called and tried to persuade us even after we communicated our decision to them The company hasnt adopted Apple Pay he said because not even a small percentage of its customers have asked for it SPEED CONVENIENCE AND SECURITY Many companies that accept Apple Pay report that they and their customers are happy with it Whole Foods WFMO spokesman Michael Silverman said that Apple Pay transactions accounted for percent of its sales dollars as of March and that it expects use to rise Our shoppers are really enjoying the speed convenience and security of Apple Pay he said But for other retailers and consumers Apple has yet to answer the question what is in it for us if we use Apple Pay said Alberto Jimenez program director for mobile payments at IBM which provides technology to mobile wallet makers and retailers Jimenez would not say whether Apple is among their customers The program doesnt offer loyalty rewards to customers as companies such as Starbucks SBUXO do with their mobile applications nor does it provide customer information to retailers about Apple Pay users For of the retailers surveyed by Reuters lack of access to data about customers and their buying habits is a key reason they dont accept Apple Pay One of the biggest concerns is data control said Mario De Armas senior director international payments at the worlds largest retailer WalMart Stores Inc When a credit card is swiped through a terminal the retailer gets the name and card number which when combined with publicly available demographic data like address phone and email helps retail chains send welltargeted promotions to customers WalMart and of the other top retailers are part of a coalition challenging Apple Pay with a mobile wallet called CurrentC which is scheduled to launch in mid Retailers participating in CurrentC wont be allowed to accept any other mobile wallet until according to a senior official at MCX the company launching CurrentC For that reason alone of the NRFs top retailers will not be able to accept Apple Pay before the end of the year although three of them said they plan to accept Apple Pay by early Another reason cited for not accepting Apple Pay by retailers surveyed by Reuters was the cost of terminals and computer upgrades required to accept a mobile wallet What is the return on investment asked Maureen Elworthy director of treasury at Ahold USA which runs supermarket chains like StopShop during a panel discussing Apple Pay at an industry conference The return is negative she said She told Reuters that Ahold USA does not plan to accept any wallets because they see it as an investment cost without immediate returns The cost to merchants of accepting a mobile wallet is highly variable depending on what technology they already have in place Retailers face an October deadline to upgrade their credit card terminals to accept cards with microchips and the new terminals will typically also support contactless payments such as Apple Pay But mobile payments also require backend systems that can be costly especially for a large retail chain accepting multiple types of mobile payment systems said Rick Dakin chief executive of Coalfire a security systems and IT infrastructure firm Apple declined to comment on the cost to retailers of accepting Apple Pay but referred Reuters to Ian Drysdale Executive VicePresident at payment processor Elavon which works with Apple As long as the retailer is upgrading to the new payment terminals which are enabled with contactless payment technology there is very little additional cost to accept Apple Pay he said Ultimately the success of Apple Pay may rest with iPhone users like Scott Braeckel an iPhone owner who has used Apple Pay but only once Braeckel said he liked the Apple Pay experience but he generally pays with a credit card even at places like McDonalds which accepts the mobile wallet A survey released in March by shopper insight firm InfoScout and PYMNTScom of more than iPhone users found that while percent of them had tried the payment system only percent said they continued to use it It was an interesting curiosity but hasnt moved into daily use for me because frankly I dont really shop at places its taken Braeckel said The places I mostly shop which are my grocery store and pharmacy
