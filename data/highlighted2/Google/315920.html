from the site Submitted by Christoph Gisiger via Finanz Und Wirtschaft Fred Hickey editor of the widely read investment newsletter The HighTech Strategist warns of more trouble to come for stocks and spots bright investment opportunities in the gold sector Around the globe financial markets are in turmoil For Fred Hickey that doesnt come as a surprise The outspoken editor of the investment newsletter The HighTech Strategist predicted towards the end of that the US stock market would fall when the Fed stops its stimulus program QE Since January especially equities in the Nasdaq Composite index are getting clubbed For the contrarian investor with a longtime experience in the IT industry this fits the classical behavior of a bear market Mr Hickey warns that stocks will fall further and recommends to buy gold and shares of gold miners Mr Hickey the bumpy ride on the stock markets continues How dangerous is the situation Were in a bear market Technically were not in a bear market yet but bear markets are a process where it takes time to batter investor confidence and break it down Bear markets start off as healthy corrections or just as selloffs that turn into corrections Only later do they reveal themselves One could compare this process to a boxing prize fight In the first round the eventual loser which would be the US stock market investors is dancing around the ring and is really excited after several rounds of gains But as the US economy starts to break down and the stock market starts to fall off without QE and mutual fund outflows grow the fighter starts taking a lot of body blows and weakens We saw that process occur all of last year Stocks fell for the first time in six years and weve seen many market segments get hit hard whether its energy materials or transportation stocks So last year was the breaking down process and now since the beginning of its been a rough time As the bear market process continues fewer and fewer stocks remain aloft One by one they fall and investors crowd into a smaller and smaller number of favorites which look like theyre invincible This classic herding behavior has happened as long as I have been watching markets At the beginning of the bear market in for example investors crowded into tech stocks like Polaroid Kodak and IBM The same thing happened with Microsoft Intel and Compaq in the early bear market of The next time we saw the market break in investors crowded into Cisco Systems Sun Microsystems and EMC Similarly as the market started breaking down in October we had Apple Research in Motion Amazon and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>They were even called the four horsemen and were still holding up months later after the market had already started to weaken But finally the knockout blow comes and even those stocks arent immune In fact they fall harder and faster than the rest of the market because theyve held up before Last year weve seen that very same pattern with the so called FANG stocks Facebock Amazon Netflix and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Some of those shares are now under heavy pressure Does that mean were already near the knockout round Some of those stocks like Amazon and Netflix more than doubled last year in an overall market that was down Whats interesting now is that some of these FANG stocks like Amazon and Netflix are even leading the market down Also biotech stocks are getting killed These equities were all ridiculously overpriced and now the confidence is being lost Its hard to know when exactly the knockout blow comes But were certainly well into the bear market when such stocks start to break down like this How can you be sure about that Maybe this is just another temporary setback like the one at the end of August There are always rallies in bear markets For instance back in I counted six rallies over points in the Dow Jones Industrial They are typically very sharp Most of them are short but some can last for a while We had several rebounds that lasted one month But I also do know that in the later stages of a bear market these rallies begin to last only a day or two It gets very violent before the bottom This bear market will continue which means were headed lower with rallies in between until the Federal Reserve is forced to come in and start QE At which point will the Fed step in The problem for investors is it wont happen very soon In December the Fed sold everyone that the economy is improving so that they could raise interest rates But the economy wasnt strong In fact industrial production was in a recession and the ISM manufacturing index dropped to indicating a contraction Almost every time that happened in the past it lead to a recession in the US Also prices for oil iron ore copper and basically all commodities collapsed last year and continue to drop this year And you see the high yield market getting crushed That only happens in recessions typically In the past all of that would have indicated that the Fed would have been cutting rates not raising them So how long can the Fed afford to stay on the sidelines The question is how much damage and how much blood is going to be on Wall Street The problem for the Fed is that its going to be difficult to reverse course right away because it just raised rates in December Not only did the policy makers raise rates they indicated that they were going to hike rates all over this year and four times more in So they have to save their face and theyre probably digging in their heels there which means investors are at risk for more losses Will markets rally once again when the Fed reopens the spigot Ultimately thats whats going to happen But in my opinion the Fed is completely dangerous Its the most dangerous entity out there The policy makers are the ones who are causing much of the problems we have today We have inflated asset prices and thats favorable on the upside But when they come down the pain is twice as hard And ultimately it affects confidence Its not sustainable when you have valuations too high It creates all sorts of malinvestments in the economy and ultimately all of those become unwound That painful process seems to happen in the energy sector Why are investors so nervous about the drop in oil prices In its typical optimism Wall Street wants to blame all the problems on oil Wall Street wants you to believe that if oil prices stabilize the stock market will stabilize too But oil is not the problem Its just a symptom of a severe disease The real problem is too much debt and too many bad government policies The oil price has collapsed because the Fed and other central banks around the world pushed interest rates down to zero That encouraged new investments in energy production and in other commodity production whether its steel copper or whatever Were overproducing everything now as a result of the zero percent interest rates How about malinvestments in your field of special expertise the tech sector When you have easy money it encourages technology companies to invest in some of what they call the growth areas Since there isnt a lot of growth in PCs smartphones tablets and other areas they all crowded into the cloud business Ive been talking about that for some time At one point around eighty companies were piling into the cloud space from every area of technology We had all of the telecom companies like ATT Verizon and Centurylink piling in We had IBM HewlettPackard Dell Apple and all of those companies piling in And then we had the social media companies and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Amazon All those companies were building cloud capacity at the same time Everybody was building too much capacity What we see now is that cloud demand isnt growing fast enough and it hits the wall It was the same thing with the fiber optic and hosting capacity buildup in You had peoples imagination running wild with easy money and it ended in an enormous amount of capacity The same problem we have now with cloud capacity So in the last few months of and since the start of this year weve seen a lot of companies drop out of the race HewlettPackard dropped out and so did Dell CenturyLink Verizon and several others are trying to sell their cloud businesses Also Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>slashed capex And I believe Amazon has too much capacity too In fact they had to do over fifty price cuts Is this going to be as bad as the burst of the dotcom bubble The early s were pretty special There was a total collapse All the malinvestments all the overvaluations were concentrated in the technology world This time the problems are much broader We had too much fracking capacity buildup too much steelmaking capacity too much of everything around the world including in the technology world where we had this bubble of capacity buildup in cloud computing In the commodity sector the buildup of overcapacities is also related to the fast growing demand out of China How important is China for the tech sector China is very important because it is either the largest or the second largest end market for most technology products For PCs and smartphones China is the number one consumer and for autos as well Now China has a lot of problems It lifted growth around the world coming out of the last recession and to do so it piled on debt from trillion to trillion Now the only way out seems to be devaluation of its currency which will cause problems for other countries that compete with China Also many of the emerging markets are selling to China and they have accumulated an enormous amount of debt too Debt was the problem in and around the world all we have done is increase the debt In the US the government increased its debt from trillion in to almost trillion This is what zero percent interest rates negative interest rates and money printing do They encourage even more bad behavior by governments Instead of getting the correction that needed to occur weve only made it worse So what does Chinas slowdown mean for the tech sector Its going to have an effect on the technology markets Thats a problem And then there are bad news from other parts of the world as well like Latin America Brazil is in recession Also Japan despite all of the money printing attempts is back in recession Japan is one of the top economies in the world and weve seen that PC sales have absolutely collapsed there Europe is muddling through but thats only because they have the benefit of a lower Euro right now The US is a little better but clearly weakening All that doesnt make for a good outlook for the technology world and there doesnt seem to be anything that could turn it around Whats the impact on earnings As of now most big tech companies have reported their results for the fourth quarter Im not surprised that there have been a lot of warnings from the Apple world You have to understand Apple is a giant with bn in revenue last year and the tentacles are wide Its mostly a hardware company and two times the size of HewlettPackard the largest computer company in the world So when Apple is in trouble its a huge drag on all of the suppliers I call them the Apple Dumplings and there are many of them In fact Apples numbers were one of the big disappointments in this earnings season The bad news has only just begun People wanted iPhones with a bigger screen and Apple was very slow to bring those out But when they did there was a great hunger in their customer base for the iPhone and the iPhone Plus At the same time Apple was rolling out those phones it brought in the last major carrier that hadnt been carrying iPhones That was China Mobile with to million subscribers So that led to the mother of all upgrade cycles and Apples numbers were enormously inflated Now here we are a year later and Apple is going to have extremely difficult comparisons The fourth quarter numbers were disappointing but the first quarter numbers are going to fall apart And what about the long term outlook Apple hasnt brought out a really new product in years They had some failures Apple TV hasnt gone anywhere and Apple Pay has been very slow The Apple Watch has been a huge disappointment There is tremendous amount of competition and they have overpriced the product They want to bring out an Apple car in but there is no chance of that happening Maybe they can bring it out many years later at best The company has become primarily a smart phone company and that even more so over the past few years Thats a problem because the smartphone market has matured Even in China the market has grown only last year And when a market in technology products gets saturated prices start to drop and margins contract Thats a permanent slowdown which the analysts havent really accounted for yet The smartphone market becomes essentially another PC market and thats not a good thing as we have witnessed over the last ten years or more What does that mean for Apple shares The stock has already lost more than in the past twelve months I think Apple will fall but it has the support of its dividend So its decline will be limited Its the suppliers that are going to get killed Stocks like Skyworks Solutions Cirrus Logic Qorvo Avago and NXP Semiconductors that doubled tripled or quadrupled in the prior year leading up to the introduction of the iPhone Those stocks have all broken down and they will continue to fall since I think that even when the iPhone is introduced it wont be a leap in technology There wont be the kind of pent up demand like there was for the iPhone So where do you spot opportunities for investors Were still in a money printing environment I dont believe the central banks are willing to let the free market forces correct The correction will be so painful and it will prove that their Keynesian policies were wrong As a result we are going to get more money printing debasing of currencies and even deeper negative interest rates and thats the best environment possible for gold Also because the gold price fell so hard in the last few years we had no malinvestments in the gold mining sector in contrast to the energy space or in the cloud business In fact gold supply from mining is expected to fall this year At the same time the demand in countries like China Russia and India remains robust Thats why I expect gold to rally this year and the secular bull market in gold to resume Even when stocks are in a bear market When the worlds stock markets come down gold typically goes up In the US for example gold took off when the stock market broke in It went on a year run whereas it was a lost decade for stocks Same thing in the s There was a big bull market in gold and it was a very bad period for stocks Just look at China today The Shanghai Composite is down almost since June of and the Chinese real estate market is collapsing So what are investors going to do Well you go into gold in those circumstances So if the central bankers keep debasing we will see multi thousand dollar levels for the price of gold How are you positioned for this rally You have to be patient But when gold lifts off the mining stocks will be even greater Right now gold mining stocks trade at multi decade lows relative to the price of gold These are levels that even people who have been in the industry for a long time have never seen before So the mining stocks would have to triple to just attain average levels relative to the price of gold Therefore what I have been doing this year and last year is to capture the downside of technology stocks through put options I have been taking those gains and putting them into the mining stocks I think thats going to be the biggest payoff that I have ever seen Which are your top picks in the gold mining sector My favorite pick has remained the same for a while Agnico Eagle Mines They are managed so well and there are no concerns about them going under Last year was a terrible year for the gold miners in general Despite that the stock of Agnico Eagle actually went up a little bit Another nicely conditioned company is Detour Gold And then there are the battered ones Among them I like New Gold Goldcorp and Alamos Gold But obviously you cant put all your money into mining stocks and into gold Therefore it makes sense to have a good amount of cash at this point to take advantage of the decline that occurs in the stock market Because if the Federal Reserve launches QE that will likely lead to another upleg in stocks and you want to be able to take advantage of that Wed nink Wed NidStyles Wed slaughterer We will be locked in a trading range of for awhile before things really break down Way too many excessive positioning errors across too many markets for it to really plunge There is already covert QE happening through RRs and other shadow transfers Next leg up will catch alot of people by surprise Wed Hitlery__Dictator Only satanic super debt slave morons who worship the world had any confidence in the last years Sorry those are just the facts Wed Tinky Yeah well count me out as one who has confidence in any serious prolonged upleg in the market when the FED folds and starts the next round of QE Wed BlueStreet Wed Chuckster Wed insanelysane It really isnt a bear market If the market can only price based on fundementals then the price needs to be lower If you are pricing based on QEx then it can go up Wed savedeposit Right so they can sell fictional worthless stuff called assets nobody wants they just dont know it yet in stock markets to each other to pretend it it worth something Wed eatthebanksters Obummer Ray Dalio and every hedge fund operator on Wall Street the TBTF banks and the politicians who need to give away free shit to get electd or keep their jobsno one else really Wed eatthebanksters This one is on Barry folksya see Barry didnt want to make hard choices he wanted to spend and make everyone happy so he could play King He told his minions at the Fed to take care of business and make things better with monetary policy becasue he DID NOT want to do what was necessary after which was to tighten our collective belt and reduce debt Well the Fed has run out of tools one year before Barry is set to ride off into the sunset The Fed knows if they keep adding band aids and kicking the can down the road it will get so bad that there will be no recovery So Janet and her Federales are now saying NO to all the Wall Street banks hedge funds and politico junkies that need their cheap money injections to continue functioning Wont it be ironic that after blaming GW for fucking years that our MIC Moron In Chief will end his reign as Amerikas first King with an imploding economyhis legacy will be how he fucked things up so bad that the only way to recover was to undo everyting he did Bwahahahahahahaha Wed Chuckster When these guys are on the right side of the trendthey are geniuses The system is going down but the Fed is totally unpredictable and that fact should be respected I do expect negative interest rates and I hope the public rebels We had operation twist beforewho knows what in the hell they will come up with next I think when it is discovered they been buying back the USA government bonds in Belgium creating a round robin it will be all over They desperately need WW as a diversion Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site US MARKET WRAP In a
