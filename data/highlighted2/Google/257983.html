Super Simple Dumb Model To Value Yahoo Yahoo Inc NASDAQYHOO Seeking Alpha Discounting cash flows is hard Forecasting them is even harder Fortunately discounted cash flows are no longer needed in order to value shares of Yahoo All you really need to do is make a good guess at what the board was up to this past weekend Anyone can do it So without further ado I give you my Super Simple Dumb Model which you can use to value your own shares of Yahoo Have you heard Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO is the new black The last thing the Internet needs is another article about Yahoo Nevertheless Ill give it a go A lot has been in the news So lets get caught up first The web is littered with chatter about what the sum of the parts are worth Tanveer Signgh did what looks like a nice job here This is a reasonable way to think about valuation First you add up their cash Then add in their large stakes in Yahoo Japan and Alibaba NYSE BABA Finally subtract out their debt What you are left with is some number Lets call it the value of Yahoos garage Like its all the stuff that Yahoo has sitting around in their garage Yahoo has a lot of other stuff too Like a core bushiness that Marissa Mayer has been trying to turn around That core business should be worth something But what happened was kind of strange The market price of Yahoos stock started trading below the value of all the stuff it had just sitting in the garage So then you get some headlines that are all like Is Yahoos core business really worth That particular one is from CNBC Yahoo has been dead set on spinning off their stake in Alibaba They asked the IRS if they could do that tax free The IRS decided not to give their opinion Then the IRS started talking about dropping hot dog stands into pools of appreciated stock Who knew the IRS was so colorful Matt Levine at Bloomberg View breaks it down nicely here But the IRSs answer was basically to lock the door yell were not here and then dig a tunnel out the back to escape It refused to say yes refused to say no and announced that it was reconsidering its ruling policy in the hopes that no one would ask it a similar question ever again The office of answering this particular question is closed indefinitely This is a much worse answer than yes and looks sort of ugly even compared with no The lack of opinion didnt seem to matter much to Yahoo They just kept going about their business It appears they are still getting ready to spin off the Alibaba shares into a box called Abaco This upset some activists It also explains why shares of Yahoo were worth less than what it had laying around in the garage Lack of an opinion from the IRS opens the door to the possibility of one day receiving a tax bill from the IRS Yahoo analyst Bob Peck has a worst case scenario where the bill could actually turn out to be greater than of the sale You see Worst case is of what you have sitting in the garage shares of Alibaba becomes less than worthless I am a big fan of Matt Levines stuff He seems to be ahead of the curve here I remember reading his article from September of last year when he figured out that Alibaba Could Buy Yahoo for Free Yep he pretty much had it nailed well over a year ago If you missed it last year you can check out last weeks rehash here His plan looks pretty optimal for Yahoo shareholders The trick is to get rid of everything in the garage except for the Alibaba holdings Then Yahoo just becomes a box of Alibaba shares Alibaba can then buy that box and retire the shares tax free However I tend to agree with him on the following points Here he is again This is a good trade Yahoo and Alibaba should do this trade Why wont they do this trade One reason is that it is a little too obvious that Alibaba would be getting Yahoo and Yahoo Japan for that matter for free and if you are a management team and board of directors and someone comes to you and says I want to buy your company for nothing then your inclination will be to say no Your company has to be worth something Like youre coming to work every day doing stuff Concluding that the stuff youre doing is worth nothing or negative billion depending how you count is a little too much like staring into the abyss for most corporate executives So with shame ruling a good plan improbable lets assume Yahoo keeps working toward the Abaco deal In that case here is simple dumb model to value shares of Yahoo A the value of some of the stuff in the garageThe cash the debt and Japan shares bn the market value of the Alibaba holdings B the probability that the IRS would let the Abaco spin off tax free C the tax rate if someday the IRS decides to send them a bill Got it Yahoo is worth the garage plus some probability weighted value of the spin off less the expected tax bill The value of the core business is assumed to be worth zero in this model That could be an unreasonable assumption I didnt really think about it that much A quick glance at a company burning cash and a negative valuation in the sum of parts made me comfortable with zero Plus I heard dozens of executives are quitting their jobs at Yahoo That is a pretty good proxy for insider selling A was about bn in my mind It was adjusted for taxes and market impact and liquidity premiums and things like that If you plug B and C you end up guessing that Yahoo is worth about per share Those are not reasonable estimates is a random guess Im not a tax attorney for C comes from Bob Pecks numbers on gains tax and indemnification Its a dumb model It might still be a good model The stock is trading at So at we are not far off But thats not really the point The point is that the stuff in the garage is worth a lot relative to the core business So much so that the value of the core business does not play a huge role in the value of Yahoos stock I mean the fair value for core Yahoo is probably either so low relative to the value of the garage that it doesnt really matter or it should be valued as a takeover target So we can skip all the forecasting and cash flow discounting Thank goodness That stuff is a lot of work Who has time for that stuff Remember when I told you that Matt Levine had figured out over a year ago that maybe the best way for Yahoo to maximize shareholder value would be to consider selling itself to Alibaba for free Now imagine how surprised I was to see YHOO spike last week on headlines talking about how the board is all of the sudden going to start contemplating a sale of the core business Had they really not considered that before Its a good option The game plan has been sitting out there on the Internet for a year The market should not reprice itself on these headlines Right I mean prior to last week did the market think that regularly scheduled board meetings consisted of eating Popsicles and playing Twister If thats the case then yeah reprice Yahoo My Super Simple Dumb Model for Yahoos Shares A long time ago I decided the market is usually going to be smarter than me It has become a kind of core principle My investment process basically consists of trying to answer the following question Whos the dummy Its usually me Here is what I will call my Super Simple Dumb Model for Yahoo shares The Internet is full of goodies There are some simple ideas Mr Levine often discusses his Simple Dumb Models in his daily column on Bloomberg View and some more complicated ones sum of parts and things like that Why not combine some of that and see what happens So here is my Super Simple Dumb Model If you want to play along at home there is a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>spreadsheet for that Here we go Cash is easy Its just the value of the cash and liquid investments Cash Equivalents on the balance sheet Yahoo has some long term debt too We back that out Thats it We cannot get very creative with CASH This is where you can be as creative as you want Tanveer Signgh went with a x multiple on EBITDA of bn in his analysis Lets do an EBITDA thing too Lets say that the value of core is EBITDA multiplied by some multiple I call that multiple HOPE I just pulled the income statement from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Finance there is a tab in the spreadsheet for that and summed up some of the rows Here are the numbers The sum of the last months is million Without thinking too hard lets go with it I assign a x multiple If you are playing along at home you can make EBITA and HOPE whatever you want As far as I know there has not been much talk about Yahoo doing anything with the stake in Yahoo Japan So we can give it a garage value This is pretty straight forward The value of the stake should be the market value JVAL adjusted for a liquidity premium LPREM and a tax rate JTAX JVAL is bn and if Yahoo ever wanted to sell something that big they are not likely to receive the bid price This is the reason for LPREM and I have taken a wild guess at The sale would also generate a tax liability at something like JTAX I am not really sure what Yahoos cost basis is so I just apply the tax to the entire market value less the liquidity premium It keeps things conservative and keeps us moving along Now for the fun part This is for most of the marbles Let us consider three scenarios In the first scenario Yahoo goes ahead with the spin off without a blessing from the IRS We will call this scenario ABACO The value of the stake in Alibaba in this scenario looks like this BABAABACO BVAL BVAL PTAXED BILL It is just the market value of the holdings BVAL less an expected tax payment BVAL is just a market price on the Alibaba shares No creativity there The expected tax payment is BVAL times the probability of the IRS calling with a bill someday PTAXED and the expected size of that tax bill BILL I am not a tax attorney and is my wild guess at PTAXED The BILL I suppose would be something like It is the capital gains plus indemnification charges I saw in that article quoting Bob Peck Yahoo would have to make it worth Alibabas trouble to go through with the plan Therefore there is some discount involved called DEAL Lets make it There would also be a sale of Yahoos core The value of that sale net of tax is called LEMON Lets go with Mr Levines extremely illustrative sample math at bn This is a good opportunity to remind people they can play along at home on the spreadsheet My numbers are just my numbers The third and final option for the board is to do nothing Cancel the spin off No sales That would be pretty lame BABALAME BVAL LPREM JTAX This is just like JAPAN all over again It is a garage value for the Alibaba stake The market value of the Alibaba stake adjusted for market impact and a tax liability Nothing fancy here Now that we have our three mutually exclusive scenarios we can play with their probabilities PABA is the probability that Yahoo goes for the ABACO option The value of the Alibaba stake is just a probability weighted average of all three I went with for PABA It seems pretty likely they will just stay the course There is also this article There we have it A fair value model for YHOO and not a single discounted cash flow There is a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>spreadsheet out there and anyone can make their own best guess Just plug values into the yellow boxes and find out what Yahoo is worth to you Enjoy I
