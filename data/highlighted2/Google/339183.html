lawmakers say Facebook may have broken tax rules Reuters People walk in front of the Facebook logo at the new Facebook Innovation Hub during a preview media tour in Berlin Germany February LONDON Facebook FB said it would ditch a corporate structure that helps minimize its UK tax bill prompting lawmakers and campaigners to ask whether the arrangement had ever complied with UK tax rules Facebook said on Friday it would stop booking sales to major UK clients via an Irish subsidiary and in future report sales agreed by UK staff in Britain In light of changes to tax law in the UK we felt this change would provide transparency to Facebooks operations in the UK the company said in a statement The change follows the British governments introduction last year of a new tax on profits shifted offshore From the start of April UK sales made directly by our UK team will be booked in the UK not Ireland Facebook added The Californiabased company declined to say if it currently booked sales made by UKbased staff to UK clients in Dublin If it did this would break UK and international tax rules which require companies to book sales where they are made Caroline Flint member of parliament MP with the opposition Labour party said the statement raises more questions than it answers Facebook are trying to improve their corporate reputation but in so doing they appear to have confirmed that UKbased staff were conducting UK sales in the UK but artificially diverting that income as though it was generated by Facebook Ireland she said Labour MP Nick Smith said the UK tax authority Her Majestys Revenue and Customs HMRC should have challenged Facebooks arrangement before now Both HMRC and Facebook need to be brought to book over this he said HMRC should not just give Facebook a wrap over the knuckles over this he added A Facebook spokesman said we are compliant with UK tax law In the parliamentary public accounts committee PAC investigated <span

holding group Alphabet in January agreed to pay million pounds million in UK back taxes and interest and said it would also start to report more revenue in Britain Crawford Spence Professor of Accounting at Warwick Business School said Facebooks new arrangements lacked sufficient transparency to tell if they would result in the company paying a fair share of tax Prem Sikka Professor of Accounting at Essex University said Facebook could easily use alternative arrangements such as intergroup charges to shift profits out of Britain as effectively under the new arrangement as it does under the current system HMRC has previously downplayed the potential that increased reporting of revenue in Britain would lead to higher tax bills The tax authority says it assesses how much value a multinational creates in the UK and assesses its tax bill on that basis rather than simply following the companys own accounts of where profits are generated Facebooks main UK subsidiary said it had a million pounds loss in the most recent year for which accounts are available and a tax charge of just pounds The group does not report UK revenue but analysts said it was likely to run to hundreds of millions of pounds The company declined to answer questions about its potential future UK tax bills A spokeswoman for Prime Minister for David Cameron said on Friday the government was committed to making sure that multinationals pay their fair share of tax Facebook declined to say whether it planned to change its structure in other European countries Unlike <span style='background-color:
