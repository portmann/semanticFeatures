losing subscribers For consumers there are certain areas of the market where competition is clear cut When it comes to soda for example the products are on shelves next to each other and competition is clearly defined When it comes to Netflix NASDAQ NFLX however I often see a lack of understanding when it comes to this key business item In this article I explore the issue a little further as it goes to the heart of the companys future In regards to Netflix the service isnt that expensive which allows for consumers to subscribe to multiple streaming services Amazons NASDAQ AMZN Prime unit and Time Warners NYSE TWX HBO Go are always discussed as alternatives These are just some of the US peers Netflix has along with all of the cable companies both domestically and internationally that try to sell addon services From reading the comments on my articles as well as plenty of other data out there there are a number of subscribers who have more than one service I bring this issue up because we often see news about someone else making a play in this space Recently Rogers Communications NYSE RCI and Shaw Communications NYSE SJR have announced that they are opening their streaming video service Shomi to all Canadians Previously the service was only allowed to the companies subscribers It is clear from the comment section of that news piece and Ive seen this plenty of times regarding streaming services that not everyone understands how this totally impacts Netflix These two Canadian firms for example dont need to steal subscribers away from Netflix to negatively impact Netflix One of the key competitive aspects many lose track of is that this adds another content bidder to the space especially if the Shomi service generates a fair amount of revenues Lets say hypothetically that Im looking to sell a episode show to Netflix for rights in Canada for million or million per episode With another bidder for content maybe now I can get million per episode or million total Netflix is either forced to pay more for the show or perhaps walk away and not get the content HBO Go is currently looking at pricing plans in an effort to gain more subscribers which would give that name more financial power to purchase content Even if a new player doesnt steal subscribers away from Netflix it still can hurt the streaming giant Netflixs content liabilities have been rising substantially in recent years a lot faster than revenues in fact A look at the latest quarterly Q filing shows Netflix with almost billion of streaming content obligations The chart below shows how fast this number has grown in the past three years You can view all past quarterlyannual filings for Netflix here From Q of to Q of content obligations rose by more than Thats a rate more than double the or so revenues have risen by over that time In recent years Netflix usually has a big content obligation jump from Q to Q so I wouldnt be surprised if the number cracks the billion mark when we get quarterly results in late July About billion of these liabilities havent even hit the balance sheet yet which is why Netflix has been raising a lot of debt in recent years We also got this interesting tidbit in the Q filing about future content deals Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles the ultimate quantity andor fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date However these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately billion to billion over the next three years with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ Netflix was already at billion in content obligations over the next three years so adding nearly to that is quite material The numbers could get even worse going forward especially if more players throw their hat into the ring What if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL decides to throw a billion dollars behind content to help expand Youtube Weve also heard about how Apple NASDAQ AAPL wants to launch some sort of a TV service in the near future Add a major player to this fight and content prices could easily soar Netflix might not see a negative impact to its top line but margins could easily be squeezed On the flip side Netflix management discussed on the conference call that it believes original programming gives them more bang for the buck The following is a quote from Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos What we are seeing is the dollars invested in our original programming are more efficient in that for every dollar spent we get more bang for the buck in terms of hours viewed And hours viewed leads to higher retention more wordofmouth and more brand halo So that why we say that it turned out to be not just an important strategic investment but also an efficient one The streaming business for Netflix is currently a less profitable one than the ever popular DVD service and that will continue for years to come Well see over time if shifting money to originals really helps out the financial picture The company is hoping it can get the US streaming segment to contribution margins by and the latest quarterly result was just The DVD segment has been running around a or so contribution margin in recent years The DVD segment still has a few years of life left It will be very interesting to see what Netflix decides to do with the segment if it starts to lose money Netflix bears rejoiced last quarter when the company reported its nonGAAP free cash flow figure at a negative million With content obligations piling up at an alarming rate the bear camp wonders when Netflix will be cash flow positive again The past three quarters have seen cash burn totaling more than million In the end competition for Netflix isnt just about subscribers Many see a new player entering the space and think it wont really impact the streaming giant Unfortunately Netflix can still gain subscribers and lose if content prices are soaring The companys content obligations have soared to new highs in recent years vastly outpacing revenue growth The company also discussed future obligations that could be in the billions For those that are looking at this companys future it is important to understand all of the aspects regarding competition Source For Netflix Competition Isnt Just About Subscribers Disclosure The author has no positions
