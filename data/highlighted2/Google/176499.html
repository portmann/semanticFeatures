Microsoft Surface Phone Can Rival The iPhone s Microsoft Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha The Surface tablet brand is now accepted as a bonafide luxury brand Lumia is now popularly known as the brand for cheap Windows phones Tony Bradley of Forbes is speculating that Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT could reveal a Surface Windows phone next month I agree with his outlook I think Microsoft needs to drop the Lumia brand for its next flagship smartphones After dropping the Nokia NYSE NOK name Microsofts previous releases of Lumia handsets were all cheap products As a result Lumia is now synonymous with cheap Windows phones Sad but true smartphones of today are still considered status symbols The cool and rich vibes of the Apple NASDAQ AAPL brand likely influences people who buy iPhones The unprofitable tactic of selling Lumias is only feasible if Microsoft could implement a real alternative to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Facebooks NASDAQ FB domineering platforms for mobile advertisers I think Microsofts hardware business will improve if it focuses more on highermargin flagship phones that will cater to the oftendiscriminatory affluent sector of society The core customer base of Apple is biased toward brands like the iPhone This was made possible precisely because it was marketed as a luxury handset in spite of it being manufactured for less than Using the Surface trademark Nadella can use the same trick of making Windows phones and then selling them at flagship price tags of or higher The Surface brand of tablets has long established itself as a highend product that sells for not less than The continuing success of the Surface Pro up in sales over Q numbers even compelled Apple to copy it with the new Stylustoting iPad Pro Bradleys suggestion of a Surface phone is therefore the right step forward for Microsofts new plan for its moneylosing handset business Bradley hinted that the Surface phone could come equipped with an x bit processor from Intel NASDAQ INTC This would make the Surface phone a mini computer that will be able to run enterprise legacy apps that are still exclusively only available for Windows or Windows Its my strong opinion that the true potential of Continuum for Phones feature of Windows is best realized through Intelpowered smartphones The ugly side of ARMbased processors is that they are unable to run important industry standard software like AutoCAD or Adobe NASDAQ ADBE Photoshop The usefulness of Continuum for Phones is severely limited if Microsoft again exclusively uses Snapdragon processors from Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM for its future flagship Windows phones Office is not the only software necessary in the workplace Microsoft makes its Office bundle compatible with Snapdragonpowered Continuum for Phonescapable Windows handset from Acer However enterprise and educational market clients might still find the Acer Primo Windows smartphone inadequate if it cannot run their existing alreadypaid for custom x only software Even before the Nokia DS purchase Microsoft already was working on a prototype of a Surface smartphone The Juggernaut Alpha Surface phone was being tested in However Elop was able to sweet talk Ballmer into buying Nokias phone business which led Juggernaut Alpha being shelved in favor of Lumia phones I think the huge writedown of the Nokia handset purchase is now enough inspiration for Nadella to revive the Surface phone project Imitating Apples focus on highmargin handsets made it super successful Selling Windows phones is a pyrrhic campaign if Chinese and Indian companies could sell sub Android phones The Lumia trademark ought to be relegated only for reasonably lowcost and midrange Windows phones The Surface should be the new brand for nextgeneration Microsoftmade flagship Windows smartphones Much like the Surface tablet deal Nadella can again recruit Dell and HewlettPackard NYSE HPQ to sell highend Surface phones to their enterprise clients The prospect of an Intelpowered Surface smartphone which can replace office desktop computers is much more compelling than an iPhone S MSFT will become a real longterm winner in the enterprise mobile device market if it can deliver smartphones that are real pocket computers MSFT is a buy This is a cashrich dividendpaying and low capital intensity company with a very wide moat For the past years in spite of Nadellas decision to give away free Windows licenses is still posting growth in revenue Disclosure I amwe are long MSFT AAPL INTC NOK MoreI
