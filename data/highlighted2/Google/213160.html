this new program will see immediate and wideranging traction Expect this offering to allow FB to prove out via data several market capadding outcomes of its platform as a result As Facebook NASDAQ FB nears the psychological and algorithmic barrier of its important to put into context what is likely the most important nearterm driver of shares For me and apparently for Josh Constine who does a really good job breaking out the more colorful details in a recent TechCrunch article this has to be Facebooks embedding of highquality rich content advertisements For clarity FB has been proactively covert about the development and rollout of the optimized ads Very similar to Instant Articles Facebook is deploying differentiated advertisement offerings within the News Feed That should be good enough to take shares a leg into the mark These News Feedpositioned optimized ads are quite literally replications of the wellreceived and soughtafter Instant Article publications that have become Facebooks premium content offering for publishers The new ads give Facebook a chance to prove out several data points that could lead to it being incredibly lucrative This will matter to investors The big must have driver behind Instant Articles and the new ads are that after a user clicks on them the article or ad loads inside the Facebook app not on a mobile web browser They are what can most easily be described as preloaded for near instant loading this is huge for keeping viewers interested and that the articles provide significantly more ways to customize and engage This includes features like more engaging content structuring call to actions for engaging the user as well as for capturing the users information more options when it comes to deviceled engagement allowing the user to engage with the content by shifting their device etc and unique placement the News Feed posts are differentiated in presentation All tools that advertisers and marketers love to have access to Facebook with all its new advertiser and marketer accountability via its new reporting systems and dataanalytics features will work to prove several outcomes to advertisers and marketers That advertising to the user within the News Feed is more lucrative to the paying party as opposed to sending the user off to the paying parties website or app That its new premium ad platform economics have not been released but my guess is that these are charging a premium price is worth the rates charged That producing content exclusive to the ads is worth the manpower and risk of failure no other publishing platform that Im aware of has the ability to advertise so vibrantly within its own service at least not yet as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Twitter NYSE TWTR work on this ability in a joint venture Finally that its premium offering can bring ancillary benefits like increased visibility to its nonpremium offering But thats not it Facebook will bring itself more offensive and more defensive capacity simply by proving out the above something that will make it more money in volume and likely in average revenue per advertisermarketer Thats right By refining the way it makes money to be more geared towards a system that keep users on Facebook or within the Facebook app in effect makes FB as a whole equally more sticky By giving users fewer exit opportunities say by following a user to the advertisermarketer linked page Facebook stands to make money at a higher frequency Higherfrequency monetization means highervolume payments The companys key metrics should improve by keeping users on the website or app While not a groundbreaking concept the dynamic does need pointed out Facebooks user time on websiteapp engagements per user ad impressions abandonment rates for CTR eligible events etc presumably all improve under the new scenario Ive been a longtime Facebook bull and Im tethered to the longterm outlook of the company being long FB Jan calls which I purchased at That said Im extremely bullish the immediateterm pricing prospects of the company even approaching alltime highs I believe the official announcement of the embedded ad launch coupled with what I believe will be a marketing campaign by the company should do well to put the shares over and have them never look back My
