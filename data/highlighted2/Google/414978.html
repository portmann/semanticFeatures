file photo SAN FRANCISCO Apple Inc AAPLO is investigating how to charge electric cars talking to charging station companies and hiring engineers with expertise in the area according to people familiar with the matter and a review of LinkedIn profiles For more than a year Silicon Valley has been buzzing about Apples plan to build an electric car Now the company appears to be laying the groundwork for the infrastructure and related software crucial to powering such a product The moves show Apple responding to a key shortcoming of electric vehicles filling up the batteries A shortage of public charging stations and the hours wasted in charging a car could be an opportunity for Apple whose simple designs have transformed consumer electronics Apple which has never publicly acknowledged a car project declined to comment for this story Neither the LinkedIn profiles nor sources said specifically that Apple was building charging stations for electric cars But automotive sources last year told Reuters that Apple was studying a selfdriving electric vehicle EV as the Silicon Valley icon looks for new sources of revenue amid a maturing market for its iPhone Apple is now asking charging station companies about their underlying technology one person with knowledge of the matter said The talks which have not been reported do not concern charging for electric cars of Apple employees a service the company already provides They indicate that Apple is focused on a car the person added Charging firms are treading carefully the person added wary of sharing too much with a company they view as a potential rival It is unclear whether Apple would want its own proprietary technology such as Tesla Motors TSLAO Supercharger network or design a system compatible with offerings from other market players Several charging station suppliers contacted by Reuters declined to comment about any dealings with Apple which typically requires potential partners to sign nondisclosure agreements Arun Banskota president of NRG Energy Incs NRGN electric vehicle charging business EVgo did not respond directly to questions about Apple but said repeatedly his company was in discussions with every manufacturer of today and every potential manufacturer of tomorrow Apple has also hired at least four electric vehicle charging specialists including former BMW BMWGDE employee Rnn Braonin who worked on integrating charging infrastructure into home energy systems as well as communication between EVs BMW and utilities according a LinkedIn review As recently as January Apple hired Nan Liu an

electric car industry has faced a chickenandegg paradox with the installation of charging stations Property owners have been reluctant to install them before EVs hit the road en masse and drivers are wary of buying EVs until charging stations are widely available Apples home state of California by will need about to times the roughly work and public chargers it currently has to support a projected million zeroemission vehicles on the road according to an estimate by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Tesla recently goosed electric vehicle demand unveiling its more affordable Model sedan generating hundreds of thousands of reservations from potential buyers and leading many experts to calculate the number of EVs will soon outstrip the charging station supply Tesla also has led the way with a proprietary network for customers who also can use public chargers Its more than Supercharger stations juice up a car in about minutes more than twice as fast as the standard fast charger called Level One global engineering and construction firm already has reached out to Apple to offer its services a person at the firm said It would be natural to assume if Apple is going to have a full battery electric vehicle that creates a seamless consumer experience the way Apple does the charging infrastructure and its availability would be of paramount importance the source said News and
