class='textDiv'>Apples Numbers The Big Picture April am by Bob Lefsetz So said Bob Dylan in Its Alright Ma Im Only Bleeding a fountain of wisdom on Bringing It All Back Home a transition from politics to inner truth from folk to rock this was the LP before Highway Revisited when Dylan became a household name with Like A Rolling Stone But thats what Dylan was a man who kept rolling kept changing kept exploring who was not married to the past and cared not a whit for naysayers But those days are through To expect the Cupertino company to continue to triumph is to expect the Doors to succeed without Jim Morrison Granted some bands survive the loss of their frontman Van Halen soldiered on with Sammy Hagar and Phil Collins emerged from behind the kit to lead Genesis but usuallywhen the creative genius is gone its over But the public does not want to believe this Its hard to get peoples attention its hard to gain their loyalty but once theyre inured to you they dont want to give up Exhibit number one is BlackBerry Anybody whod used an iPhone knew the Canadian company was toast But even the financial press was out of the loop looking at the numbers instead of society Something new and different that not only titillates its fancy but demonstrates extreme utility Unlike the Apple Watch which was good in theory yet dead on arrival or after twenty four hours when it ran out of juice You had to recharge it was it worth the effort or were you better off just putting it in a drawer And like a cult band from the eighties which hits a wall and goes no further there was no word of mouth on the Apple Watch some owners testified but the rest of the populace just ignored it Tim Cook needs to be replaced Apple doesnt need a traffic cop it needs a visionary Execution is important but its secondary to inspiration The idea is king never forget it But it wont happen because in modern society the board is a tool of the CEO an echo chamber And no one likes to take big risks no one likes to upset the apple cart when things are going reasonably well But then they start to tank and its over Kind of like the iPad replaced by the phablet the large phone The iPad was killed by the phablet the same way the iPod was killed by the iPhone What did Cook and company do They doubleddown on the iPad creating a Pro version with a stylus that was a marvel of technology but is something most people just dont need Meanwhile there was this canard that the device was a desktop replacement when the truth is its nothing of the sort Thats what we depended upon Steve Jobs for Were not techies were not engineers were just consumers We buy you provide So were down to three Amazon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Facebook Apple is over And it hurts me to say this being a Mac user since but he who cannot see the writing on the wall is destined to a life of business illiteracy never mind being left behind You can fail but you must learn from your mistakes Amazon killed its Fire phone but its building a juggernaut with its Echo Apple made the big splash with Siri but its the Seattle company thats taking the flag and running with it doing what Apple used to do best Yes Apple did not create the first portable MP player nor the first smartphone it just did it better Amazon has not only trumped Apple in voice recognition it put a dent in wireless speaker leader Sonos which is pivoting at this very moment But theres no pivot at Apple only an endless victory lap As for the electric car Assuming theyre building one Steve didnt focus on metoo products but breakthrough products And the breakthrough is in driverless cars and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>dominates there The two founders the two principals took over the reins from Eric Schmidt they no longer need adult supervision And although theyve stumbled here and there <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>keeps pushing the envelope funding new businesses most people havent heard of and adjusting for a mobile economy along the way Which Facebook does best Facebook has made inroads into mobile advertising and the average person just thinks its a social network the same way most people dont know the prime revenue driver at Amazon is the web services division not retail Smartphones are nearly a commodity This is whats hurting Samsung the cheap competition from the bottom the Korean company just cant establish enough differentiation to hold on to market share never mind profits Sure the iPhone has an ecosystem it may even sport the best OS out there but Apple has been legendarily bad at services and we need look no further to Sony to see how those selling premiumpriced products are ultimately eclipsed Turned out Samsung was just as good if not better in flat panel TVs the Trinitron was no longer an engine of growth The future comes and if you dont continue to lead youre toast This is not a musical act which can thrive on the hits of its past No one wants a cassette Walkman and no one wants a twenty inch tube TV Bill Campbell believed in founders Turns out adult supervision makes the trains run on time balances the books but makes your company moribund Youve got to find a way to keep the crazy innovators in charge And if they cant adjust their ways if they cant get along theyre booted like Andy Rubin or neutered like Marissa Mayer both at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>And yes Marissa got another gig where shes accomplished little demonstrating the worst parts of her willful my way or the highway personality in the process Maybe Yahoo was unfixable but if the board had done its research it would have never hired her Apple needs a house hippie Someone who can see into the future and bend the company to his or her will Tim Cook must retreat to doing what he does best which is overseeing the supply chain maximizing efficiencies Steve Jobs got it wrong once hiring Sculley he could get it wrong again The smart money makes changes soon the dumb money just lets things roll along until the train approaches the wall its going to crash into This has got little to do with finances today Despite the drop Apple is huge and still throwing off cash But business history is littered with those who dominated today but were marginalized tomorrow Its hard to find an original someone strongwilled enough to lead minions into a future frequently only they can see Which is why most bands and most companies dont make it But they shouldnt Competition is cutthroat were only interested in the best So I dont know who can lead Apple out of the doldrums Probably someone young not invested in the past Then again Steve Jobs had an investment in Apple it was his baby when he returned he had to make it right Kind of like a record company without its founder still in place run by someone beholden to suits as opposed to his gut The history of success is one of great leaps of faith big risks And we havent seen any risk from Apple in a long time Then again youve got to know where to go Thats why movies were so great in the seventies the directors knew where to go The suits came in and normalized the industry and today its a meaningless scrapheap that generates cash but has the cultural significance of a trash bag it does its job it throws out the garbage and then you forget about it Sure detractors love to deride the leader Which just illustrates how hard it is to stay on top But Zuck buys WhatsApp knowing that messaging is king having a vision around the world and Apple still keeps iMessage locked behind a wall Its sad but its time to change leadership at Apple now Before Cook gets uptight and makes lame acquisitions like Ballmer purchasing the moribund Nokia most of its value needing to ultimately be written off It happens in music Shawn Fanning led the way Daniel Ek has picked up the flag If you think theyre the enemy you dont know how the future arrives its in the air if it wasnt Shawn it would have been someone else Ek just found a way to make streaming music work and continues to double down on the free tier raising and spending money when everybody twice his age says hes a bozo But those twice his age are already done They want Robert Plant to reform Led Zeppelin but in tech weve already established that theres little demand for the past and the past never grows it only recedes Weve got an endless supply of MBAs people who can install order in a land of chaos But weve got very few visionaries those who deserve the ball like Steph Curry We thought Michael Jordan could never be matched but it turns out someone playing a different game could wow us Who knew the three point shot was so effective Barry L Ritholtz is the founder and chief investment officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management Launched in RWM is a financial I dont plan on going back to legal work I wanted an international career and finance seemed to be where some interesting career opportunities were </div></body></html>
