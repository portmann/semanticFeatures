video ads because its data on its users allow it to target ads This ad targeting success will mimic the success of native ads Facebook NASDAQ FB made plenty of exciting announcements at its recent F conference From messaging businesses to expanding video the conference convinced me to purchase shares now that I have new money to invest The video aspect of Facebooks longterm vision is what I will discuss in this article Once it started focusing on video last year Facebook has become a significant player in the space Online videos are currently the most immersive content we consume Its presence is significantly adding to Facebooks engagement metrics and will increase profitability in the long term Facebook does well with picture sharing because it has billion monthly active users on its main site and over million monthly active users on Instagram Facebook isnt as dominant in video Obviously Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL YouTube is still the number one player in the space YouTube and social apps such as Vine and Snapchat provide competition in the video category This hasnt stopped Facebook from having great initial results in the space This is because it is encouraging its own video on its website The chart below shows the movement toward Facebook videos and away from YouTube videos on Facebook pages Facebook has two advantages over YouTube that marketers love The first advantage is that its ads are more targeted than YouTubes This is because it is able to leverage the information it has on its users to curate ads they are interested in Another thing marketers like about Facebook video is that they have a high level of interactions As you can see from the chart its videos also are more interactive than YouTubes this is because they are more social which makes them more shareable At the F conference Facebook announced the ability to embed its videos on other websites The fact that this capability hadnt existed yet shows how early it is in its growth stage Embedded videos will allow content on Facebook to get higher view counts Before this capability Facebook was a place where you browsed content on other sites Now if you are on other sites you can look at Facebook content The greater the presence Facebook has on the internet the better it is for ad revenues Facebook also discussed native ads at the conference It said that native ads have a times greater CPM than banner ads This is because the content is less distracting No user likes seeing ads popup in their face It makes users immediately want to click away Because Facebook is able to leverage the information it has on its users it makes the ads better targeted Facebook mentioned that a client was able to lower its cost per conversion by because of these features It is also utilizing LiveRail to boost native ad videos capabilities Personally I am working on cofounding a nonprofit organization and we have decided that Facebook will be the main way we target our clients As I have stated Facebook is in its infancy regarding video It may have been easy to predict that the ability to embed videos would be created but I think knowing that this would be announced beforehand would allow you to better analyze the stock I am going to make a prediction for a future announcement that will occur in the next few months It is another obvious capability but I am going to explain why it is very critical to the profitability of the firm I predict Facebook will announce preroll ad capability on its videos This is a feature YouTube has but Facebook can do it better because it will leverage the knowledge it has on its users activities to make sure the ads are targeted specifically to the viewer This will be a gamechanger for Facebook video ads Most announcements Facebook makes are gamechangers because of the vast knowledge it has on its users Facebook currently has an autoplay feature it will be interesting to see how native preroll ads will work with autoplay enabled It may provide optionality on which features to use to give advertisers flexibility According to Retail Touchpoints shoppers that view videos are more likely to purchase than viewers who do not Clearly video drives sales Lets look at how preroll ads do on YouTube to get a better grasp of how it will do on Facebook The principles behind why YouTube is a place where marketers want to spend their dollars are obvious Video is a great way to communicate with customers as viewers retain of a video message compared to of a text message YouTube is the number one place for online video The specifics behind what makes preroll ads work are more complex as marketers still have not mastered it The idea of simply using a TV commercial as an ad in front of an online video is outdated and doesnt work They must create online only ads to leverage the potential sales that YouTube can generate Burger King created innovative preroll YouTube ads that you can view here There are three main types of ads that can run in front of a video There are TrueView instream ads which let users skip after seconds and only charge advertisers when a user watches the full ad or at least seconds of it Instream select ads are the same second ads except the advertiser is charged whenever the ad loads regardless of whether it is watched until completion The final type is standard instream ads which are nonskipable second ads that run in front of the video YouTube uses the information it gains from what the user watches when heshe is logged into the account to target ads Therefore the advertiser knows what type of video the ad will run in front of and can infer the interests of the viewer for adtargeting Facebook will vastly improve the way preroll video ads will be purchased because it knows so much more about its users than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Facebook knows what its users like and can service the most relevant ads to them This is the reason why its native ad platform is successful As further proof that Facebook will put some type of video ads in front of the videos its users post Snapchat recently started putting ads in the middle of its live stories Snapchat definitely has captured the teenage demographic but because the company is so young its video ads are less sophisticated than other online video ads The best video ads on the internet which Snapchat of course lacks are interactive ads Interactive ads are ones that encourage you to click on the ad unit either to watch an additional video or read more about the productservice You can view an example of an interactive preroll ad here The click is what the engagement column represents in the chart below As you can see from the chart interactive ads have higher completion rates and a higher percentage of the ad viewed than standard preroll ads Awareness for interactive ads is compared to for standard ads The reason the clickthough rates are lower on interactive ads is that they encourage you to stay on the ad unit instead of moving to the firms website These interactive ads will soon be featured by Facebook as it builds out its video product offering I have previously written about how Vessel will have higher CPMs because the content will be more consistent than YouTube Facebook has the opportunity to have high CPMs because its ads will be the most curated because Facebook knows its users tastes and habits Facebook can further improve CPMs by building out a partnership platform like YouTube has As I have mentioned Facebooks sheer data on its users gives it an advantage in all of these areas It had a moat in video before even launching the initiative last year That is why the stock is such a great investment It is going to make you watch an ad in front of a video that your friend posted The ad will be of a brand that you like making you actually consider purchasing the item The item will be able to be purchased from Facebook itself It is an ecosystem of services that keeps you on the site for longer which in turn drives more ad sales Facebook has in the past talked about preroll ads with its announcement of a partnership with iRoll In essence you can see a skeleton of what the future initiative will look like by reading this post If you go on Facebook today you can see that there are only ads on the sides of the page when you watch videos Watching a video on Facebook is like using YouTube in Luckily for Facebook it can simply copy what YouTube is doing to catchup and build its platform Once it is caught up it will be able to leverage its knowledge of users to leapfrog YouTubes ad capability If there are better ads on Facebook Facebook may choose to pay content creators This is the basis for why the firm has been in talks with professional content providers such as Vice Vox the New York Times and Buzzfeed To show that Facebook has a vision in the content creation space Mark Zuckerberg explained that Facebook sees spherical video in newsfeed as the next leg of growth in the future It requires high definition cameras to provide this immersive form of content This is in the early stages of growth What really excited me was the prospect of this being live I could definitely see this sort of technology being the way sporting events could be viewed in the future Facebook may not be involved with sports but the prospect of Facebook involved with live video is exciting Twitter has seen initial success with Periscope so Facebook should try and join in on the action I would just like to quickly mention that Facebook announced a new app called Riff It is a social video app where friends work together to create a story similar to the personalized stories that exist on Snapchat I do not have high hopes for it to become the next Snapchat Facebook has a similar stance but some investors may get overly excited by this app I would like to see it gain significant traction among young people before I declare it to be a potential revenue source in the next years In conclusion Facebook will continue to take share in video away from YouTube Facebooks video presence has raised engagement metrics which is great for earnings The addition of interactive preroll advertising before videos will further add to revenues Facebooks ads are the best on the internet because of the power of its ad targeting which comes as a result of the vast amount of data it has on its users This along with other longterm initiatives such as live spherical video can grow Facebooks earnings which is the reason why I am recommending the stock again Source Facebook Video Is Just Getting Started Disclosure The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in FB over the next hours MoreThe author wrote
