(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Braintree is poised for growth because of all the new digital payment solutions appearing. (Uncertainty) </span>Several such solutions are already on the horizon, according to news reports.American Express (NYSE: AXP ) is planning to roll out its answer to Apple Pay, Amex Express Checkout, Re/code reported .A consortium of British banks and retailers is planning to launch an Apple Pay competitor called Zapp in October, Forbes reported .The Merchant Customer Exchange, or MCX, a consortium of companies that includes America's four largest retailers (Wal-Mart, Kroger, Costco and Target) is working on a payment app called Current C. PayPal is well-positioned to take advantage of all these new digital wallets with Payidant , which it acquired in March for $280 million.Payidant licenses a technology that lets retailers take digital wallet payments through their own apps.Payidant is what allows customers at some retailers to use Apple Pay to make payments even though the store's cash registers do not yet accept the app.This means that the growing popularity of Apple Pay will only boost PayPal.Not only will it process Apple Pay payments through Braintree and Payidant but the popularity of Apple Pay will drive the acceptance of other online payment solutions, which Braintree and Payidant will also process.PayPal is poised to grow with or without its strong brand.This makes PayPal much like some of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A ) subsidiaries, such as McLane.It provides the infrastructure that makes other companies work.McLane operates a network of distribution centers and trucks that supplies 45,000 retail locations with everything from chewing gum to beer.Just as Berkshire profits from retail sales without owning the store, PayPal will make money regardless of whose solution you are using.PayPal is also creating an infrastructure to provide international payments.It purchased the online transfer service Xoom Corp (NASDAQ: XOOM ) for $890 million.Xoom allows people in countries like the United States to transfer money directly to people in developing countries like El Salvador online for a small fee.Like some of PayPal's other acquisitions, Xoom has experienced a lot of growth.The transfer company reported a year to year revenue growth rate of 23.6% on March 31, 2015, according to data from yCharts.In contrast, Xoom's two main competitors, Western Union (NYSE: WU ) and MoneyGram International (NASDAQ: MGI ), reported falling rates of revenue growth.Western Union reported a revenue growth rate of -2.21% on March 31, 2015, and MoneyGram reported a rate of -11.8% on the same day.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even economic crises like the one in Greece could create more demand for some of PayPal's solutions. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The Greek government effectively blocked almost all transfers of money outside the country from bank accounts, NBC News reported . (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That action forced PayPal to shut down its digital wallets in the country, but it could drive customers to some of PayPal's other solutions. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The banking restrictions could force Greeks to turn to old-fashioned money transfers to get money from relatives abroad, which could help Xoom. (Uncertainty) </span>After all, Xoom allows you to send money abroad without standing in the line at the grocery store.It has increased interest in Bitcoin in Greece, Reuters reported .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Thanos Marinos, the founder of Greece's only Bitcoin exchange, BTCGreece, told the news service that his customer base grew by 400% in May and June. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Greeks are turning to Bitcoin because they are afraid the Euros in their bank account could be exchanged for worthless drachmas (Greece's defunct currency) if their nation leaves the Eurozone. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Naturally, increased use of Bitcoin could increase the number of transactions PayPal processes. (Uncertainty) </span>Bitcoin is a logical fit with PayPal because at some point, people will need to purchase goods and services with the crypto-currency in the real world.PayPal is not only a strong value investment; it has a very bright future.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you are looking for a technology stock that could be around and growing for a long time, check out PayPal.
