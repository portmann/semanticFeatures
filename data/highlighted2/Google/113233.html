(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub.ETF Hub Despite having appreciated by more than 1100% since mid 2012, analysts remain extremely bullish on Netflix, with price targets as high as $950 (+44%).Being a subscriber-based product, Netflix revenue growth is relatively simple to model.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Bulls on Netflix justify valuation based on growth potential, but the numbers tell a different story. (Uncertainty) </span>Most of the Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) bulls with whom I have spoken justify the currently sky-high valuation by pointing out that - as a market disruptor with seemingly little competition - Netflix has enormous growth potential both domestically and abroad.Thankfully, as a subscription-based product, Netflix's revenue growth is actually quite simple to model - so let's put the proverbial pen to the paper and find out by modeling growth over the next five years.Netflix justifies its $40 billion valuation through growth, and what will the next five years look like?Let's find out.Given that Netflix managed $1.57 billion in revenue last quarter, we can infer that the average subscriber pays $8.99/month.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>(61.93 million total subscribers * 8.99 per month 3 months per quarter = roughly 1.6 billion). (Uncertainty) </span>As previously mentioned, Netflix currently has 41.4 million U.S. subscribers paying, on average, $8.99 per month.Given that the population of the United States is 319 million (Source: United States Census Bureau) and that there are 123 million households in the U.S. (source: Statista.com ), it can be said that around 1 in 7 people in the U.S. currently have a Netflix subscription, or 1 in 3 households.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With 1 in 3 households already having a subscription, it is difficult to argue against potential market saturation, but let's be optimistic here and assume Netflix is capable of growing that figure to 1 in 2. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Assuming the population grows by 5% in that time, this would result in Netflix having 64.6 million U.S. subscribers. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>(Source: The Prosperity Active Yield Fund) Let's also assume Netflix is capable of doing this while also raising the average monthly price by 45% to $12.99. (Uncertainty) </span>This would result in 2020 domestic subscriber-based revenue of $10.07 billion.Estimating ex-U.S. Growth Potential: As previously mentioned, Netflix is currently available in 79 countries, excluding the United States.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Here 's a list of those countries : Using data provided by <b>Google</b> Public Data Explorer , I was able to calculate that the aggregate population of those countries is roughly 965 million . (Google: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Applying the same ratio of total population to number of households as in the United States (2.6 to 1), it can be estimated that the total number of ex-U.S. households which currently have access to Netflix is roughly 371 million. (Uncertainty) </span>Therefore, 1 in 18 (5.5%) of all ex-U.S. households that have access to Netflix currently are subscribers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Let's again be optimistic here and assume that - by 2020 - Netflix is capable of doubling that percentage. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What's more, let's assume this is possible while simultaneously raising the average subscription to $12.99 per month and expanding into large markets like China, Russia and India. (Uncertainty) </span>This expansion would double the potential ex-U.S. subscriber base from 965 million to 1.9 billion by 2020, giving Netflix 82.5 million annual ex-U.S. subscribers.If true, this would result in $12.86 billion in ex-U.S. annual revenue.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Combined Optimistic 2020 Growth Potential: The purpose of this exercise has been to quantify the growth potential that Netflix bulls are so quick to point out whenever questions of valuation are raised. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As such, I have been quite optimistic in my estimates. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>By 2020, I have assumed that Netflix is capable of the following: Despite an already-saturated market, Netflix is somehow capable of increasing the percentage of domestic household subscribers from 33% to 50%. (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix is capable of doubling its potential ex-U.S. subscriber base while also doubling the percentage of families using the product, resulting in a four-fold increase in ex-U.S. subscribers.Netflix is somehow capable of doing this while simultaneously increasing the average subscription cost by 45% to $12.99 from $8.99.Netflix also is somehow capable of doing this despite competition from the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) and HBO (NYSE: TWC ), (NYSE: TWX ), let alone traditional cable providers.Gross margin increases from 31.85% to 32%.Net margin increases from 4.85% to 5%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Should Netflix be able to accomplish such incredible growth, the resulting consolidated FY2020 income statement would look something like this: Valuing Netflix Based on the Next Five Years of Growth: At today's $40 billion valuation, Netflix currently trades 35 times these unquestionably optimistic (and highly unlikely) FY2020 earnings. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even if Netflix were capable of meeting the these goals, investors would still be better off staying on the sidelines, Here's why: It's no surprise that high-growth market-disrupters like NFLX deserve to trade at a premium multiple to the market. (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I would argue that a Price-to-Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) ratio of 2 is optimistic, but justifiable, for NFLX. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Assuming NFLX is capable of meeting the optimistic growth estimates I have lined out, this would result in earnings growth of 27.5% per year ($270 million to $1.15 billion). (Uncertainty) </span>Applying the PEG ratio of 2 resulting in a Forward P/E Multiple of 55 times FY2016 Earnings.This would lead to a valuation of $19 billion, less than half of where the market values Netflix today.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is for this reason that I believe investors should avoid NFLX at its current valuation. (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix the company has a lot going for it at the moment.I have been a subscriber for a number of years, and I don't see myself leaving the service anytime soon.Netflix has an excellent collection of content - both original and borrowed - and it has never been easier to leave a cable provider and switch.That said, I think Netflix the stock has very little to be excited about.At the end of the day, growth is quantifiable - especially for a company like Netflix.So, the next time you see a self-proclaimed "expert in business growth" in Forbes saying that investors should, - Hartung, Adam."Netflix Valuation Is Not a 'House of Cards'" Forbes.Forbes Magazine, 28 Feb. 2015.Web.08 July 2015.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Remember that valuation depends on future cash flows. (Uncertainty) </span>If you're being told to invest because of enormous growth potential, always act like Cuba Gooding, Jr. and start by saying, "Jerry, show me the money!"Otherwise, you're only investing in hype.Source: Tuning In To Netflix: Show Me The Growth Disclosure: I am/we are short BABA.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
