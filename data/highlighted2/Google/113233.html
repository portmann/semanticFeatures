appreciated by more than since mid analysts remain extremely bullish on Netflix with price targets as high as Being a subscriberbased product Netflix revenue growth is relatively simple to model Bulls on Netflix justify valuation based on growth potential but the numbers tell a different story Most of the Netflix NASDAQ NFLX bulls with whom I have spoken justify the currently skyhigh valuation by pointing out that as a market disruptor with seemingly little competition Netflix has enormous growth potential both domestically and abroad Thankfully as a subscriptionbased product Netflixs revenue growth is actually quite simple to model so lets put the proverbial pen to the paper and find out by modeling growth over the next five years Netflix justifies its billion valuation through growth and what will the next five years look like Lets find out Given that Netflix managed billion in revenue last quarter we can infer that the average subscriber pays month million total subscribers per month months per quarter roughly billion As previously mentioned Netflix currently has million US subscribers paying on average per month Given that the population of the United States is million Source United States Census Bureau and that there are million households in the US source Statistacom it can be said that around in people in the US currently have a Netflix subscription or in households With in households already having a subscription it is difficult to argue against potential market saturation but lets be optimistic here and assume Netflix is capable of growing that figure to in Assuming the population grows by in that time this would result in Netflix having million US subscribers Source The Prosperity Active Yield Fund Lets also assume Netflix is capable of doing this while also raising the average monthly price by to This would result in domestic subscriberbased revenue of billion Estimating exUS Growth Potential As previously mentioned Netflix is currently available in countries excluding the United States Heres a list of those countries Using data provided by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Public Data Explorer I was able to calculate that the aggregate population of those countries is roughly million Applying the same ratio of total population to number of households as in the United States to it can be estimated that the total number of exUS households which currently have access to Netflix is roughly million Therefore in of all exUS households that have access to Netflix currently are subscribers Lets again be optimistic here and assume that by Netflix is capable of doubling that percentage Whats more lets assume this is possible while simultaneously raising the average subscription to per month and expanding into large markets like China Russia and India This expansion would double the potential exUS subscriber base from million to billion by giving Netflix million annual exUS subscribers If true this would result in billion in exUS annual revenue Combined Optimistic Growth Potential The purpose of this exercise has been to quantify the growth potential that Netflix bulls are so quick to point out whenever questions of valuation are raised As such I have been quite optimistic in my estimates By I have assumed that Netflix is capable of the following Despite an alreadysaturated market Netflix is somehow capable of increasing the percentage of domestic household subscribers from to Netflix is capable of doubling its potential exUS subscriber base while also doubling the percentage of families using the product resulting in a fourfold increase in exUS subscribers Netflix is somehow capable of doing this while simultaneously increasing the average subscription cost by to from Netflix also is somehow capable of doing this despite competition from the likes of Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Alibaba NYSE BABA and HBO NYSE TWC NYSE TWX let alone traditional cable providers Gross margin increases from to Net margin increases from to Should Netflix be able to accomplish such incredible growth the resulting consolidated FY income statement would look something like this Valuing Netflix Based on the Next Five Years of Growth At todays billion valuation Netflix currently trades times these unquestionably optimistic and highly unlikely FY earnings Even if Netflix were capable of meeting the these goals investors would still be better off staying on the sidelines Heres why Its no surprise that highgrowth marketdisrupters like NFLX deserve to trade at a premium multiple to the market I would argue that a PricetoEarningstoGrowth PEG ratio of is optimistic but justifiable for NFLX Assuming NFLX is capable of meeting the optimistic growth estimates I have lined out this would result in earnings growth of per year million to billion Applying the PEG ratio of resulting in a Forward PE Multiple of times FY Earnings This would lead to a valuation of billion less than half of where the market values Netflix today It is for this reason that I believe investors should avoid NFLX at its current valuation Netflix the company has a lot going for it at the moment I have been a subscriber for a number of years and I dont see myself leaving the service anytime soon Netflix has an excellent collection of content both original and borrowed and it has never been easier to leave a cable provider and switch That said I think Netflix the stock has very little to be excited about At the end of the day growth is quantifiable especially for a company like Netflix So the next time you see a selfproclaimed expert in business growth in Forbes saying that investors should Hartung Adam Netflix Valuation Is Not a House of Cards Forbes Forbes Magazine Feb Web July Remember that valuation depends on future cash flows If youre being told to invest because of enormous growth potential always act like Cuba Gooding Jr and start by saying Jerry show me the money Otherwise youre only
