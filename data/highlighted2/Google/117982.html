(Uncertainty) </span>The decline didn't find a real bottom until the stock went under $20 several months later in August.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Investors and media clucked their tongues, and if CEO Mark Zuckerberg couldn't figure out how to turn this social media phenomena into a money making machine, the company would be in trouble. (Uncertainty) </span>Fast forward a little more than three years ahead, and now the stock is about $90 with the company turning over $3.5 billion in revenue in Q1 2015.The social media empire is stronger, and the company also owns two of the hottest apps currently - WhatsApp and Instagram.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you could choose one word that seems to be driving many of the recent changes in features and services in Facebook, probably the best word would be "video." (Uncertainty) </span>Facebook struggled several years ago to monetize the social media experience of users.They solved the problem, but now monetization is shifting again.Faster, more capable smartphones and rapid internet downloads have made video the chief tool to capture the attention of users and deliver ads.Daily and monthly active users predominantly use mobile devices to access Facebook.In Q1, out of 936 million daily active users (DAU), 798 million of them used mobiles to check their pages and catch up with friends.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The prime real estate of the display screen became much smaller, and ad banners and and pop-ups could easily sour the user experience if used too much. (Uncertainty) </span>Video would be able to solve the size, interest and ad delivery issues altogether.I really like how Facebook wasn't going to do things by halves and dove right into changing so many features and services.The new product pages will create more appealing ecommerce spaces for businesses and the news feed will now be delivering video content on the subjects that users are interested in, based on data analytics and targeted ads.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Investors may see some initial progress when Facebook reports second quarter results on July 29. (Uncertainty) </span>Now, Facebook just needs more original content video.Tons of it.The company has started offering video creators the same ad revenue split that YouTube offers to win them over.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Facebook took in the most ad spending from businesses and marketers in 2014, almost double that of YouTube. (Uncertainty) </span>Ads and ecommerce related revenue are what Facebook must focus on.And it's doing it.In the same vein as the video creators, Facebook is moving on to the next logical step - music videos.Facebook is reportedly talking with some record companies about getting music content directly on to Facebook.Viewers love music and seeing their favorite artists is a definite attention getter.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Independent music creators will want to get their videos in front of as many people as possible. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Music labels need the exposure as well. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company has stated it has no intentions to enter into music streaming, but videos in news feeds and search engines could generate ad income just as well. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It could possibly pull more content and subsequently more ad revenue away from YouTube. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe these latest video initiatives will be the next big source of earnings growth for Facebook. (Uncertainty) </span>Once it works out a steady, consistent framework for the Facebook platform, the company can then turn to monetizing WhatsApp and Instagram as they both approach a billion users each.I will be watching Facebook updates and reports closely over the next several quarters to take a pulse on the ad revenue progress.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If it is positive, the stock could go well up from current prices. (Uncertainty) </span>Congratulations, Facebook, for the market cap record, and here's to the next $250 billion.Source: Facebook Hits $250 Billion In Record Time, Challenges YouTube's Video Dominance Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
