The company is making more changes to its platform with a big focus on videos for content and ad revenue Facebook is chipping away at YouTubes dominance in videos by encouraging video and music creators to upload and publish to Facebook directly Facebook NASDAQ FB surpassed the billion market capitalization mark and did it in record time to boot The previous record owner was none other than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Facebooks biggest competitor for ad revenue and seemingly the indirect target of a number of changes being made to Facebooks social media platform to expand business If you take a trip down memory lane to the May IPO of Facebook youll remember the botched opening and sudden and deep sell off The decline didnt find a real bottom until the stock went under several months later in August Investors and media clucked their tongues and if CEO Mark Zuckerberg couldnt figure out how to turn this social media phenomena into a money making machine the company would be in trouble Fast forward a little more than three years ahead and now the stock is about with the company turning over billion in revenue in Q The social media empire is stronger and the company also owns two of the hottest apps currently WhatsApp and Instagram If you could choose one word that seems to be driving many of the recent changes in features and services in Facebook probably the best word would be video Facebook struggled several years ago to monetize the social media experience of users They solved the problem but now monetization is shifting again Faster more capable smartphones and rapid internet downloads have made video the chief tool to capture the attention of users and deliver ads Daily and monthly active users predominantly use mobile devices to access Facebook In Q out of million daily active users DAU million of them used mobiles to check their pages and catch up with friends The prime real estate of the display screen became much smaller and ad banners and and popups could easily sour the user experience if used too much Video would be able to solve the size interest and ad delivery issues altogether I really like how Facebook wasnt going to do things by halves and dove right into changing so many features and services The new product pages will create more appealing ecommerce spaces for businesses and the news feed will now be delivering video content on the subjects that users are interested in based on data analytics and targeted ads Investors may see some initial progress when Facebook reports second quarter results on July Now Facebook just needs more original content video Tons of it The company has started offering video creators the same ad revenue split that YouTube offers to win them over Facebook took in the most ad spending from businesses and marketers in almost double that of YouTube Ads and ecommerce related revenue are what Facebook must focus on And its doing it In the same vein as the video creators Facebook is moving on to the next logical step music videos Facebook is reportedly talking with some record companies about getting music content directly on to Facebook Viewers love music and seeing their favorite artists is a definite attention getter Independent music creators will want to get their videos in front of as many people as possible Music labels need the exposure as well The company has stated it has no intentions to enter into music streaming but videos in news feeds and search engines could generate ad income just as well It could possibly pull more content and subsequently more ad revenue away from YouTube I believe these latest video initiatives will be the next big source of earnings growth for Facebook Once it works out a steady consistent framework for the Facebook platform the company can then turn to monetizing WhatsApp and Instagram as they both approach a billion users each I will be watching Facebook updates and reports closely over the next several quarters to take a pulse on the ad revenue progress If it is positive the stock could go well up from current prices Congratulations Facebook for the
