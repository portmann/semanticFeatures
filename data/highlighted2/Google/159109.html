transactions by Thats a big opportunity for AAPL but AAPL still wont earn meaningful revenue or profits The only way that Apple Pay can be a real catalyst for AAPL is if it becomes a processor or bank Last week IDC published a new report where it predicted mobile payments to top trillion by a whopping increase from the billion expected this year This represents the biggest dollar volume predicted in the mobile payments era And what this illustrates is that mobile payments are growing fast throughout the world not just areas like North America Notably IDC expects that the AsiaPacific will account for most of this growth and dollar value which bodes well for Apple NASDAQ AAPL given its share of Chinas mobile market with iOS up from last year It would seem that mobile payments could be Apples next big thing a highmargin business to drive its next wave of growth Unfortunately its not yet and Apple has no one to blame but itself Thankfully Apple has the opportunity for a lucrative future in payments Apple has a goal for million retail locations to support Apple Pay by years end And after adding with PayAnywhere in the US its quickly approaching its mark This after surpassing one million locations a few months back Still Apple has prioritized the US and other regions where Near Field Communications NFC is prevalent for Apple Pay partners However with the AsiaPacific adopting such technology Apples expansion in those regions with Pay is inevitable Therefore Apple has and is building a network thats poised to capture a significant part of that trillion market The problem is that Apple earns next to nothing for Apple Pay transactions literally For every spent via Apple Pay its partners like Visa NYSE V and MasterCard NYSE MA allow Apple to earn just In other words if Apple were to capture billion of the trillion mobile payments business it would earn only million in revenue For a company thats expected to create billion in revenue this year million in revenue from Apple Pay is pennies Further even if Apple Pay revenue translates to million in profit it would still be pennies to Apples near billion in free cash flow over the last months With that said its a shame that given the growth and eventual size of the mobile payment industry that Apple couldnt find a way to generate higher revenues and profits Perhaps Apple did not realize the opportunity that Apple Pay would become as eMarketer estimated late last year that transaction value in the US would not surpass billion until Now it appears the industry will hit that mark one maybe two years ahead of schedule mostly because of instore mobile payments Therefore Apple needs to find a more lucrative way to monetize Apple Pay This is something that I think is very possible given how fast the industry is expected to grow and how large it will ultimately become Furthermore Apple has proven over time that it doesnt like to be a middle man but rather prefers to own all aspects of an industry in which it operates in In the beginning Apple chose to negotiate a royalty with the likes of MasterCard and Visa But what Apple has managed to do since then is build an enormous network that will soon include billion locations where Apple Pay is accepted and has also familiarized itself with how the payments business works That could be very valuable information and infrastructure in the years ahead Specifically with well over million iTunes accounts those who have credit card information and a very large payments infrastructure in place it seems like the next logical step is for Apple to become an actual payment processor like Visa and MasterCard The advantages for doing so seem like a no brainer The industry is one that requires very minimal capital expenditures once the payment infrastructure and network is in place Apple already has the latter and the margins are sky high For a company that has over billion in cash theres no price thats too high for that payment infrastructure With Apple already having the existing relationship with card issuing banks via Apple Pay it would seem like a relatively easy transition into payment processing or at least on the mobile front These relationships with the likes of Citibank NYSE C Bank of America NYSE BAC and JPMorgan NYSE JPM among others differ from payment processors like Visa and MasterCard In essence banks issue cards so Apple would need partnerships with those banks in order to make Apple Pay successful as a payment processor In other words Apple Pay users would still be using their own debit and credit cards unless Apple wanted to become a bank But Apple Pay would be processing the actual transaction between buyer and seller rather than Visa or MasterCard Consequently it would also become a direct competitor of Visa and MasterCard two companies that have built a duopoly of sorts because of how hard it would be for a new processor to establish a strong relationship with banks retailers and consumers for that matter However by partnering with Visa and MasterCard in Apple Pays infancy and acting very similarly to a payment processor without the monetary advantages Apple has formed those relationships and is now well positioned to take the next step of becoming the actual processor if it chooses The tradeoff for Apple if it elected to become its own payment processor would be far higher transaction revenue and profits While rates for payment processors remain largely unknown and vary depending on the country most analysts figure around on average During Visas last quarter revenue was billion right around of its trillion payment volume Lastly Visas operating margin sits right around So if Apple were to replicate this performance with a share of the future trillion mobile payments market were talking about billion in revenue and over billion in profit If that were applied to Apples trailing month operating income it would represent a near increase Thats fairly significant and is a change that could add significant shareholder value over time Albeit if Apple did elect to go this route it would be bad for Visa and MasterCard Apple Pay would then be a direct competitor focused exclusively on mobile payments an industry of payment processing that is expected to create the fastest growth over the next five years Because of Apples existing presence with Apple Pay and mobile payments it could capture much of Visa and MasterCards business in mobile payment processing With all that said the big billiondollar question remains whether its likely that Apple will go this route I think so I think Apple has learned a lot about the payments industry over the last year has built an incredible payment ecosystem which is of the challenge of entering payment processing and has relationships with all of the largest banks Finally now is a good time to enter the market as a competitor in a processing sector that Jefferies recently described as a calming regulatory environment Ironically I think that both Visa and MasterCard both feared and expected that Apple would eventually enter the payment processing space After all neither Visa nor MasterCard have negotiated with any other mobile payments platform for a share of fees not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Samsung PayPal NASDAQ PYPL or any other company While per spent is next to nothing it still proves that Visa and MasterCard preferred to be a partner with Apple versus a competitor However neither MasterCard nor Visa may have that choice In closing the biggest issues for Apple to make such a move successful include dealing with security and penetrating China The security issue is obvious due to large public cyber attacks However besides some leaked photos of Kate Upton and Jennifer Lawrence caused by their own weak passwords Apples ecosystem has not yet been breached on a large scale or at least its not publicly known if it has Given the size of its ecosystem thats impressive With regard to China Reuters said back in July that MasterCard and Visa face bigger challenges in China than investors realize These challenges include lower rates and the threat of Alipay as a competitor which also could be a potential Apple partner With Apple receiving just per just about any rate that Apple could earn in China would be an upgrade The bottom line is that all pieces look in place for Apple to make a big move in the payment processing business If so it would appear that Apple Pay would be the companys next big thing a catalyst that reflects its present growth and future opportunity If not and if Apple chooses not to utilize the ecosystem it created and the relationships it has built then I guess investors can just look ahead to this trilliondollar industry and wonder what could have been Given Apples ability to innovate and evolve over the last decade Id be shocked to see Apple miss this opportunity
