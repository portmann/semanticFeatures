class='textDiv'>Yahoo Finally Ready For A Turnaround Under Marissa Mayer Yahoo Inc NASDAQYHOO Seeking Alpha Yahoo announced a new Search partnership with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>at Q earnings This among other partnerships and several other statements made on the Q investor call lead me to believe YHOO might finally have a turnaround strategy that can work I believe the company must initiate several strategic pivots which I detail to give itself a competitive position in Big SocialSearchContent I get that Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO investors might not be too happy with the recent earnings results I get that frustration might be setting in as the stock has been plummeting with consistency over the last twelve months CEO Marissa Mayer appears to be losing control of investor sentiment More importantly Mayer has had enough time to show meaningful results yet hasnt I get it I really do And maybe my view of Yahoo is skewed in that I just recently started to pay close attention to the developments at the company as I was intrigued by the long overdue upgrade to the Yahoo Mail app But from what Ive seen as of late highlighted by the companys announcement of a partnership with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL I like Now that doesnt mean Yahoo isnt overvalued or isnt doomed as many naysayers in the market believe But it does mean that for the first time in a long time backdating my research I think Yahoo has a development road map that can see some real traction can have staying power and is worth talkingwriting about I also think if the company can execute on the current directional pivot it might finally be capable of the turnaround its been chasing the better part of the last decade First its important to understand what Yahoo is trying to become and how it sees itself going forward YHOO rightly believes the future of the Internet and those that monetize the Internet is in providing an applike experience I agree with this Second Yahoo also realizes it doesnt have the capacity to be best of breed in providing the applike Internet experience for users Especially the user experience thats going to be required for a name with some legacy connotations to be given a second chance Maybe it will in the future actually Yahoo has made clear it aspires to be able to do this as a standalone entity but it doesnt right now Put simply Yahoo isnt the sexiest search engine to use It isnt the sexiest email provider It isnt the sexiest news content aggregator and so on Theres a reason the companys key metrics and parts of the financials looked like garbage at recent reporting Let us Yahoo faithful not deny what is true Because it just is its the truth In understanding that YHOO has chosen not to deny the truth but to address it It has chosen to officially and unofficially partner its problems away What do I mean by this Take Search for example Yahoo has now partnered with both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT to improve its search experience Instead of trying to compete straight up a fools endeavor at this point Yahoo took a page out of the newtechstartupwedonthavetobeeverythingtoallpeople Microsoft playbook and just integrated partners into its model Because the existing infrastructure is already in place these types of moves are not only economical from an offensive standpoint read user acquisition but also they make sense from a defensive standpoint as well read retaining users Another example is Mail Yahoo finally decided to do what everybody else in the space was doing and ripped off a bestofbreed user interface Yahoo essentially ripped off Apples NASDAQ AAPL user interface for mail and finally allowed multimail provider access via its app Both as Ive detailed in longform coverage in a prior article should do well for user acquisition and user retention I hope we see much much more of the above What I also think Yahoo realizes is that where its competitive advantage lies and frankly where I think its market positioning lies is in being the Dashboard for the Internet If Im right this is going to be huge for the midterm story and likely for the longterm viability of the company As is Yahoo is a cluttered mess both for desktop and mobile The user experience isnt terrible but it isnt great I mean really log on to the homepage and tell me you arent overwhelmed But this overwhelming content and portal providing isnt a bad thing per se just how its currently being deployed Mayer made comment of this actually several comments of this on the Q investor call we are also experiencing continued revenue headwinds in our core business especially in the legacy portions we see a unique moment and opportunity for Yahoo as we move into to narrow our strategy and focus on fewer products with higher quality to achieve better growth and better resultswe will share the details of this plan in which we aim to delineate our focus improve our execution and define our relevance to users at our next earnings release if not before users are expecting an applike experience And so were constantly looking at search both in terms of how it behaves in the browser as well as opportunities inapp as we look towards a postspin we think theres a unique opportunity to reset and realign against the most impactful areas of focus This will require us to simplify our structure improve expense discipline and prioritize our investments to improve growth and profitability we continue to pride ourselves on being the indispensable guide to digital information across search communications and digital content Yahoos homepage aggregation and content portal providing in such size is fairly unique Even more important some of the homepage verticals are hugely popular portals A few that Ill call out are Finance Fantasy Weather and the general News feed Both of these the uniqueness of the home page in content aggregation and high visibilityhigh traffic verticals are hugely important to Yahoos turnaround strategy I believe Yahoo needs to initiate several strategic initiatives to give itself a permanent chance at key metric growth as well as a more sound longterm financial footing Shift into being much more silo based Yahoo like Twitter NYSE TWTR should silo key portals as it does already with many verticals and as Twitter has done with Moments and build out unique apponly features for each silo This would allow it to keep its verticals focused and to develop a base of vertical powerusers This is different than the status quo in that currently Yahoos vertical apps are underwhelming and unimpressive Outside of being mobile theyre collectively not differentiated from the desktop experience This is anecdotal but I also believe they appear unsophisticated and arent aesthetic in general There are definitely user interface optimizations that can be made Yahoo Mail set a nice table for the followon apps Yahoo has an incredible ecosystem it just needs to make it more efficient and utilize it better Focus on being appinfrastructure led YHOO should restructure its entire frontend not inclusive of programmatic ad functions basic infrastructure functions etc to be appfocused If there is an expense that isnt tethered to the reshaping of the company to be appled it should be cut The company has done an excellent job trimming expenses but it should go skeletal into the next turnaround launch the current one Get skinny and get skinny fast Yahoo This will provide some margin for error Tear down and rebuild the desktop homepage to be dashboardlike Yahoo should reshape its desktop home page to be dashboardlike with open architecture I know this is possible because other huge enterprises across other tech niches allow this to be done with realtime data feeds None at least that Im aware of on the scale of Yahoo but none are the scale that Yahoo is I think this could alter the course of the company I really do If Yahoo allows its desktop homepage to be the Dashboard of the Internet as Ive alluded to above I think that its traffic and monetization go through the roof I could realistically see Yahoo being a starting point a home page for a huge base of users that want one look access to a customized information experience and curated content portal aggregator With maturation Yahoo could even curate in other ancillary data not incumbent to the current experience Tweets would be one example Ive also seen this done at smaller tech service providers This is totally realistic and totally a potential teardown that I think Yahoo should consider I think it will If Yahoo continues down the path of becoming more applike in experience and continues to build out its partner ecosystem I think the company makes a serious turn for the better finally YHOO was adamant on the investor call that it realizes the importance of predictably growing EBITDA I would hope so and in growing EBITDA at peer comparable levels Management was also clear that it understands that the growing pains in the interim of implementing the forwardlooking strategy would require clear expression of the growth strategy and consistent milestone hitting I agree When investors see the operations line and the bottom line getting blown up they want to see progress being made from the nonfinancials Yahoo needs to find a way to spark its key metric growth users time on platform apps per user CTR etc and a way to drop more of its saving grace from the top line to the bottom line The fact that management had to make it clear that it understands this is important is indicative of just how real the need is I think Mayer is finally on to a strategy that will work and still be relevant by the time its fully implemented I also think Yahoo finally figured out how it fits into Big SocialSearchContent in that it should aspire to be the Dashboard of the Internet rather than competing straight up with better breeds Well have to see if Yahoo can execute on what I think is the first credible strategy of the Mayer era With not much else being certain at this point stay
