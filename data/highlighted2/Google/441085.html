class='textDiv'>Facebook Is Turning Into AOL Facebook NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha AOLs dramatic fall was driven by its focus on its needs rather than the user experience Facebooks profoundly userunfriendly moves such as unbundling Messenger from Facebook shows it no longer cares what its users think This egotistical position is unjustified there are plenty of other platforms waiting if Facebook wants to fire its customers The new move to create celebrity videos on Facebook follows in Googles error with original content thats not why people are on YouTube or Facebook Facebook is essentially telling its users that their content isnt good enough anymore People are getting the message Investors should take heed Have we hit Peak Facebook as fellow SA contributor Dana Blankenhorn argues Im not sure were at the exact peak yet but the signs are becoming clear that the top is coming soon Plenty has been said about Facebooks valuation I wont rehash those wellknown arguments The topic for discussion today is Facebooks troubling evolution into a publishercontent firm that forces its ambitions onto users against their wishes For whatever reason tech companies seem prone to take on media ambitions Despite obvious shortcomings it keeps happening Engineers dont have the social skills that New York media world executives do nor do algorithms work well in the cozy networkingdriven creative industries world This brings us to Facebook NASDAQ FB which is for whatever reason punting on its proven business model in an effort to become an allencompassing professional media platform In other words it wants to be AOL again circa For investors expect similar results AOL rose to become one of the kings of the first internet boom It had complete dominion over its territory which encompassed the dialup internet world While its CDs that it sent to everyone with AOL software are now the butt of jokes it was a very effective approach back in the day The company had offthecharts recognition and presence Getting grandma onto AOL was the same rite of passage for grandkids that getting her Facebook account set up today now represents A key part of AOLs strategy was its fortress closed internet creating safe and sanitized versions of the wild untamed internet on the other side of the wall Itd take a book several were written to explain what all went wrong with AOLs strategy To summarize they ignored broadband thinking users would stay loyal to their dialup service since it had more associated bells and whistles They also figured people wouldnt want to move their email addresses true in some cases But beyond that they had a host of ancillary services such as their sometimes disturbing always interesting private chat rooms about a broad range of topics Over time it evolved into what could be reasonably described as the first social network Digital Trends explains But if there is a true precursor to todays social networking sites it was likely spawned under the AOL America Online umbrella In many ways and for many people AOL was the Internet before the Internet and its membercreated communities complete with searchable Member Profiles in which users would list pertinent details about themselves were arguably the services most fascinating forwardthinking feature As the threat from the real internet continued to rise AOL increasingly moved into content It contracted more and more journalists and celebrities to create exclusive content to make AOL stand out What they failed to realize was that this sort of content is available anywhere on the internet people werent loyal to AOL because it had better generic media content they were there for the human connection AOL tripled down on this approach with the Time Warner merger widely considered the worst merger of all time The rest is history Facebook hasnt learned the lesson from AOLs fall Facebook rose to prominence on a similar strength to AOL its intensely human connection Yes Facebook had a bit of a firstmover advantage Aside from Myspace which looked horrible and became overly distracted with the music industry Facebook really had the field to itself However competition quickly arose from the zillions of metoo social networks that arose and some of them for a time became quite prominent AOL subsequently paid million in for the US then social network Bebo in another spectacularly bad deal Facebook with its clean interface excellent developer API and continued focus on its core mission connecting friends soared above the competition However much of Facebooks model has been built on building its own private web just as AOL did They dont want you to leave their castle things like Facebook events causes places messages etc are all done elsewhere on the web and usually with better functionality Why did users put up with doing so much of their business inside Facebooks walled castle rather than out on the open web Simple They got to see what their friends were doing and enjoyed the instant feedback and affirmation that it provided Facebooks ongoing pivot away from its old core mission doing things with friends toward professional paidfor content will destroy the sites ethos and drive users back out into the open internet More on that in a second More generally the companys naked ambitions toward power and growth are getting through to users Facebook doesnt even pretend to like us anymore its bluntly wielding its force to change user behavior The ongoing move to displace messages off of Facebook and into Facebook Messenger is one such example Take this discussion of the move The real reason that Facebook is pushing chat into its Messenger is to create another platform or silo from which Facebook can access you as a user This might seem an odd decision on the surface but viewed through the lens of a company that wants to spread its tendrils as far and wide as possible it makes sense Its the same reason Facebook bought WhatsApp On the one hand the dedicated chat app competes directly with Facebook Messenger and potentially the lowlevel Facebook social network experience However it also targets users who are not interested in Facebook At this point Facebooks decisions are about creating more silos with which to access its users How charming Thats great for them if it works though competing with its own WhatsApp is still odd business strategy regardless But this move to unbundle Messenger from Facebook is horrendous for the user experience Now Facebook wants us to have two dedicated messenger apps both owned by them in addition to email texts and whatever else we may use Messaging has network effects forcing people to subdivide their attention like this is profoundly userunfriendly and is generating major backlash As for the supposed upside that it targets people not interested in Facebook who is going to sign up for Facebook messenger in after ignoring the company for the past decade The rationale is on its face absurd Facebooks Move To Become A Media Company A Disaster In Waiting Web tech companies seem to always want to become media companies its a recurring blunder AOL famously popularized the trend by merging with Time Warner The content integration with AOL led to fewer synergies than anticipated lets just say More recently Amazon NASDAQ AMZN for whatever reason decided it should set up its own publishing imprint This had the natural effect of irritating the rest of the publishing industry to no end which was terrible for their overall business of selling media produced by their nowenraged partners And the publishing arm itself hasnt accomplished much notable See this scathing report The highprofile publisher brought in to run the unit was canned after it failed to produce bestsellers Turns out publishing books is a different game than using algorithms to turn readers onto already published and marketable books In an example especially instructive to Facebook <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG spent million on its YouTube Original Channels in an initiative that was soon forgotten <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>soon removed all references to it from its site The idea was to invite celebrities athletes and other such leading lights to create TVlike content for YouTube One participant described the fiasco that resulted as follows We are extremely grateful to be a part of this program It was a great thing for usbut it might have been a bit of a dopey idea There were a lot of recipients of this money and many of them were major media companies trying their hand at online video that received some fat checks up to M a piece to launch TVlike channels What we all found out is that no matter how hard you push them and how much money you spend on them YouTube doesnt work like TVand funding it that way is daft Of the channels that YouTube funded as part of this initiative my educated guess is that exactly one earned back its advance out of fail rate on this dopey idea less than succeeded Thats not so hot Turns out people werent using YouTube as if it were a TV substitute With its reincarnation of Original Channels YouTube appears to have learned its lesson its only dishing out money to already prominent YouTube creators rather than raining big money on random media personalities with no platform presence Which brings us full circle back to Facebook and their asinine latest announcement Facebook will be showering money on a bunch of celebrities and media companies to make videos for Facebook According to reports this is supposedly necessary to keep users engaged But heres the thing people have been using Facebook for a decade now to connect with people they know Who signed up with Facebook because they wanted to see what JayZ or Brad Pitt is doing at the moment in a live video I didnt my parents didnt my grandma didnt Which generational part of their user base do they think theyre targeting Theres no shortage of chances to see celebrities on the internet What makes Facebook think their users want that in their streams instead of the relatable personal content theyve gotten for years Facebook already had a challenge managing the line mixing ads and impersonal content such as news and trending stuff into the interesting personal stuff that drew us there in the first place This article summary I saw recently should scare any Facebook stockholder to the bones Facebook wants to get rid of text content and replace it with videos Note the second bullet point Facebook doesnt notice the pernicious effects of this trend on its website however theyre still ready to destroy their own platform due to this supposed threat Cue echoes of Nokias foolish CEO Stephan Elop who set fire to his own company with the infamous burning platform memo In place of the personal text and image content that site users have enjoyed for years now the plan is for videos Because grandma is really eager to get into virtual reality I guess Sprinkle in a mix of failing Facebook Instant Articles from impersonal clickbait sites such as Buzzfeed and youve completely replaced the human connection that built Facebook with generic corporate rubbish Heres the dirty secret with this allvideo push Amateurs cant compete with professional videomakers The barriers to entry are too great This wasnt the case with text Even a poorly written entry describing an important life event is emotionally compelling coming from someone close to you a poorly made video by contrast is closed within a few seconds regardless of the author Only big media producers will win in the new Facebook world and judging by the finances of Gawker and other such clickbait sites this isnt a model Facebook investors should yearn for If Facebook doesnt deviate from this flawed course theyll end up with a platform full of professional but uninteresting content that doesnt motivate people to come back Already the warning signs are here Users are sharing less much less Teenagers are already going to newer more exciting and userfriendly alternatives such as Snapchat Private CHAT Its clear from how Facebook is remaking the site that they dont value mere text from us noncelebrities anymore And users are responding Give it two or three years and people will reject Facebooks professional videos and biased curated news and return to the open internet What happened to Myspace once they got fixated on music and stopped tending to the userside of the website Facebook meet AOL Youll make great sidebyside case studies for future MBA students on how to lose your friends and trivialize people Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no
