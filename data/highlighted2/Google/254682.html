However the company posted a average transaction price increase The aluminumbodied F is seeing positive customer reception and the company announced plans to make a significant capital investment to upgrade a pickup truck plant As the US economy stays strong Ford is in an ideal position to take advantage of the booming US automotive market Ford NYSE F announced November US vehicle sales of K up from the same month in This small incremental increase came in below expectations from analysts who were expecting an increase of Despite missing expectations again Ford utilized strong FSeries and Van demand to post the best November truck sales since Despite seeing a decrease in demand for passenger cars the Ford FSeries Ford Transit Ford Edge Lincoln MKZ and Ford Explorer posted gains of and respectively Despite missing the analysts expectations in November there are two important factors from the results that have me feeling optimistic about the reporting First overall sales are up or million vehicles yeartodate in when compared to and secondly the average transaction price is up yearoveryear to This average transaction price is nearly higher than the US industry average compared to General Motors average price up only when compared to a year ago Fords less than growth came in below the industry average of gain from last November Competitors such as General Motors NYSE GM up Toyota NYSE TM up Fiat Chrysler NYSE FCAU up Hyundai up and Nissan up beat Fords increase while others such as Honda NYSE HMC fell and VW plummeted nearly saw larger decreases in the month The auto market reached million vehicles through November which should give them a chance to challenge the million sales record achieved in Barring a period of really bad weather or another unexpected event many analysts are anticipating consistently high demand in December Fords impressive yeartodate results are due to the strong second half I have been expecting as a result of the new aluminumbodied F pickup reaching optimal inventory levels It has become clear that as the US economy is strengthening Ford is in a great position to take advantage of the economy dependent auto market The key to the companys turnaround has been the remodeling of the Ford F The Ford F which underwent a drastic model change to an aluminum body starting with this years model has seen tight inventory levels so far as the company has worked to configure their manufacturing plants Because of the inventory constraints surrounding the new F model the company did not utilize heavy incentives to sell older models like competitors in the first half of However the company has reached full production and saw a increase in FSeries retail sales which pushed total Fseries sales to their highest monthly level in eight years The FSeries pickup is the most popular vehicle in the US and is gaining popularity with lower oil prices Another key indicator of the new models public reception management announced the company would spend billion to upgrade the pickup truck plant in Kentucky Despite a sluggish November down the Mustang still supports a yeartodate increase as it builds its case for comeback car of the year in This is a title the company has not held since before the Chevrolet Camaro was introduced Over Mustangs sold yeartodate in compared to only yeartodate in I believe this is the resurgence of the Mustang and should provide longterm growth for the company in the reclaimed muscle car segment With these results its clear the turnaround gained traction in August and the company has been consistently hitting on all cylinders in the US ever since However there are certainly contingencies that could derail the companys momentum These include the overall health of the US economy the upcoming interest rate hike labor negotiations with the UAW and emergence of new competitors in the auto industry If there was an event or condition that forced the US economy back into slowing growth territory or a global recession it would definitely have a major impact on Ford Furthermore with an interest rate hike expected in the near future it will likely force the automotive market to reach its limit However Im convinced Ford will be able to gain market share even as the total market contracts Additionally labor negotiations with UAW are key to Fords bottom line as it employs more than US UAW hourly employees Its important that management keeps these costs under control and does not let costs get out of control Finally with new companies working to produce technology infused vehicles such as Tesla NASDAQ TSLA <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Apple NASDAQ AAPL it is important that Ford stays ahead of this curve and doesnt fall behind when it comes to technology use in the vehicle Management should not be looking at the industry as theirs to lose but they should rather be seeing it as an opportunity to lead the way It was no secret that Ford was losing ground to competitors due to the inventory restrictions as most consumers purchase a vehicle when needed instead of waiting for the newest model Because of this and other factors the Ford resurgence is not guaranteed However its encouraging to see Ford posting numbers it has not posted since the early s This shows me as an investor that the new Fs results are positive and the highend models are selling well which is creating a lot of optimism around the new model going forward Despite the sluggish vehicle sales the company continued to increase the average transaction price which shows the company is not utilizing heavy incentives to make sales Given this longterm optimism with Ford Im extremely encouraged by the US sales results the past few months I continue to be excited about the companys future as the new aluminum bodied F is seeing quick turnaround times the recent shift in consumer sentiment to higher profit margin vehicles and the strong sales of the Mustang With consumers purchasing more expensive vehicles it will allow Ford to report stronger top line and bottom line growth in the end of I remain bullish on the US automobile industry and believe Ford has a strong product mix to take advantage of the growing market I will continue to enjoy the above dividend yield as the company prepares to be successful in the long term
