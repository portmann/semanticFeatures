They don't mind the companies spending on future growth, they just want it done in a disciplined manner and not just throwing stuff at the wall to see if it will stick.The point is Jet.com and its investors have to see the patience investors have had with Amazon for a couple of decades, and have concluded, whether the company makes any type of profit for years, they will be rewarded if and when it does an IPO.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If not, it's almost certain the only other purpose behind the extraordinary funding is a big player would acquire it. (Uncertainty) </span>That's the obvious two end plays to me.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As for how that has an impact on Amazon Prime, if Jet is able to get the type of backing it appears it will get, it will operate with huge losses for at least five years, and possibly more. (Uncertainty) </span>That means it will hold the prices at 10% to 15% below what Amazon charges.It will do that no matter what type of economy it operates in.If it takes longer for a recession to come, that would be a huge obstacle to the future of Jet, if it starts running out of money.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If not, Amazon is still likely to grow its Prime membership, while trying a variety of tactics to make Jet look like a low-quality alternative. (Uncertainty) </span>To me a recession is the real concern here.That's where the low-cost retailers thrive, and if they do it right, it will add some value to customers in order to keep them coming back for more.Amazon will need a plan in place to counter that scenario.Source: How Vulnerable Is Amazon To A New Attack On 'Prime' From Jet.com?Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
