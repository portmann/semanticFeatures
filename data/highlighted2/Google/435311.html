can match the lowball pricing of Amazons smart devices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Home and the future Apple Smart Speaker will still get outsold by cheaper Alexapowered products of Amazon Amazon is again implementing a firesale promotion for its tablets Kindle readers Fire TV console and Alexa speakers AMZN sells its hardware below cost to gain more repeat customers for its online marketplace It also does this to hurt the hardwaresoftware sales of its rivals Amazon NASDAQ AMZN had the perfect answer to the potential threat posed by Alphabets GOOG GOOGL upcoming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Home intelligent home assistant Amazons prompt answer was to just sell a off Alexapowered Amazon Tap Bluetooth speakersmart home assistant In fact Apples NASDAQ AAPL alleged upcoming Siri Speaker will also likely get a beatdown from Amazon Echos cheaper variations Deep discounting is Amazons deadly weapon against any threat to its popular brands of smart devices Amazon doesnt prioritize making a profit on hardware All the cheapo Fire tablets Fire TV consolestick products and Alexapowered speakers it sells are mere customer recruitment avenues for Amazons online marketplace I also reiterate that Amazon intentionally sells its own products at below cost to reduce the hardwaresoftware revenue of Alphabet and Apple Please study the screenshot below Amazon is obviously not making any hardware profit on the Fire Tablet or the Fire TVHD antenna bundle The major benefit that a Fire Tablet gives is that increases the total number of potential repeat customers for Amazons online store The other benefit is that it hurts the sales of the iPad and Android tablets Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>also lose potential customers for their app stores since Fire tabletsconsoles are tied exclusively to Amazons own app store Bezos recently revealed that more than employees are now working on Amazon Echo and Alexa That kind of manpower focus strongly says that Amazon wants to protect its big lead on cloud computing and artificial intelligence computing Smart home assistants like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Home and Amazon Tap will have to rely on online neural networks to service millions of homes I previously wrote that Amazon will likely buy more pricey Tesla GPUs from Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA to build deeplearning computer servers for its enterprise customers However I also think Amazon will also allocate many deeplearning computers for its own online Alexa smart voice assistant Yes Alexa now touts more than skills up from just last January However the diverse needs of different people means thirdparty developers will continue to code custom skills for Alexa Processing all the new skills require Amazon to keep building more powerful server farms for Alexa I expect that all Amazonbranded devices will eventually be powered by Alexa The Amazon Fire Tablet can already be called a legit smart home assistant Alexa is now accessible via a web browser Anybody with an Amazon ID can test Alexa through their connected and micequipped devices at Echosimio Everybody should test the browserbased Amazon Echo simulator before they spend for any Amazon Alexapowered products Letting people test drive the leagueleading artificial intelligence power of Alexa is a masterful marketing strategy The cheapest smart home assistant available now is still the Amazon Echo DOT A little test drive is necessary to convince more people to trust these kind of deeplearning home appliances Alexapowered devices like the Amazon Echo are key toward persuading more households to rely only on Amazons ecosystem rather than iTunes or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play Store for their shopping and entertainment needs Losing or on a smart home gadget like the Amazon Tap is a small sacrifice The great Mary Meekers most revealing Internet trend warning is that the Alexapowered Echo is allegedly emerging as a threat to the iPhone Without Siri the iPhone is really just a dumb smartphone Meeker was smart and clairvoyant when she dared to compare the small but rising sales numbers of Amazon Echo against the massive sales of the iPhone Meeker only wanted to point out that the smartphone industry is slowing down while sales of smart home assistants are just starting to take off Amazons stock has had a great oneyear return However we should still remain long on AMZN because it is the company which kick started the era of voicepowered machinelearning appliances <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Apple failed to see the threat of Amazon Echo last year They are now relegated to playing catchup with the real innovator Amazon Bezos and his strong Alexa army will crush the imitators Amazons reign as the de facto king of smart home assistants will remain unchallenged for many years to come Amazon can undercut the prices of its rivals Amazon also has a dedicated development team and proprietary technology to compete with the artificial intelligence platforms of <span style='background-color:
