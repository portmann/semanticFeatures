not impressed However throughout the year weve seen quite a bit of good news from Amazon and to be honest my opinion has changed drastically In fact when it comes to Amazon Im incredibly bullish at this point Today well talk about why Amazons Low Margin Model Is Starting To Make A Lot Of Sense Last year one of my big concerns with AMZN was its low margin business model Essentially Amazon has made a business out of making very little money on sales That simply didnt make much sense to me My biggest problem with this model was Amazons service thats known as Prime For those of you who dont know much about Prime its a very simple service Consumers pay per year to become Amazon Prime members In return for the payment Prime members receive free day shipping on several items purchased at Amazon free streaming television services and more At the price for the service I saw this as an easy way for AMZN to lose money As time passed the vision behind Amazon Prime became apparent Throughout the year we learned quite a bit First and foremost data came out stating that a large portion of Amazon Prime members spend more than per year on the online retailers platform Also Amazon Prime creates a rotating door Users sign up to get free shipping on Prime products As a result more manufacturers want to become Prime members to take advantage of the advertising that comes along with it Then more consumers sign up to take advantage of more offers and the door rotates With the massive amount of consumers that have signed up for Prime and the massive amount of manufacturers that are now selling Prime products its easy to see how this plan has become profitable As the cloud computing industry becomes a larger and larger industry more and more companies are getting involved However few have made as big of a splash as Amazon Amazons cloud computing service Amazon Web Services grew incredibly fast The company grew to be a billion company before any time at all Now speaking with friends in the tech industry Im hearing more and more people saying Im going to Amazon Web Services The company has created a platform that has taken a leadership role in the industry and that isnt likely to change Amazon is one of the largest online retailers in the United States However their business doesnt stop at the US border In fact they are incredibly popular outside of the US and that popularity is only growing Recent data surfaced showing that the company is doing incredibly well in India as well In the month of October Amazon brought in million visitors in India making it the most popular ecommerce website in the region for the month and proving growth in the region of The bottom line here is the fact that Amazon has had an incredible year throughout and is likely to see strong growth throughout The company has proven throughout the year that their low margin system is working Beyond that were seeing exponential growth abroad and incredible movement in the cloud computing industry With that said Im expecting to see great activity out of the stock moving forward Buy AMZN Stock from Modest Money Recommended Brokers Get in free trade commissions plus
