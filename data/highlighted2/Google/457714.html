administrator what is this thing g verizon att spectrum fcc mobile data explainers flying cow terragraph Wireless companies like to throw around a lot of swankysounding terms to get you interested in their goods The new hotness on everyones lips is G which does not in fact exist yet But it will and the FCC today is going to vote on a proposal that will have a lot to do with getting it off the ground So heres everything you need to know about the future of your phone What is a G and why are there five of them The G in your phone speed G G G and so on actually stands for generation Weve basically been through four major iterative developments in mobile communications tech so far The first generation of wireless tech let you make cell phone calls G introduced basic data services including text and picture messages G was the first tech generation that made the mobile internet truly possible its what we had when the iPhone launched and made smartphones a thing that everyone got And G using LTE tech in the US is our current highspeed mobile broadband environment But of course technology goes ever onwards and upwards and the fourth generation of wireless connectivity will eventually hit its limits So G is up next From the consumer perspective G does basically the same things as G just a lot A LOT faster and better The network will also be able to accommodate more devices which is handy since the whole internet of things era is projected to bring literally billions of those devices online in the next decade Your current phone probably pulls peak speeds of around Mbps if youre really lucky The average connection speed you get is more like Mbps depending where you are and what network youre on An early test of Verizons proposed G technology hit speeds of Gbps or about Mbps In theory the G network would top out at about Gbps Mbps or about ten times faster than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Fiber and other gigabit land networks And that faster applies in two ways one is your data speed and the other is something called latency Thats the speed at which a packet of data travels between devices and G is supposed to drop that time from about milliseconds to about one Yes one Right You can see why all the companies want in on this When can I get G on my phone Can I have it now Please Verizon said late in that it planned to run some G tests in and demonstrated a proofofconcept test in February ATT also announced G tests to take place this year in Texas Both companies have hinted at very limited commercial deployment of the tech in maybe but havent said anything more specific Of course this is hardly an Americanonly effort G tests are also underway in China There mobile company Huawei s big test clocked in with an average speed of Gbps and peaking at Gbps results similar to Verizon If youre planning to go to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang South Korea you may be able to get a taste of the tech Korean wireless carrier KT is planning to show off their G network tech at that event and of course phone maker Samsung will be there to show off too How does it actually work Whats taking so long Previous technology generations have been defined by sets of standards that the wireless industry worldwide more or less agrees on But there isnt yet any agreement about the particular technical specifications of G Globally its still a work in progress GPP a global consortium that handles these things announced in that they hoped for a fully defined consensus by the end of The final consensus not only has to figure out what a new network and new protocols should look like it also has to establish for example how to make sure the network stays backwards compatible with your G phone Wireless phones have to transmit and receive Thats it Though you can use a phone offline as a pocket computer everything it does with connectivity from voice to video is the act of sending and receiving a signal in the air How they do that is all down to the EM spectrum which as weve explained before is what lies behind all wireless technology Its physics you can send a signal from point A and receive it at point B if its using the same frequency on both ends Thats how radio TV mobile phones and WiFi among other things all work The FCC regulates and assigns segments of the spectrum to different industries and uses Some segments are reserved for broadcast television some for aviation some for amateur ham radio use and so on Having all the industries and devices run through a specific clearinghouse the FCC minimizes interference and lets different industrie devices and technologies coexist The FCC can both gather and allocate stretches of the spectrum in spectrum auctions which are exactly what they sound like Companies sell their rights or the FCC sells rights to companies depending on the auction and what its for Since you cant make new EM spectrum the laws of the universe are what they are you can only get extra by buying a share from somewhere else or from developing technology that can access bands that were previously offlimits If youre really interested in the nitty gritty you can look at some countylevel maps of which mobile carrier has access to what spectrum where The FCC currently has spectrum allocated in four AWS Advanced Wireless Services bands for wireless carriers to use as well as a couple of other stretches of spectrum What FCC chairman Tom Wheeler is now proposing and the FCC is about to vote on is a plan to allocate a fat wad of spectrum to developing G technologies But in addition to some chunks of spectrum in the low and midbands Wheeler is also proposing to set aside highfrequency spectrum previously unused for anything much for G whatever form that may finally take There are definite technological obstacles to getting decent use out of the highfrequency spectrum but industry is now at the point where it seems we can work around them Or as Wheeler put it in remarks PDF in June G will use much higherfrequency bands than previously thought viable There are definite advantages to the set of airwaves Wheeler is proposing to let industry play with its available its plentiful and data can go fast through it But there are also distinct disadvantages The millimeterwave signals travel in straight narrow lines and they dont spread as far as signals on other frequencies Also the signals have trouble penetrating physical obstacles like buildings You can see why this would present challenges in an actual environment particularly an urban one If a signal can only travel in lineofsight from point to point it takes a drastic rethinking of what the idea of a cell network looks like in order to keep those signals moving A whole bunch of different ideas for how to combat that are floating around FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel has suggested PDF the wireless equivalent of LEED certification for buildings that have G support built in to them from the start which would help with new construction Facebook yes that Facebook is also already well underway with a tech to make G viable their Terragraph system which they just announced a few months ago Terragraph is meant specifically to work as a system of streetlevel nodes that would bounce highfrequency signals around things like buildings and people explicitly what G networks need And then theres even more dynamic stuff like ATTs flying COW drones Though those are just now in early testing for LTE networks its possible that later versions of that or similar technology would also help keep both urban and rural G networks connected In addition to all that you cant make data go super fast out of a cell tower if the backbone infrastructure the tower is connected to doesnt work worth a damn Gigabit wireless service requires backhaul the links in the middle that consumers dont see that can support it in order to work Thats also where the FCCs proposed changes to business data services come in improving connections and regulations about connections in the first and middle mile is part of making the last mile the part that connects to a consumer actually work So if this will be ten times faster than my home internet connection why am I paying for a home connection too Cable companies like Comcast have been claiming for a few years now that wireless broadband is competitive with their service Right now its not for reasons of both speed and cost But at some point it absolutely is going to be and G deployment whenever it comes may well mark that tipping point ATT and Verizon of course own both wireline and wireless businesses If they lose business from one end only to gain it in the other thats still a net win for their balance sheets But what of the Comcasts and Charters of the world Comcast is planning ahead In an investor call this spring the company confirmed that it plans to bid in the incentive auction to get some juicy wireless spectrum of it own Comcasts CFO also pointed out in that call that the wirebased company has a lot of valuable assets you need to make an allwireless future tick it has the backhaul capacity as well as rightsofway and access rights in municipalities all over the country The same applies to Charter especially since it now owns all of Time Warner Cables and Bright Houses assets Earlier business deals also created agreements between Verizon and both Charter and Comcast that would let the cable companies use Verizons network in order to launch their own wireless brands which they may someday choose to do Meanwhile cable and fiber operators are looking toward nextgeneration tech to significantly speed up their broadband connections without having to run new networks The new DOCSIS standard allows cable companies to use their existing lines to deliver speeds that would compete with G Comcast recently began tests of this speedier service and plans to deploy it in a handful of cities this year Fiber services are right there too theyre looking toward a tech called NGPON to upgrade their existing networks to reach those same Gbps speeds or possibly even higher Verizon has run an experiment on that tech in Massachusetts Results Of First LargeScale G Wireless Test Faster Than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Fiber Verizon Prepping Trials Of G Wireless Could Be Times
