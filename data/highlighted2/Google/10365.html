Following that rationale, Microsoft's international revenue will be negatively affected to a certain extent.Despite an underwhelming earnings outlook from the prior quarter, Microsoft looks a lot more attractive at current levels.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And while many technical analysts would argue that a stock trading below the 200-day MA is a risky gamble, I think there's a reasonable likelihood of a pay-off when operating on a multi-year time frame. (Uncertainty) </span>Source: Microsoft 2014 Annual Report If we look very closely, Microsoft's revenue from the PC operating system is only representative of 19.4% of revenue.So even if licensing revenue were to drop by 5%-10% year-over-year, the impact on sales would be $825 million to $1.68 billion.When taking into consideration Microsoft has many rapid growth businesses in enterprise services, hardware and Office 365 the impact on earnings is likely to be negligible.Furthermore, Microsoft isn't really all that expensive in comparison to the broader market.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Microsoft trades at 17.3 times earnings and pays a 2.89% dividend yield, better than the 10-year U.S. treasury bond, without any significant risk of default, as the company has $85 billion in liquid assets on the balance sheet and $22.65 billion in debt. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That's a pretty good ratio and is probably as safe if not safer to own than some foreign bonds. (Uncertainty) </span>Also, let's not forget that Microsoft has a diversity of businesses, both domestically and internationally, which means it's not that exposed to certain business segments or geographic regions.Currently, the forward S&P 500 price target by Morgan Stanley is based on a 16.9 earnings multiple, Microsoft's forward P/E is 14.79, which is a little less expensive than the forecasted P/E for the S&P 500.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Not only that, Microsoft carries considerably less risk and is trading at a bit of a discount in comparison to its earlier highs. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I have high conviction that the stock is relatively cheap when taking into consideration the risk profile and forward looking growth estimates. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Currently the consensus analyst estimate calls for a 9.10% reduction in EPS year-over-year, but it's entirely possible for Microsoft to beat those expectations as Microsoft isn't that reliant on the consumer PC business for revenue. (Uncertainty) </span>Despite the challenging business environment facing Microsoft, the business is diversified enough to absorb issues pertaining to piracy, falling PC shipments and currency effects.Therefore, investors should look to buy Microsoft opportunistically at these lower levels as there's a high margin of safety to both top and bottom line.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I anticipate a recovery in sales and earnings in FY 2016 as new products stabilization in FX will make for better looking comps and will also improve sentiment, which will drive multiple expansion in the next calendar/fiscal year.
