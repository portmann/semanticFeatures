skeptical advertisers in India with features such as free email support for questions about advertising and advice on increasing sales in a bid to boost revenue from its second biggest market Facebook has million users in India trailing only the million in the United States according to the company and the country is critical for the Menlo Park California social networks global expansion But so far the payoff has been small Facebook earns cents per user in India every quarter compared to the to it makes on each US user according to analysts Facebook does not break out its revenues in India but Neil Shah an analyst at Counterpoint Research a Hong Kongbased technology consulting firm estimates it brings in million a quarter far behind the million he estimates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>earns there per quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>which set up in India in has been in the Indian market six years longer than Facebook and its search ads are more familiar to advertisers there than the display ads Facebook offers The businessboosting features described to Reuters by company executives and Indian business people are aimed at advertisers such as Mohit Khattar managing director at online grocery company Godrej Natures Basket one of the roughly to million small and mediumsized businesses in the country He said he began advertising on Facebook about two months ago as the company ramped up its online presence He found that advertising instore events and sales helped attract customers but would not provide specific figures Since our customers are on Facebook we are on Facebook Its that simple Khattar said Facebook declined to say how many staff members it has in India or how much it has invested since it launched operations there in But the worlds largest social network says it has seen early signs its efforts are working The company unveiled a new type of ad designed specifically for India last year called click to missed call Users click a button on an ad which automatically calls an advertiser The user hangs up to save them the charge for the call and the advertiser calls back with a prerecorded message Garnier Men a leading mens hair care company in India and a unit of beauty products giant LOreal SA saw online sales more than double by using click to missed call according to Facebook and the company But Indian advertisers still overwhelmingly flock to television ads and remain skeptical of the value of advertising on social media analysts and business executives said Advertisers in India are not warmed enough to social media as a concept of marketing said Shah the Counterpoint analyst We really need to help them see how Facebook pages and advertising will help grow their businesses said Andy Hwang Facebook director of small and mediumsized businesses for Asia Pacific For instance the company advises businesses to create interactive Facebook pages and use Facebook Messenger to interact with customers as a way of increasing sales Technology companies have turned to India and other markets in Asia for growth because the region contains twothirds of the worlds population Asia is Facebooks fastestgrowing region with percent yearoveryear growth in monthly active users India alone has billion people second only to China and Facebook increased the number of users there by percent last year On the other hand only million people in India have Internet access Expansion in India is also important because of the China factor Facebook like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Inc and Twitter Inc is shut out of the biggest market of all due to the Communist governments concerns over control of information Other tech companies such as eBay and Yahoo have struggled to crack the Chinese market Getting more Indian users drives success or at least the perception of success said Jaideep Mehta vice president and general manager for International Data Corporation Southeast Asia Facebook said it plans to use its strategy in India for other emerging markets such as Brazil Indonesia and Mexico which are Facebooks third fourth and fifthlargest markets by users That makes success in India even more important for its global expansion For the second quarter of this year percent of Facebooks billion in revenue came from outside the US and Canada In addition to efforts to attract more Indian advertisers Facebook is working to make it easier for users to get on the service More than percent of Facebooks Indian users access it through mobile phones but the Facebook app uses more data than most are able to pay for and Internet connections can be patchy So the social giant developed Facebook Lite which uses less data for India and other emerging markets It has also rolled out its Internetorg initiative in India a program started in August that aims to connect the twothirds of the world without Internet access Many of Indias advertising dollars are in rural and semiurban cities analysts said where users do not have a reliable Internet connection Facebook is also getting help from the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi which uses Facebook to provide updates on the governments workings It is undeniable that a prosocial media government is good for the industry Mehta said Thomson Reuters is the worlds
