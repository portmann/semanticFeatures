class='textDiv'>Amazoncom Something To Monitor Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha There are possible signs of a P marketplace slowdown at Amazoncom This is important because the P marketplace is one of main pillars sustaining Amazoncoms profitability I havent written on Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN for more than one year I was short and covered back then because my models didnt show any more fundamental deterioration Indeed since then Amazoncoms fundamentals and earnings have improved significantly In large part this improvement was driven by AWS Amazon Web Services and for now there doesnt seem much reason to believe that the AWS pillar shows any weakness There is another pillar to Amazoncoms fundamental performance though That pillar is its P ThirdParty marketplace This marketplace is akin to what Alibaba NYSE BABA or eBay NASDAQ EBAY do in the sense that its not Amazoncom itself selling products to its customers Instead the products are listed sold and fulfilled by third parties though up to of P fulfillment is now done by Amazon For these services Amazoncom charges a commission As its easy to see both Alibaba and eBay have no trouble being profitable and indeed having very high margins eBay operating margins exceed Alibabas are near The business of letting third parties use your platform to sell their wares and just collect commissions from them is clearly a very lucrative business Recently Ive started seeing worrying signs for this particular pillar the P marketplace For the longest of times P grew faster than Amazoncom as a whole Such was very nice for Amazoncom for as we saw the P marketplace is likely to have higher margins that Amazoncom as a whole as well However there are now signs that either this growth might be seeing deceleration or the sample leading to that conclusion is itself having problems What are those signs I am speaking about ChannelAdvisorcoms NYSE ECOM regular online samestoresales reports ChannelAdvisor provides services to third parties selling in many different online marketplaces and tracks those customers sales trends It then anonymously aggregates those sales trends into samestore sales for those disparate online marketplaces and reports them on a monthly basis with more detail and periodicity during the Christmas season As such ChannelAdvisors SSS report works as a possible sample of each marketplaces ongoing activity What this ChannelAdvisor report has been showing as of late is some significant deceleration in the samestore sales trend for Amazoncom Indeed as of the June report out late yesterday this deceleration seems to have gone all the way down to yearonyear It might be possible that part of this deceleration is due to ChannelAdvisors own customer mixture However given that ChannelAdvisor serves a large number of customers its unlikely that ChannelAdvisors deceleration isnt also being felt to some extent at the overall Amazoncom P marketplace Since this affects one of Amazoncoms most profitable segments along with AWS this development might thus have significance for Amazoncom as a whole This deceleration took place during the whole of Q so pretty soon well see if this translated to weakness for Amazoncom Amazoncom should report Q earnings on or around July Of course maybe Amazoncoms P marketplace isnt slowing down at all ChannelAdvisor itself says that its reported SSS numbers can deviate significantly from those being experienced by retailers Namely due to Customer variance ChannelAdvisors customers may not be representative of the overall customer mix of any individual channel For example on eBay our customers are skewed toward a larger eBay customer set not the average Category variance ChannelAdvisors customers are overrepresented in some categories electronics sporting goods and auto parts and underrepresented in others collectibles BMVmedia etc On Amazon for example ChannelAdvisor has very few media customers so we have no visibility into that large chunk of Amazons business Crossborder trade variance While ChannelAdvisor does have a fair amount of nondomestic GMV our mix of domestic and international customers is not necessarily equivalent to that of other ecommerce players Software Impact At the end of the day we are a software company Some of our features cause a shortterm bump in sales that may skew results high at the beginning and then lower at the end of a oneyear SSS cycle Channel impact Certain changes at ecommerce channels may cause disproportionate good or harm to our customer base category mix international mix and software While the data shows these changes because we are not a material part of every channel over of that channels business may not have the same impact positive or negative SSS is a metric unique to ChannelAdvisor Amazon eBay <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and other ecommerce businesses do not measure SSS They look at overall growth when they report their financial metrics We believe SSS is important to our customers from a benchmarking standpoint which is why we do it this way it is not intended to be a proxy for the overall performance of any of these ecommerce channels However if this significant deceleration isnt being felt by Amazoncom then its being felt by ChannelAdvisors existing customers and represents underperformance for them Now ChannelAdvisor is supposed to help gain sales not underperform the market its customers sell into by a large margin If ChannelAdvisors customers and certainly Amazoncom represents most of them because Amazoncom is the largest US P marketplace are suffering this much versus the market they are in then this might be a large negative for ChannelAdvisor itself The sudden erosion on ChannelAdvisorreported Amazoncom samestore sales is a worrying datapoint This is so because the P marketplace is one of the large pillars which underpin Amazoncoms newfound profitability Were growth to slow significantly at Amazoncoms marketplace and Amazoncoms earnings growth would likely be slower than expected as well However it might also happen that the problem is not Amazoncoms at all In that case it is ChannelAdvisor investors who have to worry about it If Amazoncom is experiencing no unexpected P slowdown then its just ChannelAdvisors customers experiencing it If this isnt negative for Amazoncom then its very negative for ChannelAdvisor Indeed it might be negative for ChannelAdvisor either way because Amazoncoms P marketplace is the largest in the US and thus certainly touches most of ChannelAdvisors customer base Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses
