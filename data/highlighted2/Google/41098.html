introductory remarks Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us We have a lot of great news to talk about so Ill jump right in Today were reporting our strongest March quarter ever with revenue growth and earnings per share growth year over year Were seeing fantastic results for iPhone with revenue growth of year on year and were seeing a higher rate of switchers than weve experienced in previous iPhone cycles The success of iPhone has been extremely strong in emerging markets where unit sales were up year on year The App Store had its best quarter ever with a record number of customers making purchases driving a new record for revenue and year on year growth We also reached an alltime quarterly record of billion in total services revenue We also continue to defy the trend of declining global PC sales with double digit Mac unit growth in a market that IVC estimates contracted by Were now halfway through fiscal and our year to date results have been simply staggering We sold over million iPhones million iPads and million Macs in the first six months of the year Our revenue has grown by to over billion net income has increased to over billion and EPS has grown by Were making many strategic investments in Apples future in research and development in our supply chain and in our infrastructure and weve made acquisitions in the last six quarters Were in the very fortunate position of generating more cash than we need to run our business and keep making these important investments So today were announcing another significant update to our capital return program expanding its size to billion through March of to reflect our strong confidence in what lies ahead for Apple Luca will go into this in more detail in a moment Were also making great progress in many other areas The Apple ecosystem continues to expand in exciting ways Were seeing great momentum with Apple Pay Discover announced today that its cardmembers in the United States will be able to make contactless payments in participating stores through Apple Pay beginning this fall And last month we said that the number of locations accepting Apple Pay has tripled and we continue to see great progress with merchants Best Buy which has been a longtime strong partner of ours has just announced that its now offering Apple Pay inapp and later this year will offer Apple Pay in all of their US stores And merchants arent the only ones jumping onboard Earlier this month a leading healthcare payment network announced acceptance of Apple Pay for its clients so over major hospitals across the country including Stanford Healthcare and Aspen Valley will accept Apple Pay this year for copays and bill payments at registration and check in Were also incredibly inspired by the momentum were seeing in healthrelated solutions Since we released HealthKit with iOS last September over apps have been developed to transform how people track manage and interact with their health and theyre now available on the App Store Just this past weekend CedarsSinai in Los Angeles turned on the largest HealthKit integration to date giving more than patients the ability to share their health and fitness data seamlessly with their MyCS link app which syncs with their electronic medical record And last month we announced ResearchKit an open source software framework that helps doctors and scientists gather data from medical research participants more efficiently and accurately using iPhone applications The response so far has been simply amazing far exceeding our expectations The first research apps developed using ResearchKit study asthma breast cancer cardiovascular disease diabetes and Parkinsons disease and have enrolled over iPhone users in just the first few weeks of being available on the App Store Over researchers have contacted us expressing interest in performing studies through ResearchKit We think these types of solutions have the potential to revolutionize medical studies in lifechanging ways and were proud that Apple is helping make this possible Last quarter we also announced a major economic investment in Europe where we will spend billion to build data centers in Ireland and Denmark These will be our largest data centers in the world Apple is now responsible for creating over jobs across the European continent Most of them have grown out of the success of the App Store which has generated more than billion for European developers since just We feel great about the economic contribution weve been able to make in Europe The two data centers were building will run on renewable energy from day one This is just part of the work were doing to protect the environment and leave the world better than we found it Today of Apples US operations and of global operations are powered by renewable energy Just before Earth Day we announced our plan to move to renewables in China Were undertaking a groundbreaking partnership with several companies to build a megawatt solar farm in Szechuan Province that will generate far more than the amount of energy used by all of our offices and retail stores in China combined We also announced an innovative new partnership with the Conservation Fund to permanently protect more than acres of working forest in Maine and North Carolina to help offset the impact our packaging has on the worlds supply of sustainable virgin fiber Apple is deeply committed to these initiatives and will continue to make them a priority The June quarter is off to an exciting start with great new products and services Three of them in particular are giving our customers a glimpse of the future and we are very happy with the reception that each of them is receiving First the allnew MacBook began shipping just over two weeks ago and we are very happy with the response were getting from customers The new MacBook is our lightest most compact Mac notebook ever and you really have to see it to believe it It features a stunning inch retina display a new force touch trackpad all day battery life and a revolutionary new keyboard We believe and I think most everyone agrees this is the future of the notebook Second is the new streaming service from HBO which is available on Apple TV and iOS We teamed up with HBO last month to help launch HBO Now a standalone service that lets customers stream the content they love from HBO on the devices they love from Apple all without requiring a subscription to cable HBO now has been incredibly popular with Apple TV users since its debut and it has been one of the top downloaded apps on the US App Store as well And third of course is Apple Watch Its been really great to see the reaction of customers since their watches began arriving on Friday morning All around the world weve seen the excitement on social networks as people start using their Apple Watch The response has been overwhelmingly positive Adding to the surprise and delight of Apple Watch are the more than apps that are already available Our developer community has already seen the potential in this new category and put some of their best thinking into what wearable technology can do We cant wait to see more of the inspiring apps developers dream up for Apple Watch as we head into our Worldwide Developer Conference six weeks from now Id like to thank all of those developers and our hundreds of millions of customers for their loyalty and support Id also like to thank all of the Apple employees around the world for their creativity tireless effort and passion for delivering the very best products in the world Thank you Tim Good afternoon everyone As Tim mentioned we just completed another outstanding quarter Revenue for the March quarter was billion an increase of billion or year over year Growth was driven primarily by the very strong performance of iPhone and the continued strength of the App Store and Mac sales We achieved these terrific results despite growing foreign exchange headwinds Our performance was particularly impressive in our Greater China and rest of Asia Pacific segments In Greater China we established an alltime quarterly record for revenue which grew year over year to billion Gross margin was ahead of our expectations mainly due to stronger than expected iPhone results Operating margin was of revenue and net income was billion a new Q record Diluted earnings per share were a year over year increase and cash flow from operations was billion also a new March quarter record For details by product I will start with iPhone We sold million iPhones in the quarter representing year over year growth and demand for iPhone and plus has remained incredibly strong IPhone sales more than doubled in Korea Singapore Taiwan and Vietnam and they were up or more in several other markets including Canada Mexico Germany and Turkey The strong mix of iPhone and plus combined with the popularity of higher capacity offerings led to iPhone ASPs of an increase of year over year despite the very significant foreign exchange headwinds I already mentioned We increased iPhone channel inventory by million units during the quarter which allowed us to get into the low end of our target range of to weeks of channel inventory Next Id like to talk about the Mac We sold million Macs representing year over year growth which is particularly impressive in the context of IDCs latest estimate of a global PC market contraction The growth was led by portables and spurred by the updates to MacBook Air and MacBook Pro in March We ended the quarter within our to week target range for Mac channel inventory Turning to iPad we sold million compared to million in the year ago quarter iPad sellthrough was million as we reduced channel inventory by about million units coming off the holiday quarter This left us within our to week target range of iPad channel inventory We set a new March quarter record for iPad sales in Japan and an alltime record for iPad sales in China but performance in other markets was more muted during the quarter iPad turns five years old this month and in every year since its introduction it has been the number one tablet in sales in quantity and quality of tablet apps in usage and most importantly in customer satisfaction And based on the latest data from NPD iPad maintains a very strong leadership share in all the price bands where we compete iPad has also consistently been the number one tablet in enterprise A recent Changewave survey found that among corporate buyers planning to buy tablets in the next six months plan to purchase iPads In fact we are seeing very high interest from companies who want to use iPads to transform how work gets done The vast majority of the app opportunities that have been identified as part of the Apple and IBM partnership are specifically for iPad In addition to IBM we working closely with more than two dozen other leading business software and solution providers including Box Docusign Microstrategy Revel and ServiceMax to bring a broad range of innovative mobile solutions to more customers on iPad Turning to services revenue grew to a new alltime record of billion an increase of year over year The growth was led by the App Store which remains incredibly popular with our customers around the world with revenue up in the March quarter According to App Annie the App Store generated more global revenue in the March quarter than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play up from a lead in the September quarter Traffic to our retail and online stores was excellent with a year over year increase in customer visits Were progressing well with our plans for retail store expansion in Greater China where we added six new stores in the past quarter alone bringing us to stores in cities Were on track to have stores open in Greater China by the middle of next year Let me now turn to our cash position We ended the quarter with billion in cash plus marketable securities a sequential increase of billion Over billion of this cash was offshore In the March quarter we issued billion US dollar denominated notes and billion Swiss franc denominated notes as we continue to diversify our global debt investor base Weve now raised a total of billion of term debt at very attractive rates We spent billion to repurchase million Apple shares through open market transactions paid billion in dividends and equivalents and utilized about million to net share settle vesting employee RSUs We also retired an additional million shares during the quarter with the conclusion of the accelerated share repurchase program we launched last August We have executed our capital return program aggressively and weve now taken action on over billion of our billion program including billion in share repurchases at an average price of As weve said consistently creating value for shareholders by developing great products that enrich peoples lives will always be our top priority and the key factor driving our investments and our capital allocation decisions With this framework in mind Apples board and management team continue to review capital allocation regularly and we solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders This process allows us to be thoughtful about the size the mix and the pace of the program We very much appreciate all the input that many shareholders have provided us We continue to be in the fortunate position of being able to return significant capital to shareholders We first announced our capital return program three years ago with an initial size of billion and weve increased it annually since then Today were announcing the third update to our program expanding its size by the largest amount yet and extending its duration The existing program was set to conclude at the end of this calendar year and were now extending the program by five quarters to the end of March Once again with this update were allocating the majority of the expansion of the program to share repurchases given our strong confidence in the future of Apple and the value we see in our stock The board has increased the share repurchase authorization by billion raising it from the current billion to billion We will also continue to net share settle vesting employee restricted stock units We also understand that the dividend is very important to many of our investors and were raising it for the third time in less than three years The quarterly dividend will grow from per share to per share an increase of This effective with our next dividend which the board has declared today and is payable on May to shareholders of record as of May We believe this is a meaningful increase for those shareholders who value income and we continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward With over billion in annual dividend payments were proud to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world In total the size of our revised capital return program will increase by over from approximately billion to billion As weve done in the past we expect to fund our capital return program with US cash future US cash flow generation and borrowing from both domestic and international debt markets And we plan to provide the next update on our program at about this time next year Now as we move ahead into the June quarter Id like to review our outlook which includes the types of forwardlooking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call We expect revenue to be between billion and billion compared to billion in the year ago quarter We expect gross margin to be between and We expect opex to be between billion and billion We expect YNE to be about million and we expect the tax rate to be about Thank you and we ask that you limit yourself to one onepart question and one follow up Operator may we have the first question please When we look at the effect of currency on your gross profit which I think was far less than anyone anticipated have you be able to reduce some of the pressure by adjusting the terms of your suppliers Or is that something we should expect to see more of as you progress through the year Im gonna give you some numbers on the currency because I know its a topic that is top of mind Youre asking about gross margin and you know we look at this on a sequential basis And I mentioned during the call in January that we were expecting FX to have a negative impact on a sequential basis of about basis points after the effect of the hedges And that is exactly what happened in our actual results So that was pretty much in line with what we were anticipating Of course we expect this headwind to continue And on a sequential basis when we look into the June quarter we expect to see another basis points of negative impact from currency Were dealing with these headwinds Theyre part of business and so were dealing with them in many ways We are looking at in some cases at the potential to increase prices in certain markets Were looking of course at our cost structure and we try to remain as competitive as possible So we feel very good about the gross margins that weve generated in the March quarter and we feel very good about the guidance that we provided given the severity of the impact And then as a follow up obviously I guess one of the incremental tailwinds to gross margin continues to be the iPhone upside relative to expectations Can you give us a bit more color on the dynamics of the customer mix for the iPhone You had mentioned youre very excited about the new iPhone rate so far but if you could just give us a bit more color as we had last quarter on folks that are new to iPhone Android switchers versus replacements Bill we continue to see a higher rate of switchers than we have seen in previous cycles and so were extremely excited about that We also continue to see a reasonable percentage of first time buyers particularly in some of the emerging markets And if you look at emerging markets in general I think Luca covered some of this the revenue from emerging markets just for the March quarter was up year on year And a big piece of what is driving that is iPhone Obviously those results would have been higher without some of the FX headwinds that Luca mentioned earlier Youve said in the past that the watch may take longer to ramp given the new category and new interface to customers Is that in fact playing out Is the watch ramping slower than past product categories Yeah preorders and first week in sales and any other data points that you track in terms of interest versus say when the iPad launched in Let me talk about supply and demand and sort of separate those two Right now demand is greater than supply And so were working hard to remedy that Weve made progress over the last week or so and we were able to deliver more customers an Apple Watch over the weekend than we had initially anticipated Were going to keep doing that and so weve already sent some notes out today moving the customers and versus what we had communicated to them previously So Im generally happy that were moving on with the ramp It is a new product for us and with any kind of new product you wind up taking some time to fully ramp Having said that I think were in a good position and by sometime in late June we currently anticipate being in a position that we could begin to sell the Apple Watch in additional countries And so thats our current plan From a demand point of view its hard to gauge when you dont have product in stores and so forth So were filling orders completely online at the moment The customer response from people that have gotten theirs over the weekend have been overwhelmingly positive and were far ahead of where we expected to be from an application point of view To give you a comparison when we launched the iPhone we had about apps that were ready When we launched iPad we had about a thousand And so our internal goal was to be able to beat the thousand level and we thought it would be great if we were able to do that by a little bit And as I mentioned before we now have over apps in the App Store for the watch And so we couldnt be happier about how things are going from that point of view We are learning quickly about customer preferences between the different configurations Theres a much larger breadth of possibilities here for customers than in our other products And in some cases we called that well In some cases were making adjustments to get in line with demand But Im really confident that this is something we really understand how to do and will do And so Im really happy where we are currently and happy enough that were looking forward to expanding into more countries in late June And then as a follow up research and development spend continues to track well ahead of revenue growth And that has happened for many quarters now Can you talk about whats driving that Is there a broader set of projects that youre working on Are you making bigger bets entering bigger markets Whats driving such a long period of elevated RD spend Of course weve said this several times now When you look at our current product portfolio it is much broader than it used to be Weve now developed two new iPhones over the year We were not doing that a few years ago Developed two iPads And of course now we have the Apple Watch Were also developing some core foundational technologies more in house now than we were in the past And of course were also spending ahead of some of the products that will generate revenues in the future So when you combined all these factors that is the reason why you see these research and development increases year over year Research and development is the core of the company Innovation is the core of the company And were very proud of the fact when you look for example at the last two quarters the first half of our revenue growth has been higher than our opex growth And when you look at our expense to revenue ratio which for the first half of the year has been its lower than it was a year ago and its definitely something that we consider extremely competitive and were very proud of Tim you mentioned theres more switchers versus previous cycles Any thoughts on what that would mean or could mean for market share over the next few quarters and kind of I guess the sustainability of the cycle And then second question for Luca in terms of any thoughts on what the margin impact from the watch is that ramps over the next couple of years Gene if you look at the overall worldwide we grew iPhone And IDCs estimate of the market for last quarter is a so we grew two and a half times And if you kind of look through at the different countries in almost every country we grew at a multiple of the market And as I mentioned before in emerging markets we did extremely well And so I feel really good about where we are and you can hopefully tell with the strong guidance that we provided that were very bullish on the current quarter as well And so I think things look very very good Were also pleased in addition to the switcher number that were doing fairly well with first time buyers which is also a key metric for us And so its tough to find something in the numbers not to like And Gene let me take your question on margins Ill talk about Q because you know this is the period that we provide guidance for And we guided to to which is slightly down versus our performance in Q And this is driven by a number of things First of all its the loss of leverage from the sequential decline in revenue This is typical of our seasonality Theres a foreign exchange element and I mentioned before the negative impact on a sequential basis about basis points And also were launching the Apple Watch Apple Watch is not only a new product but its a brand new category with a lot of new features a lot of new innovative technologies And Apple Watch margins will be lower than company average One maybe quick follow up Tim in terms of the base of iPhones that have upgraded I think you provided a number last quarter on that Is there any update to that metric Yeah sure Our current estimate is that about of the active installed base has upgraded to a or plus And so as I look at that number that suggests theres plenty of upgrade headroom in addition to we want to keep inviting over as many switchers as we can So between both of those and the first time buyers as well it seems really really good right now I just wanted to revisit the watch Tim I think youve said when you were talking about your new products you said were very happy with the reception and in response to a previous answer you said relative to demand its hard to gauge with no product in the stores I would say relative to other product launches where your commentary around demand was characterized by superlative after superlative that assessment feels very modest And part of the reason that I ask is A are we reading you right in terms of that but if we look at consensus consensus is expecting that Apple will ship more watches in its first two quarters than it did iPad despite as you said very limited distribution in terms of only selling through your store So Im wondering if you could talk a little bit about putting those demand comments in context given that they do seem different from how youve characterized product demand for other products and how if at all we should think about modeling demand in the context perhaps of the iPad which was your most recent significant new category Im thrilled with it Tony so I dont want you to read anything Im saying any way other than that So Im not sure how to say that any clearer than that And in any situation whether its the watch or in the past on iPad or on iPhone when demand is much greater than supply its difficult to gauge exactly what it is And so as you know we dont make long term forecasts on here We make forecasts for the current quarter And so I dont want to make any comment about the consensus numbers Honestly I havent even studied those Weve got enough to think about here I feel really great about it The customer response literally from what Ive seen is close to positive And so its hard to imagine it being better You talked about the watch having lower margins in the third quarter which is surprising A I think in the context of price points that many people thought were higher B in the context of what luxury watches sell for C I think in terms of what estimated margins might be installed on accessories like your watch band So Im wondering if you believe that the watchs gross margins are being burdened by lower volumes and startup costs and that you believe that as a category watch margins will be in total including everything else that you sell with it on a sustained basis lower than the company average Tony were not going to guide to or give projections of gross margin outside of the current quarter And so what we have right now which is a situation its not surprising to us we knew we would be here is that the watch gross margins for the current quarter that weve included in the guidance that Lucas provided in the aggregate are lower than the company average And so that to us is intuitive that they would be And so I think we must be just looking at it through a different lens than you are I guess the question is is there anything unique about it being in its first quarter that its providing that margin profile In the first quarter with any new kind of product you would always have learning and these sorts of things Weve had this with every product weve ever done And so again were not guiding to what it will be over time Were talking about what it is now But you know I would keep in mind that the functionality of the product that were making is absolutely incredible the power of it And I havent even seen this but generally theres cost breakdowns that come out around our products that are much different than the reality Ive never seen one that is anywhere close to being accurate And so if thats the basis for your comment Id really dig on the data if I were you Tim can you talk a bit about what youre seeing in China with year over year growth in the Greater China revenue and clearly very strong iPhone If you can talk a bit about what consumers are saying what the carriers are saying in terms of demand and opportunity Just any color because clearly its quite strong Yeah it was an incredible quarter We were up year over year We set a record in China for revenues We did that now in a quarter that included Chinese New Year and so we have the help of a strong holiday season much like the US has a strong season in December Chinas is obviously in the March quarter iPhone led the way It was up over year on year And the current estimates from Kantar are that that would mean that we would gain more than points of share on a year over year basis And so by everything I can see we did extremely well The Mac also had an unbelievable quarter in China and Im particularly very happy with this that Mac unit sales were up And like the rest of the world or most of the rest of the world IDC is projecting that PC sales in China contracted by last quarter And so once again bucking the tide Also in China consistent with the company but at a much different rate the App Store had a record quarter and grew over year over year And so you can see the iPhone the Mac and the App Store adding and with the iPad in PRC not in Greater China but in the PRC iPad had its best quarter ever higher than all the others and also grew in a market that contracted for the overall market And so really and truly its sort of everything you look at in China was extremely good We have been working significantly on expanding our ecosystem there and so we added Union Pay as a payment option for customers We increased the iPhone point of sales to over during the quarter Thats up about year on year And more importantly than the total number we are in many more cities than we were before We worked significantly on our online store Our online store revenue was up over three times year over year As you probably heard us say before weve opened several stores in China recently Were now at in Greater China and were on track still to achieve stores by the middle of next year The online store will also be expanding from around cities to where they can hit two day delivery to cities So adding about new cities by the end of this quarter And so the net is were investing a lot across the board in our infrastructure in our products on partnering with different companies The Chinese developers are coming on in significant numbers Weve now made payments to developers in Greater China of almost billion over half of which was in the last months And so you can see this enormous momentum building in the developer community there as well And so lots of positive things and you know as you probably heard me say before Ive never seen as many people coming into the middle class as they are in China And thats where the bulk of our sales are going And so were really proud of the results there and continue to invest in the country And just sort of a follow up on the iPad side What do you think its going to take to reaccelerate iPads The sellthrough was better than the sell in this quarter but are we seeing cannibalization from the iPhone plus and how are you sort of thinking about the IBM partnership as it relates to iPad Number one we have to stop having the situations where we sell through more than we sell in where we dont have to have an inventory correction That was over a million units Two have we had cannibalization The answer is yes Were clearly seeing cannibalization from iPhone and on the other side from the Mac And of course as Ive said before weve never worried about that It is what it is That will play out and at some point it will stabilize Im not sure precisely when but Im pretty confident that it will The IBM partnership I think is in its early stages in terms of bearing fruit here but everything I see I like on it Im a big believer in the ability for iPad to play in a major way in enterprise And so Im looking forward to seeing that play out as we move forward If you look at the underlying data it makes you feel a lot better than the sales do And so things like first time buyer rates the latest numbers from the US are somewhere around And if you look at China theyre almost And so these numbers are not numbers that you would get if the market were saturated And so I continue to believe even though Ive seen people write that that I think that theory is not correct and do not see that We also see usage numbers that are off the charts so far above competition its not even in the same planet And we see customer satisfaction at or near And so these kind of numbers along with intent to buy numbers everything looks fantastic the ecommerce numbers And so my belief is that as the inventory plays out as we make some continued investments in our product pipeline which were doing that we already have planned and have had planned for some time between that the inventory playing out the enterprise starting to take over I think still I believe the iPad is an extremely good business over the long term When precisely it begins to grow again I wouldnt want to predict but I strongly believe that it will Luca could you comment a bit about the factors that went into your decision on the capital return program particularly the share repurchase part For example I would think youre pretty well done in terms of taking US cash down So you are dependent upon cash flow in the US as well as debt And regarding debt do you have a debt to EBITDA ratio in mind that you dont want to go over Do you want to keep your AA rating Is that important Just other factors like capital spending needs just curious what your thinking was The logic has not changed over the years We look at our business plans we look at what we want to accomplish from product perspective We look at the capital needs that we have to run the business and to grow the business And then we see that were in this great position that we can return cash to shareholders We know Apple very well We are very excited by the level of customer response that weve got for our current portfolio Were super confident about the pipeline of products and services that we have and therefore we believe that there is great value in our stock And that is the reason why again this year were allocating the majority of the increase which is the largest increase that weve ever done were increasing the program by billion And the vast majority of that were allocating to the share repurchase because again we believe theres great value in the stock We also know and understand that we have several investors that value income And so thats important for us to increase the dividend And as weve said in the past we plan to continue to increase the dividend every year And as weve said in the past we will come back at about this time next year and give you another update to the program because we will have better information and well be able to be very thoughtful about the size and the mix and the pace of the program From a funding standpoint of course we have a very strong balance sheet We do have some cash in the US We will continue to generate cash in the US but definitely a good portion of the program will be funded through debt We will raise debt both in the US and outside of the United States And you know of course weve got a very very strong balance sheet Weve got a very open dialog with the rating agencies And so we feel we have a lot of room for us to fund the program So from a balance sheet standpoint we feel very very comfortable with the program that weve announced today My first question is for Tim Tim on the point you made about the of the unintelligible being on or plus are we right in interpreting the comment that thats a substantially lower number than at this point in previous cycles And that would I guess argue for just a longer period of growth as the unintelligible upgrades And then also linked to that just by the points youre making on unintelligible iPhone users and unintelligible being higher that number year on year in the first six months is really growing significantly year on year Is that the right way to interpret that comment Oh sorry yes My second part of my question is in the first six months of the plus is the gross number of new users to Apple whether its new users or switches from Android significantly growing year on year I dont have the comparisons in front of me about the answers to either one of your questions My understanding of what you asked was is the number that Id mentioned in the question from Gene how does it compare year over year is it a lot different I dont know the answer to that off the top of my head As I look at the number my point from bringing it up is that theres a lot of people that havent upgraded to a and plus And so as I look at that it screams that theres significant opportunity there And thats before thinking about switchers and first time buyers Okay great and then Luca just on the gross margin decline from the March quarter to June I understand the currency point I understand the iPhones a little bit older I guess of the iPhone and the watch impact is the decline equally attributed to both those reasons or is there something different going on Let me tell you there are a number of reasons why our guidance for gross margins is lower than the actual for the second quarter The first one is the loss of leverage because of the sequential decline in revenue We got the foreign exchange we got as you said a lower iPhone mix And we got the Apple Watch I think well leave it at that and were not gonna get into more specifics But those are the four reasons that drive the sequential decline Tim this is for you You mentioned something in your past comment that you thought a lot of the iPhone sales were going into the middle class in China And Im just wondering if you could elaborate on that and open it up more broadly speaking to the emerging geographies If you have demographics that you could talk about for your iPhone specifically and where you think those phones are ending up Because I think it does raise the question as you look out over the next year or so do you have the right price points for the demographic youre hitting Heres what I would share with you Keith is that if you look in the emerging markets our revenues were up year on year And this accounted for just slightly less than of the companys revenue If you look at BRIC within the emerging markets BRIC countries were up year over year And so as I look at that without having market research data on the demographics that youre asking its clear to me that it has to be coming from the middle class because the upper income earners theres only so many of those And you cant grow those kind of numbers without getting significantly into the middle class And so I think thats where we are I hope were also beyond the middle class but I dont have the data to suggest that thats the case or not the case But its clear to me that the middle class statement has to be true My follow up Tim Im gonna stay with you for a second it sounds like HBO Now is a great opportunity today and as you look out If you could just speak more specifically how we should be thinking about Apple as a conduit for something like HBO Now and other products Is that a meaningful revenue opportunity without getting specific andor is it more about selling incremental devices or is it about expanding the revenue pie as you look at opportunities like HBO Now First of all I think its about giving the customer something they want and giving to them in Apples classic ease of use and in the product environments and the user interface that theyre used to working in in this case Apple TV And so I think HBO in particular has some incredibly great content And so were marrying their great content our great product and ecosystem and its clear from looking at the early returns you know weve only been at this for a couple of weeks or so that theres a lot of traction in there And so where could it go I dont want to speculate but you can speculate probably as good as I can about where that can go I think were on the early stages of just major major changes in media that are going to be really great for consumers and I think Apple could be a part of that Thank you Keith A replay of todays call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes Store as a webcast on applecominvestor and via
