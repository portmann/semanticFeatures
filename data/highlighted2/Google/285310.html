initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Netflix is expanding its business worldwide including Russia Because I live in Russia I can provide useful commentary on the companys prospects in this market I am not sure Netflix will be a success in this market during the first years but I see potential in the medium term Last year a few mass media sources announced that Netflix NASDAQ NFLX was going to expand its business into several new countries The main purpose of this expansion is to become a global videocontent provider as Netflix spokesperson Yann Lafargue stated a few days ago He also said that Russia was one of the potential targets link to the Fortune article Because I am bilingual I tried to find some additional information in the Russian media Here is what I found Joris Evers Netflixs VP of Communications announced that Netflix will debut in the Russian market by the end of January Moreover he mentioned that the company has made agreements with Rostelecom one of the largest telecommunication companies in Russia to promote Netflix via monthly subscriptions with SmartTV and settop boxes Finally Vitaliy Svistunov Development Manager of the SmartTV unit at LG OTCLGEAF said that his company has already made modifications to the hardware to allow Netflix to be streamed into LG SmartTV sets the links for the Russian media sources are here and here Netflix estimates the Russian market to have M potential subscribers it is the total number of Internet users in the country and about of the population If the average subscription price is per month just like in the US the total market potential is B per year As a current Russian resident I can provide a useful commentary on why these numbers will hardly ever be reached even in the next decade Moreover I want to name a few reasons why Netflix will probably not even see onetwentieth of this figure during the first years of operations in the Russian market On the other hand I also want to give a few points as to why the company has a good chance to reach a sales level of M in the next five years in Russia I think this is the most serious issue Today the Russian ruble tested a level of RUB per USD a historical maximum since the s even if we take into account the currency devaluation in Even before the most recent devaluation the GDP per capita in the US was much higher than in Russia According to the World Banks statistics in an average American earned about per year It means that the bill paid for Netflixs annual subscription was about of personal income An average Russian earned about per year during the same time frame more than times less than the average American In the average Russian could get the annual Netflix subscription for of his annual income You can easily see the difference here However this is not the worst point According to the Russian Statistics Bureau s forecast the Russian GDP per capita will fall by about in so it will roughly be at a level of RUB Given the average USDRUB exchange rate of in the Russian GDP per capita is about per year or lower than in see Diagram Moreover several days ago the Russian Statistics Bureau announced that the average monthly income for October in Russia was RUB per month or about RUB K per year Given the current exchange rate of RUB per USD this results in less than per annum This means that the Netflix annual subscription is now more than of the average annual salary Add to this the inflation rate in and the rising unemployment rate the official data are not applicable as about of Russians work illegally and you will see the economic trap Russia has fallen into The forecast for and thereafter is not optimistic a growth of nominal GDP in the best case and a CPI level of is expected The real GDP has been falling for almost one and a half years and is likely to continue declining in the future The RUB devaluation in the next five years is in question but the purchasing power parity theory shows that the fair exchange rate will be about rubles per dollar unfortunately I do not have the data but a friend of mine almost precisely calculated the potential for the devaluation in his article a year ago Despite the bad economy the video streaming market does exist in Russia Its main players are shown in Table According to the table the total market turnover is currently at about M In February analysts said that the Russian market may become a RUB B market by or increase by more than However the RUB devaluation means that this level will only total around M which implies a compound annual growth rate of less than in USD terms Source data by RosBusinessConsulting infographics by author Founded in and owned by private equity firms Baring Vostok Capital Partners ruNet Tiger Global Management and Interros Ivi has become a leader in the video streaming market with a base of M subscribers and sales of RUB M in Despite the high revenue growth in year over year its operating income margin has been near zero for the time period The net income has been negative and because of increasing costs is not going to turn positive in the next years The key strengths of this business are The service is growing very rapidly The company has quickly become a market leader A few friends of mine do not know of any streaming services other than Ivi The company definitely knows the market and its target audience With several sales channels monthly subscriptions singlemovie options free films with online advertising etc it shows excellent sales growth figures Low prices A monthly subscription for full HD movies with p quality and no online advertising costs only RUB or about per month This is two times lower than what Netflix charges by the way Strong sustainability background Four private equity multibillion funds can make additional investments to fund further market penetration Netflixs plans are the best catalyst for that This is the second biggest videostreaming service in Russia with a market audience of M people and a market share of according to the revenue figures Its main focus is providing SmartTV services to premium clients The main approach is providing highquality content to loyal customers at a reasonable price The customer base exceeds people at the moment so the company has a good margin of safety Moreover its revenue has increased four times in and reached a level of RUB M M Just like Ivi the company has recently shown a positive operating income However its net income is yet to turn positive The key competitive points of this business are The fantastic growth rate of over in The focus on high quality content and premium service The high quality results in The core videostreaming market is not limited to these companies There are also Internet and telecommunication providers that are going to fight with Netflix for audience Most representatives are regional so I do not know all the names My friends mostly use Akado Using Akado as an example I will explain the business model of similar companies in Russia Despite the fact that its main business model is providing access to the Internet Akado also provides several additional products and services including selling wireless routers payTV telephone connection etc One of the additional services is purchasing movies for home viewing The main point here is that it costs user only rubles less than cents to buy a movie in HD quality and watch it without online advertising A lot of people can afford this price Besides that there is an additional service to the current monthly plan which gives customers unlimited access to video content It costs about RUB per month per month on average It is an ideal option for those who want to have the Internet PayTV and Home Cinema bundle at once Finally the broadcasting companies majored in public entertainment such as tv Russia TNT CTC do not want to allow Netflix to capture their market share even if they do not offer House of Cards and Orange is the New Black series tv is the most popular TV channel in Russia like ABC or NBC in the US with more than RUB B M in revenues Its majority shareholder is the government of the Russian Federation Netflix is going to have to fight with both core competitors like Ivi and Okko and with noncore competitors whose interests are hurt by the companys intrusion Final Barrier The Most Significant One Even if Netflix provides a good valueforprice service and successfully fights against its main competitors there is a problem which Netflix cannot solve there are websites with free movies video and audio content People not only can use the content online but also download it in high quality These sites can be divided into three categories the torrent sites torrents social networks the most famous is Vkontakte VK founded by Pavel Durov the exCEO of VK and the founder of Telegram and other sites Approximately of Russian Internet users are torrent pirates There are mainly three reasons for that First The legislation is at an early stage There have been no precedents of people being put in jail for copyright infringement Moreover Russia does not have a precedential law system Hence it takes a very long time to review each court case Second Relatively low standards of life make people want to spend time finding cheaper entertainment options Third Russian IT specialists are one of the best in the world It is not difficult for them to circumvent the law and create anonymous systems to bypass the regulations Several years ago the government tried to close one of the most popular torrent sites at the time torrentsru They successfully did it However a new website was created right after that called rutrackerorg which quickly became filled with the content from the closed website torrentsru In Russian authorities tried to close rutrackerorg but the legislation process went on for too long Finally the court announced that the domain rutrackerorg had to be blocked in Russia Several organizations made an official protest so the court had to postpone the blocking for a month By that time the sites administration had taught its users how to avoid the domain locking and download the necessary files without being trailed you can see this in Diagram As you can see blocking just one torrent site in a tenyear period is a systems failure Besides there are dozens of other torrent sites where one can easily download the desired content Hence the problem seems to be impossible to solve VK is the most popular social network in Russia and the CIS and one of the most wellknown in Europe VK has always been a free source of audio and video content Sometimes the quality is very high HD p or even higher In the last years there has been a series of mass cleanings of illegal content Each day dozens of copyright holders ban thousands of illegal movies and songs However most people can spend a reasonable amount of time to find a movie they want to watch even if it was released in the movie theaters less than week ago Because the majority holder of VK is Mailru Group controlled by Alisher Usmanov Forbes in and now and Vladimir Putins pal the website will never be blocked by the Russian authorities for copyright infringements in the near future and neither will the free content There is nothing much to say here I just want you to look at Diagram where you can see that there are more than six billion requests per month for phrases like watch movies online for free or the best films online There are thousands of websites that make money by providing these movies for free in exchange for online advertising Note Yandex NASDAQ YNDX is the most popular search engine in Russia <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is second Wordstat Yandex is the analogue of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Trends Despite the unfavorable facts I have mentioned before Russia is slowly becoming a developed country I see changes in the legislation and in the peoples mindset The legislation changes are mostly about the copyright law Nowadays it is difficult for many people to cope with the idea of distributing audio and video content without the authors permission The torrent sites are being shut down and there are additional investments being made to make this process go faster Moreover the content owners have found a compromise with the Internet users Everybody agrees that both downloading and watching for free and selling content for a high price is not profitable to anybody Hence copyright owners provide highquality content at a reasonable price and people buy and enjoy it On the other hand the latter have to cope with online advertising on the websites they visit Netflix is a big company much bigger than any of this type in Russia Hence a good strategy going forward is to make acquisitions of the biggest competitors in the core market and reaching compromises with the noncore market players On the one hand this will decrease the level of market rivalry On the other hand it will help penetrate the market quicker and give the company the necessary local experience There are several recommendations from me for the companys success in the Russian market As I have already mentioned acquisitions of key core market players Ivi is the best target here because it is owned by four private equity funds I do not think they will refuse to sell their stake in the currently complex macroeconomic environment Cash is a king as they say It can definitely work here Provide highest quality at a reasonable price People will not pay for lowquality content because they have access to torrents VK and other sites However the price should not be higher than per month as most people cannot afford spending of their monthly income on watching movies even if the movies are interesting and of high quality Provide choices for customers including free watching Ivis strategy of monthly subscriptions payasyougo and free films on random days has helped its revenues increase by more than over the last year Make watching highquality films at home a good tradition The current economic situation is the main reason why most people cannot afford to spend too much money on entertainment Hence a prolific marketing strategy is the way to make the business grow in the long term I do not expect Netflix to have a nice ride in the Russian market However reaching a subscriber base of M with each user paying about annually is a reasonable target for the company over a fiveyear period As I said in my introduction section this implies that the company could be making M in sales in Russia in the years to come The companys success mostly depends on the recommendations I have mentioned before I believe that the company already knows about the issues I have mentioned and will do its best to use the knowledge to its benefit in order to succeed
