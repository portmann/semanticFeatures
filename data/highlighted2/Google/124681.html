buy even though it is at its alltime high Facebook video is taking share in a growing marketplace YouTube grew FB will grow faster Currently Im up on Facebook NASDAQ FB stock Being a longterm investor does not mean I stop doing research to continually check to if the stock is worth owning My opinion on the stock remains the same it is a buy There are two themes I am going to review that fuel my bullishness on the stock The first trend is online video It may seem like an old trend as YouTube NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL has just passed its th anniversary but the trend is still in its early innings Facebook is improving its video strategy and still has much more room to expand The second is separating the winners and losers in social media The three biggest winners currently are Instagram Snapchat and Periscope The three biggest losers are Tumblr <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Meerkat Facebooks Instagram will be critical for the success of the company in the long term Im expecting remarkable growth metrics on Instagram to be reported when Facebook releases earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>announced that YouTube experienced growth last quarter This means Facebook will see even larger growth because it has been taking share from YouTube It would be a continuation of the high growth trend seen in the chart below as the number of video views per day has increased from billion to billion in the last quarter Although Facebook has been taking share from YouTube they arent directly competing with each other both will do well as the online video pie grows larger Right now Facebook is a place for friends to share personal videos that they dont want to publicly post on YouTube and for viral videos to be shared YouTube has developed a platform that is sophisticated This helps the small YouTuber like myself grow People who care about analytics such as audience retention will continue uploading to YouTube Those who just want to share a video about their friends jumping in a pool dont care about these stats and just want to easily share it Facebook is the place to go for these content creators As I expected Facebook recently announced that it was launching a revenuesharing platform for video content creators They didnt quibble over percentages and decided to simply copy the split YouTube has with going to the content creator and going to Facebook Facebook started the program with the inclusion of only content creators with millions of views aka viral video creators This makes sense to start because as I previously stated Facebook video mainly consists of viral videos and very personal content Of course FB will never pay people who are just uploading videos of their friends so this isnt an issue The revenue structure is different from YouTube YouTube pays each channel individually when it uploads a popular video Facebook has videos on autoplay which means preroll ads arent an option Autoplay does a great job at catching a users attention so making users click to watch a video wouldnt make sense Therefore Facebook has instead decided to put a preroll ad in the second video a user watches if heshe clicks on one of the videos in the suggested videos tab The advertiser pays Facebook as the ad is viewed for seconds The revenue is split between the original video watched the second video and the videos in the suggested tab This is certainly a tough hurdle to leap over so Facebook has been improving its algorithm to make sure users stay engaged The company recently announced it was changing the way it measured whether a user was interacting with a video Interactions measure what it puts in the newsfeed FB is now counting actions such as turning on the volume putting the video in full screen and putting it in HD as actions that signify the user liked the video Sometimes a user doesnt want to share a video they liked either because it reflects poorly on them or it has already been shared millions of times What content you share is starting to represent the type of person you are so some content is meant for consumption and not for sharing Some users also dont want to share every video they watch because they dont want to clog up their friends newsfeeds There is a large gap between viral videos and videos made for friends and family This gap consists of what is commonly referred to as YouTubers YouTubers with subscribers or more are the ones Facebook should focus on These YouTubers need to create a content strategy for Facebook just because of how big FB is billion video views per day This reach makes it worth it for YouTubers to post content on Facebook even without pay YouTubers are posting condensed versions of their content For some this could be a second sped up clip that gets a viewers attention and makes himher want to click Just posting a YouTube video on Facebook isnt engaging because it doesnt have the autoplay feature It doesnt take much time to edit the Facebook video because it is simply a clip There are two possibilities for how this will evolve in the future Either Facebook decides to never pay these YouTubers for posting this type of content or it decides to pay them for content which makes them post full videos on the social network Either strategy could work out for FB If a YouTuber does the strategy I outlined then YouTube is effectively subsidizing the content creation on Facebook as a YouTuber wouldnt create the video for Facebook if heshe didnt already have a YouTube channel It has been a great start for video on FB If it does try to develop its video network and pay more creators it will take a lot of time and effort to build an equivalent platform to YouTube If it does users will spend more time on Facebook because they will be getting full videos I have made this point many times in previous articles but it is worth repeating because I feel some investors dont grasp the importance of it After all they seemed to have missed the huge growth YouTube had last quarter The social media winners among teens are Instagram Snapchat and Periscope As you can see from the chart Instagram is the most popular response to the question of which social network teens feel is the most important to them Judging from my own observations I expect the Instagram metrics to continue to go higher Instagram allows you to connect with friends and family without having to think about making a status It may sound like a terrible generational trend but teenagers dont want to have to have deep original thought on a social network They want something quick Having their parents not on the app is also a benefit It is important to remember teens are on the leading edge of social media adoption so any growth in teen usage should funnel through to the older generation Its not as if posting pictures and video is a foreign concept it will catch on The advantage of Instagram over Facebook is the importance given to each post Facebook is for dumping your entire photo album and Instagram is where only your best photos are uploaded By checking through someones Instagram feed you can get an understanding of who they are as a person and what they like to do instead of having to read through their likes and dislikes on Facebook While Instagram focuses on being quick and easy I fully expect the average amount of time spent on the app to increase from the minutes it is at now This average will increase because of the increased engagement from older users who are still just catching onto the trend It will also come from the increased development of its Explore function which allows users to find photos on a specific event as it happens One of the reasons Instagram is successful with the younger generation is it provides a full screen of content with only one image allowed to be seen at a time This is also a feature of Snapchat and Periscope The exact opposite of this feature is Twitter NYSE TWTR because it has the most content on one screen at a time As you can see Instagram is killing Twitter in terms of engagement rates of the top brands on each app Part of this is because users dont understand what a favorite is on Twitter It doesnt make intuitive sense This is why Twitter is experimenting with replacing favorites with hearts as seen on Periscope Instagrams simplicity of what a like actually means is helpful for engagement On an anecdotal note I often get more likes on a terrible picture I post on Instagram then I get favorites on Tweets Keep in mind I have about followers on Instagram and Twitter followers The engagement factor is critical for Facebooks ad pricing power For the first time on Instagram I saw a carousel feature on ad for Coors Light It let you swipe right to see more images It was highly creative I spent time viewing it just because I had never seen this carousel feature on Instagram before It definitely could be added as a feature for all users if it works out For the other ads sometimes it is difficult to determine whether the picture was even an ad Usually they dont inspire action but because every picture on Instagram is valued so highly I expect them to generate a great amount of exposure for brands Overall the most critical thing for Facebook to get right is to make sure the ads look good If this is the case users wont mind a small spike in ads in fact they may not even notice they are ads at all In conclusion Facebook stock is up on a shortterm high The price of the stock could have a small correction but the decline would be a buying opportunity because video and Instagram will prove to be key growth drivers Source Facebook Is Still A Buy Going Into Earnings Disclosure I amwe are long
