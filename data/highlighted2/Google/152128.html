run on Windows Mobile devices Project Astoria is still in beta testing but many people are already using it to install Android apps on their twoyear old Lumia Windows phones Microsoft needs more app developers to port their topgrossing games and apps to the Windows platform Project Astoria is a great way to persuade these developers Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT promised a quick and painless way for Androidonly developers to port their appsgames to Windows last April The stillin betatesting Project Astoria SDK Software Development Kit is a bridge tool for developers to reuse their existing Javabased <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOGL Android codes to make Windows versions of their apps Project Astoria is available for Windows and Mac OS X computers and it will let developers quickly replace the embedded codes of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Mobile Services Pending GMS and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play Services with Microsoft App Services Based on the Project Astoria SDK documentation disabling GMS and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play Services in favor of Microsoft Services is a twostep procedure for seasoned programmers The best part of Project Astoria SDK is that Android apps such as games that do not need inapp purchases or cloudbased saving that are not dependent on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Mobile Services and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play could be published and distributed at Windows App Store with very little code revisions This almostautomated way of porting Android apps to Windows is a very important tailwind for Microsofts big shift toward a freemium strategy The mobile apps industry is a billionyear business Unfortunately due to the low global market share of Windows mobile devices Microsofts app store business is way behind that of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Amazons NASDAQ AMZN Giving away an easy porting software tool to Android developers is a brilliant tactic for Nadella Project Astoria will definitely encourage big developers like Supercell and GungHo Entertainment to bring their billiondollargenerating game to Windows devices As of now only a few major developers like King Digital NYSE KING Zynga NASDAQ ZNGA and GameLoft OTCPK GLOFY have ported some of their topgrossing mobile games to the Windows platform King Digital used the Project Astoria SDK to port its Candy Crush Saga game to Windows Phone devices last December However other topgrossing Android games like Clash of Clans and Game of War Fire Age have not yet been ported by their respective developers Supercell maker of the millionmonth grossing game Clash of Clans has never released a Windows Phone or Windows version The Project Astoria SDK beta kit is supposedly for a few professional developers only However thousands of Lumia phone owners are now aware of the online tutorials on how to sideload or even install Android apps and games directly from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play Store Please do not attempt those tutorials if you are not competent enough XDRdaniel a Senior Member at XDADevelopers Forums has released three methods on how people could install and run APKs of their favorite Android appsgames on Lumia smartphones running Preview builds of Windows Mobile XDRDaniels initiative also revealed that Microsofts Project Astoria tool uses the Dalvik Java Virtual Machine of the older Android OS to run Android Apps on Windows Mobile Please visit WMPoweruser to see an updated list of working Android apps on Windows Mobile phones The work of XDRDaniel and others is prima facie evidence that Project Astoria really works The currently unofficial way of sideloading or installing Android apps directly from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play could lead to Microsoft accelerating the commercial release of Project Astoria While it is now possible to play Clash of Clans on a Lumia Windows Mobile phone it is still not ideal for gamers Saving game progress in Clash of Clans requires the cloud services of GMS Buying inapp gems from Supercells store also needs the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play Services enabled <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>will never allow unofficial activation of GMS and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play on Windows mobile devices It is therefore urgent for Microsoft to negotiate a separate deal with app owners so that inapp purchases on ported Android apps could be done through Microsofts App Store MSFT is still a great hold for longterm growth investors Project Astoria is a powerful incentive for recalcitrant Androidonly developers to finally expand their app monetization to include Windows devices Microsoft needs more income from app store downloads and inapp purchases to offset the lost revenue from giving away free Windows upgrades Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>enjoy multibillion annual revenue streams from their respective app stores Offering a lower commission instead of the that Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>charges on app store sales could further encourage developers to make Windows versions of their topgrossing apps and games The other benefit of more app developers porting their games to the Windows platform is that it might just lead to more people buying Windows mobile phones Microsofts willingness to sell sub Lumia smartphones coupled with full compatibility with the millions of Android apps is a strong buy incentive for budgetconscious consumers The more people who use Windows devices and Microsoft mobile apps and services the bigger audience there is for Microsofts appinstall mobile advertising The Project Astoria SDK also allows easy replacement of Googles AdMob API inside Android apps with Microsofts Ads in Apps service Disclosure I amwe are long MSFT APPLKING ZNGA MoreI wrote this article myself and it
