trends and industry developments are working against both companies This article will quantify the effect of societal changes on the automotive industry For some reason I remember it well My parents loaded me and my siblings in their car for a ride to town I dutifully took my place in the back seat between my older sister and younger brother On the return trip while we were at a traffic light my father spotted a vehicle stopped in the opposite lane Look That car is made in Japan Theyre trying to sell them in the United States Its called a Toyota I leaned forward and followed the length of his arm as he pointed at the car It was white It was new and shiny It was small I was unimpressed Those cars wont sell I thought I would be getting my license soon and a car like that would not do No girl would want to date a guy with a little Japanese car Despite stellar results this year Ford NYSE F and General Motors NYSE GM two iconic American car companies seem doomed to trade in a narrow range Why ask shareholders dont the stocks increase in value It has been nearly two years since I wrote my last article on GM and Ford While I can understand the allure of an investment in Ford andor GM I will pass on both companies I am a man of limited means and it is my opinion better investments are available However GM and Ford fit my model for a very profitable trade The stock of each company is significantly underpriced The shortterm prospects of each company are good and Ford and GM both boast dividends north of three percent The dividends should help prop up the companies share price and attract dividend investors If the market pushes the stock below my entry point I can collect my dividends as I wait for the likely increase in the share price How did Ford and GM stock fare since the publication of that article F opened close GM opened close As you can see I got that one right But a broken clock gives good time twice a day and both Ford and GM have made great advances since that article hit Seeking Alpha A few highlights of Fords progress The FSeries pickup remained the bestselling vehicle in the US for the th straight year In the last two years Ford made huge strides shoring up the companys pension obligations Ford recorded the greatest pretax profit in its year history billion Ford reported a profit in Europe million for the first time in four years Profits in the Asia Pacific region at million are the highest ever representing an increase of percent Fords fullyear net income jumped to billion from billion in And as for GM The chart below doesnt say it all but it does speak volumes GM was No in sales in North America South America and China So with all of the gains made by these two companies why am I against investing in Ford and GM particularly when is expected to be another banner year One reason I hesitate to pull the trigger is the large levels of debt both companies hold particularly Ford Additionally both companies operate in highly competitive markets Other industries offer higher profit margins and better growth opportunities But more importantly as I conducted research for this article I found ominous headwinds facing both companies in the future Societal changes present serious problems for the automotive industry I have a side job as a strength and fitness coach for a local high school football team It seemed curious to me that many of my athletes dont have a drivers license and arent terribly interested in acquiring one I simply assumed my boys were a bit odduntil I read the following This Is a Big Problem for the Auto Industry and Its Getting Worse According to a study cited in the above article only percent of Americans held a drivers license in That represents a five percent drop since and a ten percent drop since Although all age groups recorded losses in relation to license holders in among the youngest cohort the losses were continuous without upturns in intervening years Fewer drivers licenses mean fewer car purchases In a recent study over a third of Generation Y consider modes of transportation other than personal cars as the preferred means of travel Nearly a third listed a combination of trains light rail buses carpooling car sharing ridesharing bicycling bike sharing and walking as common means of transportation Millennials now constitute the largest percentage of the US workforce AlixPartners a consulting firm estimates there are already fewer vehicles on the road because of car sharing AlixPartners projects million people will be sharing cars by As a consequence there will be million fewer cars on the road Among those studied stated car sharing resulted in avoiding the purchase or lease of a vehicle and anticipate they will not purchase an automobile in the future Other studies buttress those of AlixPartners A nationwide study conducted by researchers at the University of California estimated nine to thirteen vehicles were lost for every vehicle used in car sharing Study participants owned vehicles prior to joining a car sharing service Once car sharing clients joined the service ownership levels dropped to vehicles The consulting firm of Frost Sullivan provides estimates of fifteen lost vehicles for every car sharing vehicle in use Frost Sullivan also determined car sharing members drove less than when they owned a personal vehicle Frost Sullivan project car sharing membership will reach million in North America and million in Europe by Autonomous cars are coming sooner than most people think Thats right autonomous cars are arriving on US roads sooner than you might think Dont believe me Check out the following headlines and excerpts from recent articles Tesla battles <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>in race to get driverless cars on the road Elon Musk says company will produce selfdriving vehicles by Germanys Daimler AG and Japans Nissan have both said they hope to begin selling selfdriving cars by the end of the decade When asked about whether selfdriving cars would emerge by GM President Dan Ammann didnt hesitate with his answer Robot Taxis a joint venture between DeNA Co and ZMP Inc is hoping to start testing an autonomous car in Kanagawa from March that will be able to chauffeur tourists to and from the Olympic stadium in time for the opening ceremony Londons first driverless cars based on Heathrow pods The socalled UltraPods currently in service at Heathrow carry passengers between the car park and Terminal In the five years they have been in use they have carried million passengers and traveled million miles three million kilometres The Greenwich Automated Transport Environment project or Gateway will see seven driverless pods tested on the pavements around the Greenwich Peninsula where the O Arena is based from July It is important to note that selfdriving does not mean autonomous Selfdriving cars in will be able to accelerate brake and steer a cars course without input from the driver An autonomous car is defined as one in which the driver could be completely disengaged from a vehicle In fact the vehicle could move from one place to another without occupants Dont believe thats possible View this video to see a car that can park itself today not in the year Look here for a video of an autonomous vehicle negotiating a variety of common traffic conditions Here is an excerpt from an article in the MIT Technology Review Hidden Obstacles for Googles SelfDriving Cars <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>often leaves the impression that as a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>executive once wrote the cars can drive anywhere a car can legally drive However thats true only if intricate preparations have been made beforehand with the cars exact route including driveways extensively mapped Data from multiple passes by a special sensor vehicle must later be pored over meter by meter by both computers and humans Its vastly more effort than whats needed for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Maps Googles cars are better at handling some mapping omissions than others If a new stop light appeared overnight for example the car wouldnt know to obey it However the car would slow down or stop if its onboard sensors detected any traffic or obstacles in its path Among other unsolved problems <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has yet to drive in snow and Urmson says safety concerns preclude testing during heavy rains Nor has it tackled big open parking lots or multilevel garages The cars video cameras detect the color of a traffic light Urmson said his team is still working to prevent them from being blinded when the sun is directly behind a light Despite progress handling road crews I could construct a construction zone that could befuddle the car Urmson says Pedestrians are detected simply as moving columnshaped blurs of pixelsmeaning Urmson agrees that the car wouldnt be able to spot a police officer at the side of the road frantically waving for traffic to stop The cars sensors cant tell if a road obstacle is a rock or a crumpled piece of paper so the car will try to drive around either Urmson also says the car cant detect potholes or spot an uncovered manhole if it isnt coned off The introduction to this article was more than a pathetic attempt by this author to wax poetic If you are my age you can remember a time when cars were without seat belts and the only vehicles on the road were made in America Think of what happened to Ford and GM with the introduction of Toyotas NYSE TM into the American market Big changes right Now think of what autonomous cars can bring It is my personal perspective that selfdriving cars will result in not only a rapid acceptance of the concept of autonomous cars but will accelerate demand for autonomous vehicles Once autonomous cars are on the road I contend that car manufacturers are doomed Imagine a future in which a company like Uber brings a vehicle to your doorstep summoned by your smartphone Need a quick ride to the mall A little inexpensive twoseater will show up at your doorstep Want to haul that old couch to the dump A longbed truck backs into your driveway Wish to drive across country with the family A plush car with plenty of windows and an interior embedded with entertainment devices is at your disposal Under those conditions will you really want to make payments on a personal vehicle Need a ride to work The car you use for your morning commute may be the same vehicle your nightshift employed neighbor uses to wheel to work In other words fewer cars will be needed And the car manufacturers They will sell the bulk of their vehicles to large companies with enormous fleets Ever look at the margins Ford and GM get from rental companies Thats the future of the automobile industry Im not claiming this will happen overnight but Ill be drawing Social Security in a few years and the odds are that Ill live long enough to see the scenario I described Obviously that doesnt mean my hand is posed over my computer keyboard awaiting tomorrows market opening to dump my shares in Ford To the contrary I make it a practice to monitor solid high yield companies with rangebound shares Ford and GM fit that description I purchased shares of Ford recently and I fully expect to sell them for a profit before years end I hope to trade in and out of Ford and GM on numerous occasions over the next decade or two But invest long term Sorry no An aside only kinda sorta related to this article I have a passion for investing and that means I spend a great deal of time reading and writing investment articles Unfortunately the nature of investing means the pieces can sometimes be dull Even the most avid investor may need a respite from Ks and earnings transcripts With that in mind I leave you with ten quotes concerning cars The problem with the designated driver program its not a desirable job but if you ever get sucked into doing it have fun with it At the end of the night drop them off at the wrong house A light on my cars dashboard came on and instead of fixing the problem I waited for the bulb to burn out Crisis solved Life is more than great sex and a nice car Men may or may not be better drivers than women but they seem to die more often trying to prove that they are I said Id drive to her place But she lives in her car so I dont see why she couldnt just drive her place to my place If all the cars in the United States were placed end to end it would probably be Labor Day
