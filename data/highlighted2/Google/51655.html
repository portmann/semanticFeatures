class='textDiv'>Apples Search Opportunity Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Apple has developed a critical element of a full fledged web search engine Apple may gradually develop a search capability to rival <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Recent reports that Apple NASDAQ AAPL is expanding its web search capability point to a significant opportunity for Apple to reinvent the search experience for its customers Not needing the revenue stream Apple could provide ad free searches This would deny competitors such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL a significant revenue stream that draws on the wealth of the iOS ecosystem Lately weve been hearing more details about Applebot Apples inhouse web crawler Bots such as Googlebot and Applebot play a crucial role in search engines Bots crawl or visit numerous web pages cataloging their contents into the search engines database When you submit a search term to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>or Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Bing what is actually searched is the database constructed by the bots rather than the web itself This is the trick behind fast web searches That Apple even had its own bot was only discovered last November Since then more pieces of the puzzle have fallen into place Apples purchase of Topsy the social media analytics firm in now appears to have been geared towards bolstering Apples search capability Apple currently offers limited web search capability through Spotlight in OS X and iOS but Spotlight is mainly geared towards helping users find files on their devices With the latest version Spotlight now offers suggestions that can include web pages This doesnt make Spotlight in any way a viable competitor to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>or even Bing but it does indicate that this is an active area of interest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is currently the default search engine for Apples Safari in both the Mac OS and iOS versions This is due to expire this year leaving the door open for an Apple solution Apple also appears to be on something of a hiring binge for software engineers to work on search But if Apple is still trying to fill positions for its search team this suggests that the work isnt far enough along to slam the door on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>I would not expect Apples search capability to be the equal of Googles any time soon so Googles contract will probably be renewed in some form This is not about kicking <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>to the curb this year or even the next This would be a longterm strategic move by Apple that might take something like five years to pay off Doing search well is a huge undertaking requiring massive resources and manpower After all Microsoft has been at it for years and what do they have to show for it A search share in the US and a search engine that is still inferior to Googles The very magnitude of the undertaking makes it appropriate for Apple Apple has the cash to add server infrastructure as needed and with the recent announcements of new data centers in Europe can take advantage of some of its offshore cash Apple also has a motivation that goes beyond the revenue stream For years Googles search and advertising empire has profited from the iOS ecosystem perhaps even more than from Android <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>recently revealed that in the US Japan and in other countries mobile devices account for more than half of all searches <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has never specified how much revenue was derived from the respective mobile device ecosystems but for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>its all good It all gets thrown onto the cash pile that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>then uses for things like the Motorola purchase and Android development That Apple is in effect subsidizing Googles competitive ventures must rankle just a little With search Apple has the opportunity to do something that is often the focus of its product development fundamentally improve the user experience What better way to improve the search experience than to ditch advertising Im sure there are some who will claim that paid product placement in search results enhances the search experience Perhaps but my view is that advertising is just one of the aspects of our mobile life that weve become so desensitized to that we dont realize how obnoxious it is At least we dont realize it until its absent Apple is in a position that it doesnt need the advertising revenue Search can become just another value added service of the Apple ecosystems helping to improve user experience and user retention Apple has for some time adopted the model that ecosystem support costs in terms of services and software upgrades are paid up front in the purchase price of Apples hardware products Search fits right into this At Apples World Wide Developer Conference in June Apple has promised many exciting new iOS and Mac OS technologies Okay it always promises that But one of those could very well be an enhanced Spotlight search capability One of the important ways Spotlight could be enhanced is if Spotlight APIs are made available to iOS developers Spotlight APIs allow Mac OS X apps to access spotlight search and to make the apps files searchable from Spotlight No equivalent APIs exist for iOS apps Partly this is because Apple has deliberately discouraged app developers from involving users in file management With iOS that started to change and Spotlight search is a feature of iOS Its starting to look likely that Apple will roll out a new enhanced Spotlight with a suite of APIs for iOS at WWDC If Apple does that at WWDC it means it really is going after search And if Apple goes after search it will do it in a way that makes it fundamentally better I look for Bing which has always been the weak sister of search to be the first major casualty But even <span
