One of the best performing sectors this year has been technology and online retail giant Amazon NASDAQ AMZN which has seen its shares more than double On Monday shares hit another new high mainly due to growing enthusiasm around AWS However shares seem like they are peaking in the near term and this years gains are not going to be repeated in The latest leg up came after a strong Q report highlighted by the tremendous growth in Amazon Web Services Investors cheered the segments yearoveryear revenue growth along with its operating margin that nearly tripled the year ago periods value The Q beat and decent guidance has analyst estimates on the rise However investors should realize that revenue and EPS estimates for are actually below where they were going into the Q report while shares have more than doubled since then Im a little concerned that the stocks rally has gotten ahead of itself as I dont know if AWS will be able to meet fast rising expectations in Last week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL made a key cloud hire adding former VMWare NYSE VMW CEO Diane Greene to lead the firms cloud operations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>also is acquiring another firm that Greene founded Bebop a developer platform for enterprise software My concern is that investors will lose interest in AWS when growth rates in start to slow and profitability gains come to a crawl The last two quarters have seen yearoveryear revenue growth of and respectively numbers that will be hard to match next year as prior period values start to rise significantly Over the past year AWS operating margin went from to and gains of that size will be hard to replicate If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>turns out to be a large competitor in this fastgrowing space Amazon might even see margins contract as it is forced to cut prices to remain competitive Another item that worries me and this is not Amazon specific is the continued rise in the US Dollar as many are anticipating a rate hike from the Federal Reserve in December Since the Q report as seen in the chart below the Dollar Currency Index has risen by more than three percent This worries me because the international business represented onethird of Amazons Q sales Analysts are currently about million above the midpoint of company Q revenue guidance which worries me given the dollars strength On a related note investors have started to send interest rates higher and they could go up even more if we get that hike from the Fed While Amazons sales were up in Q over the prior year period interest expenses soared from million to million This worries me because Amazons trailing month debt liabilities to assets ratio continues to rise seen below If the balance sheet worsens Amazon will need to take on more debt or potentially raise equity Either situation is bad because interest costs will reduce net income or dilution will hurt EPS making it hard to Amazon to triple EPS in as analysts are expecting The final thing that worries me is that the stock itself has become a bit overextended As seen in the chart below Amazon shares are nearly above their day moving average I added arrows to show what happens when the stock gets too far above this key technical level and the past three times it has meant a flat stock for months There is a potential short opportunity here for investors who believe the stock has peaked because a pullback to the rising day isnt out of the question Amazon shares hit a new high on Monday but Im worried that the stock has peaked in the short term AWS enthusiasm seems to be spreading like wildfire but what happens when growth rates naturally slow and competitors like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>start to strengthen Analyst estimates are actually below where they were going into the Q report and the stock still trades for times expected next years earnings which assumes they triple On the technical front the stock is way ahead of its day moving average which has led to months of stagnation in the past I believe investors have an opportunity here to fade the rally with a short opportunity existing until the stock trades down to that key technical level We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more
