when Twitter NYSE TWTR CEO Dick Costolo announced he was stepping down from his position Twitter has struggled to grow its user base compared to expectations and the company took down its yearly guidance at its Q report In this article I discuss another tech company that could see a CEO shakeup in the next year and thats Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO Shares are at their lowest point this year and if the Alibaba NYSE BABA spinoff gets knocked down by the IRS I believe a continuation of poor results will send Marissa Mayer packing In the past Ive discussed Yahoos search gains thanks to its Firefox deal However those gains have turned out to be shortlived with Yahoo in a comparable position now as compared to a year ago I looked at data from StatCounter regarding Yahoos monthly search share for desktop tablet and mobile platforms The chart below shows monthly figures going back to June Yahoos share topped out at in January of this year but it has been all downhill since So far this month Yahoos share stands at which is only just above the value from June Despite the Firefox deal things really are not improving Yahoo has made some questionable moves lately the latest of which was reportedly giving a huge raise to Katie Couric Im not convinced in the companys strategy going forward especially considering the NFL deal that I believe is a mistake Yahoos core business is struggling right now with revenues expected to decline by this year NonGAAP earnings per share are expected to be cut in half and estimates continue to drop as seen below About a year ago analysts were looking for almost in nonGAAP EPS this year Marissa Mayer has been one of the main beneficiaries of Yahoos stake in Alibaba Yahoos stake in the Chinese giant is a main reason for the explosive gains in shares of Yahoo since Mayer took over and also for a chunk of the buyback program The key to the Alibaba holding is disposing of it in the most tax efficient manner and Yahoo has proposed a taxfree spinoff for later this year Unfortunately there are some doubts that the IRS will approve Yahoos proposed transaction This could be a disaster for Yahoo because a taxfree spinoff could save about billion One analyst from Capstone states that a tax code change could hurt Yahoo by a share more than a quarter of the stocks current value If the Alibaba spinoff does not go through as planned taxfree you can bet the pressure on Marissa Mayer will ratchet up tremendously Yahoo shares have not done well in In fact they are off their week high and they closed Friday at their lowest point since October Part of the stocks fall is due to Alibaba coming down from its high but the rest is because of the items Ive detailed above Yahoos market cap is down to billion so a further decline could make it enticing for a large activist investor to come in and shake things up Investors are obviously getting more worried about Yahoo at this point As you will see in the chart below short interest in the name is up more than in the past month and a half On the flip side Alibaba short interest is decreasing at this point showing which name investors have more faith in going forward Yahoo short interest is currently at its highest point since November Mayer took over Yahoo during the summer of That year the company reported revenues exTAC of billion Weve seen two straight years where the topline number declined with last year coming in at billion This year analysts believe the company will struggle to bring in billion in exTAC revenues In a time when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Twitter Facebook NASDAQ FB and others are showing strong revenue growth Yahoo cant even report flat revenues Thats a problem and this year nonGAAP EPS are also expected to plunge If Twitters CEO cant satisfy when he basically doubled revenue growth in a year and a half why should Mayer get a pass when revenues are going the wrong way Next month Mayer will hit her year anniversary as CEO of Yahoo Is the company in a better place now than it was when she took over I would argue no Sure shares have jumped during her time at the top but that is basically due to the success of Alibaba A failed taxfree spinoff of Yahoos Alibaba stake may be the last straw If Yahoos core business continues to stagnate I wouldnt be surprised
