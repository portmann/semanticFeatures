FRANKFURTSAN FRANCISCO BMW BMWGDE and Apple AAPLO may rekindle a courtship put on hold after an exploratory visit by executives of the worlds top maker of electronic gadgets to the headquarters of the words biggest seller of premium cars Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook went to BMWs headquarters last year and senior Apple executives toured the carmakers Leipzig factory to learn how it manufactures the i electric car two sources familiar with the talks told Reuters The dialogue ended without conclusion because Apple appears to want to explore developing a passenger car on its own one of the sources said Also BMW is being cautious about sharing its manufacturing knowhow because it wants to avoid becoming a mere supplier to a software or internet giant During the visit Apple executives asked BMW board members detailed questions about tooling and production and BMW executives signaled readiness to license parts one of the sources said News of the Leipzig visit first emerged in Germanys ManagerMagazin last week Apple executives were impressed with the fact that we abandoned traditional approaches to car making and started afresh It chimed with the way they do things too a senior BMW source said The carmaker says there are currently no talks with Apple about jointly developing a passenger car and Apple declined to comment However one of the sources said exploratory talks between senior managers may be revived at a later stage It is too early to say whether this will be a replay of Silicon Valleys Prometheus moment The day in when Apple cofounder Steve Jobs visited Xeroxs Palo Alto Research Center where the first mousedriven graphical user interface and bitmapped graphics were created and walked out with crucial ideas to launch the Macintosh computer five years later BMW has realized nextgeneration vehicles cannot be built without more input from telecoms and software experts and Apple has been studying how to make a selfdriving electric car as it seeks new market opportunities beyond phones Since the visit there has been a reshuffle at the top of BMW with Harald Krueger appointed BMW Chief Executive in May in favor of establishing his own team and his plans for BMW by year end before engaging in new projects a person familiar with his thinking told Reuters A further complication was the departure of BMWs board member for development Herbert Diess who played a leading role in initial discussions with Apple He defected to Volkswagen VOWG_pDE in December Diess who declined to comment for this piece oversaw the development of BMWs i vehicles which are built using light weight carbon fiber using a radical approach to design and manufacturing Car technology has become a prime area of interest for Silicon Valley companies ranging from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Inc GOOGLO which has built a prototype selfdriving car to electric carmaker Tesla Motors Inc TSLAO Diess has said the German auto industry needs to undergo radical change because consumers are demanding more intelligent cars and antipollution rules mean the next generation vehicles will increasingly be low emission electric and hybrid variants In only two generations of new cars away in auto manufacturing time scales only a third of vehicles will be powered by a conventional combustion engine alone experts predict It means that in two cycles we will shut down two thirds of our engine manufacturing Diess told a panel discussion in July last year adding that the value chain for new electric cars is already shifting with vehicle batteries made mainly in Asia The second part is that the car will become intelligent part of the Internet Diess continued And the strong players in this area are in the United States in the software development area We will surely need to find alliances in this field Germany has two years to prove that it can hold its own against new entrants when it comes to shaping the future of luxury vehicles Diess said Carmakers including BMW have already developed next generation selfdriving cars vehicles which need permanent software updates in the form of highdefinition maps allowing a car to recalculate a route if it learns about an accident ahead The technology is moving ahead faster than the legal and regulatory rules which would allow largescale commercial availability Earlier this year BMWs new RD chief Klaus Froehlich said his company and Apple had much in common including a focus on premium branding an emphasis on evolving products and a sense of aesthetically pleasing design Asked in general terms whether a deeper collaboration beyond integration of products like the iPhone would make sense Froehlich initially said BMW would not consider any deal that forces it to open up its core knowhow to outsiders We do not collaborate to open our eco systemsbut we find ways because we respect each other Froehlich told Reuters BMW will keep in mind the needs of the customer and what the companys core strengths are when it considers the merits of entering any strategic collaboration Froehlich added PeterSchwarzenbauer BMWs management board member in charge of the Mini brand as well as digital services declined to comment on possible talks with Apple in an interview earlier this year But he said Two worlds are colliding here Our world focused on hardware and our experience in making complex products and the world of information technology which is intruding more and more into our life The winners will be those companies that understand how to build intelligent hardware he said adding it made sense for carmakers and tech firms to cooperate more closely We need to get away from the idea that it will be either us or them We cannot offer clients the perfect experience without help from one of these technology companiesSchwarzenbauersaid That dialogue is well underway he stressed With billion in cash Apple has the resources to enter the automotive market on its own said Eric Noble president of the Car Lab a consulting firm in Orange Calif The tech giant would have an edge on the dashboard its CarPlay infotainment system connecting iPhones to cars but would be at square one with the rest of the car Noble said If Apple decided to sell a car it could make sense to find a partner to help with industrial scale production retail and repair since demand for such a vehicle could be high There are no estimates for potential Apple car sales but the brand and its products command a loyal following So if only percent of Apples annual iPhone customers decided to order a car it would need to make million vehicles Thats more than the vehicles Jaguar and Land Rover produced last year Even BMW Group which made just over million cars last year
