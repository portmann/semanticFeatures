Dividend Portfolio Increasing My Verizon Stake Verizon Communications NYSEVZ Seeking Alpha Verizon has proved to be a consistent solid performer over an extended period of time delivering good investor returns I will be using Verizon as a dividend anchor in my portfolio given its solid yield above the average for my portfolio Verizons market position and customer base provides the company with a strong moat in the telecommunications industry in my opinion I am developing a passive income stream from dividends to generate financial independence Im proceeding down the path of steadily accumulating a set of highquality dividend paying stocks My strategy is to accumulate a basket of wide moat dividend stocks quarterly Verizon NYSE VZ is one of the businesses in my dividend portfolio that I am accumulating Verizon is one of the largest telecommunication providers in the US primarily providing fixed line and wireless telephony services to residential and commercial establishments Verizon has a market capitalization of B with revenues of B and a gross margin in excess of Verizon generates a net income of almost B Verizon currently trades at a forward PE of and offers a dividend yield of close to In brief I am primarily looking for companies that have dominant moats and strong returns on equity greater than Im also looking for a track record of dividend increases and an average dividend yield of A full explanation for my filtering criterion for my portfolio can be found here Verizons wide moat stems from its dominant scale in the US telecommunications industry Given the considerable fixed cost required to provide telephony service to subscribers providers with dominant share are able to amortize cost of service across many subscribers delivering service at lowest unit cost Verizon derives a return on equity of close to well above my minimum requirement for inclusion in my dividend portfolio Verizons dividend has for the most part shown consistent increases over the last years satisfying my need for dividend growth consistency The dividend yield comfortably exceeds my minimum threshold for inclusion In fact the yield is so generous that Verizon is an anchor position in my dividend portfolio The company thus met my criteria for inclusion with my Dividend Accumulation portfolio Consistent performer with good operating history Verizon has been in business since though its originating businesses have been in operation from many years prior The operating performance of the company has been quite strong over a consistently long period of time Verizon has increased revenues from B in to over B in representing an annualized growth of close to During this same period operating income has increased from B to almost B an annualized growth rate of almost Verizons total return performance over the last years has been reasonable and on par with the SP An investor who invested in the SP years ago would have returned close to The same investor in Verizon would have returned almost over the same time period Verizons moat is protected by high barriers to entry The barriers to entry for new wireless providers are fairly substantial In addition to the regulatory hurdles of becoming a telecom provider operators require access to expensive spectrum to operate a network typically at a cost of billions of dollars In addition the provision of wireless service directtoconsumer requires significant marketing branding and investment in customer care and postsales support Any new carrier would require significant capital to set up operations and provide ongoing operational support There has been much talk and speculation about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Facebooks NASDAQ FB possible entry into the telecommunications market Facebook has been experimenting with free wifi for sometime now in local cafes in San Francisco Facebook has also been active in exploring the use of highaltitude satellites to deliver cheap internet connectivity to developing economies and its recent purchase of Ascenta is a step in that direction <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has also been active in exploring the use of cheap forms of connectivity to reach users <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has been active in exploring wifi balloons to deliver lowcost internet access to remote areas Finally like Facebook <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has also been active in considering promising satellite technology to deliver on the potential of cheap universal internet access <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>recently purchased Titan Aerospace to further its ambitions in satellite technology Additionally the drones and satellite technology are currently focused on the delivery of cheap connectivity for the developing world rather than in North America I dont realistically believe that either <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>or Facebook will be able to effectively replace Verizon as a primary provider of mobile connectivity and data access For one the reliability of a mesh network comprised of different types of coverage such as wifi or satellites and wifi balloons is fairly questionable While users may be able to get sporadic connectivity from these services while mobile its unlikely to be significant enough to be a complete replacement for mobile connectivity provided by ATT NYSE T or other carriers Even if these technologies actually prove viable and commercially sound both Facebook and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>will in turn have to operationalize service for consumers if they choose to go this route That means proper pricing plans customer service and a host of other supporting actions I also dont believe that Verizon or ATT have much to fear from Googles recently announced MVNO efforts It appears that Googles new wireless service would primarily leverage a range of wifi hotspots with a fall back to cellular connectivity where suitable wifi is not available While such a service will likely work without significant limitations when a user is stationary it is likely to be fairly choppy when mobile Assuming Googles ultimate play is to push more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>services and generate more mobile advertising revenue its highly likely that the scope of devices that will be offered by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>will be those that help maximize <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>advertising revenue meaning that nonAndroid devices wont be featured This could put some natural limitations on the attractiveness of a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>wireless service If Googles past efforts with a direct to consumer service are any indication its wireless service will likely have significant bumps in the road Googles attempt to sell its Nexus range of devices direct to consumers demonstrated a serious underappreciation of the core competencies involved in direct to consumer sales and support While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>can build up these competencies over time it will need the ability to do this well at scale and with national presence to be a real direct threat to ATT and Verizon anytime soon Much has been made of pricing pressures in the wireless industry with aggressive promotions and deep discounting This is not sustainable and should peter out over the next months Of note was that Verizon indicated that wireless EBITDA margins should at least be consistent with fullyear margins or around which suggests that Verizon expects pricing stability in What was also interesting was to note the recent Deutsche Telekoms comments about TMobiles NYSE TMUS pricing approach not being sustainable long term given a need to invest billions yearly just with no nearterm prospect of sustained free cash flow This is suggestive of TMobiles owner rapidly losing patience with such an aggressive pricing strategy with no nearterm return prospects Neither Sprint NYSE S nor TMobile is likely to have sufficient capacity in the tank to keep aggressive pricing measures in play for a sustained period of time Sprint has not been able to generate meaningful free cash flow since and continues to lose subscribers It is also faced with network upgrades that will occur over the next few years that will see cash flow bleed further TMobiles aggressive pricing and subsidization of early termination fees has only had the effect of reducing the companys already marginal free cash flow TMobile incurred large deficits in free cash flow in with also displaying a similar pattern This is suggestive of the fact that neither Sprint nor TMobile will be able to keep discounting for a significant period while still investing to make necessary capital upgrades Current penetration of US wireless connections is in excess of meaning that most households have greater than one device per member in the household That places a natural limit on the extent of growth companies such as ATT and Verizon can continue to enjoy in the absence of connecting additional devices Verizon has been making particularly good progress in driving machinetomachine connections which include such things as wirelessenabling vending machines tablets watches and wireless connected cars Estimates indicate that Verizon likely has about M machinetomachine connections The progress Verizon is making in adding more connected devices is apparent in Verizons quarterly results with connected device growth increasing to connections per account at the end of a growth of from the connections per account at the end of Why did I pick Verizon for longterm accumulation The natural question arises as to why Ive picked Verizon for longterm accumulation Lets face it Verizon isnt likely to increase its earnings or dividends much beyond the steady per year that it has managed for much of the last decade However the fact that the company is a stable high yielder with a well protected dividend stream has great attraction for me and offers a few benefits Verizon provides immediate guaranteed return Highyielding dividend stocks provide you with cash in the bank today They provide a real return and less of a promise of speculative return through capital growth which essentially is the case with low yielding or moderate yielding stocks The advantage to investors of a higheryielding stock is they dont need to make bets on capital growth They dont need to pick which stocks will experience strong capital returns and how quickly such stocks will be rewarded by the market Verizon provides a nice shield against volatility The company has a beta of only meaning it moves approximately half as much in price as a general move in the market Thus when the market takes a precipitous dip Verizon doesnt dip as much in general The inclusion of stocks like Verizon means I can also afford to have companies like Visa NYSE V and Mastercard NYSE MA in my dividend portfolio and still achieve reasonable dividend income today while I wait for those stocks to achieve dividend growth status over time It helps effectively underwrite the capital growth that these companies provide me even though their dividend income remains low today VZ is a key lynch pin of my dividend growth strategy and I find there is much to like with the company A market leading position stable dividend growth and solid yield help contribute to reasonable dividend income today and help me invest in the dividend growth stars of tomorrow Given Ill likely need my portfolio to produce dividend income to support me for as much as the next years this is something thats vitally important to me Im backing my conviction in Verizon to the hilt with ongoing regular accumulation I currently have a stake in Verizon and Im supplementing this with steady regular quarterly accumulation I feel that Verizon remains fairly priced and offers reasonable value here Morningstar rates the stock at stars while SP also rates it stars I most recently purchased VZ at share toward the end of March Source My Dividend Portfolio Increasing My Verizon Stake
