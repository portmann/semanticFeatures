and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>are further ahead on Windows solves a lot of those problems Microsoft managements attitude to embrace competition rather than fight it combined with a great release in Windows will help the company in the long run If theres been one area where Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT has been having its lunch eaten by Apple NASDAQ AAPL and <span

operating systems that are seamless between PC and phone both of which with decent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>to great Apple aesthetics Aesthetics This was the challenge that the company tried to address with Windows Instead it alienated its users especially those who found Windows to finally be a nice upgrade Jokes were made about how Microsoft gets it right only every OTHER operating system Those jokes may have actually held true once again as its basically unanimous that Microsoft has produced a fantastic release with Windows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Windows Reviews and read through some of the results from heavyweights like Engadget CNet and others This is bullish for the company and it came from the forward thinking at the company to begin with The new management at Microsoft realizes the dramatic shift in the OS market Apple is steadily gaining market share but still has plenty of room to go and theyre embracing the change by innovating their own product Let your game do the talking they say The open source days are upon us and we really agree with Microsofts decision to release the OS for free We thought this was a spectacular decision Like with business when you have something good to show off you want to talk about it and show it off Getting Windows out for free works with that logic We think Microsoft knew how good Windows was going to be and that it was a wise choice releasing it to the masses for free If you recall The quote from the OS Chief was we think of Windows as a service This decision making conveniently comes a couple quarters after Apple made a similar move when it launched its Mavericks operating system to the public What does Windows mean for Microsoft Based on reviews weve read we think it will slow the bleed in OS market share to other companies It will give PC users a nice reminder that Microsoft can also focus on the GUI side of an operating system Itll help gain market share with video game users and mobile users with versions for Xbox and mobile Semiconductor stocks like Micron NASDAQ MU that rely on PC sales could see a bump in sales Accessory makers like Hewlett Packard NYSE HPQ could get a bump not just from PC sales but from accessory sales as well We had previously written about the age of Windows here We saw this coming change when we said This is all a part of the bigger evolution picture for Microsoft A new browser in a new operating system is a move in the right direction We cant wait to see Windows mostly just to get rid of Windows In an earlier piece we wrote about why Windows failed to impress consumers and how the tile format of the OS works best on tablets only We critiqued that the company should focus more on a Windows like environment for those using their desktops when they produce the next version of Windows which is now considered long overdue Its now looking like Windows will combine both Windows and elements with a fresh new browser To reiterate what weve said in the past we think a continued successful launch of Windows could do big things for those invested in Microsoft The synergy between Windows and Xbox could help create a better all around user experience for those with more than one Microsoft product in their lives This all plays into the ecosystem picture and now that Microsoft has an operating system in favor with its users we see Windows as potentially being a key that will unlock doors for Microsoft in the quarters ahead As weve said in the past we think MSFT could be a nice addition to any longterm focused dividend portfolio especially with Windows as a tailwind The companys modest x forward PE and impeccable balance sheet billion cash vs billion debt make it a solid foundational piece for any large cap portfolio We think the companys cash position lends itself to MSFT continuing to strategically deploy capital to its shareholders in addition to the companys forward yield of
