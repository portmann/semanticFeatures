appbased payment service This is despite the retail giant having experienced firsthand the shortcomings and ultimate failure of another payment app the now defunct CurrentC Given the distribution of power in mobile payments it is more likely for Apple Pay to be accepted at WalMart than WalMart Pays success Apple Pay is off to a slow start but Apple is in a solid position to remove existing friction points and add further innovation and value to the service WalMart NYSE WMT remains one of the few large retailers in the US opposed to adopting Apple Pay Apples NASDAQ AAPL payment service for the mobile and digital era Instead WalMart has just completed its nationwide rollout of WalMart Pay the companys own appbased payment solution This is despite the retail giant having experienced firsthand the shortcomings and ultimate failure of another payment app the now defunct CurrentC created by the association of merchants including WalMart Best Buy NYSE BBY CVS NYSE CVS and Target NYSE TGT Best Buy has since adopted Apple Pay CVS is reported to be testing it while Target is open to introducing the service in the future Will WalMart eventually follow suit Given the distribution of power in mobile payments I think it is more likely than WalMart Pays success WalMart Pay faces two significant problems Poor value proposition To say that WalMart Pay is less convenient than a credit card is an understatement Just consider all the hoops that the company asks its customers to jump through to make a payment with WalMart Pay Of course such an experience does not compare well to Apple Pays more streamlined process of simply holding your iPhone near the contactless reader even if the phones screen is turned off With the Apple Watch you dont then even have to search for your device No control over key technology Another problem for WalMart is that its apps inconvenience cannot be solved Just like CurrentC WalMart does not control the key technology in mobile payments the mobile OS That makes Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL the most powerful players in the field as they control the two entrenched mobile ecosystems and can restrict others to more inconvenient appbased payment solutions Apple then takes things one step further and blocks thirdparty apps from using the iPhones NFC chip The very fact that WalMart has to rely on clunky QR codes to push its payment service tells you everything you need to know about the amount of power it holds in mobile payments and the prospects of WalMart Pay Where does this leave Apple Pay In her SA article Sarah Ji explores several workarounds which she argues could help Apple compete with WalMart Pay However I think Apples actual strategy is much more simple There is no doubt that Apple Pay is off to a difficult start A consumer survey from a fellow SA contributor Karen Webster shows the payment services considerable adoption and usage problems This should probably not come as a surprise given the large number of friction points in the Apple Pay experience and existing strong payment habits However I think Apple is in a solid position to improve Apple Pays value to the point where the service trumps credit cards convenience Apple can rely on the following Strong foundation Apple holds a significant amount of power in mobile payments thanks to controlling iOS as a major mobile ecosystem This allows the company to relegate competitors to inferior appbased solutions while Apple gains time to remove friction points in Apple Pays experience and add further innovation and value Apple Watch Apple has a good chance to gain even more power in mobile payments If reaching for the smartphone can be no more convenient than searching for the wallet then using Apple Pay on the Apple Watch is decidedly the easiest way to make a payment Given its unique positioning at the intersection of technology and liberal arts Apple has the potential to run away with the smartwatch market the same way it did with the iPod and gain further power in mobile payments Many underestimate the Apple Watch and Apple Pay Dont underestimate their combination Improving infrastructure The Apple Pay experience is full of friction points which impact the user experience and consequently adoption and usage Nonparticipating banks and retailers nonsupported store credit cards and reward cards ATM withdrawals with just one bank However the convenience gap between the credit card and Apple Pay ecosystem is constantly shrinking as Apple adds new partners use cases and benefits Expect more innovation from the Cupertino company as to how we shop pay and handle money Apple Pay currently trumps the credit card in security and privacy Once it will also match and exceed its convenience we will then get to an inflection point in the services adoption and usage Both WalMart and Apple want to control the customer experience on their properties Unfortunately for WalMart when it comes to mobile payments the power is in Apples favor Those who own the mobile ecosystem control the mobile payment experience This is painfully visible in the poor value proposition of WalMart Pay WalMart merely controls the access to its payment terminals the commodity part in mobile payments Note that even as part of the powerful association of retailers MCX accounting for trillion in annual sales WalMart could not get traction for CurrentC and stop Apple Pay from increasing merchant support Given the distribution of power in mobile payments it is therefore more likely for Apple Pay to be accepted at WalMart than WalMart Pays success Apple is in a solid position to further improve the Apple Pay experience and move the service toward an inflection point in adoption and usage While this would not have a significant impact on the companys revenue Apple would further strengthen its ecosystem brand and relevance in todays world Authors
