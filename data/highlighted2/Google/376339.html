class='textDiv'>The Invisible Platform Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Its not difficult to imagine a time when smartphones are relegated to being more specialized devices for specific tasks in the same way PCs fell into that more specialized role Sometimes its the things hidden in plain sight that have the biggest impact in the long run That may be true with the Amazon Echo Most visions of the future imagine technology that blends into our lives gives us immediate access to all the worlds information and helps make our lives easier And so it may be with voicecontrolled devices in our homes such as Amazons NASDAQ AMZN Echo After an awkward start the Echo has morphed into the new tech darling receiving heaps of praise from both the tech industry and normal consumers for its ability to easily and intuitively bring control to our digital devices and services The success of the product has even inspired new members of the Echo family the Echo Dot designed to be used with existing speakers and the Amazon Tap a smaller portable version of the Echo both of which are just being released At first glance the Echos capabilities seem somewhat interesting to people However only when you start to dig into what the device actually is and how it works do you begin to truly understand not only its brilliance but its potential to completely disrupt traditional mobile platforms and app models Technologists will tell you that the Echo is a frontend for Amazons Alexa a cloudbased voicedriven service that runs on Amazons own AWS Amazon Web Services infrastructure Alexa takes spoken commands sends them to the web converts them into digital commands and sends them back to the device The device then turns those commands into discrete actions such as playing a song from a particular web service turning on a light in your living room or receiving an answer to a query Fair enough But what really matters is that beneath the faade of this slick new home automation device lies a remarkably clever and new type of platform an invisible one The Echo and its siblings have absolutely no screens the primary means by which you interact with the device is your voice Yes it has a remote but its designed as a secondary input device That means theres no dependence or reliance on any kind of visual cues Everything happens through your voice making the technology essentially imperceptible In fact its arguably one of the best examples of invisible technology to date In addition theres no traditional operating system running on Echo Instead there seems to be some type of basic RTOS realtime operating system that merely serves as an onramp to the cloudbased Alexa voice services which are the real engine for the Echo and its siblings This lack of a traditional OS does not mean that the device is limited however You can add on capabilities through what it calls skills essentially a new type of application that runs on Alexa Skills arent big fancy functionfilled screens of software just simple directives to do certain specific things or retrieve certain bits of information when you request them From a usage perspective if you compare the voicedriven model of something like Echo to todays smartphones and other mobile devices like smart watches the differences become glaring Instead of just speaking a command you need to find the right application on your smartphones display launch it and select a command inside the app all while focusing exclusively on the screen and needing to physically touch the device Yes most mobile OSs have started to add voicebased assistant features that are arguably similar to Alexa and its fast handsfree means of interaction However they are still clearly secondary input methods on todays mobile devices not primary ones and that distinction is extremely important Given the inherently visual nature of human beings its hard to imagine voice ever becoming a primary means of interaction on any device with a screen we cant help but want to look Its also important to point out that you cant do everything on an Echo that you can do on a smartphone Nevertheless you can do a lot of the most common and most important things As a result its not difficult to imagine a time in the nottoodistant future when smartphones get relegated to being more specialized devices for specific tasks in the same way that PCs fell into that more specialized role with the growing importance of smartphones Just as PCs have not gone away neither will smartphones of course but they will likely slip a tier or two in the pantheon of our digital device universe The implications on the world of thirdparty apps are equally profound Theres likely little need for more than a few hundred or perhaps a few thousand skills to be added to a voicebased system and the means for monetizing those skills are few to none Skills are likely to be created as enablers for other connected devices or services instead of being seen as an end unto themselves as most mobile apps currently are Perhaps this is just as well because the current mobile app store ecosystem is clearly faltering under its own size and weight and seems ready to implode at any moment To Amazons credit they recognize the platform potential of Alexa and are actively encouraging other device makers to use Alexa in their own hardware designs and to create addon skills This could allow Amazon to do an endrun around the existing ecosystem players such as Apple NASDAQ AAPL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and place it at the forefront of voicebased computing Most visions of the future imagine technology that seamlessly blends into our lives gives us immediate access to all the worlds information and helps make our lives easier While the Amazon Echo family of devices may not completely fulfill all these requirements its one of the clearest indicators of where personal technology is
