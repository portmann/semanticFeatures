out of It will leverage the million mobile app developers to offer other businesses the expertise and creativity it never could Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT recent acquisition of Xamarin has the potential to totally transform the future course of Microsoft in line with its new mobilefirst cloudfirst approach The beauty of Xamarin is that despite the differences under the hood XamariniOS and XamarinAndroid coupled with Microsofts Windows Phone SDK offer a seamless experience for writing C code that can be reused across all three platforms Business logic database usage network access and other common functions can be written once and reused on each platform providing a foundation for platformspecific user interfaces that look and perform as native applications Xamarin To explain it in simpler terms Xamarin tries to makes things easy for developers Consider a business trying to develop an app for its users It will have to create an app for iOS Apple NASDAQ AAPL device users as well as one for Android NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL users The app itself is essentially the same thing but the developer has to do it twice Xamarin cuts through this though not by thereby making the development cycle easier for the developers and a lot cheaper and faster for the companies Microsofts relationship with Xamarin goes back to when Microsoft introduced Xamarin as a global partner at a time when the latter already had a community of developers in countries In my earlier article on Microsofts new vision Microsoft Buy Opportunities Coming Your Way I spoke about how the company had managed to nearly kill Windows Phone by not taking the effort to build a developer community the way Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>did With the acquisition of Xamarin comes a new era for Microsoft which can put its weight behind a companycommunity that will build apps for iOS Android as well as its own Windows Mobile in one go Naturally the first two operating systems will have priority on build but Windows wins in the process When you offer any business the option of having a mobile app that will work on any Windowsdriven device in addition to iOS and Android theyre not going to say no to it Microsoft has so far left a big gap in its mobile strategy but with this readytouse community of over million developers and over clients I think it has got its foot in a door that was long closed to it because of the choices it made in the past At least now theres a realistic chance for it to capture some market share where it has virtually none This is its opportunity to crack the mobile code that has confounded it for so long Although businesses may look like a drop in the ocean now its a significant addition to its arsenal especially in an area that has so far been its weakest link Moreover all of these businesses are already in the market for mobile applications which means theyre ripe to be picked for cloud solutions as well which Microsoft will surely start pushing them into Yes they were but as partners Xamarins contribution was to work with Microsoft to give the latters developers additional tools to develop Microsoft products In the process Xamarin benefited by being brought to the limelight because of their global partnership That was the extent of their relationship This time the equation is very different Microsoft now owns all of Xamarins resources most importantly the million strong developer community that comes with it Now is where Xamarin is bringing true value to Microsoft What would have otherwise taken Microsoft years to build along with high odds of failure is now readily accessible because of the acquisition Investorspeak Why is This a Key Acquisition To build any kind of community of skilled people Apple being the one probable exception you need to give and take Thats how Androids developer base was built in fact even Apples developer community was built on the faith that a developers work would be accessible to millions of people around the world The Microsoft of old was a control freak and thats not the kind of company that can build a community that is popular and that techsavvy people are eager to join unless it were disproportionately incentivized in some way Under Nadella however the company seems to be going in the opposite direction and thats the need of the hour Changing the direction of a billion company is like doing a Uturn in a footlong oil tanker in rough seas It takes the focused effort of all hands at their positions doing their utmost to make sure she doesnt keel over From that perspective this acquisitions impact is hugely disproportionate to its actual cost or current contribution to MSFT Microsoft is finally going to be recognized as a serious contender in the mobile space and that is critical to its mobilefirst cloudfirst agenda that Nadella is pushing As an investor you should be looking at how Microsoft can enlarge its ability to compete in the enterprise mobile space as well as end user market for mobile applications Again right now its a drop in the ocean but you can be sure that Xamarins contribution to the bottom line will make itself known over the next few years I see MSFT as possibly offering a few if not plenty of earnings shocks as it transitions from device and systems building into mobile and cloud services It is at the threshold so its too early to tell but the fact that its at least at the threshold is something to be said for Nadellas acumen Please follow me for deepdive analyses on technology companies and
