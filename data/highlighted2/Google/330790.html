saturation point in terms of user base growth Secondary markets are great for increasing users but not in terms of revenue generation If someone told me ten years ago that someday Facebook NASDAQ FB would be worth more than Walmart NYSE WMT Id have thought they were just making a stop on the way to the loony bin A social media company worth more than a retailer with revenues in the hundreds of billions Thats crazy right However that day is soon coming Facebook has been threatening to make its home in the rarer atmospheres of the billion club But we need to answer a key question here Can a company that earned billion in the last fiscal year actually be worth billion Is the times sales valuation the company enjoys right now the result of current earnings or strength of their user base and how can it be leveraged in the future Facebooks valuation with respect to their current revenue earning power is more than twice that of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL nearly four times that of Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and just short of eight times that of Apple NASDAQ AAPL These are companies that have already proven their ability to earn over a period of time and they all have shown resilience to competition Facebook is a relative newbie who disrupted the status quo and upended the social media circuit Facebook was not the first company to think of connecting one internet user to another in a social context There were many that came before but the odds of Facebook becoming the last social media company with a global presence are indeed very high Its one thing to be a awesome business with great prospects its another thing altogether to be valued based on unknowns Facebooks current valuation demands the company to either keep growing its EPS in double digits for the next ten to twenty years or keep increasing its user base year after year till it reaches the sun Both of them are nigh impossible Dont get me wrong I may agree that Facebook will be the last social media company to dominate the world but I still dont think theyre worth billion Let us now get into the two biggest forces that affect the growth of a company this globally pervasive growth prospects and growth limitations As of September Facebook had over a billion users of their desktop application Mobile users were slightly behind at around million One might assume that most mobile users use it as a secondary access point to their Facebook accounts but thats not entirely true If you look at the graph below people who use Facebook exclusively as a mobile app number about million or thereabouts Essentially that puts their total user base in the neighborhood of about to billion worldwide Thats about right Now at that point theyve already reached more than half of the worlds threeplus billion internet users You might say they were saturating but its too early to make that call so lets dig a little deeper As you can see their million users in North America were growing by leaps and bounds until the beginning of this decade but has slowed to lowmid single digits since Look at the growth stats published by SmartInsightscom With so many social sites vying for mindshare a more mature platform must necessarily give way to user preferences Theyre still the largest but that means they cant grow as fast anymore at least as weve seen not in North America So Whats The Problem Theres Asia Isnt There As you can see from the charts above North America one of the most profitable geographies for any company has seen Facebooks monthly active user base grow from million at the end of December to million at the end of The YoY growth rate has slowly come down from in to near last year There is nothing wrong with user base growth rate slowing down for Facebook in the North America segment its just a natural process for a company For any given market there is going to be only a select number of users unless the countrys population growth shows an anomalous high yearoveryear which is not the case in North America Its clear from the graph above that North American and European growth have somehow settled down to levels well be seeing for a long time into the future AsiaPacific and the rest of the world are still growing at healthy twodigit rates but what does that actually mean for the company in terms of revenue After all thats what it finally comes down to isnt it earnings As of Q billion of a total of billion in revenues came from North America and Europe thats a clean being generated by a little more than a third of the user base and that user base is slowing down dramatically as weve already seen And if you look at the average revenue per user it becomes even clearer they need about nine users from APAC and RoW for every one user in North America to match peruser revenue InvestorSpeak Again Is Facebook Really Worth Billion So now we have a set of conditions that dont point to a valuation of billion Here they are in summary User growth in core profitable markets has slowed to the level and revenue increase will be in direct proportion to that Secondary markets are growing user base aggressively but they need to be nine times the size of core markets to be an equal contributor to the top line And lets not forget China is still out of bounds The popularity of half a dozen other social sites is eating into their users mindshare which means people are using Facebook less exclusively and sharing their available time between multiple social applications Highgrowth user base countries such as Brazil or India cant compete with North America or Europe in terms of revenue generation which means they can only contribute a fraction of the latters share to EPS growth At this kind of valuation its clear the market expects miracles from Facebook and Facebook itself must be hoping for a miracle at this point I do see a way out of this situation for the company Of their two key acquisitions in the social space WhatsApp stands out as the more promising one Even though theyre pulling out their annual renewal fee of cents and arent certain of their forward monetization and revenues as far as Facebook is concerned its an untapped platinum mine They just need to figure out how to dig in If push came to shove Id say a doubling of revenues was certainly possible considering the number of loyal WhatsApp users which would bring their PS ratio down to a more acceptable level I invite you to follow me for thoughtprovoking and insightful articles into the workings of
