quarter earnings call we can savor the possibilities At Yahoo or as we report it the core Yahoo devoid of those smart and lucky investments in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan is up for sale I know its a pipedream but wouldnt be great for Verizon and Time Inc to team up to buy Yahoo Which picture would you like to see on the wall of digital media history alongside that alltime classic Time Warners NYSE TWX Jerry Levin halfsmile as he brought new partner AOL chief Steve Case into the fold as the companies completed their billion merger in As Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO prepares to open its bidding envelopes on Monday a day before its first quarter earnings call we can savor the possibilities Just as her million parachute inflates and other execs get newly positioned for payouts Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer could join up with Tim Armstrong at AOL A Yahoo AOL tie up has been seen as imminent since long before Mayers time with lastminute twists undoing the matchup before it became reality Or how about Yahoo and Time Inc NYSE TIME CEO Joe Ripp smiling for the cameras Perhaps Mayer could soon be holding a press conference with one of the anonymoustothepublic private equity CEOs who may front the money to match up the yearold Yahoo with an experienced if insufficiently monied partner At Yahoo or as we report it the core Yahoo devoid of those smart and lucky investments in Alibaba

been axed POLITICO The ax falls at Yahoo as the company prepared to go to market Legions of smart and talented people have spent long and short careers in Sunnyvale Even as we assess its future as it finally surrenders its independent status its life cycle must be put in perspective Founded on Jan three years before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and nine before Facebook NASDAQ FB its been a wild ride of misguided management astonishing misdirection and enough bad execution to consume a shelf full of HBRs Long before search and then social changedeverything Yahoos directory set a new standard The wild World Wide Web had been tamed organized as John Dewey might have done if he had been alive for the digital revolution It seemed supercool and led the way to our certain sense that PortalsWouldEattheWorld They munched mightily and Yahoos competitors of the early days Excite Altavista Infoseek Lycos nostalgia fans check here the list sends a shiver down my spine of deals negotiated all faded into history most as parts of something else I still recall the day that Lycos CEO Bob Davis explained the businesschanging business model of his thenhigh flying portal He drew a large rectangle on a large white board and then put all his vertical topical products along the top Down the side all the exclusive ad placements in each of the verticals Before me Dozens of boxes offering that exclusivity in each niche Hed found a way to sell nearinfinite multiple exclusivity he said with a smile and the future was his Yahoo employed similar tricks of the trade and lots more over the years Our number one word associated with the company eyeballs For a long time Yahoo amassed enough of them to merit the that founders David Filo and Jerry Yang had affixed as they trademarked their name the plain Yahoo already TMed by companies hawking barbecue sauce knives and humanpropelled watercraft The exclamation point survived the redesign when Yahoo as it approached the maturity of its thbirthday decided it was time to grow up and drop its funky logo Its luck though hasnt changed and the exclamation point has just become selfsatirical punctuation As Yahoo now approaches the deal of its lifetime its string of failed deals surface perhaps for the last time prominently Through a succession of CEOs its reverse Midas touch persisted as it plunked billions and millions into dissynergy buying Broadcastcom billion Geo Cities billion and Tumblr billion among many smaller sinkholes Theres no shortage of web pieces detailing Yahoos serial blunders my favorite are in listicle form and of course Recode cofounder Kara Swisher has filled the equivalent of several tomes on the topic in her ownthebeat reporting Now as we approach the deal that apparently will end the independent Yahoo weve known we must ask What could possibly go wrong As the weekend some bidders prepare to spend long weekends finalizing bids for the Yahoos core assets Next week Ill plumb some of the numbers that may drive the deal but for now lets survey the deal playground on which the deal may get done Among the likeliest bidders for Yahoos core properties those media news and mail properties that form the portal are these ancientintheteeth behemoths Conventional wisdom puts Verizon founded as part of ATT NYSE T in and the reconfigured to Bell Atlantic in in the pole position Then comes Daily Mail and General Trust founded in Time Inc first birthed the same year as DMGT and CBS Not all legacy media companies look on Yahoo with so much affection Both News Corp NASDAQ NWS NASDAQ NWSA and Axel Springer both on the hunt for acquisition have passed on this opportunity Why Five words Legacy digitalnative media turnaround That capsulizes the challenge here Yahoo may have revved its restart engines innumerable times but still needs that turnaround Turnarounds are expensive in money and time and many companies with access to the cash required think they can spend their money better elsewhere For Verizon a buy would be still one more step moving into farther away from being the pipes company of its birth and cash flow generation One irony these wouldbe legacy buyers must ponder before they name their number the market economics of the digital news media is taking another turn south Newsonomics With new roadblocks for digital news sites what happens next with both legacy content producers and even the biggest digital news startups challenged by intense ad revenue competition Yahoo is big Able to claim an audience of million unique US visitors in February it ranks third behind digital darlings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Facebook Thats the big lure here for the three main wouldbe buyers But big is relative and gets to the central value question in this transaction Is big as valuable today as it was years ago In the old portal metaphor each could serve as its own universe slicing and dicing up space on the site as Lycos Bob Davis had demonstrated back before the Millennium Yahoo though had had mighty issues monetizing its vast audience similar problems increasingly experienced by both Time Inc and DMGTs Mail Online In these scenarios either Time Inc or Mail Online would merge with Yahoos properties to create Something Really Big though still subscale compared to Facebook and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>The Multiverse theory is the emergent one In that one its all about matching up endlessly multiple aggregations of discrete audiences wherever they are found through programmatic tech In that worldview no one else can get big enough to compete headon with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>or Facebook And that idea is behind the Verizon NYSE VZ buy of Yahoo The theory AOL CEO Tim Armstrong has built one of the better ad machines out there and has apparently satisfied his new bosses at the phone company with last years billion acquisition of the Yahoos older cousin AOL was founded in Armstrong could take all that Yahoo traffic merge it with AOL traffic smoothly integrating verticals Yahoo Finance and AOL Finance Yahoo Sports and AOL Sports etc and make more per digital page than Marissa Mayer could So for Verizon its more than a size play its a tech play How much can Tim Armstrong really juice out of Yahoo audience Take that projected number and youd know how much Verizon is really to pay for Yahoo Yahoo News The two words together seemed confusing early on Was the news written on that Yahoo portal by or just sent through Yahoo Was it distributing newspaper and magazinewritten stories or employing people to write its own Over the years Yahoo zigged and zagged on that question It has hired both the tops in their fields Katie Couric and David Pogue for example and at times veteran and highregarded newsies Yet the original content has always been an uncertain business for Yahoo execs and for its many readers Now as Yahoos media properties go elsewhere will Yahoos distribution strength become its main goforward asset will more expensive content origination already cut back be a significant part of the mix So we know Yahoo is big but exactly who is in its audiences My favorite description is one thats probably halfright In talking with dealmaking cognoscenti a couple offered one contrarian would bebuyer for Yahoo Meredith The company that started as Des Moinesbased Midwesternpleasing magazine company continues to grow and grow Ahead of the curve it moved away from a print magazine branding to announcing itself as the leadings womens marketing company in the country and then backed that up as an early inventor of what we now know as branded content Meredith figured out how to serve middle American middleclass largely betweenthecoasts women to advertisers Much of Yahoos audience now matches that positioning several insiders have told me Yahoos readership skews older more female and more betweenthecoasts than many major web brands they say Of course that metaphor may only go far Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Sports serve as the two highestranking Yahoo properties up for sale and both those topics tend to skew male Yahoo Mail that legacy of a legacy akin to AOLs mail and Internet service businesses certainly skews older and generates a large amount of that traffic that makes Yahoo a thirdplace player though it monetizes poorly While Meredith is an unlikely suitor having just announced its merger with Media General and casting its future more greatly in regional TV still its a tantalizing idea Declare a concentration on half the American population and then execute like crazy I know its a pipedream but wouldnt be great for Verizon and Time Inc to team up to buy Yahoo Then Yahoo could be finally betrothed to AOL and AOL and Time could be reunited one more time It would also make quite a new iconic photo Tagged Technology Internet Information Providers Editors Picks
