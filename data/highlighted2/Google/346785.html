market today and for good reason The company has released yet another reason to be bullish on their stock Recently it was announced that Amazon and Comcast CMCSA entered into an agreement with one another Today well talk about the details of the agreement how investors are reacting to the news and what we can expect to see from AMZN moving forward So lets get right to it AMZN Enters Into An Agreement With CMCSA Recently it was announced that AMZN entered into an agreement with CMCSA for the sale of cable internet and phone services This is a clear win for Comcast After all Amazon has proven its skills with being able to sell just about anything In the s AMZN started as a website that did nothing more than sell digital books Years later the company became the worlds leading online retail website Now AMZN is one of the largest companies in the world and this growth comes from its ability to sell products and services quickly online So whats the deal for Amazon Well AMZN gets quite a bit out of this deal In fact the company is earning its share of each and every sale made using their online retail platform While AMZN hasnt made the amount it earns public Affiliate programs are very common and tend to pay a decent percentage of sale So in this case lets say that Amazon is only earning about of each sale Believe it or not that adds up to a ton of money The truth is that on average AMZN is selling year contracts with price tags of per month So at per month on each customer it brings to Comcast Amazon is earning about through the life of the contract Thats a good chunk of money considering the massive amount of people that are likely to sign up for services through AMZN Discover the secret to uncovering the most profitable stocks Another big question that investors have with regard to the deal is What does AMZN have to offer that makes the deal unique If Comcast services are purchased through Amazon customers are guaranteed dedicated customer support and thats something that Amazon is incredibly well known for As investors weve learned that any time there is positive news released with regard to a publicly traded company we can expect to see gains in the value of the stock associated with that company Considering the new partnership theres plenty of reason to see positivity in AMZN So naturally were seeing gains on the stock Currently the stock is trading at per share after a gain of per share or thus far today What We Can Expect To See From AMZN Moving Forward Moving forward I have an overwhelmingly bullish opinion of what we can expect to see from AMZN First and foremost its relationship with Comcast is likely to drive a massive amount of revenue for the company However my bullish opinion on the stock goes far beyond what its doing with the cable provider The truth is AMZN has done quite a bit for itself over the past year or so Ive been incredibly impressed with the movements weve seen in Prime On top of Prime AMZN is working on offering groceries through its online platform to compete with the likes of Walmart Ultimately if the company continues moving forward how weve seen and theres no reason to expect it not to were going to see nothing but overwhelmingly positive movement out of the value of the stock Where do you think AMZN is headed moving forward and why Let us know your opinion in the comments below Learn how to
