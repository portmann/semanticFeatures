class='textDiv'>Intel And Qualcomm Have Jumped Into Bed Together Intel Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha Intel and Qualcomm have joined hands for taking WiGig mainstream WiGig offers faster WiFi connectivity The technology has huge growth potential Intel NASDAQ INTC and Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM are well known for their smartphone chip rivalry But the two chipmakers are collaborating with each other to broaden their horizon in WiGig an emerging wireless communication technology WiGig the short form of Wireless Gigabit Alliance was originally a trade association aimed at promoting multigigabit telecom technology In March WiGig was included in the WiFi Alliance after which WiGig became identical with the term ad which is the underlying technology Why Is This Significant for Intel and Qualcomm Everything is fair in love and war right For Intel and Qualcomm its time for change A new episode of love has begun keeping the ageold war aside WiGig offers faster WiFi connectivity Industry observers believe that will be the year when WiGig will bring multigigabit speed wireless connectivity into the mainstream The initiative involves expanding the adoption of the new ad WiFi standard which is actually a combination of different GHz WiFi technologies The new standard is capable of offering a throughput of gigabit per second The GHz frequency a part of the VBand frequencies in the United States is witnessing growing interest in wireless telecom lately Earlier GHz was used in military communications In addition to Qualcomm and Intel <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL is also interested to exploit the frequency band for developing next generation WiFi and G solutions In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>purchased Alpental a startup engaged in developing innovative GHz networking solutions Qualcomm acquired Atheros Communications for billion in Subsequently Qualcomm formed Qualcomm Atheros Inc a wholly owned subsidiary of itself Engineers of Qualcomm Atheros have been working jointly with Intels engineers to achieve full interoperability between the two companies respective ad WiGig solutions By the time full interoperability will be achieved a fullblown ecosystem around the new WiGig standard will also be developed With the ad standard taking off the partnership between Intel and Qualcomm will create a winwin situation for the companies The WiGig technology will create a new market for WiGigsupported devices which will thrive embracing a new ecosystem The possible use cases of ad will play a crucial role in defining the ecosystem Intels aim is offering users wirefree computing experience The idea is creating a common platform where multivendor devices can be docked which will create new demand for Intels processors that support docking I believe wirefree computing is the first step towards building the ecosystem Intels wireless docking technology uses WiGig connectivity via its triband wirelessAC card which supports GHz WiGig ad connectivity Intel will also help users get rid of power adapters based on Rezence magnetic resonance technology The technology is backed by AWP the short form of Alliance Wireless Power in which Intel is a participant The wireless docking and power supply technologies support laptops tablets and ins powered by Intels Skylake processors Qualcomm is also developing its own WiGigsupported product line The ultimate aim however is selling more processors Qualcomm is planning to leverage the power of its Snapdragon processor and Qualcomm Atheros IPQ Internet Processor Qualcomm reference design coupled with QCA ad chipset Qualcomm said Some of the ad use cases include lagfree docking and screen mirroring k streaming to multiple devices near instant access to multimedia and fast upload and downloads Why Intel and Qualcomm Joined Hands In Qualcomm acquired fabless semiconductor company Wilocity In a few executives and engineers of Intels WiFi Centrino group founded Wilocity which developed the worlds first GHz multigigabit wireless chipsets Post acquisition Wilocity became a part of Qualcomm Atheros As I said above the ad WiFi which offers multigigabit low latency and secured telecom technology is a combination of different GHz WiFi technologies These Ghz technologies have some limitations when used in shorter ranges such as in offices homes or indoor public places Intel and Qualcomm have joined hands to overcome the limitations so that WiGigcapable devices such as laptops tablets smartphones VR headsets AR glasses etc can properly utilize the new standard via full interoperability ie crossplatform compatibility between the two companies WiGig offerings Eventually full interoperability will ensure increased demand and steady market share for their processors The ad WiFi standard is capable of addressing the rising demand for data in households offices and carrier networks The technology is already being used in wireless docking and charging Going forward multigigabit internet access will also be possible utilizing ad since the technology offers networking solutions alongside pointtopoint solutions Disclosure I amwe are long INTC QCOM I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
