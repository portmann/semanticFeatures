strategy in the realm of media and technology is now crystal clear its called MA VZ just turned itself into an advertising power leaving behind old enemies while forging new ones AOL is a deal VZ had to make given that Verizons breadandbutter service bundles telephone Internet and payTV are on the decline The new strategy in the realm of media and technology is now crystal clear its called MA Companies with tons of cash and little growth have no choice but to spend for that growth The only caveat The deal has to make sense This point was made several weeks ago discussing the merits of quality content and how important it has become to advertisers While I didnt predict telecommunication giant Verizon Communications Inc NYSE VZ would gobble up AOL Inc NYSE AOL I wasnt surprised by the announcement And you shouldnt have been either thats if youve been paying attention Dana Blankenhorn says AOL got the wrong buyer Only time will tell But this is a deal VZ needed So it pounced on it VZ has valuable assets that it cant use including tons of valuable information about its consumers just sitting idle and collecting dust Do you thing Facebook NASDAQ FB or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL two advertising behemoths would have that problem No They would figure out ways to package all of that consumer data which included spending habits and preferences put a bow on it and sell it to advertisers who want to get more bang for their buck looking for predictive analysis on their target market In that vein this is what AOL will bring to VZ which by the way just turned itself into an advertising power especially in the realm of mobile The allcash deal valued at billion or per share may seem too pricey for AOL who many consider a hasbeen but it makes sense And its not as risky as it looks given that VZ generated almost billion in free cash flow last year The way I see it its a worthwhile bet and signals a change in direction for VZ who desperately craves a piece of the personal data market which has become a goldmine for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Facebook Plus AOLs recent investments in streaming video suited for the mobile platform is one less thing VZ has to worry about Not to mention this is another way VZ can leverage its FiOS television service At the same time AOL now gives VZ an edge over wireless rival ATT NYSE T whos still betting on television subscribers with its billion deal for DirecTV NASDAQ DTV And even then VZ has a piece of that market with its FiOS television service More importantly AOL is a deal VZ had to make given that Verizons breadandbutter service bundles telephone Internet and payTV are on the decline Revenue from those services are expected to climb just this year In that business posted sales of almost billion climbing more than from As for analyst predict those services to grow at just So the pattern is clear When its all said and done AOL has added life to VZ by bringing not only its sophisticated advertising platform but also revenue streams to offset plummeting bundling sales VZ is also waving goodbye to past rivals like ATT and Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA and saying hello to new ones like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Facebook Sure these are more formidable competitors But if VZ can prove it belongs in their company its investors will be rewarded for it Source Verizons Deal For AOL Attacking <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>And Facebook Is Not As Dumb As It Looks
