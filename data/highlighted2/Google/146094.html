see tight supply levels The Ford Mustang saw the strongest July sales since With Ford expecting to reach full inventory levels next month its turnaround remains on track to take advantage of the growing US auto industry in the remainder of Ford NYSE F announced July US vehicle sales of K up from the same month in This increase surprised analysts as it came in well above the increase estimated Fords yearoveryear increase came amidst an overall US auto sales industry that is crushing prior year with an industrywide growth of With the low interest rates and cheaper fuel prices to be credited analysts are expecting sales to be million with the annualized sales rate at million If the annualized sales rate keeps pace and million is reached it would mark the best year for the industry since If the analysts are right and the rate falls to million it would match the sales from prior to the recession Even with the record setting July Ford believes a strong second half is coming as the new aluminumbodied F pickup is reaching full production levels for the first time all year Based on this I believe Ford July keeps the company on track to a lagging recovery The Ford F production is continuing to catch up to demand as the plants reached full production levels in July The Ford F which underwent a drastic model change to an aluminum body starting with this years model has seen tight inventory levels so far as the company has worked to configure their manufacturing plants Because of the inventory constraints surrounding the new F model the company has not utilized heavy incentives to sell older models like competitors Because of this the F saw another record setting average transaction price during July with an alltime transaction price up versus a year ago Additionally the new F is seeing positive consumer reactions when it makes it to the customer lot with a quick turnover time According to management the new F is turning twice as fast on dealer lots than the industry average for halfton pickups This turnover time bodes well for the company going forward as management said the company only had half of their normal inventory levels on dealer lots in through the midpoint of This is very encouraging for a company expecting to reach full capacity of its bestselling product next month Based on these results keeping the company on track for a major turnaround I continue to be optimistic of Fords future because I think it is important for Ford to get this product launch right as the company is taking the Fseries brand in a new direction designed for better fuel mileage With optimal inventory levels imminent I think its important to look at the quick turnover time of the model and the very strong US auto market Both of these indicators are signs of a positive finish to for the F and Ford as a whole In July the US auto consumer continued the shift back to less fuelefficient vehicles in response to the falling fuel prices This shift in consumer sentiment will boost sales for the companys higher profit margin vehicles such as the F Explorer and Expedition The Mustang saw another impressive month in July consistent with early results Mustang sales were at their highest July level since and continue to build its case to reclaim the title of bestselling muscle car in This is a title the company has not held since before the Chevrolet Camaro was introduced During July Mustang sales were up a whopping with nearly Mustangs sold yeartodate in compared to only nearly yeartodate in I believe this is the resurgence of the Mustang and should provide longterm growth for the company in the reclaimed segment While the turnaround looks likely there are certainly that I believe could derail the companys momentum These include the overall health of the US economy labor negotiations and emergence of new competitors in the auto industry If there was an event or condition that forced the US economy back into slowing growth territory it would definitely have a major impact on Ford especially given their lag on inventory levels Additionally labor negotiations with UAW are key to Fords bottom line as it employs more than US UAW hourly employees It is important that management keeps these costs under control and does not let costs get out of control Finally with new companies working to produce technology infused vehicles such as Tesla <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Apple it is important that Ford stays ahead of this curve and doesnt fall behind when it comes to technology use in the vehicle Management should not be looking at the industry as theirs to lose but they should rather be seeing it as an opportunity to lead the way Its no secret that Ford is losing ground to competitors due to the inventory restrictions as most consumers purchase a vehicle when needed instead of waiting for the newest model Because of this and other factors the Ford turnaround is not a sure thing However this is not the big picture an investor should be seeing when buying shares of Ford They should be seeing managements plan to shorten the companys normal summer shutdown in order to increase production This shows me as an investor the new Fs results are positive and the high end models are selling well which is creating a lot of optimism around the new model going forward Once full production capacity is reached I fully expect Ford to start leading the pack Given this longterm optimism with Ford I am encouraged by the US sales results in July I continue to be excited about the companys future as the new aluminum bodied F is nearing full production levels the recent shift in consumer sentiment to higher profit margin vehicles and the strong sales of the Mustang With consumers purchasing more expensive vehicles it will allow Ford to report stronger top line and bottom line growth in the end of I remain bullish on the US automobile industry and believe Ford has a strong product mix to take advantage of the growing market I will continue to enjoy the near dividend yield as the company prepares to be successful in the longterm Disclosure Iwe have no positions in
