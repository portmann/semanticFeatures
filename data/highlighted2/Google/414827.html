to compare Apple to an unloved retail name Kohls just to see how cheap Apple might actually be This article presents the conclusions from that comparison some of which are surprising and some of which show why Apple is also a very good business When it comes to Apple NASDAQ AAPL a general consensus exists that the stock is rather cheap This extends perhaps as much as to include even bears in the name which usually just claim that while it looks cheap the company is challenged on two grounds iPhone dependence and resulting revenue and earnings shrinkage But is Apple really that cheap An interesting exercise can be made Lets compare Apple which has a lot of fans to a company in an unrelated and unloved industry and see what we can come up with The comparison I am going to make is between Apple and Kohls NYSE KSS Kohls obviously is not a tech company and instead mostly just runs stores to sell stuff made elsewhere under someone elses name Now this isnt exactly central but its rather funny that Apple also has its own stores and that up to of Kohls business actually consists in selling its own private label brands That is brands that belong to Kohls but whose manufacture is farmed out just like the iPhones So the companies arent as different as they might seem Anyway lets say that they were indeed as different as they could be They would still be comparable Why Because a dollar is a dollar A dollar in revenues is a dollar in revenues A dollar in EBITDA is a dollar in EBITDA A dollar in FCF free cash flow is a dollar in FCF Indeed the whole purpose of having accounting and valuation multiples is to make different companies and different sectors be comparable amongst themselves For sure when it comes to relative intrasector valuation whats the cheapest smartphone manufacturer you can only compare between smartphone manufacturers But when it comes to absolute valuation whats the cheapest business you can actually compare across sector lines You can compare a condo rental development in Florida with a MLP running a pipeline into the Bakken And if the condo rental is yielding and the MLP is yielding for rather similar risk quantitatively speaking then its likely that your investment dollars will be heading to the Bakken even if you love Florida that much more What doesnt make a whole lot of sense is and here I am going to reference another era to say Oh Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO at x earnings is much cheaper than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL at x earnings while all the while you could find nontech companies with comparable growth and profitability going for x earnings all values are exemplificative Yet this kind of comparison between the lesser of two great evils is made much more often than valuation comparisons between companies in wildly different industries to try and come up with the better investments Of course being in different industries introduces very different dynamics and risks It also introduces different potential revenue growth rates At the very least we should thus require that the comparison were making isnt between wildly different positive growth rates After all something growing at per year is always going to command higher valuation multiples versus something showing stagnation and rightly so The valuation metric Ill use is EVEBITDA EVEBITDA is rather nice for this comparison because it takes into account debt and cash on hand usually seen as a great Apple advantage Also EBITDA will eliminate the effects of different tax rates and depreciation schedules I will also compare current revenue growth rates knowing beforehand that neither of these companies is putting on barnburning performance which is exactly what makes both comparable When it comes to growth heres what we know In its most recent quarter Apple saw its revenues decline versus the same quarter the year before Apple is also expected to see its revenues decline during the present fiscal year In its most recent quarter Kohls saw its revenues decline versus the same quarter the year before Kohls is also expected to see its revenues decline during the present fiscal year Thus when it comes to growth its obvious that Apple is doing a whole lot worse than some of the unloved apparel retail companies such as but not just Kohls When it comes to valuation EVEBITDA heres what we know Presently Apple trades at x TTM trailing twelve months EVEBITDA Remember this takes into account all of the cash hoard This number is slightly deceiving though because in the latest reported quarter Apples EBITDA was falling at a yearonyear rate but in the preceding quarters it wasnt yet under the effect of the iPhone s underperformance Presently Kohls trades at x TTM trailing twelve months EVEBITDA Granted Kohls EBITDA was also falling at a yearonyear rate in the latest reported quarter Thus not only is Apple shrinking a whole lot more than the unloved Kohls but its also more expensive if measured through EVEBITDA Obviously EVEBITDA is not the only multiple we can use to evaluate these two companies We could also evaluate both from a FCF Free Cash Flow perspective As a proxy for FCF we can use EBITDAcapex Apple does have one advantage versus most of the other companies out there it spends preciously little on capex Lets see how Apple would do in terms of EVEBITDAcapex Presently Apple trades at x TTM trailing twelve months EVEBITDAcapex This multiple is so close to the EVEBITDA multiple because over the last twelve months Apple generated billion in EBITDA but spent only billion in capex It spent just of its EBITDA in capex Presently Kohls trades at x TTM trailing twelve months EVEBITDAcapex Here Kohls loses its valuation advantage to Apple Its not that Kohls spent tremendously in capex but it still spent quite a bit more than Apple It spent of its EBITDA in capex nearly double what Apple spent It could be argued that this very low FCF multiple is whats probably attracting one of Warren Buffetts investment managers towards Apple along with its strong brand Still what can we conclude from this exercise We can conclude Apple is shrinking faster than even an unloved retail name like Kohls If Apple doesnt significantly slow down this shrinkage at some point Apple will stop being cheap Arguably the shrinkage is so fast that Apple deserves a valuation discount versus even unloved names like Kohls On some valuation measures like EVEBITDA Apple still appears more expensive than Kohls in spite of shrinking at a much faster rate The one redeeming Apple feature is that it spends so little on capex that it generates monstrous FCF Thus while being more expensive on other measures its actually as cheap or cheaper thank Kohls and other names when it comes to FCF multiples On the whole both Kohls and Apple show extremely low valuation multiples especially when it comes to FCF However Apples quick revenue shrinkage is more troubling than Kohls That said Apples highmargin business offers it a measure of reprieve which Kohls does not enjoy I might write about this phenomenon in an article of its own All in all the sentiment towards Apple seems quite a bit more positive than the sentiment towards retail names like Kohls However if we delve into both companies Apple doesnt seem materially cheaper and its shrinkage greatly exceeds Kohls
