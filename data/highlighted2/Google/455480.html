cant still make investors very rich Find out a simple low risk way to earn fantastic yields on shares of one of Americas most undervalued companies Find out the risk factors that you need to keep in mind before using this powerful income generating strategy Apple NASDAQ AAPL has been one of greatest longterm investments of the past years having generated total returns of CAGR since the return of Steve Jobs in Thats compared to just for the SP over that same time period AAPL Total Return Price data by YCharts However today Apple has transitioned from one of the worlds greatest growth stories to a far less exciting dividend growth stock While Apple can still make longterm investors very rich in the years to come what if you are primarily concerned with generating strong immediate income Apples yield while better than the markets payout is hardly something to write home about Read on to learn a simple and low risk way to earn far higher yields from the worlds most profitable smartphone maker The awesome income generating power of covered option writing Options often get a bad rap among conservative investors who view them as confusing and complex financial instruments designed to use massive leverage as a means of making potentially massive but speculative profits While this is true of some types of naked options strategies they can also be used as conservative and low risk tools to generate substantial income For example covered calls and cash secured put writing use no leverage and thus expose investors to risk of margin calls Heres how these financial instruments work Covered option contracts mean you are essentially becoming an insurance company By writing puts you are agreeing to buy shares of Apple stock per contract at a designated price known as the strike price by a given date if Apple is trading below that price A covered call contract means you will sell shares of Apple stock per contract to the owner of the option at the strike price if Apple is trading above that price by the expiration date In exchange for taking on these obligations the buyer of the option pays you an upfront option premium The reason that option buyers are willing to pay you this premium is to hedge against uncertainty over the future price of Apple stock For example the buyer of a put contract may be worried that the upcoming release of the Apple iPhone will be a flop and want to guarantee a fixed selling price in case the shares drop On the flip side a buyer of a call option may think Apple is highly undervalued and potentially set to rally However with pessimism about Apples growth prospects now at multiyear highs heshe wishes to avoid buying shares unless they end up rising in the future Apple is MASSIVELY undervalued which make cash covered puts the way to go Which option type to write is based on whether you think Apple is overvalued write calls or undervalued write puts As you can see Apples PE and Price to operating cash flow ratios are far below their historic levels Meanwhile shares of Apple are currently a free cash flow yield of which likely indicates the stock is highly undervalued While I grant that some measure of multiple contraction is warranted by the fact that the companys growth prospects have dimmed somewhat the extent of that contraction is likely overblown For example based on a reverse DCF analysis Apple appears to be priced for FCFshare growth over the next years Given the companys still superior margins and immense cash flow generation buybacks alone should make that highly unlikely Now DCF analyses should always be taken with a grain of salt due to their reliance on longterm growth projections and arbitrary discount rates I used the markets historic CAGR since However based on analysts latest growth forecasts Apple is likely trading at a substantial discount to the present value of its future cash flows Dont get me wrong DCF fair value estimates should NEVER be the sole reason for buying or selling a stock They are just one data point and can only give a general indication of whether or not a stock is likely trading at a discount or premium to its intrinsic value That being said I think its safe to say Apple is probably undervalued to a high degree which means that cash secured put writing is the best conservative option income strategy to use Apple bright future means Wall Street bears are wrong Of course Apples shares are only significantly undervalued and thus a great put writing candidate if it can continue to grow its already impressive earnings and cash flow Luckily future increased sales of the iPhone and the strongest margins in the smartphone industry make this highly likely For example Apples brand is the most valuable on earth worth billion nearly double that of its nearest competitor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG That aspirational brand is protected by an incredible sticky and enormous ecosystem over billion iOS devices This results in steady global market share while maintaining premium pricing power The end result is a remakable free cash flow margin that has allowed Apple to amass the largest cash reserve of any company on earth and fund the largest buyback program in history AAPL Shares Outstanding data by YCharts Apples ability to reduce its share count by a year has been most impressive and with billion remaining under its existing buyback plan that trend should continue Of course in the longterm the key to Apples share price rising is growth in free cash flow per share With FCFshare recently declining due to weaker than expected iPhone sales why should investors remain bullish More importantly why should investors consider writing puts on its undervalued shares Japans Nikkei newspaper recently reported that the company is moving to a longer iPhone upgrade cycle meaning major changes wont arrive until s iPhone While that means that iPhone sales may once again show a lack of growth it also potentially sets the company up for a massive blow out According to Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz Apples iPhone is likely to be an upgrade megacycle Thats due to numerous major upgrades that supplier leaks hint are coming These include While Moskowitz expects iPhone sales to decline by he predicts the iPhone will sell better than this years iPhone upgrade That would if true set new sales records for Apple and likely generate the highest free cash flows in the companys history While analysts forecasts should never be the sole reason for an investment none the less I agree that the next major upgrade cycle to the iPhone is likely to silence Apples critics Which is why Im confident that record results are likely to lead to a sharp rise in the share price Thats especially true if the companys recent efforts to expand its prescence in Indias booming smartphone market prove succesful Which means that Apple put writers have a strong catalyst for potentially several years of strong income generating potential How much income exactly Well just take a look Apples already low share price just off its week low means that Apple should have a reasonably strong floor under it preventing it from falling further in the shortterm So now that we know which option strategy to use with Apple and why its likely to work lets look at three concrete examples of how investors with different risk tolerances can use put writing to earn substantial option premiums Lets say that you agree that Apple is highly undervalued and wouldnt mind owning shares at which is close to the current price You can sell August puts which would pay you per share in premium or excluding commissions per contract This generates a premium yield of for this one month contract or on an annualized basis You would then need to set aside in case the price remains below and you have the shares put to you If Apple rises above then the contract expires worthless and you keep the premium and can potentially repeat the process to keep earning high income If the price is under by August then you end up owning shares of Apple per contract at a cost basis of or a dividend yield on cost of On the other hand lets say that you like Apple and want to own shares but arent sure that the current price is a good one In that case you can write an out of the money put meaning the strike price is below the current share price For example you can write a September put that pays in premium per contract in exchange for the obligation of buying Apple at a cost basis of a dividend yield on cost of The reason this premium is so much lower than the previous example is because Apple would have to fall over from its current price On the other hand in exchange for tying up of your capital for just two months you can earn a return or on an annualized basis In todays ultra low interest rate environment that kind of yield can only be found in junk bonds or higher risk equities such as mREITs BDCs or highly distressed dividend stocks One final example this time for someone who is generally bullish on Apples longterm prospects but unsure about the next year or so Maybe you are worried that the market is set for a big correction and or iPhone sales will be much worse than expected You can sell a January put which would in a worst case scenario cause you to end up with a cost basis of and a dividend yield on cost of Actually given that Apples CEO Tim Cook has said the company plans to raise its dividend each year that is likely to be closer to assuming another dividend hike by expiration By January of the iPhone will have been released and if analysts and myself are right about the coming megaupgrade cycle Apple will be trading well above share by that options expiration There are six VITALLY important things all cash covered put writers need to remember After all the buyer of a put option isnt going to pay between and premiums for no reason Nothing on Wall Street pays that well without coming with strings attached First this strategy is ONLY for those who like Apple as a longterm investment and wouldnt mind owning shares at the implied share price Thats because the stock market is inherently volatile and investors can become highly irrational especially in times of a shortterm market panic Which brings me to risk number two Because options are time sensitive and because most of them expire before the iPhone is likely to be released there is always the risk that the Apple shares will sell off in the coming months Thats especially true with the stock market at an all time high while corporate earnings remain in a recession In fact even a January put bears the risk of you buying the shares if Apples get caught in a general market correction or bear market no matter how impressive iPhone initial opening weekend sales figures may be Which brings me to risk number three If Apple drops below the strike price unless you close out the contract buy it back likely for more than you sold it for you will receive those shares at the implied buy price For example lets say you sold the October put which has an implied buy price of per share If a market crash takes Apple to then you would end up owning the shares and have an instant unrealized loss of Thus you could end up with massive buyers remorse at the fact that you effectively bought Apple at a yield instead of the you could have received if you hadnt written the contract and thus been able to buy shares at A forth important thing to remember is that this strategy should only be undertaken if you actually have the money to buy shares of Apple per put contract you write Most brokers will allow you to sell naked puts if you have a margin account That means you can potentially write contracts to buy thousands of dollars of Apple stock even if you only have a fraction of the money to cover your obligation However this leveraged strategy while potentially leading to even higher option premium income yields also comes with the risk of a margin call That means that should the market fall and the rest of your portfolio sink in value your broker could require you to top up your account in order to be able to meet put contract obligation If you cant afford to do that then the broker could end up selling your other holdings potentially at a massive loss This risk is the reason I only ever recommend writing cash covered puts meaning you always have the money to buy the shares set aside Fifth while the biggest risk with put writing is a financial loss there is also the risk of lost profit opportunity Thats because put writing allows you to profit in from a rise in Apples share price but only to a certain point Say for instance that you wrote a January put that paid you per contract in gross premium However iPhone opening weekend sales turns out fantastic and by January shares have soared to what I believe to be Apples fair value price of Suddenly that annualized return you earned from the option premium doesnt look so hot compared to the gain you could have earned had you simply bought Apple shares at todays price Finally while the examples I give here dont include commission costs or taxes in real life you must always consider these For example the cheapest broker for options trading is either Interactive Brokers NASDAQ IBKR or eOptions Interactive Brokers charges per contract with a minimum while eOptions charges per contract Thus for writing five or fewer contracts Interactive Brokers is the cheapest but for six or more contracts youre better off with eOptions Meanwhile other brokers can charge significantly higher fees For example Options Xpress charges a flat fee for the all options trades up to contracts costs another per contract While this may not seem like much studies show that keeping trading costs low is one of the most important components to successful longterm investing Depending on what put contract you write that commission can eat up a substantial portion of your option premium Say youre with Options Xpress and you sell a single August put That commission would represent an outrageous commission In addition to commission fees you cant forget Uncle Sam All written option premiums are taxed as shortterm capital gains Which means that you could potentially be facing a hair cut if youre in the top tax bracket This is why option writing is best done in a tax sheltered account such as an IRA However brokers can have strict limitations on margin requirements in such accounts Which is yet another reason to never write naked puts but only ones covered by the cash needed to buy the shares Bottom line obvious growth catalyst makes undervalued Apple an ideal cash secured put writing candidate As long as you remember the risks youre taking on writing cash covered puts on Apple is a way to earn potentially amazing income from one of Americas best new dividend growth stocks At worst youll end up owning shares for cheaper than you could buy them today However if you take the time to write a contract that meets your specific risk profile and time horizon and Wall Street ends up valuing Apple closer to its intrinsic value especially after the release of the iPhone then you can potentially turn Apple into a wonderful cash generating machine One that could end up paying you potentially stunning option
