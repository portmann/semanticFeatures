ET About Apple Inc AAPL By SA Eli Hoffmann SA News Editor In an interview with Minutes Charlie Rose set to air today AppleNASDAQ AAPL CEO Tim Cook defends Apples tax practices Cook dismisses claims that Apple does its best to avoid paying taxes on overseas earnings as total political crap adding that Apple pays every tax dollar we owe It would cost me to bring it home and I dont think thats a reasonable thing to do Cook says This is a tax code Charlie that was made for the industrial age not the digital age Its backward Its awful for America It should have been fixed many years ago Its past time to get it done The segment will also go inside Apples design lab with Jony Ive and take an early look at a new Apple store design with Angela Ahrendts No Patrick its the market that has really stunk this year Apple has simply been stuck in that market I concur with Tim Cook regarding taxes Id rather see Apple move its HQ to Ireland as may Pfizer and others than pay a thieving corporate tax levied by the slackassed donothing incapable Congress that we are stuck with Tim Ballmer Cook needs to get moving and leave He has made all the wrong moves Iwatch Icar Itv He has tyurned AAPL into a cult stock once the cult turns the stock will tank Ruffdog if youre going to criticize at least call the products by their real name Theres no such thing as an iWatch WowYou knock up Apple for a practice used by every Fortune company Welcome to the Modern Age of Tax Avoidance Its the stupid Dems I mean the stupid Reps I mean the stupid Government Hey maybe a fair tax repatriation bill could bring the stupid sides together Apple might solve one of the biggest problem this country faces Stupid Government I agree with TC The tax code was made for US economy of years ago Too much pork for legacy industries that employed too small a segment of the population I hope that Charlie Rose took the time to speak with politicians who have not addressed the current tax codes Why would Apple or any other company not take advantage of tax laws that save them and their shareholders money As I understand it taxes have already been paid in the countries where the sales were made To bring the cash back to the US with a further hit would be irresponsible It doesnt benefit he shareholders in these corporations to do this and it doesnt benefit the US taxpayers to leave it abroad Surely its time to revise the tax laws and find a compromise Its really not a hit as taxes paid overseas are credited against US taxes owing Of course if there were no taxes paid overseas then it would be a hit but why should Apple one of the richest companies in the world be able to avoid taxes that the rest of us are forced to pay Are you making money overseas paying taxes abroad and also filling at home Unless youre a US citizen working abroad I doubt it And unlike corporations most Americans are sheltered from that tax even if they do work overseas Yes let corporations bring it back home for free to invest in RnD capital goods new jobs Will have positive effect on overall long term tax revenue But dont expect a lot of wisdom from the legislative class Apple and the tech sector has no shortage of money to invest in RD capital goods etc All of this money if repatriated taxfree will flow to shareholders Who will effectively enjoy tax rates lower than most other US business particularly those with domestic manufacturing operations for which it is impossible to perform such tax trickery Lowering taxes on repatriated profits just serves to further discourage domestic manufacturing as foreign manufacturing will have a comparative tax advantage pequity keep dreaming by bring it home u mean buy back stock profits made by corporations hardly ever get recirculated back into the economy like youd think agree I am of the opinion the corporate tax should be ZERO in US Between the things you mention above do those things in U S and also it will free up the wasted money spent on accounting legalize to get tax return income to zerodifferent than book financial income which can be invested in something more productive to Apple and the US Sure I have no problem getting behind a corporate income tax rate but it needs to apply to all corporations not just ones which happen to use transfer pricing and intellectual property agreements to shift such profit offshore into tax havens in accordance with Canada personal tax rules if any person has a Canadian driver license he must pay taxes to Canada even income was earned outside of Canadaas I know AAPL is considering as American companyso AAPL must pay all taxes to America Sort of true The Canadian residency test is a bit more complicated than merely a drivers license But in Canada and in the USA as well a taxpayer is entitled to offset a domestic tax liability with foreign taxes paid on profits which were derived from holding shares in a foreign corporation But otherwise they pay Canadian taxes at Canadian rates on the paidout profits of the foreign corporation In some instances mark to market rules also apply to Canadians investing in certain foreign trusts whereby tax has to be calculated and paid each year on gains in the trust Apple is following the rules set by the US Government If the government doesnt like companies moving profits to Ireland fix the rules I rarely agree with Tim Cook but he couldnt be more right about the tax code I only wish hed have been this vocal back when Paul Otellini former Intel CEO was pushing for changes The US has one of the most bass ackwards corporate tax codes in the world because of Democrat populist policies The stupid voters that fall for this are only cutting their own necks and forcing investments overseas Stand by and watch high tech grow in Asia and shrink in the US Why should one sector of the economy receive tax preference over others Apple is still an amazingly profitable organization even when they properly pay their taxes They benefitted from infrastructure paid for by taxes including the BSD operating system most of their products are built on Why shouldnt they be paying taxes to support such The US corporate tax code doesnt apply to just one sector In fact the high profile companies that have relocated overseas have so far not been in the tech sector Keep pumping your braindead populist polices and that may change though But many sectors cant take advantage of it like Apple For instance the restaurant owner around the corner cant accumulate profits in overseas entities mostly taxfree Hence he faces taxation at the full rates Most industries in the USA cant shift their profits elsewhere using transfer pricing and software licensing agreements Why should these sectors be placed at a comparative disadvantage taxcodewise You dont have any idea of what youre talking about Apple wouldnt be avoiding paying taxes on US earnings They arent avoiding that now If you want the US to be a nation of restaurant owners and burger flippers keep pumping your populist policies because thats what youre going to end up with One can only hope that the rest of the US populace has more common sense than that and wakes up If the burger flippers and restaurant owners can create economic growth and pay their taxes and Apple can only grow by not paying their taxes then we need to get behind the burger flippers and restaurant owners But as it stands Apple is an amazingly profitable company fully capable of properly paying its taxes They just dont want to and have employed a plethora of gimmicky in order to try and avoid such Congress should not be picking winners and losers as far as the economy goes as they usually get it wrong Cinci Hell must be about to freeze over as this item is the first time I have ever agreed with what you have said MarkOfO What part of this do you not understand The tax law says US companies do have to pay taxes on foreign earnings until the foreign earnings are brought back to the US All earnings generated in the US are taxed by the US and Apple pays their US taxes There isnt any tax evading taking place it is strictly according to the US tax code We could certainly argue that this section of the tax code has severe unintended consequences for the US Treasury but this is not Apples problem My opinion is that all earnings generated outside of the US should be repatriated with no tax liability This external money coming into the US would go a long way in enhancing our economy and would eventually be taxed as it is distributed or used within the US No it is not a dumb analogy and comment Restaurant owners cannot use transfer pricing and intellectual property agreements to accumulate profit in foreign entities well they technically could license their recipes from their foreign affiliates but thats not very practical Why should one class of business that can play tax trickery derive a benefit that firms who cant play tax trickery cannot Youre right theres nothing illegal going on If there was then the IRS would be all over Apple However Tim Cook and many other sectors of the tech industry are asking for a tax benefit to be provided exclusively to reward their tax avoiding behaviour And if you start allowing earnings generated outside the US to be taxfree then companies will shift all their earnings overseas This would be catastrophically bad for the taxpayers who remain who would be forced to pick up the mess and horrible for the economy My opinion is that the rules as currently constituted work just fine and that Apple needs to examine its sense of entitlement to tax treatment that most normal American businesses that do business in America cannot take advantage of Apple has benefitted enormously from American society American investment in education They need to pay taxes to keep up their end of the bargain Nobody pays more than required by law But Apple is asking for the laws to be changed to reduce their tax liability Change the tax laws then The restaurant owner can always start over there and accumulate the profits there Do you think they will pay the tax there and here too No the restaurant owner cant merely operate in America but book its profits overseas Well I guess they could sell their recipes and trademarks to a foreign affiliate and pay royalties on such recipes to their foreign affiliate but the professional costs to make this practical and defend such to the IRS would be prohibitive Apple on account of its scale can essentially do such accumulating profit in foreign affiliates So youre saying that there should be no tax on foreign stocks For instance it should be less taxing for me to buy stock in say Hoffman La Roche a Swiss corporation than it should be to buy stock in Pfizer Do you really think that such a tax preference would lead to a growing US economy Of course not Actually the foreign investment probably should be taxed at a more punitive rate than investment in America That is if you want the US economy to grow instead of foreign economies to grow Apple should not be given a tax break that honest hardworking American companies who do business in America and pay American taxes receive Cook and the rest of the tech sector is delusional if they think that future governments will favour companies that operate overseas over companies that operate at home The US I believe is the only developed country in the world that insists on taxing earnings made outside the US Even though Apples has paid the applicable taxes based on where those earnings were made the US wants to tax those earnings again if the money is transferred into the US In the global economy we have how can any international company justify remaining in the US with these kinds of tax laws America does not tax earnings outside the USA They only tax investments outside the USA when such investments make payments to the benefit of their US owners ie Apple is the owner of its foreign affiliate Apple is asking for an exemption on such taxes and they most likely will not receive such Apple could have accumulated its profits domestically and paid taxes but they chose not to and are now left to suffer the consequences of their past decisions The tax code does not need revision And nearly every country taxes the investment returns of its domestic taxpayers who invest overseas We should allow these corporations to bring this money home without penaltiesOur borders r open for all to come in why not do the same for money born in America We could even allow it amnesty followed by citizenship Why Allowing Apple to repatriate cash taxfree would be giving them a significant advantage over a plethora of domestic corporations who did not engage in such The tax code should not be encouraging such behaviour Do you know what the US Corporate tax rates are Compare our rates to other countriescome on get a clue Your suggestion of allowing no incentives to bring money home is the lets talk big and do nothing approach Sounds like you are a government employee or elected official I know what US corporate tax rates are Sure they are high but they partially fund the sort of infrastructure that made Apple the success it is Apple was started in America not in India not in Singapore Great insight MarkfThe brilliant minds of Apple didnt build this company Like Obama saidgovernment tax money infrastructure thats what did it Government should just take all the money foreign and domestic and let Bernie divvy it out Well great minds in America pay taxes Thats how the system works Why should one set of great minds in the American economy whose activities are mostly domestic pay a high tax rate while Apple with its army of accountants and great minds pay a lower rate Nobody is talking about taking all the money We are just talking about Apple paying taxes like every other profitable American business or individual pays Tim Cook having a temper tantrum on TV should not and arguably will not meaningfully change US tax policy to which we must all adhere HahahaUS tax policy is so complicated no one adheres to iteven the IRS employees cant figure out what we owe or who owes it But Im sure the billions Apple has paid in taxes is not near enough in your brilliant mind If you had it your way all corporations would pay much more but this foolish thinking just runs em out of the country one after another Arent you late for a Bernie Sanders fundraiser Hoping Paul Ryan will lead fixing this early with Obama gaining new reduced tax money for infrastructure and more this is the quarterly between earnings aapl time to buy then sell after they crush earnings At least that appears to be the pattern Because of how cheap aapl and the wmt beat down Im bullish from here into earnings season The only way we get tax repatriation is if lobbyists say we do know whos in charge Apples lobbyists are really stronger than lobbyists from the of other US corporations who do not engage in such aggressive transfer pricing and foreign profit accumulating schemes Doubtful Apple might be big as far as the tech sector is concerned but theyre just small fry in the rest of the economy The government is increasingly desperate for tax revenue and they are not going to allow Apple to get away with not paying billions in tax Any company that has cash that could be taxed at a future date need to have a future tax liability on their balance sheet overseas is not equal to in the US Ive seen claims that the money itself is actually invested by a Appleowned hedge fund operating in the United States in USD Just that the owner of the fund is a foreign entity controlled by Apple So the money isnt actually physically overseas but rather its in America just nominally owned by a foreign affiliate of Apple Inc Not Apple Inc itself Apples taxes as a of income before taxes run about fairly close to the average for the SP which is The IRS has rules and auditors and if they object they can ask for additional payments and go to court if necessary The rules are complex and accountants are ingenious as are lawyers The US should beef up tax collectionaudit activity and speed the resolution of disputes through the courts After everyone has been brought current and the noise dies down we could then work out a simpler and fairer way of doing it If not for the need of the Democrat Party to harness antibusiness votes from the who pay no taxes and the millions who earn tax credits on top of not paying anything hundreds of billions of dollars of earnings could be brought home to the US and contribute to the economy and lower the deficit If a tax was put on repatriated funds and say billion was invested back in the US Thats a billion direct tax payment plus individual taxes on any dividends paid out and the economic benefit of share repurchases and business expansion Why reward the behaviour of firms that engage in such trickery instead of booking profits in the USA Thats what a tax on repatriated funds would be a huge tax cut to corporations who arent really willing to play by the theme and the spirit of the rules In the case of Apple the money is apparently held in USD in the US just beneficially owned by their offshore affiliates So the money is already reinvested in the US economy albeit indirectly Apple is just seeking to lower its tax burden in a way that most domestic taxpayers could only dream If the tax code is unfair it is up to the government to fix it It is not the responsibility of one company to unilaterally pay more taxes than they should Apples management is playing a game of chicken which could easily backfire on them especially if the government actually raises taxes on repatriated profits instead of lowering them I dont think shareholders want their managements to be playing tax games and chicken with the government which could result in severely negative consequences There is no rational economic rationale for giving companies which engage in aggressive tax avoidance strategies a break To do so would be to throw the other of corporations who keep their profits domestically and play by the rules under the bus If the tech sector cant survive without paying taxes on its profits <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is another significant abuser of transfer pricing with their socalled double dutch schemas then perhaps the viability of their business models needs to be examined As many colleagues here mention the reason is a tax code that Penalaises international profitability The US is the only country that tax income earn overseas Not true All countries levy tax on profits of foreign holdings when they are paid to domestic actors Some countries even go so far as to look into the activities of foreign affiliatestrusts to tax them on a yearly basis The US does not And if those companies are so successful why cant they pay their taxes like everyone else is expected to Maybe theyre successful not because they have superior businesses but merely because they enjoy lower tax rates and are able to grow faster than their fully taxed competitors Why not level the playing field Do you think AAPL share holders should pay tax times Overseas when they bring back the profits and also when they pay dividend Do you think AAPL share holders should pay tax times Overseas when they bring back the profits and also when they pay dividend Yes they accumulate these profits in tax haven countries where they dont pay much if any tax Most tax they pay overseas is applied as an offset to US taxes BTW every US citizen who invests overseas has to declare payments from overseas entities to themselves to the IRS and remit taxes accordingly and qualified dividends receive a preferential rate on account of tax already being paid by their corporate payors The tax system is integrated Apple knew the rules at the outset and the rules are uniform for all taxpayers Apple is seeking a preference for their business and businesses which engage in similar activities They should have considered this in their decision making calculus before engaging in such activity Maybe someday US will have a corporate tax as low as the rest of the world and encourage repatriation of earnings Our country is behaving like a third world country when it comes to taxes greedy and stupid if we had a decent tax bracket for companies like this one they will all bring back the money into the country and that will represent trillions for the countries arcade instead they want to impose outrageous tax brackets like France for example and thats why most of the wealthy want to leave the country and big corporations want to set up banking shop somewhere else Give a tax break to these big corporations like apple and you see how the money will come back Here is the president of one of the biggest companies in the world saying this outfront and flat out lets see if finally our Government will do something about it Individuals dont have the option of simply stashing their profits overseas and hoping that the government wont come after them eventually Why should Apple be afforded such Its about tax fairness Do you really think the government would give tax avoidingevading individuals a preferential lower tax rate to incent them to bring money back If not then why do such for Apple I dont believe it is right to specifically blame either the Dems or the GOP for this debacle Both sides are equally at fault IMO I havent seen either Party in Congress or the White House making a serious and public push for repatriation That money would have been very helpful during the depth of the financial crisis instead of the money printed to bail out the big bank culprits Hope to post some more after the show tonight Cook says This is a tax code Charlie that was made for the industrial age not the digital age Its backward Its awful for America It should have been fixed many years ago Its past time to get it done Tim Cook is right IMO the best idea George W Bush had as president was corporate tax reform Unfortunately he couldnt get it done because he didnt propose it until the electorate and congress had lost faith in his ideas Which means designed by American citizens and residents living in America with the rights protections and benefits of being in America Except when it comes to financial gain from that IP of course In that case Go Irish or whichever place will allow Apple to assign financial rights not legal rights to the intellectual property designed and developed by Americans working in America Increasingly not even designed by American citizens but designed by foreigners brought to America on HB and other guest worker visas we need to stop spending and putting the US into such debt that we dont need to charge such taxes to try to keep afloat there are many US companies with money that stays over seas so they dont have to pay tax there is prob enough over there that the tax would help reduce debt by hundreds of billion Exactly There is even a good argument to be made that profit repatriation should be taxed at a punitive rate rather than a preferential rate that Cook et al are hoping for After all the real value of the taxes owing on previous profits is declining over time on account of inflation AppleCook should consider themselves lucky if they only have to pay the current rates to repatriate instead of much higher future rates or punitive rates THERE ARE MORE THAN TRILLION DOLLARS OF US CORPORATION MONEY OVERSEAS THAT HAVENT BEEN TAXEDWHY SHOULD THE CORPORATIONS BRING THE MONEY BACK INTO THE US AND PAY A TAX ON THE MONEY TIME TO CHANGE THE PRESIDENTIAL ATMOSPHERE ELECT TRUMP SO THAT THE MONEY CAN BE BROUGHT BACK INTO THIS COUNTRY TO EXPAND THEIR BUSINESS MAKE MORE JOBS Why should corporations pay their fair share of taxes particularly corporations who made the explicit business decision to use various transfer pricing schemas and intellectual property agreements to accumulate profit in tax havens Why should businesses that engage in such trickery be rewarded to the detriment of domestic corporations that do business in America and pay full taxes in America The real beef here is that the US government is an enormously wasteful spender of money and has set taxes so high and probably not even high enough given theres still huge debt Fallacy You are aware that hundreds sometimes thousands of people serve jail time and pay huge finespenalties on account of this fallacy every year to the IRS AAPL continues with their game is on the cash dummy If you create jobsnot for the dummy brain washed store clerks but for engineers and have manufacturing in USA your tax rate might be or at most in some states I hope Charlie Rose will mention that which I highly doubt because we all know those interviews are edited scripted etc Unless states are rebating federal taxes tax rates in the USA are very unlikely to ever be However Apple should not be rewarded for having its products manufactured in Asia by the tax code allowing for preferential repatriation of profits derived from such Domestic manufacturing will be increasingly decimated if such a horrible precedent is set to reward the likes of Apple Considering the huge numbers of US citizens unemployed and thus drawing government benefits on account of Apple manufacturing in Asia instead of America a tax rate on the profits really isnt all that punitive HahahaUS tax policy is so complicated no one adheres to iteven the IRS employees cant figure out what we owe or who owes it But Im sure the billions Apple has paid in taxes is not near enough in your brilliant mind If you had it your way all corporations would pay much more but this foolish thinking just runs em out of the country one after another Arent you late for a Bernie Sanders fundraiser Bernie Sanders lol Dont like the guy at all But if the US tax policy is so complicated and nobody adheres to it then why is Tim Cook complaining about it As for taxes sure they might have paid billions but what have their profits been Its all about scale A company with the scale of profit as Apple has should expect to pay proportionally scaled up taxes And no not all corporations need to pay more If all corporations didnt have these loopholes to exploit then rates might actually fall The fact these loopholes exist means that the corporations who do pay taxes end up having to pay more Mark and boyzindahood USA right now has the highest corp rate on this planet USA Govt is now only good for schemes corruption and conspiracy theories If there werent so many loopholes and exploiters such as Apple the US might be in a fiscal position to get that high corporate tax rate under control and become more competitive But Tim Cook proposes to expand the loophole and its financial impact on tax revenue Which is precisely the opposite that is needed to fix the problem Well at least Apple Shareholders dont have to worry about paying taxes Capital Gains this year for because at this point their have not been any Oh Except for the DIVIDEND which I believe is taxed at a lower rate LOL Sounds like we need a MUCH HIGHER dividend The tax code should be updated PERIOD It should not be an issue for us based companies Also companies that chose to move their HQ to avoid us taxes they should addressed as well It should be as unpleasant as a US citizen who renounced their citizenship I thought corporations were people The real issue is that the US government spends way too much This is the big elephant in the room not whether Apple might have to pay a higher rate on repatriated profits It wouldnt cost anywhere near to bring their money back to the States It is common knowledge that Apple has used the loophole of Irelands tax haven as a hiding place for all of its EU profits Whilst it may be legal on paper it is effectively tax evasion If the EU deem Apple to not be observing the spirit of the law they may decide to fine them and shut down the loophole That would be the fair thing in my opinion not just for Apple but also for the other corporations taking unfair advantage of the Irish situation What is total crap is Cooks continual evasion of the truth which he has made his hallmark first with the nonreporting of Apple Watch numbers and now with his gross distortion of the tax status of Apple When you look at Apples huge cash pile which they have no clue with what to do but sit on like some grotesque Smaug and which has been stashed up thanks in large part to the avoidance of billions of dollars of tax one has to express astonishment at Cooks amazing lack of political credibility In a time when governments are being overwhelmed in a sea of debt and pension black holes with recession looming and with the USs coffers starting to be drained by a just war how the hell does Cook think he is going to win friends by losing his temper Apples profits are obscene their treasure chest is obscene the tax they pay in the EU is much lower than is the average for the EU Not only should they have paid billions more in tax for the past years it would not even affect their longterm health if they paid the proper tax rate Im sick of Apples unjustified margins when they try and squeeze every last ounce from musicians I will not forget how they tried to make musicians go unpaid for three months with Apple Music Perhaps they should donate three months of their revenue to the war against ISIS and go unpaid for three months its not as though it would make the slightest bit of difference to their lifestyles We have aggressive tax avoidance which is deemed illegal That means that if a person or business takes advantage of a legal means to avoid tax that is against the spirit of the law he or it may be prosecuted Ideally those legal loopholes wouldnt exist but this is a compromise Just think how many times in a day we on a personal level make decisions that can be legal but morally wrong It is often up to us to police ourselves But when corporations lose their sense of moral compass it is necessary for the government to step in as they are effectively being defrauded to the tune of billions of dollars by big business It is easy to get frustrated with the Machiavellian tax laws and demand that loopholes are closed but I suspect that if it were that easy it might have already happened The structure of the EU is to blame I feel in treating the whole of the EU as one block yet preserving national tax laws This is a fundamental flaw you cannot have a single currency without a federal state Hence the abuses we see by Apple and other corps I dont believe England will ever want to be part of a federal state which is why we want to leave the EU as that is the only successful outcome of the EU As it is made up of so many different countries I dont think they will ever agree to a federal union which dooms the EU to failure Cooks hypocrisy is especially risible as he claims Apple want to leave the world a better place than they found it We all know hes talking about his petty and pointless social activism yet his hypocrisy is double he freely does business with China and Russia because he follows the money as he likes to say in the quarterly earnings despite their support for social mores wholly opposed to Cooks And he gets on his high moral stance about accessibilityIts not about the bloody ROIwhen it suits him but not when it suits the welfare of countries All of this could have been avoided if Apple chose to pay tax for the countries in which their products were purchased which is where their huge profits were really made and if Cook had not made Apple a vessel for his personal political views We can see how Jobs was wise to keep focused on Apple and almost never be distracted by political matters He would have still had the problems of tax but I feel sure he would have dealt with this matter in a better way Well put Actually I think Apple is putting its shareholders at grave risk by not realizing that the next move in taxation might be to apply punitive not preferential rates to repatriated profits In an effort to discourage offshoring of profits and manufacturing If the turns into Cook and Apple s management will have a lot of egg on their face destroying so much shareholder value on an illadvised bet that tax rates would be falling in the future A move which seems wholly implausible given the fiscal situation of government going forward Apple is playing a high stakes game of chicken here And the odds arent all that significantly in their favour The government will gladly throw a relatively small group of tech companies under the bus to save its tax base and provide tax fairness for the majority of people and businesses who conduct business in America and do not engage in such aggressive tax avoidance measures All of this could have been avoided if Apple chose to pay tax for the countries in which their products were purchased and not just Apple Amazon Ebay Starbucks the list of companies that make a fortune in the UK and pay NO TAX here at all grows by the day That has to change Exactly firms should be rewarded with net profits on account of their ability to deliver the best product to market operate the most efficiently etc Not on account of their ability to conjure up tax schemas which are able to most efficiently game the tax system Lots of those firms competitors play fully by the rules do not use aggressive tax avoidance schemas and shouldnt have the playing field artificially tilted away from them There is a BIG difference between TAX EVASION and Tax avoidanceTax avoidance is a legal effort to not pay taxes Tax evasion is flipping the bird and saying Im not paying TAXES Point is Tim Cook still can pay the and set up a credit card company and make up the difference in two years with to interest rates just just like the credit card companies do This headline is a misuse of the word evades He pays of what is owed in order to obey the law He declines to pay in order to obey his fiduciary duty to Apples owners It is not his money to waste on overpaying the revenue authorities of any government If Apples owners want to voluntarily donate any amount of their profits to government they are always welcome to do so If they would like an introduction to a less wasteful philanthropy I can make several Apple is playing a sort of game of chicken Currently the claim is that repatriating profits will cost in taxes Tim Cook is hoping to have that number reduced potentially to But there is always the possibility that such rate goes up to perhaps Especially in this rising interest rate environment in which the fiscal straitjacket on the US Treasury tightens with each Fed policy rate increase So by deferring repatriation of profits to pay to shareholders as dividends Apple is forcing their shareholders into a very risky bet on future tax policy If they get it wrong the consequences to Apples longterm balance sheet could be significant He has demonstrated that he does not have the moral responsibility necessary to realise that the American public demand that Apple pay their fair share of tax Using Ireland as a tax haven to hide their money may be legal but it is morally bankrupt Apple simply must not be let to get away with defrauding the American people out of tax that is rightfully due their government ETF Screener Search and filter by asset class
