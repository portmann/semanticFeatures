last high Market bulls have spent a year looking like the walking dead Theyve Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Submitted by Dan Calabrese via CanadaFreePresscom Thats pretty much what Facebook said late Monday by changing the policies it insisted did not need to be changed in order to stop the suppression of news stories that appear favorable to conservatives in its Trending Topics section Facebook Inc FBO said on Monday that it had changed some of the procedures for its Trending Topics section after a news report alleging it suppressed conservative news prompted a US Congressional demand for more transparency The company said an internal probe showed no evidence of political bias in the selection of news stories for Trending Topics a feature that is separate from the main news feed where most Facebook users get their news But the worlds largest social network said in a blogpost that it was introducing several changes including elimination of a topten list of approved websites more training and clearer guidelines to help human editors avoid ideological or political bias and more robust review procedures Earlier this month a former Facebook contractor had accused the companys editors of deliberately suppressing conservative news The allegations were reported by technology news website Gizmodo which did not identify the excontractor The report led Republican Sen John Thune to write a letter demanding that the company explain how it selects news articles for its Trending Topics list Based on the various stories I read it sounded like the key here was the list of approved web sites Editors were told that if they found something on a conservative site like this one they had to affirm it on a trustworthy site like er the New York Times So its not as if they were told Dont post stories about Fast and Furious or the IRS scandal They were told to make sure the New York Times and other MSM sites were also covering them And since we all know the MSM likes to ignore stories that are trending on conservative media voila De facto bias But if the Gizmodo story was accurate Facebook editors were at least in some instances putting their fingers on the scales by promoting proleft movements like Black Lives Matter If theyre not doing more training to stop that I suspect that probably means theyre changing earlier training that very much encouraged it By the way I remain troubled by the fact that the US Senate got involved with this and I hope that they drop it now that Facebook is changing their policies As much as I didnt like Facebooks bias which was impossible not to notice its a private company not privately held but operating in the private sector and they can do whatever they want Is the Senate going to haul Arianna Huffington before an investigative committee for making Huffington Post both liberal and completely inane If the Democrats take back the Senate this year will Harry Reid be issuing subpoenas to Herman Rob and me Actually I guarantee we would make that entertaining That said it does matter a lot when the news media tilts the scales in favor of the left in its news coverage and Im glad Facebook is at least making a show of changing its procedures Well see if it actually makes a difference Far too many people rely on Facebooks Trending Topics section for their news and they never fail to find out when a celebrity has a nipple slip or World Turtle Day arrives It would be nice if they also knew the effects of big government and the insane agenda of the secular left Tue knukles Plus the Zuck is tearing down homes abutting his property for additional privacy while being guarded armed guards Tue KnuckleDraggerX Its not evil if WE do it Im pretty sure that Zuck is a secret honkie clone of Obozo so its kind of surprising that he let them move out before he started bulldozing the neighborhood Tue Dormouse Tue jcaz Tue pods Not even sure why they would change They are in the business of selling ads to people who use the product They are not in the business of soothsaying If they can make the most money by pimping out stories of how many pimples are on Kim Kardashians coochie why not just keep doing that There is no freedom of speech on facebook It is a private entity Let them do the what the fuck they want Why are people bitching about the bias of facebook Let them be who they want to be JUST DONT FUCKING USE IT As if this is the make or break issue for facebook You sign away rights to any and all shit you post and they can snoop through all your shit and market that to whoever they want Tue lunaticfringe Zuck is the typical new age pussy that this country is producing Steal someones idea and parade around like youve accomplished something The brothers should have beat his spoiled ass Tue City_Of_Champyinz Tue Ms Erable Tue buzzsaw Tue NoDebt And socialist Bernie made it cool All the college kids want it just as they have been indoctrinated Well be a socialist country in a generation Tue KnuckleDraggerX Socialist progressive sounds sooo much better than hard line Marxist They dont have the time or patience to wait a generation which will be their downfall At least out here in the god forsaken wilderness of flyover country The true blue states however are going to get their wish hardand soon Tue NoDebt Tue lunaticfringe No I did it on my own sober even Fucking worst mistake ever Like screwing your sister ya know unless shes really hot I may need a therapist I have an account so I can have a facebook page for my business err weekend beer fund LLC Generated single sale from it so now I dont even bother to update the page Found a few other places to advertise for free and got more business that way Tue quadraspleen The problem with Fuckbook is that its become so ingrained in the way corporations ream us and businesses target us that its hard not to be involved if you sell anything or produce anything you want other people to see Like us on Facebook has become a modern meme you cant escape from if you want to promote anything I voted the bottom no seriously I dont use it but I actually do have a Fuckbook page as if I want to promote my musical endeavours a side bet from my day job the best only way to get people to look at it is via fucking Fuckbook or Twatter To do it on Fuckbook you have to have a personal page What the fuck facecunt WHY You cant just create a bandartist page They are total cunts Then as soon as people you know see you have a page they all start hassling you to fucking friend them so no I dont really look at it now as Im a miserable old fuck who doesnt care what you had for lunch nor where you went on holiday or how much your fucking house has just been valued at In fact Id like to send a few of you out late at night on Dartmoor and EE your arses with some dogs Tue Allen_H Tell me about it I went to speak to somebody about work and everytime they would stop taking and say You got Facefuck Errr NO I do not agree with spying Then continued to talk and Do you have TwaTter Errr NO It has the same issues Then I had to say that I have NO social profiles I was not asked again about any social sites Tue The Wizard At least you are honest I would venture to guess most people on ZH use facebook Send them a message STOP USING FACEBOOK Tue buzzsaw i seriously doubt it zhers might lie about how much gold they have or how fat they are but we are seriously antisocial and anti corporate and especially anti facefuck besides why lie on an anonymous poll Tue pods Reason enough right there for me to stay far far away I only have time in life to do a certain amount of things Facebook would be one more thing keeping me from accomplishing those tasks even if said task is to scratch my nuts and forget about life for an hour Tue Guru I simply use it as a conversational tool along with whatsapp A nice easy way to share your school work with others no other than that its a big waste of time and the public that post comments on conservative stories are incredibly dumb very few ZH like crowd on fb Tue Umh Started to establish a Facebook account years ago After browsing through the terms and conditions I decided that I would have to avoid it like the clap Tue tedstr Tue scintillator Tue quadraspleen Or god forbid ACTUALLY MEET AND SPEAK TO EACH OTHER Tue scintillator Much like looking around in any restaurant or social gathering People are literally across from each other yet will text to each other instead of talking Tue TradingIsLifeBrah I dont believe any of this type of stuff would happen on Facebook I mean come on we have Obama in office with the most transparent administration ever you know how close Facebook is with the government so why would Facebook be anything but transparent as well Right Tue SMC Tue brooklinite This is equivalent to a bank rigging a libor Why not throw some fines on Zuck book He has got lots of it I think the gov should look into fining the net folks Tue maxamus Well maybe they ignore articles but at least they arent like ZeroHedge which will INTENENTIONALLY post flat out lies and make things up How is that year short working for you now ZH Just think if the DOW drops over points you can finally say I TOLD YOU SO Actually k would just get you to break even Tue rudyspeaks O Facebook is biased Booeffingnoo Meanwhile of the mass media is owned by Rightwing families and the worlds biggest weaponsmaker In the runup to the Iraq warcrime they presented youw rightwing liars for every person trying to tell you the truth They constantly feed you imperialist er nonsense notice how fast they stopped coverage of the Ukrainian crash of a Malaysian airliner when the bashRussia approach started falling apart disappear inconvenient stories Bernie WHO generally manipulate you to accept the Ruling Class Narrative And against this background youre worried about Facebook trending Tue theghostofwmr It pains but I must agree with your comment The only conservative aspect of the modernday conservative is CON It would be against the laws of Moloch for a diedinthewoll Trotskyite to change his viewpoint on Liberty Like trying to mix oil water Do
