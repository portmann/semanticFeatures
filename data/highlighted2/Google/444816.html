by the Brexit sell off as well We think peak iPhone hatred will happen upon iPhone release and that long term oriented investors should wait for Apple to trade with an handle and then buy We think the iPhone is going to flop with sales and in the media and we think peak hatred for this phone is going to create an extraordinary buying opportunity in the high s prior to the iPhone narrative beginning Expectations for the iPhone have been extraordinarily low and likely for good reason The announcement that Apple NASDAQ AAPL was not going to be making any mass of upgrades to the phone has already turned off consumers us included to the concept of upgrading The while not branded a flop yet because we dont yet have sales data is certainly being questioned by the media more than any other model weve seen Heres a taste of what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL has offered on the iPhone Querying the phone on its own shows many articles calling it into question Querying the phone with the word flop or asking whether its worth the upgrade from the iPhone produces a litany of results Most are murky sounding at best Throughout the iPhone news cycle so far all we have been hearing about is the iPhone We have heard about how much better it is going to be and we have heard that it will be the upgrade worth waiting for We look forward to fantastic sales and an upgrade worth getting excited about from Apple with the iPhone but what does that mean for us now To quickly lay out some of the improvements Apple is offering with the iPhone it is rumored to have GB as the base option and a GB maximum option But it really looks as thought the iPhone is the model that both consumers and more importantly the media is going to be looking for People are looking for that stunning design upgrade perhaps incorporating a curved screen or a front phone face where almost all of the surface area is display Those seekers will have to wait for the next iteration of the iPhone In many ways the coming of the iPhone at this point in time is a perfect union with how the market is acting overall People generally just seem bemused and are waiting for something big to come along to shake them out of their seats We dont think this is going to happen for the market and we dont think the iPhone is going to be that product that does this for Apple So the release of the iPhone and this period in time may just be a match made in heaven But with mire and muck can sometimes come opportunity for those looking to stake their claim in a rock solid company for the long term We have no doubt especially backed by Mac and iPad that Apple will be a great investment over the course of the long term for years to come The iPhone may give those who missed the last upchurn cycle in AAPL stock their chance to enter We believe both media sentiment and Apple stock will both wax and wane with the release of the iPhone likely coming at a nice pullback for the markets we predict the markets will sell off another for sure at least and it will definitely come during a lull in excitement for Apple This sets up a period where the stock could keep falling as Apple churns ready to head into the iPhone media cycle which will probably start months to a year prior to its release We also predict the phone will be a smash hit We believe this is going to set up for an nadir of sorts when the iPhone could drag Apple to multiyear lows at the very same time that the market is also putting pressure on the company stock It is at this point that we believe the very beginning of sentiment change will happen moving into the iPhone and we believe this will be the point to go in and buy Apple Apple doesnt need a lot of pressure to create a buying opportunity because its PE is already constantly too low The ability to buy this company with a forward PE at near or under x would be an absolute gift We think the iPhone could make that happen We know that Apple is already suffering slightly due to the volatility coming from the United Kingdom exiting Europe There has been a small pullback in shares that we think is worth taking a small nibble at However we think that investors are going to get an opportunity to buy Apple in the high range once we hit an area called peak iPhone seven hatred We wouldnt be surprised if Buffett adds to his shares at this point as well We dont think actual hatred of the iPhone is going to be enormous but we do think it is going to get a serious play in the upcoming news cycle that accompanies the release The media has already branded the iPhone to be a failure before it has even launched and we think the media is going to pound this narrative mercilessly after the is released and moving forward from that point Catching Apple stock at peak iPhone hatred prior to the iPhone narrative starting is going to be the key we think Similar to the way people sell the news we think that there will be a peak moment of hatred right after the phones release that is going to drive Apple stock lower similar to the way the stock always winds up turning lower during the middle of product release events Well be
