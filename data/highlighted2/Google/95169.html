class='textDiv'>Payments Business Is A LowHanging Fruit Amazon Could Use To Drive Growth Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Amazon has operated payments services for years but the company is absent from the current boom in the epayments market Amazon is currently one of the smallest players in the payments market and couldnt monetize its extensive payments portfolio By rebranding its payment service and distancing itself from the marketplace business Amazon could grow revenues from an existing business One of the latest trends among technology companies is trying to expand revenues by adding ecommerce or online payment capabilities With these new capabilities companies like Facebook NASDAQ FB Twitter NYSE TWTR and Pinterest can increase traffic monetization keep users on the site and benefit from a portion of the sale Each of these social networking sites implemented the idea in a very similar way through a calltoaction button that drives users to Buy or Shop Now Facebook is one of the companies leading the effort to penetrate the ecommerce and online payment markets and tries to implement on top of the ecommerce features mentioned above as well as the PP money transfer through Messenger that could operate as an onlinemobile payment service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Apple OTCAPPL followed Facebook into the online payment market and recently launched their payment services to challenge existing players like PayPal Pending PYPL and Square With all the buzz and hype on every new development in this area I find it odd that Amazon NASDAQ AMZN is not making any move in the same direction Amazon has thrown to the air many ideas that were supposed to improve their business including shipment drones uberlike grocery delivery Kindle improvements AWSrelated issues and many more concepts good and bad However one lowhanging fruit that Amazon has not fully utilized is its payments portfolio which includes Amazon Payments and Amazon Local Register Years ago Amazon launched an electronic payment service to replace eBays NASDAQ EBAY PayPal and to gain additional revenues from transactions However while PayPal is widely used across the web and is a synonym for secure online payment Amazon Payments remain primarily within the Amazon turf and is hardly used in other sites as a secure payment processor Unlike eBay that leveraged PayPal to become an industry leader Amazon Payment lags behind PayPal Stripe and Braintree as shown in Chart below Last year Amazon expanded its payments portfolio and launched Amazon Local Register an inperson pointofsale service that allows merchants to accept credit cards in their brickandmortar stores Amazon Local Register competes with Square and PayPal Here and completes Amazons comprehensive offering for merchants that includes an ecommerce marketplace payment processing service and instore credit cards transactions Amazon suffers from the inherent problem that merchants consider Amazon as their rival and dont rush to do business with the company Unlike Square Stripe or PayPal which are perceived as standalone independent players that dont compete with the local merchants many retailers consider Amazons ecommerce platform as a risk to their business Amazon doesnt reveal how many transactions are paid using Amazon Payments but based on the fact that its not raising any questions and no serious investor considers it as competition to PayPal I infer that its revenues are not significant Amazon consolidated its payment services under a whollyowned subsidiary named Amazon Payments Inc This subsidiary owns Amazons Payment service Amazon Checkout and Amazon Local Register quite an impressive portfolio that can be easily compared to PayPal Theoretically PayPal which is owned by eBay for now could have faced the same problems as Amazon Payments however unlike Amazon Payments merchants are not intimidated by PayPal as they dont consider it a threat to their business PayPal is branded and perceived as a standalone payments company and not as an eBay subsidiary Amazon should copy that model and rebrand Amazon Payments without the Amazon to something else lets call it ZonPay By minimizing Amazons presence in ZonPay Amazon could help the payment service gain more customers both in ecommerce sites and instores locations and could move with these three actions Reach out to eBay once the PayPal spinoff is done and offer its services or some strategic alliance that would benefit both sides as probably other payment services will do Reach out to Etsy and Shopify to add ZonPay to their list of payment methods Aggressive transaction fees at the start to compete with PayPal Square Stripe Apple Pay and Android Pay Acquire Square or Stripe to increase its market penetration Such an acquisition will move ZonPay to become the number player in the market and start challenging PayPals dominance As companies like Apple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Facebook struggle to penetrate the ecommerce and online transactions markets Amazon has a vast payment portfolio that includes services for instore transactions online transactions and checkout solutions Amazon can do much more than it does to generate additional revenues from the payment business that is relatively easy for a company with such an impressive payment portfolio alongside with its endeavors in the shipment drones and hardware area Source Payments Business Is A LowHanging Fruit Amazon Could Use To
