secure for its customers This has been criticized as affording criminals and terrorists unfettered electronic communications Following Apple NASDAQ AAPL CEO Tim Cooks interview on Minutes Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton denounced Apple for its use of encryption that neither the government nor Apple can decrypt Apple is about to come under a much more serious attack in the United Kingdom if the Investigatory Powers Bill a sweeping codification of the Surveillance State is passed The UK bill threatens not only personal freedom but could force changes in Apples business model Apples use of socalled endtoend encryption has been sporadically criticized by government officials both in the US and abroad Cottons statement reflects the standard talking points of advocates of greater governmental surveillance If we apply a different legal standard to companies like Apple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Facebook NASDAQ FB we can expect them to become the preferred messaging services of child pornographers drug traffickers and terrorists alike How could anyone be in favor of child pornography drug trafficking or terrorism These talking points are echoed in the forward to the Draft Investigatory Powers Bill by the Home Secretary Theresa May Powers to intercept communications acquire communications data and interfere with equipment are essential to tackle child sexual exploitation to dismantle serious crime cartels take drugs and guns off our streets and prevent terrorist attacks Apple sent a letter to the Parliamentary committee in charge of the bill according to the BBC detailing its concerns Most prominent was the concern that the new bill might require Apple to provide a back door to any encrypted data that might be in Apples possession The BBC article was careful to state what appears to be one of the selling points of the new bill that it doesnt expand surveillance powers that already exist but merely consolidates them under a single legal authorization Current legislation demands that companies take reasonable steps to provide the contents of communications on production of a warrant but that has not been interpreted as requiring firms to redesign their systems to make it possible The government had briefed at the time that the bill was published that the legislation did not constitute any change to existing legislation After reading the draft bill I can understand Apples concern At the very least the bill describes what will surely become the model of the surveillance state of the future The bill authorizes government law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept all forms of communications for individuals targeted by a warrant It also allows the government to hack the computing devices of individuals subject to a warrant in order to compromise those systems to facilitate data collection socalled equipment interference These powers also are expanded to widespread and indiscriminate versions of the above the socalled bulk powers So the government of the UK will be empowered to indiscriminately intercept communications hack into computers and cell phones virtually without limit The fact that the new bill makes clear that this is merely the status quo is hardly reassuring Apple is concerned that it might be required to assist the government in the bulk equipment interference authorized by the bill Depending on how the language of the bill is interpreted Apple could be required to provide encryption back doors to facilitate individual or bulk interception of communications and individual or bulk equipment interference Its not clear how the UK government would take Apples standard defense in such matters that it cant provide back doors that dont exist Only Outlaws Will Have Encryption Apples Fight for the privacy rights of its customers is first and foremost a matter of principle that Apple believes in Tim Cook has made clear on numerous occasions that Apple should act according to principle not merely selfish profit motive By all appearances Apples concern for the privacy of its customers also is good business Apple customers are assured that their personal data and communications are as free of compromise as is currently technically feasible Apple Pay itself depends on endtoend encryption to ensure the privacy and security of transactions This has been a major selling point of the technology that has promoted adoption by consumers merchants and card issuers Increasingly the technology of endtoend encryption is becoming a fundamental underpinning of the digital economy Its obvious to those of us who are at all familiar with the technology what will happen if such strong encryption is outlawed by national governments Encryption will simply be driven underground and its prohibition will create a thriving black market in the technology as such prohibitions are wont to do Law abiding consumers will be denied the protection of strong encryption while criminals will continue to make use of it In case it hasnt quite emerged in the course of the article let me make my bias on the subject explicit I regard the ongoing encroachment of the right of privacy to be a fundamental threat to all human rights The surveillance apparatus that is being created in countries such as the US and UK is always depicted as being for the purposes of protecting citizens and not political control But once the apparatus is created the potential exists for it to be perverted in the future for just such political control The surveillance state has always been an essential component of the totalitarian state Apples stance on encryption is just one small battle against the surveillance state but an important one that it must undertake in my view This is acting on principle not for corporate gain But Apple investors should be aware that there are significant risks If the UK bill is written or interpreted to mean that Apple is required to provide a back door for its encryption technology it will wreak some havoc with Apples current business model Apple would have no choice but to comply with the legal directives of the UK government including an extraterritoriality provision that would require it to unlock encrypted data even if it resides outside the UK The UKs action would have a domino effect in which other national governments including the US would seize upon the UK precedent to demand similar access Once again Apple would have no choice but to comply with any legal directive The resulting patchwork of conflicting national claims and directives would make conducting business internationally more costly Apple would have to reengineer its current encryption system possibly multiple times in order to satisfy different national governments In order to avoid running afoul of extraterritoriality claims Apple would need to maintain separate data centers in each country in which it operates Of course even that is an imperfect solution to the problem of crossborder communications I doubt there is a solution if the bordering countries have conflicting surveillance requirements Most importantly Apple would lose one of its most important business discriminators This is a discriminator that influences virtually every aspect of Apples online businesses including iTunes and the App Store I cant even begin to put a price tag on this impact except to point out that in fiscal Apples Services product category generated billion in revenue So Apple Apple investors and Apples customers have a lot at stake in the privacy battle Apple should probably start defining some form of contingency plan in case things break the way it appears they will in the UK The Investigatory Powers Bill is almost certain to pass Its big selling feature is that it provides for added safeguards against abuse of the investigatory powers including criminal penalties for their misuse The blue pill gets a candy coating Despite the threat contained in the Investigatory Powers Bill I still regard Apple as a buy Apples defense of the privacy of its customers is an important positive discriminator for the company Apples stance on privacy will be remembered by Apples customers even if it is forced to compromise it We only use your contact details to reply to your
