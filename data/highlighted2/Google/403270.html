from deciding the quickest path to filling their very large market cap hole is by taking a small piece of the apps in their very large apps ecosystem Not many companies can lay claim to losing as much value in months as the entire market cap of the worlds largest retailer and still remain standing But thats exactly whats happened to Apple NASDAQ AAPL over the last months Apple has subtracted billion from its market cap about billion more than WalMart NYSE WMT is worth With a market cap today of billion Apples clearly no slouch either But instead of talking about its potential to become the first trilliondollar company the conversation has suddenly shifted to Apples next act and how it will keep its mojo moving along in a postJobs world I laid out my thesis last week with respect to Apples struggles by giving you my take on why Apple seems to now play fast and loose with the numbers iPhone unit sales down percent Overall the sales of Apples flagship products all products sprung from the genius of Steve Jobs are down percent The growth engine that Apple imagined would be China also is tubing down percent or billion This along with the Chinese governments decision to shut down iTunes and iBooks caused Carl Icahn to sell every last one of his million shares in a down market and prompt Tim Cook to fire up the corporate jet and pay a visit to Chinese President Xi The other growth engine services that everyone touted as promising really wasnt all that great either Yes Tim Cook reported that Apple Services posted a percent increase from Q to Q with an extra billion in revenue quarter over quarter But he glossed over the fact that percent of that revenue was thanks to a one time patent settlement with Samsung OTCSSNLF Its tough Their margin comes from the sale of devices iPhone was a home run until it wasnt People are holding onto their phones longer and there has to be a real WOW factor for people to trade their plus phones in every year or two even with the Apple installment plan For anyone who bought an iPhone two years ago to think about buying an iPhone it needs to do something hugely different than what is available via a software upgrade And Apple learned with Apple Pay how hard that is to do And with Apple TV how hard it is to make all the content providers toe the line The hill that they have to climb every year year in and year out is slaying it with new versions of the iPhone Unless they find new ways to make up the difference And here are a few of the ideas that Id be kicking around if I were in Mr Cooks shoes Everyone knows that Apple controls a massive apps ecosystem More than million apps are in its Apps Store which have been downloaded more than billion times since it launched in Last year App Annie reported that even though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL had twice as many downloads as Apple did million to million Apple racks up percent more in sales Developers like the Apple platform for that reason they stand a better chance of making money That means that even though most apps are free and ad supported more of those that arent are downloaded by people with iPhones willing and able to pay a few bucks for a premium version of their favorite gaming weather business app Apple said that last year on average iPhone users downloaded apps The latest Nielsen study tells us that most people only use of them and concentrate percent of their activity in five Facebook NASDAQ FB <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Search YouTube and Messenger Click to enlargeThe that people tend to use are those who are also aligned with routine activities and in some cases are also daily habits such as checking email the weather and stock prices tracking bank transactions downloading boarding passes getting the news paying for coffee ordering an Uber Private UBER finding places to eat and making a reservation At the moment Apple only monetizes digital apps taking percent of the sale of games digital content photos etc But theres nothing stopping Apple from deciding that the quickest path to filling their very large market cap hole is by taking a small piece of the apps in their very large apps ecosystem One possibility is that every time someone orders an Uber uses their Starbucks or Dunkin app to pay for coffee and a jelly donut orders a Dominos pizza with extra pepperoni from their app buys something from eBay Amazon NASDAQ AMZN or Walmartcom booked a hotel room via the Hotelscom app bought a round trip ticket to Cupertino from the American Airlines app Apple could decide that it would like a piece of those transactions Just like it did when it launched Apple Pay The big difference though is that unlike Apple Pay consumers actually use these apps and conduct commerce using them Take Uber for example They had about billion in revenue in that occurred on apps on either Apple or Android devices Lets say Apple wanted to be nice and only charge percent instead of the percent it charges digital apps for using its wonderful device and app store That would be a cool million a year just from Uber and all pure profit A few more of those if Apple could get away with it would go a long way to filling the revenue gap and boosting market cap Suppose Apple charged every app just for being part of the app ecosystem So Facebook Messenger OpenTable The Weather Channel banking apps third party wallets like PayPal any and all apps just for the ability to be in an ecosystem thats used by people who have the potential to drive revenue their way For example Facebook reported just last week that consumers are now spending nearly an hour a day on their platform which is of course on the home screen of hundreds of millions of peoples iPhones Facebook has worked diligently over the last several years to be much more than just the place where people keep in touch with their friends Its increasingly where people get news discover new products and even buy stuff Suppose Apple decided that it was going to charge Facebook for taking up residence on the consumers home screen Apple today decides who gets real estate on their phone Ever wonder why you dont get junky apps on the iPhone like you see on Android phones including ones from the carrier that provides the service Apple said they couldnt be there Wonder why you cant delete Wallet or Music even if you cant or dont use it Apple has decided that too So they could just as easily decide that to be on the home screen apps need to pay up even if they arent directly making money like Pandora does Heres a calculation for you In Q Facebook earned billion in mobile ad revenue Lets suppose half of that was on Apple devices which is likely Thats billion and annualized its about billion Lets suppose Apple insisted on a per user charge that added up to million Would Facebook blink Maybe not and if everyone was paying the tax they would all just pass it on to advertisers After all Apple charges <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>about billion to be the main search partner for the iPhone Perhaps Apple could decide to be less obvious and start charging for other things like having access to its toolkits each time theres an upgrade for the more established apps like Amazon and Facebook Or for preferred placement in the Apps Store Its rumored that Apple will add search to its App Store With that search may also come the opportunity for Apple to monetize preferred placement like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>does with AdWords And given the heavy dependency that all of these apps have on being accessible within the Apple ecosystem there wouldnt be much any of them could do but pay the tariff At least in the short term and probably in the long term as well unless Android really improves its app game and gets a lot better clientele The apps at greatest risk of being charged of course are those where consumers spend most of their time and use the most as part of their daily routines Facebook <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play YouTube Messenger or spend the most money with eBay Amazon and WalMart on the retail side Of course these are also the same players that have options of their own to pursue BUT LOTS OF THE BIG GUYS HAVE OPTIONS Facebook could decide to get into the devices business too and fork the Android operating system just like Amazon has done It could create its own app store Facebook by the way just hired a hardware expert from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>which makes you wonder if they might be thinking along these same lines too On that phone would be Messenger with its own commerce engine Instagram and WhatsApp With billion people coming to Facebook each month million to Messenger million to WhatsApp and million to Instagram who knows Facebook could become the hot new mobile ecosystem The Fire Phone was a big bust Amazon decided that it wanted to create a forked version of Android and force developers to write apps to it The classic chicken and egg dilemma revved into high gear No consumers not a whole lot of developer interest No developer interest not a lot of consumer appetite for the phone But its early days and one bust doesnt mean that Amazon is out of the game Because Amazon is still very much in the ecosystem business Its got a content ecosystem with its streaming media platform a marketplace ecosystem that includes Amazon and multiple third parties a BB ecosystem thats driven billion in sales between buyers and sellers a device ecosystem with Echo Dot Dash and a software and AI ecosystem with Alexa and the Dash Replenishment Services and a logistics system that enables the efficient delivery of products purchased Amazon seems pretty focused on reinventing commerce never mind retail Today its marketplace drives about percent of all products sold and some estimate percent of its revenue But it seems to be thinking about marketplaces in a very different way by enabling commerce using a consumers Amazons credentials on other sites that provide access to a curated collection of goods and services Its latest tie up with Moda Operandi a designer marketplace makes it possible for a consumer to access that site and pay with her Amazon credentials in one click is an example of how Amazon is stretching the definition of marketplace Alexa is leveraging the power of voice to enable contextual and conversational commerce to happen Now totally unbundled from the Echo device Alexa is using the power of AI and voice to contextualize data thats input into apps or via the Web via any device As commerce expands to a variety of endpoints in the home the office the car and on mobile devices Amazon could redefine ecosystems and apps and devices to access both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>could just keep on keepin on doubling down on making all handset manufacturers their BFFs including persuading Samsung to ditch its own OS The appeal of Apple is the status associated with owning an Apple device its why China is so attractive But theres nothing like the thought of making less money on Apple via an Apple tariff for apps and developers to decide that a spiffy new Fill in the blank brand of handset that provides access to the apps they want to use is all they want and need And for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and retail a potentially extra value add to pursue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Search may in fact be the most powerful app around THE APP AND THE ECOSYSTEM MAY NOT RULE THEM ALL Despite what Apple would like to be the reality according to research done by Morgan Stanley the mobile browser audience is anything but declining in fact its growing on average two times faster than app audiences across the Top mobile Web properties that they examined Click to enlargeWhere this is most relevant is retail where the browserapp divide is most stark and for the obvious reason Consumers may download the WalMart Amazon or Target app because they use them the most but most consumers shop at many more stores or at least want to browse at more than just those three For a consumer who is looking for black linen dress bracelet sleeves shell pop over to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>to search since it gives her the entire world to search from The Morgan Stanley data supports that too Ninetyfive percent of the mobile traffic to retail sites is being driven by the mobile browser not apps and browser audiences are six times larger than app audiences Take a look at this chart Even the big guys like Nordstrom Macys Kohls and Staples which recognize that mobile is whats driving their traffic and sales are getting that traffic via the mobile browser either because the consumer typed in the name of the store or a product and found her way there Now you know why Apple is working furiously on a mobile browser solution Apple Pay in app isnt really cutting it since most retailers outside of Amazon not Apple Pay eBay not Apple Pay and WalMart Apple Pay arent driving a lot of sales via their mobile apps It also explains why the Checkout Conversion performance of most retailers is so poor Their consumers are using mobile to get to their sites but not to close the loop since checking out is too painful Nine years ago Apple introduced the world to the notion of a device and a software platform that put a bunch of useful tools called apps at our fingertips Nine years and million apps later the iPhone has become an access device to a few of those apps that consumers use a lot Some of them like Facebook and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Amazon for commerce have powerful ecosystems of their own that today are accessed via another very powerful ecosystem Apples Apple no doubt has noticed My guess is that Apple will start looking to the App Store for more revenue they have got to be thinking of ways to diversify their risk if the iPhone doesnt save their bacon and the Apple Watch keeps struggling They wont be as brazen as to hit all the apps at once but I would bet we will see more and more steps to make money from the app ecosystem Then theres another play which weve seen with Apple Music If theres a great profitable app that runs on the iOS platform like streaming music maybe Apple can muscle its way into the business and get some profit that way Apple Music was partly a defensive move given the impact of streaming on their download business But there are lots of other areas Apple could get into where it can leverage all the advantages of owning the home screen and importantly not pay the tax everyone else has to pay to be on the platform Maybe thats a travel app or a finance app or a competitor to Uber a restaurant reservations app something that has universal appeal and represents a way into a revenue opportunity that Apple can control and negotiate a hard bargain But as much as Tim Cook claims the recent revenue decline is much ado about nothing investors think it is and he probably does as well So dont count anything out And if you have a business that depends on an app that depends on iPhone users be forewarned we may be well past April th but the tax man cometh Tagged Technology Personal Computers Expert Insight </div></body></html>
