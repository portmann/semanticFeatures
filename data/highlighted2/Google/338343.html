for developers Intel NASDAQ INTC is developing a wearable AR augmented reality headset A person familiar with Intels headset plans says Intel is collaborating with Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT for its wearable headset initiative according to The WSJ The news came on the heels of another report which said Microsoft will start shipping its MR mixed reality device HoloLens to developers on March The PC may be dying but the Wintel alliance could get a new lease on life with the advent of ARMR headsets Although AR and MR arent the same there are similarities Both AR and MR devices create a mixed environment for the viewer by superimposing computergenerated images over realworld objects Growth opportunities for both Intel and Microsoft Why Microsofts HoloLens Could Be A Huge Success TechCrunch reported that Microsoft will sell HoloLens to developers in the US and Canada for per unit Microsoft will also introduce a few apps for HoloLens such as Skype optimized for HoloLens and a few games in the initial phase HoloLens is capable of delivering VR virtual reality by generating holographic images It can then add the holographic images over the images taken from the physical world which falls in the realm of AR Therefore HoloLens is an MR device HoloLens is different from Alphabets NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Glass which is a pure AR device Since HoloLens could be more appealing to users it could see wider adoption than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Glass While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Glass can just add textbased information on top of realworld objects an MR device like HoloLens can provide a degree D computing experience This can even become the computing platform of the future rendering your PCs laptops or even smartphones obsolete An MR device like HoloLens can superimpose D holographic images in the realworld scene HoloLens will help users communicate and interact in new ways involving real D environment unlike D on a D surface like your PC Users will be able to move back and forth around an object which isnt possible using todays computing devices You can experience Skype on the wall of your room actually its possible to do any computing work anywhere beyond the computer screen Users can even navigate around the Earth inside their room wearing HoloLens Microsofts HoloLens will have a bit CPU made by Intel as well as Microsofts own custombuilt HPU holographic processing unit The HPU will take care of developing real D imagery by creating the illusion of D in a users brain to learn more about this click here Microsofts Alex Kipman said HoloLens has seethrough holographic lenses that use an advanced optical projection system to generate multidimensional fullcolor holograms with very low latency so you can see holographic objects in your world HoloLens will create a new revenue stream for Microsoft Since the device has the potential to establish itself as a standalone computing platform I believe Microsofts revenue will rise significantly once HoloLens goes mainstream The current version of HoloLens is powered by an Intel processor as mentioned above In addition Intel will launch its own AR device which of course will be powered by its own processor Intels D camera technology RealSense will be used in developing the AR headset The question is why a processor company will develop and sell AR headsets For Intel creating devices is nothing new Remember Intels megalaunch of smart bracelet MICA at a New York Fashion Week Further a smart sportsbra powered by an Intel chip via its Curie module was unveiled in a NYFW a year later All of these are part of Intels marketing strategy And the purpose of developing the AR headset is nothing different Via developing the devices and subsequently launching them at major events which influence people Intel conveys an important message to devicemakers Intel wants to say something like this If we are inside your device will succeed The launch of HoloLens to developers powered by an Intel processor however has a different implication Given HoloLens potential to become a standalone computing platform Intels association with Microsoft signifies the reincarnation of the Wintel alliance Reshaping the reality via AR VR or MR and the Internet of Things are fundamentally different However they have one thing in common which is developing robust tracking technologies led by sensors Intel is investing heavily in the development of tracking technologies for creating an augmented as well as connected world Take the example of its Curie module mentioned above Its a tiny piece of hardware aimed at powering a host of wearable and other consumerindustrial devices Intels revenues will grow by leaps and bounds when its hardware will power thousands of tomorrows devices The rebirth of Wintel could be the best advertisement for Intel no additional marketing strategy would be necessary When Microsoft launched its HoloLens program earlier in most people didnt take it seriously However with Microsoft inviting developers into the program HoloLens is drawing serious attention of not only developers but the media and general public as well Intels collaboration with Microsoft is an interesting development which could be a winwin for both I wrote this article myself
