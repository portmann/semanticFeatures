President Putin and Prime Minister Medvedev have been photographed on numerous occasions holding gold bars and coins A major bear market trulyhasstarted and were going to see the fraudfrom the past six years unwind in a glorious albeit inconsistent fashion Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Even though we are an institutional brokerage firm we always keep a weather eye on the state of retail investing in the US There is of course the old saw that this batch of buyers doesnt get involved until the top therefore it makes sense to see if they are getting too Bulled upThen there is the fact that retail Cult stocks can hold premium valuations far longer than those without such sponsorship To get a look at retails top stocks we went to Fidelitys website which shows to anyone interested what names their retail customers traded most today From the top of this list AAPL orders better to buy FB orders much better to buy GPRO orders better to buy and so forth The rest of the list is in this note but we also took a look at another vector how often does the general public <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>a particular symbol over time and who exactly is doing the searching Thats where the notion of Retail interest in a stock gets well interesting As it turns out the vast majority of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>searches for AAPL TSLA and MSFT come from the cities where these companies are headquartered If thats good or bad well leave it up to you to decide Apples stock is trading down after hours as I write this note which likely means thattomorrowsnews will include a healthy dose of Apple has to buy something Some company with a large addressable market OK theyve been saying that for a while now I know But at least some market commentators will say the lack of transparency on Apple Watch sales means the Cupertinobased company should enter new markets and jump start that initiative with a meaningful acquisition Will it be in automobiles Or other electronic gadgets Social networking Over the years Apples cash hoard has made it Potential Buyer in what must be thousands of investment banking pitch books to a slew of companies public and private So what happens when you type Apple buys into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>The search engine has an autofill function that tries to finish this phrase based on what other users have entered before you Most of the autofill answers include things like Beats the headphone company or Linx the maker of camera components Both of those are announced transactions so that makes sense After that Googles users have a pretty wide arrange of ideas presented here with no additional comment Tesla Android Samsung and Spotify The institutional side of Wall Street often looks at retail investors the type that create such lists with a combination of a bemused and jaundiced eye On the one hand retail sponsorship of a stock is a powerful factor in creating a Cult following and a premium equity valuation Steve Jobs Lee Iacocca Andy Grove Lou Gerstner and Jack Welch are historical examples and you can likely name a few of more recent vintage as well And yet for their ability to identify superstar individuals retail investors have a reputation for getting too optimistic at the top and too cautious at the bottom One exercise I regularly perform is to look at Fidelitys website where the online retail brokerage lists daily the top names in terms of buysell orders If you are a client minimum you can actually see the top names but well respect their terms of use and just outline what is visible to the outside world Here are the key takeaways from todays action Retail investors still trade a lot of single stocks rather than exchange traded funds In Fidelitys Top there is only one ETF listed NUGT a X leveraged play on gold miners Trading was pretty even on this name today with roughly orders each to buy and sell The top names in terms of order flow today were Apple Facebook and GoProTo give you a little sense of history we did the same analysis three months ago and the top three names were Apple Netflix and Facebook NFLX was the thmost traded name today with PayPal slotting in at Every name on Fidelitys Top list had more Buy orders than Sell orders today except one Microsoft with just over Buys and Sells The rest of the list after the six already mentioned are IBM TSLA MSFT and LOCK The last one isnt commonly on the list but todays drop in price evidently brought in some purchase interest Last time around months ago when we did this exercise the remainder of the list was Schlumberger GE Alibaba American Express ATT and Bank of America So we know what retail investors think Apple should buy and we can track which individual stocks have their favor but what about some more information like who searches for AAPL and NFLX and GOOG Where do the individuals who have an interest in public market stocks live There is a way to find out just look at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Trends the online tool that allows you to track how many times a search user enters any word or phrase Not only will you get a time series of the frequency of the search but also where the search was done Heres what we found out for a few of the names mentioned above AAPL Over the last months <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>users have been searching less for this symbol From a peak last September indexed to the last full week count is just No we havent done an indepth regression of what this means to stock prices so maybe this is just noise What isnt just chatter is the search user location for AAPL virtually all of it comes from Cupertino Sunnyvale and Santa Clara In other words plenty of people have a deep interest in Apples stock and they probably work for the company or its ecosystem NFLX Interest in Netflix stock peaked just last week in terms of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>search trends Unlike AAPL the geographic locations of this search are quite diverse including heavy traffic from San Francisco New York San Jose and Seattle TSLA Search interest here is stable according to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>search trend data Like Apples search concentration near its home office almost all the search interest comes from Fremont CA the site of the companys manufacturing plant with a few other California cities mixed in Mountain View Sunnyvale and San Francisco MSFT Search interest for Microsofts symbol is steady over the past year and interest in MSFT is very heavily concentrated in Washington State The only city that cracks the top for MSFT searches is San Francisco but on a scale of Kirkland near the Redmond Microsoft HQ it is a GOOG and GOOGL Taken together interest in Googles two symbols is modestly lower over the last year Geographic interest is quite diverse with New York taking second place for GOOG ahead of San Francisco in fourth If you would like to see how much the search data matches up with your ideas of how popular these names are among retail investors or the market as a whole just go to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Trends and enter the relevant symbols We didnt try symbols like FB or GM because they have other nonequity market meanings or online uses And again theres no backtest that can prove the data is predictive of future stock price moves We use the work exactly as weve discussed here as a piece of the retail investor mosaic Wed The Delicate Genius Wed Waylon Bits for each buyer there is a corresponding seller so you have offsetting positions We have no stake in whether prices rise or decline Rather were running a flat or relatively flat matched book What is commonly out there is that someone is manipulating the market Its not part of our business model it would be wrong and we dont do it Wed Justme The orders are between Fidelity customers and the entire market hence only a subset of all orders Such a subset does not need to balance Addtionally there is the question of whether the data contains orders ENTERED or orders EXECUTED Can anyone answer that question Wed KnuckleDraggerX Retail investors really are the new cargo cult having sacrifices investing in hopes the magic will return Its a sad part of the human condition is that herd mentality that drives so much of this Wed TheRideNeverEnds Well today is a great day to pile on moar Apple stock it hasnt been this cheap for a week and probably wont be this cheap ever again As soon as the malicious stock selling subsides its going straight to the moon Wed lasvegaspersona Wed El Oregonian I misunderstood and thought they said ABLE on the OTCBB instead of APPL and the fortune was dumped therein It has since drifted down to Oy veh Wed The Delicate Genius Wed Bitcoin Meiser You are right AAPL is undervalued and I would buy in a normal situation But this market is far from normal and its about to go down and might take Apple down even more with it despite Apples good fundamentals Wed reTARD When a brokerage firm and mass sentiment recommends something to their clients isnt it best to do the opposite If anything not that Id be buying one may probably consider MSFT especially as a contraian if we were in actually functioning markets Wed cdude Yes last HO was June th One of such occurrences since So if this one turns out predicting a crash than a HO will have predicted out of crashes Wed ZeroPoint ENRON TYCO GLOBAL CROSSING WORLDCOM etc and a worthless investment drone was trying to persuade me to stuff the proceeds from the sale of all my lifetime entrepreneur equity into these great investments Never believe hype from the people who are trying to sell you the stuff that THEY profit from whether you win or lose Are the statistics based on plain order count or order share volume or implied order dollar volume Are the statistics based on orders ENTERED or orders EXCUTED why do I asK Because limit orders often are not executed The meaning of the numbers depends heaviliy on knowing exactly what the numbers represent Not knowing the answers makes the data much less usable Wed cashtoash Wed mpath
