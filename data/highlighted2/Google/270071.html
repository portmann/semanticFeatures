class='textDiv'>Apple Pay Scales The Great Wall Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Apple Pay will be coming to the Peoples Republic of China through a partnership with China UnionPay China UnionPay is a stateowned enterprise and the only domestic credit card provider and transaction processor in the PRC Apple will gain a nearterm competitive advantage in contactless instore payments over Chinese smartphone makers Apples NASDAQ AAPL announcement of a partnership with China UnionPay to bring Apple Pay to the Peoples Republic of China represents a huge win for Apple as well as a milestone in Apples relations with the PRC In effect the PRC government has accepted that domestic smart phone makers such as Huawei cant offer an equivalent system and werent going to be able to do so any time soon Partnering with foreign smartphone makers was the best way to get in on the lucrative mobile payments market which Alipay has dominated At the same time that Apple made its announcement Samsung OTCSSNLF also announced a similar arrangement with China UnionPay CUP to bring its Samsung Pay system to the PRC in the same time frame of early The PRC government appears to be making sure that Apple and Samsung start off on an equal footing The PRCs stance also makes it clear that this was a must win for Apple simply to stay competitive with Samsung China UnionPay is the only domestic credit and debit card network in China and is essentially a state owned monopoly through the PRC central bank the Peoples Bank of China According to the Apple announcement UnionPay has issued over billion cards As the only domestic card service merchant acceptance in China is widespread CUP is accepted at more than million merchants globally according to its international website Due to its huge usage in China CUP has the largest share of the global payments market in terms of transaction amount as the graphic below shows Because Apple Pay is centered around credit and debit cards and doesnt try to replace the existing card processing system a partnership with CUP was really the only path forward for Apple in China Foreign card issuers such as Mastercard NYSE MA are supposedly being allowed into the PRC but the government has been dragging its feet on this point for years Most importantly CUP has been upgrading its point of sale terminals with its Quickpass NFC system A crucial element of the partnership with Apple and Samsung is that Apples NFC enabled smart phones and Apple Watch will be able to use Quickpass terminals providing the same ease of use as is available in the US Working through the compatibility issues with Quickpass as well as CUPs payment processing system undoubtedly was a significant technical hurdle that prolonged the process of concluding the partnership agreement The mobile payments system Alipay a spinoff from Alibaba NYSE BABA is often pointed to as the competitor for Apple Pay Not exactly Alipay is more like Paypal NASDAQ PYPL and dominates mobile and online payments in China with an share of third party payments as of according to Bloomberg However the number of brick and mortar merchants that accept Alipay is very limited at according to the article This puts Alipay at a disadvantage in an important usage scenario for Apple Pay of convenient instore payments using the iPhone or Apple Watch Chinese Android based smartphones are left with Alipay or Tencent OTCPKTCEHY as the only instore payment option since Alphabets NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Android Pay is not available in the PRC along with many other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>services Although Alipay is dominant in online payments the ease of using Apple Pay for online payments with devices such as iPad and iPhone will probably make Apple Pay the default option for most Chinese users of those devices The important consideration for Apple investors is that this isnt really about competing with Alipay Alipay will undoubtedly remain dominant in mobile payments in the PRC simply by virtue of the huge number of Android phones running the Alipay app The important competition for Apple in the PRC is the competition between iPhone and other smartphones Apple Pay will be a significant advantage compared to generic white box Android phones that dont even have fingerprint scanners so that the use of Alipay will be cumbersome at best The Alipay user will have to unlock the phone open the Alipay app etc This is not nearly as frictionless as Apple Pay Huawei was reported to support Alipay with its fingerprint scanner in the Ascend Mate but such support appears to be spotty among Chinese Android devices Xiaomi offers a fingerprint scanner on the Redmi Note which has been hailed as a major push into mobile payments however Mi Wallet apparently similar to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Wallet was still being rolled out as of November This leaves Samsung Pay as the most significant competitor for Apple Pay How significant is open to question Samsung Pay certainly felt like a hastily thrown together copy of Apple Pay when it was announced some time after Apple Pay was rolled out I doubt that Samsung Pay will constitute a significant discriminator on behalf of Samsungs smartphones compared to iPhone The partnership with CUP enables an important iPhone functionality that was heretofore largely denied users within the PRC This will enhance the value of iPhone compared to generic Android smartphones and make it an even more desirable upgrade For the most part domestic Android smartphone makers are now disadvantaged due to the lack of equivalent Apple Pay capability and the inability to incorporate Googles Android Pay The fact that all iPhone and s devices will receive this capability retroactively will also be a plus for Apple since it conveys that buying Apples technology provides a measure of protection from obsolescence In the past year the rise of domestic smartphone makers such as Huawei and Xiaomi has been seen as the most important threat to Apples rapid growth in China Now the Chinese government has handed Chinese consumers a reason to prefer Apple or Samsung This was clearly not done out of altruism but a desire to position a stateowned enterprise to compete more effectively in the burgeoning mobile payments market that Alipay has dominated The domestic smartphone makers will now scramble to come up with their own mobile payments solutions but this will take time A solution like Apple Pay requires an elegant combination of hardware and software security features in order to achieve its level of security Clearly the Chinese government believes that this level of security is necessary in a mobile payments system Duplicating Apple Pay will take some time This is time that Apple and Samsung will undoubtedly put to good use I expect the market share of both companies in the PRC to grow in the next two quarters This underscores my belief that Apples iPhone sales in Greater China will continue to fuel the companys growth in calendar I continue to regard Apple as a buy Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not
