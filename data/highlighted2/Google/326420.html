household name not just in the United States but around the world However there has been quite the debate surrounding the stock as of late Some argue that the company has reached such a massive portion of the market that its going to be incredibly hard to grow from here Others argue that were just seeing the beginning of the FB growth story Personally Im on the just seeing the beginning side One of the biggest reasons for this is the fact that Facebook is constantly working to grow whether they are growing users or growing revenue For example there was a recent report that shows that FB is working on the revenue growth side of the equation at the moment Today well talk about the companys plans and why we can expect to see incredible growth out of FB moving forward Facebook Has A Plan For Growing Revenue When it comes to Facebook were talking about a company that is a revenue growth artist Every time Ive had doubts about the companys ability to drive revenue those doubts have proven to be unwarranted Time and time again FB proves its ability to drive more revenue and theyre doing it again When it comes to Facebook we see ads on the social network on the mobile app and more However recently leaked documents show that the company is looking to drive further revenue from mobile in the one place that were not seeing ads quite yet FB is looking to bring ads to the mobile messenger app To give you an idea of just how big this is Facebooks mobile messenger app currently has million monthly active users That is a massive audience and gives this idea huge potential for growth Another Reason To Be Bullish On Facebook The plans to monetize the mobile messenger app are Facebooks most recent way to grow revenue However theres another possibly even bigger reason to be bullish on FB Think about it Facebook has created an incredible brand for itself The company started as a private social network When the private network became public the user base on the network exploded and Facebook quickly became the most popular social network online This was great but the company didnt start there Soon we started to see instant messaging capabilities the ability to play games with friends videos and more Over the years FB grew to be far more than a social network Today Facebook has become a way of life for several people around the world In fact the company now has more than a billion users and is continuing to grow Now the company is branching out even further while maintaining the social network the company is focusing on consumer products most notably virtual reality All in all FB is a force to be reckoned with and will continue to grow Find out how you can trade stocks like the pros without major time commitments Moving forward Im expecting to see further bullish activity out of Facebook The reality is that no matter where or how you look when it comes to FB youre going to see overwhelmingly positive news Strong users strong revenue growth strong earnings great plans for expansion and a brilliant mind leading the company are just a few of the reasons that this stock is going to soar All in all FB is a great company and one that investors are likely to see strong gains from Buy FB Stock from Modest Money Recommended Brokers Get in free trade commissions per trade Trade free for days per trade If you enjoyed this post please consider
