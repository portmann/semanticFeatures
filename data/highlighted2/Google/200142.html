definition and use of Free Cash Flow is both correct and contributing to better insight As the unique aspects of Amazons business model become more apparent its financial reporting will inevitably become more transparent turning skepticism into admiration and finally higher valuation While Transparent is a richly awarded Comedy in Amazons NASDAQ AMZN Original TV Series having received Emmy Awards and two Golden Globes so far transparency is not usually associated with Amazons style of financial reporting However harsh criticism that Amazon is cooking up the books should be dismissed Recently a highly critical tone was struck again in a Seeking Alpha article written by John Spaid under the title Capital Lease Confusion Amazons Financial Engineering Strategy for Amazon Web Services It harks back to another article already published in December of last year by SA contributor Slim Shady with the title Understanding How Amazons Use of Capital Leases Overstates Its Cash Flow Metrics Although both articles reveal profound knowledge of financial accounting they also in my humble opinion demonstrate a myopic focus on accounting practices and a neglect of some unique features of Amazons business model In both articles it is being claimed that Amazon deliberately overstates its Free Cash Flow figure by making use of capital leases to finance a big chunk of its capital spending on Property Plant and Equipment PPE Capex financed by capital leases as they correctly state never shows up as a cash outlay in the operating cash flow but are dealt with in the financing section of the Cash Flow Statement As Free Cash Flow is defined as cash from operations minus capex free cash flow is overstated by this same amount of capex as well Moreover as all capex appears on the asset side on the balance sheet including the part financed by capital lease which is capitalized all depreciation on PPE is added back to the operating cash flow and consequently included in the free cash flow Thus capital lease accounting gives rise to double instances of overstating part of capex is not included as cash outlay whereas all depreciation is added back to the operating cash flow The authors admit that strictly speaking Amazon is doing nothing wrong but should be less vocal when it shows off its FCF in presentations and during conference calls While Amazons use of FCF may be formally correct they contend that in its unannotated version it is grossly and intentionally misleading In my opinion it is a difficult position to defend that a correct application of accounting principles can be at the same time highly misleading In spite of all the harsh words used and suspicions made the accusation that Amazon is cooking up the book cannot be substantiated Amazons three measures of Free Cash Flow It is all about the definition of FCF one uses There are different concepts of FCF and in the case of Amazon three of them are especially relevant In its SEC K reports Amazon takes great effort in annotating the FCF concept it uses In fact it explicitly reports the FCF at three different levels which logically follow from each other the classic FCF operating cash minus out of cash capital spending the same as the classic FCF but minus repayments on capital and financial leases and the classic FCF minus all capex irrespective of being paid out of cash or financed by a capital lease agreement Applied to the FY figures the FCF million FCF million while FCF minus million There is no mystery or concealment It is for everyone to see and free to interpret in the best way he can Now we should not expect every investor to read the SEC K report from cover to cover but we can be sure that any financial analyst who takes his or her task seriously knows where to find this information and will use it in understanding the company Indeed there is something to learn from these different FCF concepts as applied by Amazon For that we should not solely stare at accounting figures but must use some imagination as well and try to reconstruct and understand Amazons business and earnings model Amazon has grown into a rather complicated business model in which it currently combines at least three different companies it is an online retailer a retail and wholesale enabler and fulfiller for others and a provider of web services and cloud computing This list is probably not exhaustive as we may already add a streaming media companycontent producer as well One day it may even start operating a parcel delivery company of its own when it has enough scale to compete with UPS NYSE UPS and FedEx NYSE FDX which is imminent I think All these activities are being developed within the same model of an online retailer which actually does no longer fit them but is nevertheless being maintained as to make it not too easy for competitors to understand and copy what Amazon is doing As the highly disruptive company it is Amazon is the natural focal point for many who wish to grab a share of the fast growing online retail market or incumbents who must defend their position As Jeff Bezos demonstrated himself in the first pioneering years there were besides creative imagination and true entrepreneurship hardly any entry barriers to newcomers The only really effective one scale was still to be established Obtaining that scale necessitated full focus on growing volume first rather than earnings It also required that Bezos kept his cards close to the chest An online business is open to any visitor whether customer or competitor It is true that Amazons figures are not as transparent as analysts might wish but shareholders have in that respect the same interest as the company and its founder Shareholders have long been left in the dark about the size the growth and profitability of Amazons web services Since the first quarter of this year now that this cloud computing business has established itself as the uncontestable market leader shareholders and others are allowed more insight into this part of Amazon Would it have been in the shareholders interest when Amazon would have been utterly transparent at an early stage about its strategy How would its main competitors deep pocketed giants like Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL IBM NYSE IBM have reacted They too have been taken by surprise And a positive surprise it has been at least for Amazons shareholders My take on this is that the reason why Amazon willingly directed as it still does all attention to the formal first version of FCF was that the company could not afford to report on new businesses as transparently as a company would do at a much more mature stage of development The use of capital leases must also be regarded in that respect It allowed for developing and financing revolutionary web and cloud services without attracting too much attention to them With hindsight investors can only admit that it was the best thing and in their best interest to do A true economic rationale for Amazons use of conventional Free Cash Flow But there is also a true economic rationale and justification to still keep using the conventional FCF as Amazon does in its quarterly presentation It reveals that it is growing fast and that the trailing months figures have reached a level of million in the second quarter of this year This figure expresses closest the free cash flow of the oldest core of Amazon ie its online retail business It would have blurred the true insight in this part of the business if the large investments in AWS would have been treated in the same way as the capital spending in the online retail business Most of the capital spending at AWS is in servers which have an expected useful life of three years and are depreciated accordingly On the other hand AWSs revenue are essentially based on some form of subscription and payment as you go This business appears to be quite sticky Customers face serious exit barriers as Netflix NASDAQ NFLX who is one of the largest among them will acknowledge Once a customer always a customer seems to be a reality here the same holds by the way also for FBA fulfilled by Amazon the part of the online retail business in which Amazon acts as an enabler and fulfiller on behalf of third parties Because of these special characteristics it is quite appropriate to have this part of capital spending financed by capital lease agreements By doing so Amazon not only separates capex in retail business from web services thus giving a better analytic insight into the latters true FCF than when everything had been lumped together But by matching AWSs revenue with the capital lease repayments which are almost all related to AWS analysts obtain the insight that this part of the business as highly profitable as it already may be does not generate positive cash flows yet Again as in online retail Amazon is with AWS fully focused on obtaining scale and must therefore keep allocating considerable amounts on capex But most importantly this treatment of the FCF underscores the favorable characteristics of delivering cloud computing services perfect pricing based on fully measured usage stickiness of customers and immediate and continuous scalability Amazon does not need to reinvest its fast growing positive FCF from its retail business in AWS but can fully rely on capital leases whenever the need arises In a way the main rationale of cloud computing for users which is using computing power when and where needed at the required scale without investment has been extended to AWS as a whole and has become a highly favorable feature of Amazons business model If this feature of Amazons model is well understood criticism may turn into appreciation In the table below it is shown that not only FCF the conventional free cash flow definition that Amazon rightfully focuses on is positive and has been growing sharply during the last quarters but also that FCF has begun following a comparable path Only FCF the cash flow definition that comprises all PPE that is acquired under capital lease is still negative However this final cash flow version will because of the high profitability of web services probably turn positive rather sooner than later In case it would remain negative much longer it would be because of continued extraordinary growth in which case it would be a highly positive factor in the valuation of Amazons profits Specific asset related capital leasing does not set constraints on valuation it is automatically extended upon purchase of equipment and does not interfere with other parts of Amazon It is the most appropriate form of financing for AWS in its current high growth phase Beyond Free Cash Flow fast growing earnings This year Amazons revenue will exceed the billion level It might be the tipping point at least in the USA where delivery costs could switch from costs into revenue as the part of retail sales fulfilled by Amazon FBA which have already surpassed Amazons own retail activities will grow steeper reaching sufficient scale to sustain a closely knit delivery network In that situation delivery charges carried on to customers may outstrip total delivery costs The home market will be the first to reach this tipping point followed by overseas operations later on AWS and most likely FBA too command considerably higher margins than Amazons own retail activities which might at some future point be seen as the necessary start that positioned Amazon to becoming in the end a pure trade enabler and fulfiller in the broadest sense including all computing and software services for online retailers and service providers to conduct their business The overall operating profit margin will be in accordance with this high service level and at a mature stage is poised to reach a multiple of that of traditional retailers in their heyday Amazons revenue has grown since by an average per year With all the recently extended delivery services under Prime and the international expansion well underway it is highly probable that a revenue growth rate can be maintained for many years to come That part of the equation is the least hard to fill in It will all depend on the operating profit margin how this will work out in future net income If that profit margin would be around or above which I think is quite reasonable to expect the stock is not excessively priced and still offers good LT potential Disclosure Long AMZN ever
