hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Netflix released their Q results Tuesday afternoon and even with a bearish tilt the subscriber growth figures were absolutely stunning However the markets response to earnings with the backdrop of the broad market chaos suggests the momentum may finally be over NFLX cash flow trends are deeply disturbing both on an annual and quarterly basis The GAAP results mask how much cash is flowing out the door Netflix is due to tap the junk bond market in the next few quarters Coupled with a potential snap of momentum I believe downside exists Netflix NASDAQ NFLX released their Q results Tuesday afternoon and despite market chaos today the broad sentiment is very positive Last year I published an extensive analysis of troubling trends And after one year Ive obviously been incorrect with a bearish stance on NFLX as the stock is up roughly since the Q results and up since the start of In full disclosure Ive been a longterm bear on NFLXs balance sheet since late These bear goggles have led to an incorrect focus on the house of cards balance sheet instead of on the new black in terms of subscriber growth I believe the market has reached a point of panic and general volatility where financials finally will begin to matter The failure of NFLX to rally on what was a very impressive subscriber growth print highlights this shifting sentiment Additionally NFLX needs to tap the junk bond markets in the next couple quarters to continue funding its lossleading expansion initiatives and these markets are rapidly closing The following report highlights the disturbing financial trends under the hood at Netflix while also looking at the traditional underlying growth metrics As investors become more critical of underlying finances even a hint of growth slippage could turn NFLX into the next Twitter NYSE TWTR or GoPro NASDAQ GPRO The following report utilizes the most recent financial figures as reported in the current shareholder letter The majority of the raw numbers come directly from Netflixs most recent Excel sheet results NFLX growth in terms of nominal subscribers remains very impressive However nominal results dont matter when a firm trades based on endless exponential expectations NFLXs latest domestic growth performance at yy is the lowest in the streaming companys history This is a firm with roughly in profit so subscriber growth is everything to the trading thesis here The following chart shows the eroding growth curve in subscriber growth International subscriber growth trends are far more impressive and this is the current growth story NFLX is pursuing However until very recently NFLX has mostly been benefiting from surge launches in countries with limited competition With NFLX announcing worldwide availability sans China a few weeks ago this source of surge growth will be officially over by mid NFLXs only remaining growth bullet will be through the Middle Kingdom and the January th PR was clearly intended to add pressure to Chinese regulators Direct from their media office Netflix will not yet be available in China though the company continues to explore options for providing the service It also wont be available in Crimea North Korea and Syria due to US government restrictions on American companies International subscribers now comprise nearly of the total base This fact gives credit to their impressive expansion plan and is a fantastic pitch slide for NFLX bulls prior to getting into the underlying finances Netflix growth has been impressive Theres no denying the global growth trends remain strong even if the low hanging fruit is rapidly vanishing The scary factor for investors is how NFLX continues to pile huge future commitments by securing premium content through providers such as Disney NYSE DIS and Lions Gate NYSE LGF while also continuing to expand custom content offerings such as Marco Polo Narcos and Orange is the New Black Although content liability growth remains significant the past two quarters have improved this spread The secondary troubling trend has been the growth in noncontent expenses marketing development and corporate versus revenues While Netflix bulls will continually tout economies of scale Ive continually pointed out that the facts suggest the opposite NFLXs growth trajectory has required an explosion of growth in noncontent expenses Again the past two quarters have shown improving trends but with the January announcement of official worldwide expansion I expect these expenses to rocket back up Despite heading subscriber growth and turning a small profit on a GAAP basis the underlying cash flows are horrendous and the weak trends continue to accelerate Here is a fouryear panel of NFLX results note how is worse than all the three previous years combined Dialing deeper into the results shows the trends are equally disturbing on a quarterly level In fact NFLX was finally stalled from their trend of milking working capital shifts to improve their cash flow position Over the past four years NFLX has pulled M from shifts in working capital only about half of which is related to subscription revenue As shown above the cash flow trends are undeniable and continue to accelerate in a negative direction NFLX finally saw a setback in working capital which contributed further to this negative flow Netflix has a very weak balance sheet considering the lack of profitability for their underlying business As of Q results NFLX net debt is M or B including content liabilities In comparison as of Q their net cash was M or B in net debt including content liabilities The poor finances are undeniable and a return to the junk bond market is extremely likely within the next quarters Netflix tries to positively spin this exposure in the Q letter emphasis added Given our expected cash needs we are likely to raise additional debt in late or early We are managing our balance sheet to lower our blended cost of capital over time while maintaining financial flexibility Despite being FCF negative as we grow our original content and invest in international our bonds trade like a BB credit vs their single B rating due in part to the longterm growth of Internet TV globally and our low debt to market cap ratio which provides bond investors with a very thick cushion of protection Utilizing debt to market capitalization as a metric of safety is one of the most absurd arguments Ive seen especially suggesting a bloated stock serves as a thick cushion of protection Regardless the intent to return to the junk bond market is clear When youre speculating in growth stocks betting against clear consumer trends and especially against market momentum can be financial suicide Netflix has enjoyed the benefit of being the most competent first mover in a clear secular trend cord cutting At the same time NFLX has enjoyed immense stock market momentum This momentum has led to a complete disregard for any financial red flags With market volatility reaching nearterm records and the market off to its worst twoweek start in history investors appear to be demanding a higher level of financial results NFLX presented the type of figures that historically would have led to intraday gains yet they ended the first trading day flat The most surprising factor is that NFLX was down by as much as intraday as shown from the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Finance capture below Todays market movement suggests that the extremely forgiving trade momentum may finally be gone for NFLX Coming from a Netflix bear the Q report was absolutely stunning on the only two trends that have mattered to investors subscriber growth and liability growth Free cash flow was abysmal as usual but growth investors rarely care about underlying financials This type of report should have boosted the stock by but completely failed to move the needle If momentum is dead NFLX might begin to search for a fair fundamental valuation in which case declines exceeding are possible especially if NFLX attempts to tap the dying junk bond market anytime soon </div></body></html>
