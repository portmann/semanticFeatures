company in like situation it has had its negative moments The negative moments are a downtrend in financial metrics a decline in profitability and the sustainability of growth rates and uncertainty about future cash flows because of substantial cash burns Finally the current valuation is also a point of concern According to my DCF model and my comparative analysis the stock seems to be overvalued by at least Microsoft Corp NASDAQ MSFT is a unique company that has conquered this world with its products along with competitors like IBM NYSE IBM Apple NASDAQ AAPL Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL WalMart NYSE WMT and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN During more than thirty years the company has been a global leader in providing software and hardware Its most successful products Windows OS and MS Office have become an integral part of our daily activities However today Microsoft is facing raging rivalry The relatively blue ocean of s has become a red ocean in the twentyfirst century after Apple and Alphabets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>declared a war against the Windows OSs monopoly and have made their best effort in the production of smartphones and tablets The ongoing technological progress kept pushing Microsoft onwards to the edge The company was late in the manufacturing of smartphones and tablets Apple Samsung OTCSSNLF and Xiaomi are the leaders in this market now Microsoft was also late in switching to online sales Nevertheless things change In Steve Balmer the companys former CEO decided to reshuffle the business The results of this initiative were the following In Microsoft acquired Nokia and manufactured the first series of Microsoft Lumia and Microsoft also acquired Mojang the company that had created Minecraft the worlds most famous sandbox game Taking it all into account there is a need to provide certain conclusions Hence I would like to give you four reasons why the company is not worth its current market price Four Reasons Why You Should Sell Microsoft The benefits highlighted before may also serve as doubleedged swords First of all take a look at revenues and other financial metrics Look at Diagram As you can see sales in the US have decreased by or by M I think that this decline is a red flag Now look at Diagram that shows key financial metrics for Microsoft including LTM What can you conclude from it The LTM revenues have fallen by The first sixmonth revenue was lower than over the same period a year ago The companys top line is in a downtrend now Gross margins have been falling along with the operating margin during the last eight years During the gross margin has fallen by more than while the operating margin has fallen by almost times Secondly other metrics related to the companys performance also leave much to be desired Look at Diagram The net profit margin has been falling for the last five years its asset turnover for eight years while ROA and ROE have also been in the state of decline for five years Moreover the decline in ROE is explained by an increasing leverage and the decrease of the interest coverage ratio This implies the company would have been in a worse shape if it had not raised debt Thirdly you may ask What has been the main reason for raising debt if the total turnover has not improved after that I will answer Dividends and buybacks acquisitions that have not shown anything profitable and bonuses for the management I will also show you Diagram and tell that spending cash now may be a good strategy in two cases You need to hide money until somebody else finds out they are illegal recall the JanuaryApril Goldman Sachs scandal with employee bonuses in excess of B Source Morningstarcom estimates by author The fourth and the most important reason is the companys current valuation taking into account the above information I will show you why this is a problem with the DCF and comparative analyses I made a few projections for the next seven years in my DCF model You can see them in Diagrams and In Diagram you can see how different metrics of Microsoft Corp will change during the forecast period My model shows that after subtracting the market value of debt adding back cash and investments and the discounted value of net working capital the market value of equity is about B Consequently the fair value per share is about It is about lower than the current price level per share My DCF analysis is based on a number of assumptions which create a certain expectation of the share price However we need to see the entire picture and derive a range of possible prices A few assumptions about WACC and the terminal EVEBITDA multiple give a plausible price range of per share It means that the stock price may decrease by My comparative analysis is based on three key ratios PE PS and PBV see Diagram The multiples mostly show that the stock is significantly overvalued The current EVEBITDA is x which is much higher than Apples IBMs or Oracles NYSE ORCL x x and x respectively and in line with Googles x Hence the company seems to be overvalued on most accounts The arguments for buying Microsoft Corps shares are weaker than the arguments for selling or doing nothing with the stock Moreover both the DCF and comparative analyses show the company is significantly overvalued relative to peers Hence I issue a SELL recommendation on this stock and set a target price range at per share for the next twelve months which is lower than the current market price Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a short position in MSFT over the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Short Ideas Technology Application Software </div></body></html>
