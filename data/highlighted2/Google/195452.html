allow it to have a significant chance at cracking the mobile market However there are still a couple of obvious things this feature is missing And if Microsoft manages to crack the mobile market using this feature a host of consequences will take place for many different players Microsoft included At this point its widely known that Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT has bungled the mobile market leaving it wide open to be conquered by Apple NASDAQ AAPL with iOS and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL with Android That said Microsoft still holds a commanding lead in the desktop and laptop world in spite of competition from the same Apple with OSX and Android through Chrome OS With Windows Microsoft is once again trying to leverage its position in the desktoplaptop world to establish more of a beachhead in the mobile space Central to that attempt is Microsofts Continuum feature Microsofts Continuum is a way to take your smartphone and seamlessly turn it into a desktop machine simply by docking it This is made possible by Windows and a hardware dock Windows enables the two interfaces mobile desktop to live within the same OS as well as providing links to the wireless Bluetooth keyboard and mouse The hardware dock provides other connectivity USB and HDMI ports power adapter etc This feature is also made possible by the continual advancements in smartphone specifications Todays smartphone is starting to reach even Intels NASDAQ INTC Core M chip performance whereas Windows runs nicely even on Intel Core CPUs from nearly a decade ago Also todays smartphone can easily drive a p display indeed many including the nowlaunched Lumia and XL ship with even higher resolutions which run smoothly Finally flash memory is becoming cheap enough that decent storage capacities can be attained on smartphones For instance the latest Microsoft smartphones again Lumia and XL are able to use microSD cards of up to TB capacities This feature is obviously attractive for many reasons including Desktops and laptops are much more usable when creating or even consuming content while not on the go Carrying the computer around means all your data is in the same place with no more syncing chores The same applications can be available everywhere with less maintenance required to keep a consistent workspace The consumer no longer has to keep as many different devices smartphone desktop possibly a laptop and the components needed to provide the laptop and desktop functions are not exposed to so much of a spec race display keyboard mouse Looking at what Microsoft presented there are still obvious flaws with Microsofts Continuum as proposed The dock needs to be sexier plugging cables is not a decent way to go about it A proper dock where the smartphone is stationed would look better though it would probably require different models for different smartphones Have third parties build the docks would solve previous problem Most importantly Microsoft needs to yield to the x world As Continuum was presented it relied on a phone running on an ARM CPU to give the illusion of a desktop But this is not full Windows able to run any Windows application Instead its a derivative of the failed Windows RT relying on yet to come universal apps to have something to run This is a recipe for failure all by itself negating all that Microsoft could gain from its Continuum feature An Intel SoC and full Windows are the only way to guarantee success for this feature Here a question is raised Is Microsoft fully engaged in this attempt Is Intel As well see there are consequences from fully pursuing this path Continuum stands the chance of destroying the general purpose desktop but not the gaming desktops or those built for highlydemanding applications Thus this implies that success for Continuum might drive demand away from other Windows device makers such as HewlettPackard NYSE HPQ Over time with a variant built for laptops and tablets similar to the ASUS Padfone it can also destroy most of the market for general purpose laptops again excluding gaming laptops or those built for highlydemanding applications More problematic while this technology can allow Microsoft to finally invade the mobile market such would come at the cost of a large slice of its own Windows business This would be so because mobile devices carry very lowpriced mobile licenses for Windows versus more expensive OEM licenses for desktops and laptops But for it to be attractive Continuum needs to carry the full Windows experience So by winning Microsoft would be losing some of its own highmargin OEM desktoplaptop licenses Even Intel has something of a problem Due to competition from ARM vendors any chip designed towards mobiles is bound to be much cheaper and lowermargin than its Intel Core M chips Yet to make the Continuum feature work to its fullest potential the device needs to be able to run full Windows And this requires Intel to match the ARM chips which are already matching its Core M CPUs This means deeply cannibalizing its CPU line Intel might have a resistance to this same as Microsoft might have a resistance to providing full Windows on the smartphone even if its able to At this point I wonder to what extent What Is Still Missing is due to the Consequences But the fact here is rather simple if the feature is halfbaked so that it doesnt produce the Consequences then it will also be very likely to fail and be irrelevant That is for this to work it cant be built on compromises designed to make it less useful and to make it not be the desktoplaptop replacement it supposedly aims to be This let it be said should already be obvious to Microsoft given how Windows RT bombed Why Is It Important For Microsoft To Get Continuum Right The mobile revolution is not going to stop and for the most part Microsoft already lost that train Continuum properly done could be the way for Microsoft to get back into the game This would be especially true because none of the two major competitors Android iOS have the possibility to do the same at this point in time Android could conceivably do a similar job but youd end up with a Chrome OS desktop iOS could try doing the same but youd end up with a laptopdesktop running iOS instead of OSX Only Microsoft can deliver the stillleading desktoplaptop platform running Windows But perhaps if Microsoft aims for that some of its business model will intrinsically change After all if Microsoft is successful it will spell a significant reduction in OEM Windows licenses replaced by a larger market share in mobile How would Microsoft monetize that Here it would seem that the only way out would be to ape Apples business model make the money on hardware not the software Indeed fully copying Apple would mean even more Microsoft would have to aim at making the money from the highend device segment Alas there is at least a measure of indication that Microsoft might be trying just that not only with the Surface tablet and the new Phones Lumia XL but also with its recently unveiled Surface Book Here something else should be considered Continuum will pressure the existing Windows ecosystem suppliers on the lowend as the smartphones will be able to take on those jobs At the same time the highend device strategy would push on the suppliers servicing the highend of the Windows market This could be a significant problem If Continuum is properly implemented it could change the nature of the entire PC market Microsofts continuum might be its best chance ever of reentering the mobile race This would be achieved by making your smartphone the center of your computing experience which is a reasonable feat for todays smartphones in regular usage The smartphone would power your desktop and laptop all while keeping all your data and applications in a single device Such a chance however would require a significant change in Microsofts business model and it might also have significant impacts on many other players servicing the PC and laptop markets Namely it could happen that those players would be pushed out of the ecosystem both from the low and highend device sides except for niche applications professional gaming etc Also it will require courage from Microsoft because a halfbaked attempt at implementing Continuum without full Windows functionality will make it a lot less likely to be successful Right now Microsoft seems to be leaning this way which will mean failure But if Microsoft shifts to full Windows on the smartphone success in the mobile space could be within reach changing both the mobile and PC markets significantly We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do
