business in major decline My latest thesis is that Verizon Communications NYSE VZ peaked after an impressive rally to start the new year The news that the wireless giant is definitely in the process of making a bid for hapless Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO isnt going to help the stock price The news is even more perplexing considering the report from Recode suggesting the documents from Yahoo showcase a very weak outlook to prospective buyers Due to these facts Verizon broke the recent trend of rallying and ended the day with a decline and trading below the DMA for the first time since the rally started The company lists the ownership of AOL as a prime reason for buying the core business The logic doesnt add up considering the core business of Yahoo is stagnant at best Not to mention the core businesses are all mostly secondary brands with limited upside Verizon has built the brand and stock valuation based on having the premier wireless network With Yahoo the search business is far behind <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and other key brands like mail Finance and Sports are really not distinguishable leaders anymore Roughly months ago activist Starboard Value LP highlighted the benefits via Business Insider of a merger of then independent AOL with Yahoo The investment firm places the ability to achieve billion in synergies as a prime reason for the deal The ability to significantly reduce cost overlaps in the Display business and eliminate corporate overhead made a combination interesting at the time Verizon though needs to add growth and the addition of AOL has provided no distinguishable benefits for the domestic wireless giant In addition the company purchased digital advertising platform Millennial Media but the one big initiative to create an app for mobile video to utilize the digital advertising assets has been a complete failure so far The go app ranks far down the list in the entertainment category in the App Store According to App Annie go is the number th most downloaded entertainment app This leaves the app far below the rankings of Netflix NASDAQ NFLX Hulu and HBO Now owned by Time Warner NYSE TWX The app is even far behind The Moron Test and Dubsmash At the same time Verizon continues making interesting addon deals to improve the content for the adsupported mobile video network This week Verizon bought a stake in AwesomenessTV The wireless giant paid around million for the stake with the intent to create more premium shortform mobile video content for go At the time that Starboard recommended the merger of AOL and Yahoo I wrote Wrongs Dont Make A Right The combination of the businesses would create a unit with annual revenues approaching billion but the operations havent improved to change the previous opinion Sure Verizon has revenues of over billion making the revenue base of Yahoo near immaterial but the wireless giant already faces revenue growth challenges of its own Why add a business that Recode reports forecasting that revenues will decline up to this year The disclosure documents provided to prospective buyers by the Yahoo bankers shows a business not worthy of a purchase Besides the revenue decline Kara Swisher suggests that earnings are forecast to plunge with adjusted EBITDA down to a meager million this year The number sat at billion in By all indications Verizon along with Alphabet and a host of other companies are looking to make a big deal for Yahoo by the Monday deadline These large corporations clearly see a fixable business though the reality in the sale book is clearly not in agreement Naturally any value creation from a deal depends highly on the price paid Ultimately though the devil is in the details Yahoo might offer a rare Internet asset with scale but the company doesnt offer an asset worth owning when Wall Street values growth so highly Verizon is heading lower if it has the highest bid for Yahoo The recommendation is
