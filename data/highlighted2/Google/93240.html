Microsoft will launch Windows on July This release has the potential to have a very significant impact on the competitive environment We have seen competitive positions shift on the back of hardware and software releases before Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT will launch Windows on July Releases of new Windows versions tend to be routine affairs At this moment in time Microsofts strategic position relates itself to Apple NASDAQ AAPL as antifragile to fragile to put it in author Nassim Talebs terms This release is anything but routine and introduces a boatload of uncertainty into the market Microsoft is more likely to profit from its move and Apple the most vulnerable in part because of its success simply has the most to lose Apple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Microsoft are in premier strategic positions to becomestay the tollbooths between a good chunk of the global developing power and a lot of service providers and the customers of that power and these services Often these companies strategic positions are compared segmented by device mobilePC but going forward that does not make much sense anymore The war is about having the strongest most durable and most profitable relationships with customers Through which channel the contact is established and maintained will matter little Of these three companies Apple derives major revenue from the hardware it sells and is also the most successful in making money with its app store I think it is fair to say it is currently the most successful tollbooth between the global developing reserve and users right now Although Apples design acumen is highly regarded the success of its hardware business is at least in part and in my view to a great extent predicated on the quality and selection of apps available on its devices This same dynamic worked against Apple in the PC industry for a long time Even when experts considered its desktop OS to be far superior to that developed by Microsoft it struggled to gain meaningful traction with sales At the time software was developed first and foremost for Windows machines That meant that a lot of long tail niche software simply was not available on Macs A severe competitive disadvantage The reversal is now true on mobile Windows mobile can not gain traction because it lacks the same extensive long tail of high quality software apps In July Windows will launch Windows and this release has a few very interesting characteristics First it is an OS that works across platforms both on mobile devices and PC and second it enables developers to get iOS and Android apps to run on Windows very easily Windows granting access to the pool of PC and mobile users suddenly turns the Windows powered platforms into a much more attractive OS to develop for Windows is a small fry in the mobiletablet OS market but it dominates the PC market The top OS on desktop in are all Windows systems By removing the boundaries between the two it negates a competitive disadvantage Not only is this new platform much more attractive to developers because they can access a much larger market through Windows as compared to developing just for Windows Mobile the ability to run software developed for other mobile OS with Windows helps to level the playing field from the getgo How this is exactly going to play out in practice is quite uncertain The reason I am still basing this investment thesis on the Windows release even though its actual impact in practice is quite uncertain is because it has the potential to shake things up in a big way I found Nassim Talebs work helpful as a framework on how to think about this event and in particular his latest book Antifragile Things that gain from disorder In this book he presents the concept of antifragility The opposite of fragile An antifragile thing gains from volatilitystressdisorder Taleb defines it as follows I think Talebs writing helps with practical investment matters but he goes way over my head when he gets technical Simply antifragility is defined as a convex response to a stressor or source of harm for some range of variation leading to a positive sensitivity to increase in volatility or variability stress dispersion of outcomes or uncertainty what is grouped under the designation disorder cluster Likewise fragility is defined as a concave sensitivity to stressors leading a negative sensitivity to increase in volatility The relation between fragility convexity and sensitivity to disorder is mathematical obtained by theorem not derived from empirical data mining or some historical narrative It is a priori I do not want to go as far as to call Apple a fragile company and Microsoft an antifragile one But I think it is accurate to say Apple is fragile to the release of Windows and Microsoft is antifragile to the release If Windows fails to shake things up there is not a whole lot of downside for Microsoft while the company has the potential to profit hugely if the release is successful A successful release improves its competitive position in the segment that is now mobiletablet Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>meanwhile are exposed to varying degrees of downside from the volatility introduced by this event while there is not a whole lot of upside for them associated with it You could argue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is even more vulnerable to lose market share to Microsoft Android and Windows mobile are probably in closer competition as Apple limits itself to the upper end of the market I actually agree with that The reason I chose Apple as the appropriate short is because Apples revenue is to a much larger extent as compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>dependent on its domination of the mobile software landscape If the company loses its appeal with the worlds best developers as THE platform to get their software on its entire business model will come under intense pressure It will lose its ability to move hardware to the extent it does now Falling hardware sales will compress margins and so on Very soon Apple is no longer the King of the Hill but just a solid competitor among peers I already used the example of Microsoft which lost a dominant market position in a similar fashion but it is not a unique occurrence Another example would be Nintendo OTCPKNTDOY which completely dominated the gaming market in the s Nintendo squeezed developers who created the software for their platform which was practically the only game in town When Sega finally emerged with the bit Saturn in and gained traction they abandoned Nintendo in the blink of an eye This is not a longshort designed specifically to profit from one mispricing and hedge the market risk out This longshort is designed to profit on two fronts from the volatility introduced by this potentially game changing software release while at the same time being longshort megacap tech probably removes a bunch of market volatility from that bet Although Microsoft trades at a slightly higher PE and PS it trades at a slightly lower EVRevenue and EVEBITDA This is caused by Microsoft carrying more cash on its balance sheet Other than that the companies have fairly similar valuation metrics applied to them by the market It will be interesting to see how the fundamentals to which they apply develop after the release of Windows It can play out in many different ways The most likely way this plays out is with little initial response by the market as the market is well aware of the release How the developer community responds probably matters a great deal In theory Windows features are very interesting but how does it all work together in practice If the market starts to pick up on favorable feedback I think the market will bid up Microsofts stock by because of the increased future cash flows it anticipates on the back of increased future market share Theoretically some of that market value should be siphoned away from Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>right away In practice it can take a while before people can let go of Apple It has been such a market darling for so long Make no mistake though if Windows really does gain traction it can take a big bite out of Apples market value Apple has short product cycles and every one of its hardware products suddenly faces increased competitive pressure When a competitor has a richer ecosystem and lower priced products I do not want to put my money on peoples brand loyalty The company will need to respond by lowering prices or other counter measures Before you know it a year has passed and the stock is down as the market slowly adjusts its models to the new competitive environment The bottom line is I am not sure how the Windows release will impact things It could very well turn out to be kind of a dud At the same time it has the potential to induce a major shift If it is a dud I think the market will shrug its shoulders and move on If it is a big success this trade will be glorious It is antifragile Source Heres Why Im Buying Microsoft And
