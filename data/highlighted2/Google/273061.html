on the release of Windows and Microsofts effort to narrow its competitive disadvantage After watching this unfold I think my thesis to short Apple is too convoluted The possible significance of Microsofts universal apps is more widely understood but because of limited traction it isnt whats moving the needle In June I submitted an article titled Why Im selling Apple And Buying Microsoft to a Seeking Alpha contest for a pair trade The trade did well but I chalk it up to luck The SP delivered approximately a negative total return over the same timeframe The thesis for the pair trade relied on the release of Windows and Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT effort to narrow its competitive disadvantage compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Apple NASDAQ AAPL on the Mobile OS front Or as I put it slightly edited to improve readability Most likely this plays out is with little initial response by the market as the market is well aware of the release How the developer community responds probably matters a great deal In theory Windows features are very interesting but how does it all work together in practice If the market starts to pick up on favorable feedback I think the market will bid up Microsofts stock by because of the increased future cash flows it anticipates on the back of increased future market share Theoretically some of that market value should be siphoned away from Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>right away In practice it can take a while before people can let go of Apple It has been such a market darling for so long Make no mistake though if Windows really does gain traction it can take a big bite out of Apples market value Apple has short product cycles and every one of its hardware products suddenly faces increased competitive pressure When a competitor has a richer ecosystem and lower priced products I do not want to put my money on peoples brand loyalty The company will need to respond by lowering prices or other countermeasures Before you know it a year has passed and the stock is down as the market slowly adjusts its models to the new competitive environment The problem with my story right now is that I believe it is kind of disconnected from the moves in both Microsoft and Apple I cant be sure of course but I dont believe the story line of the potential of Microsoft putting a serious dent in Apples mobile OS market share convinced many investors The project to enable automated porting of Android apps Astoria was even shut down It is not a surprise the media hasnt embraced the Universal app story because of its lack of early success as per the Verge Its still really early days for Windows and the future of the universal app platform Netflix is available on Windows PCs and tablets today but the phone and Xbox versions are still separate and not universal That will change over the coming months but it highlights the challenges of convincing developers to build these apps Weve got a long ways to go in our Store yet to get to the scale that we want explains Mehdi Netflix Uber Shazam Twitter and others are a good start but there are thousands more big apps to go until Microsoft can say universal apps are a success At the same time the slump in Apples stock is much more likely to have been caused by analysts increasingly bearish expectations for iPhone sales One of the things Im currently spending a bit of time on is my own estimate of iPhone sales for the December quarter and my initial work shows it is going to be a close call whether million units sold will be exceeded However at this time I dont want to rely on it to try and continue to support my bear case I dont hate my initial call of long Microsoftshort Apple but I want to come out and say Im not behind this position any more Coverage indicates performance so far has likely been mostly the result of sheer luck and driven by factors other than those underlying my thesis The possible significance of Microsofts universal apps is more widely understood but because of limited traction it isnt whats moving the needle yet The Microsoft long is the leg of this position that Im most comfortable with and I think this will continue to be a fine long Limited risk due to a strong balance sheet strong competitive advantages and strong upside potential if it is able to win big market share in Mobile OS after all I still believe over time Windows and universal apps could start to make a big difference here The Apple short leg is one I recommend taking off at this time My reasoning just doesnt hold up that well and the stock has declined quite a bit The stocks performance appears mostly tied to iPhone sales and the threat of Microsofts app ecosystem vastly improving isnt playing much of a role Therefore it seems much wiser to me to bet solely on the Microsoft ecosystem improving by going long Microsoft The short Apple is a position that could end up losing money even though the thesis actually plays out Meanwhile it isnt the best choice to just hedge out general TECH market risk Its just too complicated of a thesis where lots of things have to go right To continue to justify it better insight into iPhone sales would help much more In summary I continue to like the long Microsoft but the Apple short not so much We only use your contact details
