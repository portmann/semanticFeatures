class='textDiv'>Apple Scaling The Great Wall A Real Challenge Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Unionpay launched its own NFCbased mobile payment app Quick Pay Negative implication for AAPL which is partnering with Unionpay True to its words Chinas Unionpay last week released its mobile payment system called Quick Pass to gain greater presence in Chinas fastgrowing digital payment space thats dominated by Alibaba NYSE BABA Tencent OTCPKTCEHY and Baidu NASDAQ BIDU This comes weeks after Unionpay announced a partnership with Apple NASDAQ AAPL in promoting Apple Pay in China see Apple Scaling The Great Wall With Apple Pay Worth noting Unionpays mobile payment appears to be NFCbased in that its not appbased nor does it require a wireless signal Although the payment platform only is available on Android devices that command over of Chinas smartphone market Unionpay is expected to release an iOS version in the first quarter of next year In my view the fact that Unionpay has launched its own mobile payment system clearly indicates that it has no interest in being partnered with AAPL Given that BABA and Tencent already command close to of the mobile payment market and that BIDUs mobile payments are slowly gaining traction AAPL Pay will face further challenges in penetrating the crowded Chinese market As such I reiterate my cautious view on AAPL and its prospect in China Although I concur with the AAPL fans that AAPL certainly has a superior ecosystem the author grew up using a Mac and started to invest in AAPL back in hardware comps on the iPhone are becoming increasingly challenging and the ecosystem gap between Android has been narrowing With the Apple Watch looking more like a bust and AAPL temporarily pulling out of the web TV space as content owners command the most buying power see Apple Capitulating To The Content Owners For Now AAPL is pressured to deliver another blockbuster product to sustain its revenue growth The Chinese market is structured in a way that favors the incumbents and its difficult for foreign companies to gain a significant advantage Failures for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN are two classic examples and AAPL is no different Despite its earlier success in selling the iPhone the more sustainable aspect of AAPLs revenue stream ie software and services is unlikely to gain much traction For example iTunes faces strong competition from BIDU Tencent and BABA The app store faces competition from Qihoo NYSE QIHU BIDU and Wandoujia Other media services face competition from Youku NYSE YOKU LeTV and iQiyi With incumbents already deeply entrenched in their respective verticals AAPL cannot simply leverage its ecosystem which remains a small portion of the total smartphone user base to drive penetration The challenge that AAPL faces in mobile payment is no different from those it faces in music video and apps Chinas mobile payment market is much more advanced than that in North America thanks to the innovations by BABA Tencent and BIDU According to the banks Q mobile payments generated over Rmbb in transactions totaling Rmbtrillion up and more than double that of the prior year However this market is dominated by BABAs Alipay and Tencents WePay which together control of the market On the other hand BIDU Wallet is quickly gaining traction as it drives OO sales AAPL Pays entry into China via a partnership with Unionpay appears to be sound initially given Unionpay oversees all credit card transactions in China But I have cautioned before that Unionpay has been looking to develop its own mobile payment app which makes it a direct competitor to AAPL Last weeks announcement clearly showed that cracking Chinas mobile payment market will not be an easy task for AAPL Unionpays Quick Pass is based on the NFC standard and does not require an app or wireless connectivity Setting up the platform takes less than seconds and payment takes two seconds Given that all Chinese consumers use Unionpay gaining penetration should not be an issue for Unionpay given that users would want to keep a consistent platform More important Quick Pay is supported by more than banks across China and this is an important distribution channel that AAPL does not have For example bank employees can educate consumers on the convenience behind Quick Pay to drive penetration where as it will be much more difficult for AAPL retail store employees to achieve similar scale Although Quick Pay is currently only on Android devices Unionpay is expected to launch an iOS version which further places AAPL at a disadvantage and complicates the relationship in that AAPL is ultimately at the mercy of Unionpay which could ask for commission on mobile transaction payments as part of its partnership agreement Conclusion AAPLs ecosystem in China is growing and its evident from the challenges it faces in iTunes apps and now payment I remain cautious on AAPL in China and reiterate my preference for the incumbents namely BABA and Tencent Alibaba Setting An Example In Mobile Payments We only use your contact details to
