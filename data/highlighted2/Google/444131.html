others currency is part of a trillion carry trade the US Dollar by Steve H Hanke Jun AM Even though the broad outlines of their economic models are the same the performance of Venezuela and Ecuador are in stark contrast with one another Submitted by Michael Shedlock via MishTalkcom Looking back one really has to wonder why the UK subjected itself to all the inane EU nannycrat rules and regulations in the first place I can explain Many readers sent me this explanation but I also used it before on my blog long ago Please consider this clip from the British TV show Yes Minister From Pater Tenebrarum at the Acting Man blog I recently wrote this to my totally Europhile European email group which has hedge fund managers economists journalists insurance and pension fund asset managers and even a few politicians from across Europe every country from the UK to Latvia has a few people in the group and a few fund managers from the US Australia and Israel are also members A few days before the Brexit they had all written paeans on the EU and expressed both their expectation and hope that the UK would remain while chiding the leave campaign for its intellectual inferiority I was incredibly busy still am and didnt find the time to properly join the debate But one day before the referendum I felt I simply had to say SOMETHING to disrupt this lovefest So I wrote this I was very polite but it was met with speechlessness for a little moment I did get several very friendly and well thought out replies after a while though You must understand these people are my friends and I like them and they like me generally They know of course that my opinions on these things are very different from those of most of the European elite Leaving aside the were doing it for peace argument which wily EU politicians tacked on out of the blue or years after the EEC was founded in order to cartelize the then stateowned coal and steel industries what exactly are the advantages of being in the EU If we want to have free trade do we really need a bureaucratic Leviathan in Brussels regulating every nook and cranny of our lives NO We need the back of a napkin on which we could write Henceforth there will be no more tariffs between us Today the EU primarily serves a tonedeaf bureaucratic and political class which lives a high life on the back of people it nothing but aggravates But surely not everything is bad Indeed the EU is looking after usone might well ask what would we do without it I give you a few random examples of the great things the EU does for us citizens There are EU regulations concerning pillows EU regulations concerning pillow cases and EU laws regulating duvets and sheets You shall have shiny teeth citizen Best apples in the world man the Class EU regulated apple noone will ever manage to deceive you again about the color of the apple hes trying to sell you In order to class a Red Variety apple as class of its surface must be red To class a Mixed red coloring variety of apple as a class apple of its surface must be red and so it goes for the quality classes and individually named apple varieties The only slight drawback due to the protectionist agricultural policies of the free market supporting EU that class apple costs at least more than it otherwise would The same goes for every other fruit and vegetable you buy Will you please stop looking for that jug of olive oil at the dinner table That dangerous culinary WMD has been regulated away The EU is saving the planet One emasculated vacuum cleaner and toaster dead incandescent light bulb muzzled showerhead and shrunken flush tank at a time Enjoy your modern morgue lighting citizen and work that plunger a bit its for a good cause In exchange for paying EU bureaucrats a small fortune an MEP can earn up to times the average EU citizens salary commissioners earn a whole lot more still citizens can at least be sure that Europe will conquer the digital realm The indomitable digital commissar Oettinger is on the case Admittedly he looks suspiciously like Beavis of Beavis Butthead fame but a more qualified person couldnt have been found to lead the EU into modernity Hes practically the second coming of Steve Jobs His very first proposal upon getting the job immediately showed how much he careshe wants to protect us from unfair competition According to him economically illiterate and hence dangerous normal citizens should be forced by law to stick with their internet service providers for seven years come hell or high water This is going to give these poor companies more security for their investment planning That would be to the benefit of all of us Youll see if you live long enough Also Oetti wisely supports introducing an EUwide surcharge for hard disk drives as a precrime fine for all that illegal downloading citizens are apt to do on the intertubes Anyway Oetti is the man He knows what hes doingas he himself once said hes going online every day Apple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Facebook etc should cower in fearwith Oetti as our mastermind the age of EU digital domination has begun And were getting all this at the everyday low base salary of approx per year nearly taxfreefor Oetti anyway plus an annual residence allowance of an entertainment allowance of approx a family allowance of plus in education and child support for every child free haircuts liters of free petrol per month a allowance for traveling abroad there is an extra allowance for traveling at home too a daily Im actually here today allowance of for signing in and a general allowance of pa for secretarial expensesand a bit of free health theft and casualty insurance Much cheaper than say the CEO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>I could go on and on and on but I dont have the time at the momenthence this somewhat random list with its strange focus on Beavis the digital wonder at the end Ive picked him as an especially bizarre example of the EU nomenklatura Absurd regulations If I made a complete list this mail would be longer than the distance from the earth to the moon As I have frequently stated we do not need an EU to have free trade EU Membership is the very epitome of unfree trade If the EU wanted to do something that made sense it would scrap of its rules and regulations to be replaced with three sentences Effective immediately all tariffs and subsidies are forever revoked There is freedom of movement within the EU not into the EU by nonEU countries Each country is free to set its own tax policies and social benefits as it sees fit subject to rule number on tariffs There needs to be some rules on what it takes to get into the EU or be kicked out of the EU but those are the three key rules that apply once in Why did everybody vote for the Red and Blue Team for years Why did people believe the Weapons of Mass Delusion cdevidal NTaREALmerican Jun PM I thank years of globalistsocialist free education Put your babies in the propaganda mill and dont be surprised when they grind out as sheep who want a tyrants boot on their necks HomeSchooling nibiru cdevidal Jun PM johngaltfla NTaREALmerican Jun PM Because they got tired of sending of their year olds to Frogland to defend Paris from the Germans ever years Emergency Ward EF Mutton Jun PM Thats like the son on the Mexican telenovela who asked his father for advice on relationships and marriage The father said Im sorry mijo I would give you advice but you see that I married your mother Read tragedy of the euro by Phillip Bagus All you need to know about the EU and why is was created In brief it had a lot to do with the price of sovereign debt controlling the bundesbank and allowing big companies to drive out competition through legislation that suffocated SMEs Go on YouTube and plug Enoch Powell into the search blockand see that the present mess was predicted by him and many others decades ago The interviews of him in the early to mid s period are extraordinarily prescient Yes Minister Yes Prime Minister were both genius shows but most people laughed at them without realising how much truth was contained within If you are a fan of Brit comedy and want to get a better understanding of how the Brussels bureaucrats dont work there was a TV show called Gravy Train Initially the idea was to reduce red tape but then the manufacturers or red tape bureaucrats managed to take over It was called the Common Market which seemed like a good idea at the time It all went to shit when the name changed to European Union sinbad logicalman Jun PM kiwigal logicalman Jun PM The rule I got the biggest laugh out of is that they are NOT allowed bendy bananas No curvature at all Only allowed a certain type of light bulb Geez no wonder they told EU to feck off China regulators are to revisit the LondonShanghai stock link ANZ say that gold is likely to move higher on firm
