flow has gone negative and it is trending more negative Content costs are rising roughly an order of magnitude faster than revenues and NFLX is still losing lots of good titles Netflix NASDAQ NFLX provides internet televisionmovie streaming services to subscribers These consist of movies TV shows etc They can be displayed on TVs computers and mobile devices in the US and internationally Netflix offers domestic streaming international streaming and domestic DVD delivery It is thought of as the pioneer in its space but it has more recently been facing a lot of large and tough competition For a company that trades at a PE of and an FPE of new strong competition is a big concern A growthmomentum stock needs only to show flat results for a little while before the market destroys its inflated stock price Amazon Prime NASDAQ AMZN is now showing some HBO and HULU is now showing some STARZ and many of the major television networks latest offerings Apple TV is Apple NASDAQ AAPL Chromecast is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and there is YouTube which is also a part of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>The major television networks are now broadcasting their own shows over the internet for a fee or delayed a week without the fee but with commercials All of the cable or satellite TV broadcasters of wide variety television such as Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA NASDAQ CMCSK DirectTV NASDAQ DTV Dish Network NASDAQ DISH all seem to provide access to a variety of extra content such as STARZ NASDAQ STRZA HBO Cinemax etc for a fee There is really have a large and growing number of suppliers of rich content especially when you consider that Canada is going to individually selectable channel content for cable The numbers simply dont add up for Netflix to be able to continue to grow at the rate it did early on For anyone who wants to save money on their TV costs they can get virtually all of the great new shows on a one week delayed basis for free as long as they have a high speed internet connection ATT NYSE T among many others will provide you with this at a reasonable cost Even Netflix own fiscal results show this disturbing trend see the excerpt from NFLXs Q Lettter to Shareholders Investors should notice the disturbing overall downward trend in Operating Income They should notice the disturbing downward trend in Net Income Some might point to the blip up to million in Net Income in Q However if investors look more closely they will see that this was due to a tax accrual release after an audit resolution Analysts usually subtract out such one time events for adjusted net income On that basis the Net Income was only million in Q The downtrend is intact The downtrend in Free Cash Flow is just as clear The net adds appear to be weakening or at least stagnating see table below The net additions were weak in Q and Q They may have gone up for Christmas but NFLXs adds appear to be overall leveling out or weakening as its number of subscribers increases Plus Europe a major growth opportunity is in terrible economic shape currently It seems unlikely to provide huge growth in the near future Even if the number of adds stays at a million number each quarter the percentage growth is decreasing as the number of subscribers increases That virtually ensures that NFLX cannot continue much longer as a high growth stock The analysts are sure to turn on it soon and it is sure to crash when they do Investors should note the uptrend in Streaming Content Obligations the topmost table above which are in billions of dollars in contrast to the rest of the data which is in millions of dollars From Q to QE the cost of content rose from B to B B or almost Meanwhile Operating Income and Net Income after the adjustment mentioned above fell OUCH The total revenue rose from B in Q to B in Q B This revenue increase is less than of the increase in the content costs DOUBLE OUCH No healthy company can sustain this kind of behavior for long and this DOES appear to be a longer term trend On top of that Netflix appears to be trying to disguise this trend by stating all of the data in millions of dollars except the increasing content costs which it states in billions of dollars Reed Hastings is a salesman as many CEOs are For instance in the conference call on Q earnings he claimed million adds each quarter This is deliberately misleading when the average number of Net Adds per quarter for FY posted in the Letter to shareholders released by Netflix with Q earnings was million You need to look very closely at anything Reed Hastings says or puts out The truth is more likely to be in the fine print When you add the terrible fundamentals discussed at the beginning of this article to the FY results you have an ugly outlook for NFLX NFLX stock price at the close on March was per share The Book Value Per Share was Admittedly NFLX is a mostly software company but the share price is still hugely inflated With so many of Neflixs trends pointing downward fewer and fewer people will claim that NFLX should go up On March NFLX was started at HOLD by Argus The firm said it would look for a more appropriate entry point in the low s as an opportunity to raise its rating to BUY On March NFLX was downgraded to SELL from HOLD by Evercore ISI Evercore cut its price target from to per share This last downgrade is particularly important because Evercore is an HFT trader and it knows the likely behavior of the other HFT traders When even momentum traders like Evercore start to downgrade a momentum stock watch out below The bottom could be about to fall out and when the bottom does fall out of a momentum stock it will often lose or more of its stock price Due to increases in content expenses NFLX also has a trend of losing content It lost STARZ over movies and STARZ TV shows in when STARZ raised the asking price for its content It lost its about movies from Warner Bros MGM and Universal in when those companies decided to market themselves under Warner Active Instant service NFLX lost another movie titles at the end of due to licensing issues These includes such favorites as Top Gun and Titanic It lost a slew of titles in September NFLX lost more movie titles in February such as Apocalypse Now Batman Robin some James Bond movies etc I am sure I have left a lot of things out I have also left out the content that NFLX has added such as that it is producing itself However that is small compared to its losses Are subscribers really going to be content with getting less and less as content costs go up It seems doubtful and content costs for NFLX are rising despite the losses to the NFLX library TRIPLE OUCH The above chart shows a huge amount of upward resistance with the almost quadruple top technical structure Certainly there is at least a double top technical formation and that appears to presage a trip down to below per share before the stock will possibly be able to rise again appreciably If Murphys Law holds the momentum traders will prove me wrong However I would point out that Evercore ISI is one of those momentum traders and it has recently downgraded the stock Therefore the chances of momentum swinging against me on this call are much reduced Further the fundamentals are getting harder and harder to deny Net adds were weak in both Q and Q Plus even with a maintenance of the million per quarter approximate Net Add average for good quarters the Net Add average is becoming a lower percentage growth factor as the number of subscribers grows As the total number of paid subscribers grows million total subscribers in Q the turnover number losses of subscribers is likely to grow with that number That means the cost to acquire and keep subscribers will inevitably go up When you add this to the increases in the content costs NFLX has an even more difficult task in front of it When the average analysts EPS growth estimate for FY is you have to think that a momentum stock with negative EPS growth in will fall from its current heights Admittedly the FY EPS growth estimate is for EPS growth but that may be a pie in the sky estimate The US could easily be in recession by then and NFLX earnings would likely shrink instead of gain in that case The February Durable Goods Orders were The Core Capital Goods Orders were also The article Reasons US Q GDP Growth May Be Much More Negative Than Some Are Thinking outlines more of the recent US economic weaknesses It is worth a read if you want to understand better where the US economy may go and why In a weakening US economy more US customers may decide that free content with commercials available from the networks HULU youtube etc is a better option than paying for NFLX HULU and the networks really have a lot of great content available for free to those willing to watch advertisements andor willing to wait up to one week after a live air date to see a TV show NFLX is currently a SELL under these circumstances Down to around per share it is probably a short especially if the market is about to sell off Remember we may be close to seeing Greece leave the Euro Zone That by itself might cause a sell off in equities Add that equities are generally over priced at this time and you have a situation fraught with peril NFLX is among the riskiest of all equities with its nose bleed valuation Take your profits while you can This stock is a long term SELL far lower than the likely per share near term bottom The fundamentals have caught up with it and I can see no end game that will allow it to rescue itself SELL Conversely a resolution of Greeces problems might cause markets to rise on that news NFLX would likely rise with an overall market rising tide because that is what highly shorted momentum stocks do NFLX is short of its float as of March It would most likely get short squeezed upward in a Greece problem resolution scenario Longer term I still believe NFLX will fall Of course there are those that tout international growth The facts back great international growth only to a slight degree International NFLX streaming is not showing profit now even if Reed Hastings says or implies it is The loss on international streaming was million for Q This was over twice the million NFLX lost on international streaming in Q It is possible NFLX could turn this around in time and some analysts agree with that thesis However that seems extremely unlikely to happen in the next years The world economy seems to be worsening rather than improving Therefore an explosion in NFLX profits within that timeframe seems unlikely Of course it is within the realm of possibility and thus it may provide some fodder for momentum traders to push the stock upward However NFLX investors would have to ignore a lot of hard cold facts in order for momentum traders to be successful in that It could still happen but it is unlikely Therefore dont bet the farm on a Netflix short but a Netflix short is a worthy investment If I owned the stock now I would certainly at least take profits SELL IT Source Double Or Triple Top Slowing Adds
