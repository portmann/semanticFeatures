from the site After the recent Amazon earnings which were not bad at all but which put a lid on the companys growth expectations there was just one thing missing the same thing that capped Apples own growth and creativity a stock buyback Well we just got it On February the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to billion of the Companys common stock The program allows the Company to repurchase its shares opportunistically from time to time when it believes that doing so would enhance longterm shareholder value The repurchase authorization does not have a fixed expiration Purchases may be effected through one or more open market transactions privately negotiated transactions transactions structured through investment banking institutions or a combination of the foregoing This stock repurchase authorization replaces the previous billion stock repurchase authorization approved by the Board of Directors in And just like that AMZN joins the vaunted AAPL club in admitting it is fresh out of organic growth ideas and will resort to balance sheet alchemy to boost its price higher over the foreseeable future ostensibly first using cash and then debt to raise the funds needed to buyback stock Any immediate spikes in the stock will be faded fast and furious Wed EscapeKey Wed Quasi Can I buy AMZN on Amazon Will drones deliver my stock certificates or does it

No organic growth Wed Squid Viscous selling anything on the interwebz is a flawed model Wed cowdiddly CEO and the crony bonus pool issue themselves millions of shares and then buy them back with

was supposed to be the shining light of the future of online Retail that was outstripping brick mortar sales Wed ejmoosa Wed Sanity Bear There really is no one at Amazon who cant figure out that once Amazon stops buying its own stock the removal of a large buyer Amazon itself from the supplydemand equation is going to guarantee a subsequent plunge cementing a loss Wed css Wed RopeADope Wed

Doesnt buybacks reduce the shares issued thus supporting the company share price which in turn supports the market indices If so then comparing todays market indices price with historical prices needs to take this into account With all the buybacks going on the market price today would be lower if the same shares outstanding say in was used Wed bbq on whitehou This vary thing is why some once paid
