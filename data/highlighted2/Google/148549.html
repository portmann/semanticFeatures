and autonomy for the new CEOs Googles Alphabet corporate rebrand is no Netflix Qwikster debacle Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Alphabet plan has been praised and criticized with Mashable suggesting it may be a Qwiksterlike farce All the way back in Netflix NASDAQ NFLX made crazy changes to their products pricing operations and management structure capstoned by splitting out Qwikster the DVDbymail business from Netflix the streaming business It was a temporary disaster because they made the change so abruptly and on the heels of big product and pricing changes Netflixs stock tanked Back then I wrote a blog post about it outlining what they could have done differently Netflix eventually backtracked and abandoned the Qwikster plan Googles latest move to rebrand its corporate parent as Alphabet has some similarities to Netflixs changes in While Mashables article is great clickbait Googles change wont be disastrous It may even be brilliant While the name change feels strange if executed well theres a lot to like about it Transparency Focus Accountability Autonomy for leaders Could they have achieved those without a name change or big reorg fanfare Perhaps But now they are committed Two of the main criticisms of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>the conglomerate has been They waste their monopoly profits from search and advertising on a bunch of wild goose chases No one knows how much they are wasting These criticisms have been largely debunked with the success of Android <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Apps and Chrome Sure GooglePlus is a debacle but for the most part when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>launches a new product it quickly passes good and pushes past great on its way to world domination Nonetheless you will notice Googles stock shoots up every time theres a renewed focus on costs or a pruning of products The reason the argument still has currency is a lot of these side projects dont print money like search ads While that misses the point of the ones designed to strengthen their core dominance the bigger issue is that Googles search and advertising symbiosis is one of natures nearly perfect business models In other words a tough act to follow So what does a rocket ship like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Apple NASDAQ AAPL or Amazon NASDAQ AMZN do for an encore Wall Street might have them do share buybacks and dividends Luckily thats not Larrys and Sergeys style They seem hell bent on finding the NEXT Googlesized market That means big bets lots of them I applaud it America and the world need entrepreneurs to invest like Larry and Sergey Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos These leaders bet and bet big Which brings us back to Alphabet A friend described it as the perfect overlordstyle corporate name it means nothing but encompasses everything But thats the point right In Alphabets case all BETs are ON Create an environment where management teams feel empowered by the strength of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>but unencumbered by the politics Provide a way to orbit the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>sun but not get burned by the flares of strategic alignment See Microsoft under Steve Ballmer One of my favorite business axioms is Peter Druckers what gets measured gets managed For investors this is where it gets interesting Will the breaking out of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>the printing press from the rest of the businesses the cash drains be beneficial or detrimental to the new businesses Will they become hungrier and more capital aware Will there be pressure to get revenue growth or profitability Will it stifle innovation or create just enough tension to push the creativity of each team Will Alphabet let promising innovations be spun off in shareholder friendly ways Positive answers to these questions may determine Alphabets stock returns Larry even tipped his hat to Wall Street in his letter We also like that it means alphabet Alpha is investment return above benchmark which we strive for My hope is that Alphabet will provide the right structure focus and financial discipline that will allow one or more of these emerging businesses to become the next <span style='background-color:
