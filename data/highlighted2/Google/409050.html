similar tax strategy using a tax haven such as Bermuda Braeburn Capital which manages AAPLs bn portfolio of Treasuries and shortdated corporate paper is also instrumental and faces no immediate regulatory threat Analyst estimates of a possible bn in tax liability are likely to be significantly overstated Any unfavourable ruling will likely merely relate to the costplus transfer pricing arrangements entered into with the Irish government and not the worldwide income earned by Apple Sales International The Irish general election has taken place and a new government has finally been formed so we could expect the EC to deliver a ruling as early as this summer Much attention has been given to Apples NASDAQ AAPL corporate structure in recent times on account of its low effective tax rate on global profits as well as owing to negative publicity arising from US Senate hearings and the pending European Commission investigation under article of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union into the joint costingpricing arrangements entered into by Apple with the Irish government For example The Irish Times claims Apple cut its Irish tax bill by more than million between and using an unexplained lower rate Apple itself has said that it pays less than percent in Ireland over the years to The mounting pressure has already resulted in million being paid to settle an Italian tax claim in relation to profits declared in Ireland So are the Irish tax authorities really to blame for facilitating Apple in diminishing its tax liability The decision to take a tougher stance on Irelands idiosyncratic rules for determining corporate residency is unlikely to pose a significant obstacle to Apples socalled stateless income tax strategy which is not at all dissimilar to the double Irish strategy employed by others such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Both structures fundamentally depend on the US check the box classification rules to create a hybrid entity mismatch arrangement as well as the costsharing provisions of Treas reg section According to Joseph P Brothers an associate with Caplin Drysdale in Washington the EU is attacking the wrong target It is focusing on Irish domestic tax law when the real culprits if any exist are the US checkthebox rules the US costsharing safe harbor under Treas reg section and the general international tax principle that wholly owned shell entities located in tax havens regardless of whether the term located means incorporated managed or something else should be respected as economically independent entities rather than mere instrumentalities of their parent companies or overall corporate groups Unlike the double Irish Apples tax structuring structure does not involve any Irish incorporated entities being controlled from tax havens such as Bermuda or the Cayman Islands In Apples case Apple Operations International AOI is an entity incorporated in Ireland and controlled from Cupertino California arguably AOI files no residencybased corporate income tax returns in any jurisdiction because from a US perspective it is resident in Ireland but from an Irish perspective it is a taxresident of California This is because under Irish tax law the residence of some companies is evaluated on the basis of where they are managed and controlled One of the few who is providing a comprehensive analysis of the EC investigation is Seamus Coffey an economist at University College Cork the city where Apple is located in Ireland As Coffey puts it it is like a company that was born here but now lives somewhere else While the double Irish loophole has been repealed and will be phased out by more fundamentally the US check the box rule will still facilitate a similar tax strategy using tax havens such as Bermuda or the Cayman Islands A compromise between President John Kennedy and Congress imposed US taxes on passive income earned abroad in a law known as Subpart F In the Treasury sought to simplify Subpart F with a rule that enabled companies to check the box to label a subsidiary as a disregarded entity for tax purposes In Congress bolstered the loophole by giving corporations more latitude to move some types of income from one foreign unit to another without paying a tax with legislation that became known as the look through rule Due to the check the box and look through loopholes only Apple Distribution International ADI and Apple Retail Holding Europe are recognized as being tax resident in Ireland while the transactions among other entities such as ASI disregarded as being transfers within Ireland Apple Sales International ASI has an Irish logistics and administration branch but like AOI is tax resident nowhere ASI contracts with the thirdparty manufacturer in China as well as international offshore distribution subsidiaries ASI pays dividends to AOE which similarly has an Irish branch but no tax residence AOE in turn pays a dividend to AOI These payments represent passive income for RD which Karl Levin referred to as crown jewels This has garnered much attention considering it is estimated billion of profits earned by ASI between and Joseph Brothers believes that hypothetically if the Irish holding company with tax residence nowhere was transformed into asserting its tax residency in a tax haven such as Bermuda most of the crucial details would function more or less identically The checkthebox election does not require any same country showing so the activities of the Irish operating subsidiary would still be imputed to Bermudan holding company thus avoiding FBCSI By the same token any royalties paid from the Irish operations to the Bermudan holding company would still be ignored from the US perspective so that no FPHCI income would result At the same time these royalties would still be deductible against the trading income of the Irish operating subsidiary The costsharing arrangement would not be affected Hence the Irish treatment of management and control is not instrumental to the avoidance strategy The double Irish works mainly because of the hybrid entity mismatch possibilities available because of the checkthebox and the costsharing regime under US domestic rules Moreover a point that Seamus Coffey alluded to back in is that simply because the profits are in an Irishincorporated company does give the EU the right to tax them Indeed assistant US Treasury Secretary Robert Stack reiterated to a Treasury Finance Committee hearing that if Apple was liable to pay more tax in Ireland it would be the US taxpayer who would effectively be footing the bill owing to the US tax credit system afforded to the US based multinationals Some such as Coy and Drucker argue that if the US was to adopt a territorial system akin to what is used by most of the OECD the US would largely stop trying to go after companies worldwide income and instead would mostly tax profits earned in the US Supporters of a territorial taxation include the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform created by Obama The crux of the matter as Coffey succinctly summarized it appears to be that the US wants to have its cake and eat it According to the Fiscal Times lobbyists argued that eliminating the check the box loophole would damage the USbased multinational companies by forcing them to pay more taxes not only in the United States but also to other hightax regions such as France While much condemnation has been cast upon tax havens such as Ireland it is quite clear that US politics is the instrumental factor in facilitating such tax avoidance schemes According to a former Treasury Department official who helped write the check the box rule once a policy mistake is made that is favorable to taxpayers and particularly to big taxpayers it is extremely difficult to reverse Ironically enough the US has been passed the mantle of the biggest tax haven in the world according to Andrew Penney of Rothschild Co in an interview with Bloomberg This was made in reference to certain states such as Nevadas refusal to comply with newly imposed OECD disclosure standards These new international standards were inspired by USs own Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act in which now they are actively resisting when it comes to aiding other countries in fighting tax evasion Save perhaps a tax holiday on repatriated profits any change to the US corporate tax code is highly unlikely Therefore Apples tax avoidance strategy is unlikely to face any threat on the Western side of the pond From a narrower perspective the profits accumulated by ASI are ultimately not actually held in cash of course but as Treasury bills and shortdated corporate bonds managed by Braeburn Capital which is effectively the worlds largest hedge fund as labelled by zerohedgecom Braeburn Capital is located in Reno Nevada which has become the banking secrecy jurisdiction du jour according to Peter A Cotorceanu a lawyer at Anaford AG a Zurich law firm It is not eminently clear why Braeburn is located in Reno but it is likely because passive entities or entities organized solely to manage intangible investments are not subject to commerce tax under Nevada state law Moreover intellectual property revenue from the sale or exchange of the right to use trademarks trade names patents copyrights or other similar property is not considered gross taxable income and dividends and interest from federal and state bonds or securities is tax deductible which would be very favorable on any count Thus an equity holder in AAPL will incur capital gains through Braeburn accumulating reinvested taxfree coupon payments which would otherwise be subject to income tax if an individual investor were to hold them rather than the Nevada incorporated holding company Braeburn may receive far less media attention than Ireland does in Apples tax strategy but the weight it lifts in avoiding taxes is far from insignificant Importantly Braeburn is not likely to be subject to regulatory threat any time soon either The more pressing issue which of course will have implications for AAPL in the near term is the pending European Commission ruling which could be returned as early as this month While the impact of the investigation on Apples share price thus far appears to be negligible in its Q filing for Q Apple was obliged to warn that it could face material financial penalties as a result of the investigation Analysts are estimating clawbacks of bn or even more In a worstcase scenario JPM even estimates a bn clawback based on a rate on bn of international income over years This is highly implausible as it would mean a tectonic shift in the aforementioned taxresidency rules What is far more realistic is an unfavourable ruling based on the Irish Department of Finances validation of transfer pricing arrangements also known as advance pricing arrangements APAs APAs are arrangements that determine in advance of intragroup transactions an appropriate set of criteria for the determination of the transfer pricing for those transactions over a fixed period of time The question is whether the costplus arrangements adhered to the arms length principle In a basis for determining AOEs net profit was proposed by Apple and agreed by Irish Revenue According to that ruling the net profit attributable to the AOE branch would be calculated as of operating expenses up to an annual amount of USD million and crucially in addition it was agreed to accept a markup of on costs in excess of million in order not to prohibit the expansion of the Irish operations The Commission made clear that its investigation was focused these TP arrangements It asserted that the reduction of the margin after a certain level above USD million would have been motivated by employment considerations which is not a reasoning based on the arms length principle In particular the two margins of and are relatively far apart and should the margin of effectively constitute an arms length pricing the margin of would be unlikely to fall within the same range of pricing while applying the same degree of prudence However this relates to how much profit is attributed to the Irish branches and doesnt establish that all of the profit of these companies is taxable in Ireland The agreements were on a costplus basis so essentially were unrelated to the revenues and profits of the overall company which have accelerated dramatically since It is probable that the EC will rule against Apple on these grounds However this matter is unrelated to the worldwide income attributed to ASI and would not bring the taxability of the bn or some of the absurd headline figures that have been floating around into question Bloomberg Intelligence reckons the recovery of profits from favourable APAs based on gross margins could still be large estimating a sum of bn I believe that this figure is still at the high end Even if we are to assume the worstcase scenario and take the profit figures from the ASI filings obtained by the Australian Financial Review from to and the ASI filings from to made public by the US Senate subcommittee the profit earned by ASI between and is around bn If the EC was to rule that this should be subject to Irelands tax rate then Apple would be liable for around a bn clawback This simple figure albeit excluding ASI profits from and which are not yet available is the worst possible case which would lead me to believe the bn Bloomberg estimate is on the high end of the scale Moreover the actual ruling may bode far more favourably for Apple than the market is currently pricing in In any event the Irish government has signalled its reluctance to accept such a windfall and Tim Cook has of course stated his intention to fight an unfavourable ruling which would make for a long arduous process When will we get a ruling on the matter The Financial Times is of the belief that the ECs delay in delivering a judgement has been on account of not wanting to influence the result of Irelands general election last February A ruling against Apple and the Irish government would likely have provided ammunition to the rising left in Ireland which is deeply critical of Irelands accommodative policy for attracting multinationals The FT had predicted a ruling to be made by this summer but Vestager has warned dont hold your breath I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not
