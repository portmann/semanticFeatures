Crystal ad blocking on Safari will render ecommerce sites incorrectly Apple has a quick fix Users can just longpress the refresh icon on iOS Safari to quickly disable ad blocking browser extensions I know for a fact that my Crystal ad block extension for Apple NASDAQ AAPL iOS Safari is instantly detected and blocked by smart advertisingdependent websites like hackintoshzone I already discussed the possibility of website administrators coding a few lines of PHPJavascript to quickly deny access to their site content to mobile Safari users who enabled ad blocking extensions I am not an iOS app developer but unlike the doom gloom of fellow Seeking Alpha contributor Mark Hibben I was already dismissive of the impactrelevance of ad blockings future on mobile Safari Web programmers are smarter than we all give them credit for Once site administrators notice a significant drop in their ad revenue because Apple is allowing adblocking on iOS Safari they will eventually implement a blockthead blockeruser policy I previously warned Seeking Alpha readers that thirdparty extensions for Safari would cause some problems for iOS device users It is happening now The reality that Apple is getting a cut from the topgrossing Crystal ad block Safari extension makes it partly responsible for what is happening now Crystal is making a mess out of some ecommerce sites for Safari users People who bought Crystal and enabled it are now going to have a horrible experience when they try shopping on their favorite online ecommerce sites Crystal users will find the online stores of Walmart NYSE WMT Sears NASDAQ SHLD and Lulemon NASDAQ LULU unavailable andor rendered incorrectly with dead links and incomplete content As per the abovelinked Fortune article buying and enabling ad block extensions is disastrous for users and online store operators alike Just look at the screenshot below enabling Crystal on Searscom serves a blank home page Fortunes investigation of this disaster forced Crystal developer Dean Murphy to issue a statement that he will soon whitelist select ecommerce sites He only said select not some not majority not all Apples continuing approval of a websitemurdering paid browser extension apps is not going to endear it to bigbudget digital advertisers like Walmart and Sears Apple has a littleknown quick fix for the issues ad blockers will cause for iPhoneiPad web surfers The trick is to just longpress the refresh button to get the option to reload inaccessible sites by disabling adblocking extensions like Crystal However I suspect a majority of iOS device owners doesnt know of this easy solution The danger now is for big online commerce operators to suffer a big drop in their sales due to iOS device owners not being able to access their sites properly Unless Dean Murphy and other ad block developers on iOS come up with a solution for this quandary Apple is likely to get a bad rep among ecommerce site owners This is worse than the malwareiniOSapps scandal in China At least we all long knew Apple doesnt have the best kind of online security for its iOS device users The fact that Apple is approving and profiting from ad blockers that might cause billions of dollars of lost sales to online stores is a worse PR disaster in the making Angry online marketers are unlikely to ever use iAd to promote their products and get site referrals to their online stores The ad blockusing iPhoneiPad online shopper who doesnt know the longpress the refresh button solution on Safari will find himself unable to shop at some ecommerce sites What could happen next is this frustrated user will then just go and use his Android phonetablet to shop The other way of disabling Crystal is to go iOS Settings Safari Content Blockers and disable Crystal This fourstep method is not very user friendly for impatient online shopping iPhoneiPad users I urge Apple to reconsider its support of ad blocking on iOS Safari It might also be prudent for it to take down Crystal while the developer is still unable to fix the incorrect rendering of ecommerce sites The cut from apps is minuscule compared to the billions that Apple gets from <span

to allow ads on Safari mobile browsing Tim Cook should crack down on forprofit app developers who submit bugridden ad blockers Provoking hurt feelings from Crystalaffected online ecommerce sites is a bad move for Apple If I am an online shop owner that sees reduced purchases because Apple approved an ad blocker that prevented iPadiPhone users from buying from my store I would be stupid not to boycott Apple devices and services AAPL is no longer a Buy for me AAPL was of my portfolio but Im gradually reducing my exposure to it Im a retired employee of the advertisingmarketing industry I still have friends there who intensely dislike Apples support for greedy ad block developers I am one of the millions of graphic designerscreative professionals who salute Marco Arment maker of the
