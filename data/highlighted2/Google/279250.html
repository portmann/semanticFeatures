I was bullish for It has been a tougher year than anticipated mainly due to the China stock market crisis Between June th and August th the Shanghai lost The North American markets usually dont follow the Asian ones but this time the panic wave hit all markets Fortunately we all went back to earth with the quarterly earnings in October The US stock market recuperated all losses and as of the end of November the time where I wrote this the SP was back in positive territories year to date We experienced a similar situation to October where the market was back on solid ground after a few month of higher volatility However results werent that impressive in Q and the stock market didnt post doubledigit returns for On the other side the economy is going on the right side As the unemployment rate was around last year we are now down to Job creation stats are on a uptrend and new construction is well over a million annualized now Even better we even started to see some core inflation rising inflation without food and gas price included Latest core inflation report in November shows a increase The Fed raised its interest rate in December months after what we expected a year ago This is to show you how fast things evolve and how they are unpredictable This news was positively accepted by the markets as it is a clear sign that the US economy is going toward the right direction was punctuated by currency headwinds hurting many companies revenues Global economy slowdown didnt help sales growth either Finally we all expected the American consumers to benefit from a drop in the gas price and to spend more This is what history tells us about oil price going down consumer spending is going up Once again we had a great proof that past events dont guarantee the future as consumers decided to pay off their debts instead of buying a new Ford and going on vacation to Disney World Fortunately the wind is starting to turn again as consumers spend more and gain in confidence In fact we have reached in a year high in consumer sentiment Looking forward I believe will be a positive one for the US stock market The US economy will continue to support the worlds economy and Canadians should escape their short recession by selling more to the US Consumer spending will rise again and will lead to stronger local sales I am bullish on the US stock market for In order to benefit from this bullish market Ive identified four dividend growth stocks that should have a good year Union Pacific is a transportation company focused on railroads Its Union Pacific Railroad covers states across the western of the USA UNP shows a great diversification in terms of sectors for Automotive Agricultural products Chemicals Intermodal Industrial products and Coal The reason to purchase UNP today is simple go past the shortsighted challenging environment and look at the big picture Low oil price will only last so long and the trucking industry will not stay as a fierce competitor over the long run In the meantime management is doing a fabulous work to continue improving the companys productivity with longer and faster trains along with controlling costs This is a strong dividend payer with a relatively good yield There are many risks that may affect UNPs stock price in First the low price of fuel puts back truckers on the competitors map Second coal commodity doesnt have the spot light at the moment and suffers from the overall cheap energy commodities environment Third it was a bad year for intermodal sectors as the fracking industry slowed down drastically following the oil price However it will be a strong holding for the future Microsoft is a regular on this list Microsoft is the best known and most important software company in the world Along with its famous line of software products Microsoft also offers various services such as servers including cloud systems business solutions support and consulting entertainment Xbox and other online services Microsoft has found another niche to dominate heres why the cloud business will push this giant higher We all know the strength of Microsoft lies with all businesses using its services Windows Office series but also servers and business services Since the cloud is the next big thing for most companies Microsoft can expect huge growth from this segment in the future Plus this relatively new niche is a perfect complement for MSFTs current business A few years ago I wasnt as confident in Microsofts future the Xbox wasnt doing that well BING seemed like just another Yahoo trying to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Windows sales werent impressive However a few years later BING generates revenues Xbox is a strong player in the gaming industry and cloud services came out of nowhere with great growth potential I guess this summarizes the risk you face while investing in a technology stock This tells you how fast things evolve in the technology sector Autoliv is a designer and manufacturer of safety products for the automobile industry Its product offering includes air bags seatbelts steering wheels passive safety electronics and active safety systems such as radar night vision and cameras ALV owns of all automotive patents for its sideimpact air bags The company spends around of its sales on research and development to stay ahead of the competition ALV had to suspend its dividend in due to the car industry crisis Since then the dividend payment has grown by a CAGR from to The idea of investing in Autoliv is to select a company that is in the right place at the right time with the car industry growing and the demand for additional safety If car makers want to reach and star safety ratings they will need Autolivs products to achieve their goal The company has seen doubledigit growth in many countries such as Europe Japan and the rest of Asia An important risk associated with this company is that ALV doesnt have any incredible competitive advantage It is true it invests massively in RD and has the benefit of a good reputation However the company continuously faces fierce competition where car makers request volume discounts and reduced prices for product agreements Lockheed Martin is the worlds largest defense contractor earning of its sales from the US Department of Defense from other US government agencies and from international clients Heavy regulation years of symbiosis with the US Defense and its knowhow are three key elements protecting most of LMTs business Lets just say you cant start building military aircraft and missiles in your basement to compete with this defense behemoth With terrorist threats growing in importance we can expect LMT to share its expertise in defense across the planet This could be a very good way for LMT to diversify its source of income The acquisition of Sikorsky helicopter operations will also add more growth perspective in the future The companys leadership in the defense sector will play a very important role in the upcoming years as several threats are rising LMT has always been dependent of the US government budget for defense It has been discussed on several occasions that those expenses have to be cut Hence LMT suffers directly from such events We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the personal contact data
