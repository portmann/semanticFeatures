class='textDiv'>Why Apple Should Invest In Tesla Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha A tieup could return excitement to the Apple name and create the next big thing for the company Apple needs a boost for its venture into autos and this could be the ultimate disruptor for the auto industry Tesla would benefit from the capital infusion and Apples software expertise Both companies would gain especially in Asia from where much of their future growth will come There has been much speculation about what Apple NASDAQ AAPL is hoping to do in the auto space Nobody but Tim Cook really knows but there is little doubt it concerns the inevitable future of electric and autonomous vehicles An investment in but not an outright purchase of Tesla NASDAQ TSLA would bring many benefits to both parties There would be benefits in terms of product and in use of capital Massive investment is needed in moving from gasoline and diesel vehicles to electric vehicles EVs Apple has the money and the software expertise Tesla has the best product and the strongest brand on the road Apple has been ramping up its RD research in recent years The reasons for this increase are hard to know Some have speculated that it is investing towards building an EV This seems very doubtful The capital requirements would be huge and it would be a huge gamble by the usually cautious Tim Cook Some of it is no doubt being directed towards investments in the auto space Much of it may be just the result of increased vertical integration by Apple which comes at a cost What is not in doubt is that Apple has huge stockpiles of cash and that the market has been concerned that it does not have a clear direction in how to spend this cash That is one reason for the relatively low stock price with its PE ratio of This seems ridiculously low when compared to that of say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL at or Facebook NASDAQ FB at The current cash position has not been good for the Apple stock price and thus Apple investors Apple does buy small companies on a regular basis Its largest purchase of recent times was that of Beats Music and Beats Electronics in for US billion The benefits of this are not so clear especially bearing in mind the unenthusiastic reaction to the recent Apple Music launch Most recently Apple has invested US billion in Didi Chuxing This makes a lot more sense It is another step into the auto world and an investment in a country which represents a quarter of Apples sales total Didi is in fact losing substantial amounts of money in a price war with Uber Private UBER in China However Apples investment is presumably not for shortterm profits An investment in Tesla would also not be for shortterm profit China is of course Teslas second biggest market and one in which it is planning to build a factory A threeway cooperation with Didi Chuxing has obvious potential Apple as of Q was anticipating a total program up to March in which US billion would be spent in Buybacks The total capital return will rise to US billion when taking into account dividends and share settlements Apples cash in hand plus the money it is likely to make in the next two years would leave it with about US billion in the bank As of Q Some analysts have come out against Apple buying Tesla for revenue reasons This is a case of not seeing the forest for the trees The argument is that Apple will produce revenues of about US billion this year and Tesla only about US billion So there would only be a increase in revenues for Apple in the first year of a total buyout This misses the point of the longterm synergies and reflects short termism The market cap of Tesla is currently round about US billion So Apple could swallow up the whole company without much of a financial problem despite most of its cash being held offshore However a complete takeover would present difficulties in combining the two even though they may share quite a lot in corporate culture The history of large corporate mergers is not a happy one They are more often the product of the egos of CEOs rather than adding value for shareholders There needs to be a clear strategic imperative for them to succeed This was shown in an article studying the matter by The Economist magazine One of the few successful megamergers has been in the auto industry that of Fiat Chrysler NYSE FCAU In that case CEO Sergio Marchionne has had a clear strategic vision which he has successfully implemented Owning Tesla outright would dilute Apples earnings and reduce gross profit margins The stock market might not take that very well The PE ratio is already very low compared to its market peers Apples Gross Profit Margin is Teslas Apples Operating Profit Margin is Teslas is Apples Net Profit Margin is Teslas is However any negative effect on return on capital for Apple would be small compared to the effects of actually producing an EV themselves Another argument against a full takeover is that the Teslas stock price is overvalued That of course is a matter of opinion and only time will tell So a complete takeover might not benefit stockholders of Apple even if the longterm benefits might well be very positive Also it is hard to see Elon Musk staying at the helm of Tesla if he is not still the allpowerful leader It is difficult to imagine Tesla without Musk at this stage However many see Elon Musk as the type of charismatic and visionary leader that Apple has been lacking since Steve Jobs A partnership between the mediasavvy Musk and the administrator Tim Cook has great potential So a minority stake with joint marketing and branding agreements would be ideal It would produce mutual benefits for the companies and for their investors A complete takeover at a later date would be likely Apple needs the next big thing if its stock price is not to crawl along at the current low PE levels The development of EVs and autonomous vehicles could well be this as I detailed in a recent article Gasoline and diesel vehicles cannot provide a quantum leap in the auto world There are too many compromises necessary between CO emissions nitrous oxide emissions performance and engine life EVs can offer radical new opportunities in which software is key especially in autonomous vehicles Car manufacturers could become just hardware producers much as Apple caused to happen in the personal computer industry It is hard to see how Apple can make a big impact in the auto market without a dramatic move As other partnerships get announced almost daily Apple is in danger of following a trend rather than creating it There are countless obvious synergies between Apples software and hardware products and Teslas software driven EVs As the time of autonomous vehicles gets closer so the pace of such software and hardware tieups will increase Another such tieup has just been announced as the pace of change quickens Toyota Motor Corp NYSE TM and Uber UBER signed an agreement to cover both vehicle sales and other research as well Uber is deeply involved in autonomous technology Toyota is investing large sums in Artificial Intelligence for selfdriving cars On the same day another such partnership was announced between Volkswagen OTCPKVLKAY and Israelibased taxi startup Gett Volkswagen is reeling from its diesel emissions scandal and needs to move on rapidly and try to look like a good corporate citizen Apple has its CarPlay using the iPhone It is now available in auto models from automakers As it is though it just seems like one more software revenue generator It does not move the needle in any meaningful way It is a connectivity tool for an iOS interface to a vehicles information and entertainment system It has competition from auto companies investing in their own systems as well as Googles Android Auto It is true that Teslas own system is based on open source Linux but longterm integration with Apples iOS would not be a major hurdle Apple derives of its income from China and is making a big push into India Tim Cooks recent swing through Asia showed this In India the not particularly charismatic Cook was treated almost like a rock star This is a sign of the power of brands in India and in Asia as a whole During his visit Cook announced various initiatives including retail stores and software developments involving the hiring of thousands of Indian engineers Foxconn Apples main contract supplier has plans to invest US billion in manufacturing facilities in the country Much of it is expected to involve Apple products To gain meaningful traction in the country Apple or Tesla would need to manufacture there under Prime Minister Modis Make in India campaign China is a more likely immediate recipient of a tieup between Apple and Tesla Apart from the Didi Chuxing situation combined marketing and investments there would make sense Tesla is extremely focused on China and has had discussions with potential joint venture manufacturing partners For both Apple and Tesla China is their second largest market One reason for the tieup with Didi was the further promotion of Apple Pay One can imagine the consumer calling a taxi or an autonomous vehicle or a carshare vehicle on his iPhone and paying for it with Apple Pay This could be standard in all Tesla vehicles and in many countries Tesla has proved ideal as a taxi or ridesharing vehicle It is Ubers most popular vehicle in the neighboring Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong as I detailed in a recent article Even away from autos there are clear synergies Teslas move into home energy storage systems fits with Apples move into various home management features and its Home Kit product The photo below shows how Tesla feels they can combine their Powerwall and Powerpack products along with their autos News reports from Reuters suggest Apple is studying the EV charging business especially as it relates to Home Energy systems These have not been confirmed Despite what some bears here have claimed Tesla is in fact ramping up its home energy storage solutions There is a strong international push to this There are dedicated sales teams and webbased offerings for specific markets such as China and Australia Home Kit is another sound Apple product but not one that is setting the world on fire iOS devices enable homeowners to connect products around their house such as turning off lights lowering thermostats etc It works with outside brands and enables accessories to talk to each other and interact with each other The synergies with Teslas Powerwall are clear The single biggest benefit to Tesla at least in the short term would of course be a cash one The orders pouring in and the need for large sums of capital investment tell their own story The recent capital raise was highly successful The US billion raised should leave the company with cash of about US billion Even this amount would not rule out a future return to the market in either late or early as Model production ramps up A cash infusion from Apple would cut out the need for this It would therefore cut down on the bears constant and so far unfounded claims of a stock price crash due to stock dilution So it would also be accretive for Tesla stockholders The Gigafactory now starting to ship out Teslas energy solution products may need some extra finance for completion Additionally Apple is a huge user of batteries Cooperation between the two would make a lot of sense Particularly in Europe there is growing potential for energy storage systems such as this Customers can reduce energy bills by storing energy from solar panels or other renewable energy sources They can also be used as a source of emergency backup power during energy blackouts Nissan OTCPKNSANY has been doing this as a backup to the effects of typhoons and earthquakes in their home country of Japan It will be marketing aggressively a range of consumer home storage products in Europe starting in September this year In retail in general there could be opportunities Apple stores are undergoing some design updates as they may be getting a bit dated now On a revenue per square foot basis they are still the most successful retail operations in history Tesla sells direct through its own stores and cuts out the traditional dealer network Combining Apple retail with Tesla retail is an exciting and logical idea It would also help in countries like India where Apple is such a strong brand despite limited sales Indias Minister of State for Power Coal and New and Renewable Energy Piyush Goyal announced in March a target of having an all EV fleet on the roads of India by The move was backed by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers As things stand now Tesla would not have the finance or the Management time to be involved In an alliance with Apple their involvement might be possible The Boston Consulting Group estimates that the driverless auto market will be worth US billion by Tesla is at the forefront of this technology Its Autopilot feature is the most advanced on the market The driverless auto market will need increased capital investment and require top software and hardware engineers Apple Tesla together could achieve this The financial might of Apple behind Tesla would give confidence to consumers that Tesla is here to stay The biggest advantage to both companies would in fact lie in Asia China is key to the success of both companies India is being looked at with yearning for the long run Many other countries in the region have great potential Apple is perhaps restricted by management resources from putting more focus on Asia The lack of Apple retail stores in Asia is an example of this Apple has stores only in China but there are a lot more in just California Hong Kong Japan and Australia Tesla is restricted by the lack of management resources but even more so by the lack of finance Even in countries where there is high demand and a charging infrastructure in place Tesla cannot meet up with demand This is currently the case in Hong Kong where buyers have complained that their leadtimes for delivery for the Model S had got longer South Korea is an example of both the problems and the opportunities Apple and Tesla face Apple has made substantial inroads there despite it being the home of archrival Samsung OTCSSNLF Up to July last year market share for mobile phones tripled to This compares to Samsung at and LG Electronics at Yet there is not a single Apple Store in the country Tesla has previously said it would like to market its cars in Korea where million autos are sold each year The main market players there are both coming out with EVs Hyundai has a plugin version of its Sonata midsized sedan and a hydrogen fuel cell version of its Tuscon crossover Kia has an electronic version of its Soul economy vehicle Teslas CTO JB Straubel visited Seoul in November last year He confirmed Tesla was interested in the Korean market but had no firm plans for officially entering the market at that time We dont want to damage the brand by growing too quickly and not having enough infrastructure service and support for our customers In January this year Tesla did however incorporate Tesla Korea Ltd in the country Now it has been reported that Tesla has struck a partnership agreement with Korean automotive company Mando Corp to work on selfdriving autos together However this has not been confirmed by either party In another sign of the potential for Tesla a report in The Korea Herald this week made interesting reading A survey of the countrys autoworkers showed a stunning would consider buying a Tesla if the brand was available in their country It predicted that when EVs became widespread in Korea the market leaders would be Tesla Hyundai and Kia We live in an age where brand power and brand loyalty are key especially in brandconscious Asia Apple and Tesla would be a brand combination made in heaven in a country like Korea with two of the most powerful brands in the world joined together Worldwide brands matter increasingly Apple is still the most valuable brand in the world It has however lost a bit of its brand equity amongst the young and environmentally conscious An alliance with Tesla would do much to repair this damage Apple has historically shied away from taking over large companies There has been much speculation on potential targets in recent years A complete takeover of Tesla might not be advantageous in the short run A substantial investment in Tesla by Apple would have nothing but advantages for both companies These advantages could play out in finance product development sales and marketing opportunities and in brand development Since Steve Jobs Apple has been following trends rather than setting them They have done this very successfully However this is a golden opportunity for Apple It could define a new market and the next big thing for the company The financial might and software expertise of Apple could combine with Teslas clear lead in EV manufacture to prove the ultimate disruptor of the auto industry Disclosure I amwe
