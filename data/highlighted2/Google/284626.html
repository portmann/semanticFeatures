Stadium November Steve FlynnUSA TODAY Sports The National Football League is planning to livestream all three games scheduled to be played in London next season and Apple Inc AAPLO and Alphabet Inc GOOGLO subsidiary <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>are among the technology companies in talks to buy the rights to conduct the streams said two sources familiar with the situation Last year the NFL partnered with Yahoo Inc YHOOO to livestream a London game the first time a technology company has streamed a game for free to viewers Livestreaming is becoming increasingly popular as more consumers cancel their cable subscriptions a practice known as cordcutting Winning a partnership with the NFL to livestream one or all three games would be a big victory for a technology company Apple owns Apple TV and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>owns YouTube If Apple or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>win the rights to stream one or more games it would be a first for either company The NFL wants to livestream more London games after last years streaming experiment was deemed a success according to the sources who asked to remain anonymous because they are not permitted to speak to the media It is unclear if the NFL seeks to sell the rights to stream all three games as a package or individually or how much the league is asking for the rights Representatives for the NFL Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>declined to comment About million viewers worldwide watched at least part of the livestreamed game in October which was broadcast during earlymorning hours in the United States therefore drawing a smaller audience than regular NFL games In some cases the stream of the game automatically started playing on Yahoo websites and consumers who clicked on those websites were counted as viewers if the streams played for more than seconds An average of million viewers were watching at any given time according to data released by Yahoo and the NFL About onethird of the viewership came from outside the United States Nationwide broadcasts of Thursday night games on CBS and NBCs Sunday night games average more than million US viewers per minute according to Nielsen TV data In the months leading up to London game livestreamed by Yahoo Yahoo dropped its asking price for commercials during the game from to less than buyers said Ad slots were sold out Still media buyers said the games overall viewership and the participation of more than advertisers signaled a success at the time Given the big push by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Apple and other tech companies to build their presence in the media world it is no surprise they would want to partner with the NFL said Tom Richardson a sports media professor at Columbia University in New York City Professional sports content is among the most premium content you can find said Richardson who is also president of consulting firm Convergence Sports Media If it happened in Hollywood why wouldnt it happen with professional sports Separately the NFL has put its Thursday night football package
