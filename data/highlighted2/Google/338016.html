been sold much sooner Yahoo and especially its search business offers excellent synergies for Alibabas attempts to enter the US search market Microsoft or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>may purchase Yahoos search business just to keep their search income if the price is right Microsoft or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>also may consider a strategic purchase just to deny Alibaba an easy entry point to the US search market The thoughtprovoking challenge initiated by SA editor Michael Hopkins inspired me to write this article There has been a great deal of debate about the future fate of Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO and the options it has to unlock value for shareholders I really like the balanced and pragmatic comments of Aswath Damodaran In a nutshell he says that tech companies have a short shelf life high fail rate and when they reach their peak their decline is usually very fast I believe this is what happened to Yahoo and I doubt any other CEO would have been able to magically and sustainably turn Yahoo around Perhaps the correct decision would have been to start to unlock value sell Yahoo much much sooner Mr Damodaran also suggested that Yahoo should find a buyer who would be willing to overpay for Yahoo in order to buy sales even without the profits I believe this is what Yahoo is finally starting to do by reportedly auctioning off specific pieces of its assets specifically their search business now There is one buyer for whom Yahoo would be a very suitable fit especially the search business but not just the Yahoo core but the entire company It is Alibaba NYSE BABA which will be the focus of this article However Alphabets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT also have their reasons to acquire the Yahoo search business at the right price However regulatory hurdles would probably be a major issue for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>but also for Microsoft to a lesser extent The companies may decide its not worth the hassle and negative PR if it risks being labeled a monopoly For similar regulatory and PR reasons <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>gave up on a Yahoo search deal in Interestingly and unsurprisingly Microsoft lobbied hard against the deal My take is that both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Microsoft have been pretty easy targets of antitrust campaigns Microsoft paid more than B in alone in antitrust fines yet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is now more at risk of being labeled a monopoly in my opinion Alibaba also may run into regulatory hurdles not for monopoly reasons but due to security issues The MA landscape has been cautious toward Chinaled acquisitions recently such as in the case of Micron NASDAQ MU and Fairchild NASDAQ FCS for example But given Yahoos ownership of the Alibaba stake this case may be very different Outside of the search engine landscape there are several other suitors that are or should be interested in some of Yahoos core assets especially companies in telco and media industries Private equity firms have shown some interest as well Alibaba created a search engine in in order to compete in the very long run with Baidu NASDAQ BIDU and Alphabets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>on the local Chinese market but also symbolically with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>globally Interestingly Yahoo once used to be a pretty solid search engine A long time ago Yahoo even had the best text ads PPC system after it acquired Overture former GoTocom and totally wasted its potential But the word Yahoo still has a strong brand lots of free automatic traffic from users of its email and portals such as Yahoo Finance Im convinced that Yahoo would fit very well into Alibabas longterm vision of trying to build and promote a global search engine How better to start this international search engine expansion than by buying a strong legacy search engine name Yahoo virtually for free and power the search by Alibabas AliYun search engine Alibaba recently announced an AI platform arguably the first in China This would be a perfect fit for the AliYun search engine in combination with Yahoos strong US Japanese and other international presence The company also has been expanding its cloud computing internationally via Singapore as well as the US Alibaba allocated B for the international expansion of its cloud services <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Microsoft which currently have search deals with Yahoo may eventually decide to buy Yahoos search business just to secure the future income from providing search to Yahoo traffic At the right price this would certainly make sense if there is a lack of interest from other buyers It also would make sense strategically to deny Alibabas AliYun a strong foothold in the US market Some insiders including Jack Ma announced a large M purchase of Alibabas shares using their own funds If a halfabillion insider purchase is not a bullish sign I dont know what is Alibaba has been borrowing recently perhaps to fund the recently announced buybacks but perhaps for something else In any case I believe these actions are strong telltale signs that Alibaba is preparing to buy something either its own shares or Yahoo or its parts or another company Buying Yahoo is essentially like buying Alibabas own shares without raising the stock price thus getting a large stake cheaply without having to pay a strategic premium These signs are clearly bullish for Alibabas stock in any case And if you buy Yahoo you will benefit from Alibabas stock rise whether the future actions are just that Alibaba repurchases its own shares or whether they increase sales and profits by acquiring another company or whether they end up buying Yahoo The current value of the spread under various scenarios My net cash estimate uses Dec balance sheet data of M in cash plus in shortterm investments minus total debt which equals M net cash Ive attempted to make a scenario where Yahoos assets excluding cash Alibaba and Yahoo Japan stakes are sold or valued at B under these assumptions the current spread seems to be roughly but that includes the worst possible tax scenario of for the Alibaba stake as well as the Yahoo Japan stake This is not a version considered at the moment fortunately So if you believe the outcome will be anything better than this either lower tax hit or even higher core Yahoo value the spread will be profitable How profitable will depend on the timing of the transactions of course Under the worst tax consequences but with Yahoos core valued at B the spread would be roughly minus at the moment and with the core valued at zero the spread would be minus assuming the worst theoretical tax consequences On the other hand if there is no tax hit at all and the core is valued at zero the spread seems to be a very nice This is my base case scenario I believe the core will be sold off for some positive value and some taxes will be paid on this amount but the value will still be positive If you add some more value for the core it gets even better Depending on the timing this is a very lucrative deal to be in and it is well worth the risk in my opinion As you can see from the chart the spread widened from all the way to at one point Since the beginning of February however the spread has been shrinking fast tightening by some With specific steps to unlock value now in motion and Marissa Mayer allowing all options on the table although some grudgingly I believe the spread will tighten again as the positive news of value unlocking gradually keeps coming in Im always curious to know how other investors approach this special situation what their estimate for the value of the core is and how they assess the tax risk under the current most likely scenario of the piecebypiece breakup of the core business To conclude my article Im bullish on Alibaba and bullish on Yahoo Im also bullish on Yahoos core assets to have positive net value and this clearly is not reflected in Yahoos stock price Yes they are a zeromargin business but the brand and data obtainable through large user traffic can be invaluable for the right buyer such as Alibaba search engine <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>or Microsoft among others and one other company which I will cover in my next
