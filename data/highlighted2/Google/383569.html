class='textDiv'>Apples Greatest Challenge In the Next Years AAPL Modest Money Apple Inc AAPL has always been a keen innovator of consumer electronics But it has slowly become a victim of its own success Over the past decades Apple has been able to do something which almost no other company has done It has generated huge profit margins and grew its market share to become literally the largest company in the world by market capitalization And amazingly the company is still growing As one of the most profitable businesses on the stock market the pressure from investors for AAPL to continue to outperform is unbelievably high Learn how to trade smarter today risk free Find winning trades in minutes Apples methodology of bringing new products and services to its customers has been to move slowly deliberately and carefully so it can deliver something new that is better than anything else that already exists This has been Apples strategic advantage since the beginning Today everyones eyes are on the giant tech company so it cant release a product and not have it be widely successful If Apple comes out with a new product that is anything short of perfect or does not execute a perfect launch with enormous success then critics and analysts will denounce the company because it will no longer be the perfect Apple that never disappoints The expectations are unreasonably high for Apple to deliver quarter after quarter device after device However the technology industry is growing and changing very quickly Apples traditional strategy of moving slow and careful to produce a very polished looking device may not work for them anymore in the future because newer and smaller consumer electronic companies which are more agile can release comparable products before Apple in order to get an early movers advantage in the market One example of this trend is the virtual reality VR space The video game industry has been developing VR technology for many years But since games have not been Apples traditional area of focus and it hasnt attracted a large gaming community or developers Apple will have to play catchup in this fairly new market Even Facebook a social media site is ahead of Apple in terms of VR technology as it purchased Occulus Rift one of the leading hardware manufacturers and developers of virtual reality Apple needs to find a way continue to bring value to shareholders by introducing only successful product lines of new technology but not take too long to release them Apples greatest challenge in the foreseeable future is to find new ways to compete in new consumer markets without compromising its current standards of high quality design and craftsmanship Needless to say Apples best growth days are probably behind it But it is still a very profitable company and its stock is actually quite fairly valued The price to earnings ratio of AAPL is only about times This likely means that the market has already priced in a possible under performance of the companys financial in the upcoming earnings reports Make a killing trading penny stocks Learn how today The company doesnt disclose sales numbers for its Apple Watch Instead its line of watch devices is recorded in its other products category which also includes the Apple TV iPods and thirdparty accessories with the Apple brand In its latest earnings conference call Apple

products only represents a small of the companys total sales Even if its Apple Watch continues to see strong sales growth over the next few quarters it will not affect the companys financial figures in a very meaningful way The iPhone on the other hand is a much bigger deal for the company Almost of Apples revenue comes from iPhone sales It will be interesting to see how Apple will innovate and
