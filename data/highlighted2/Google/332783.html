Government Asks Tech Companies To Tweak Algos Promote Certain Content Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Submitted by Mike Krieger via Liberty Blitzkrieg blog You probably had no idea but representatives from Silicon Valley Hollywood and the US government came together earlier this week to privately discuss how they could jointly fight ISIS propaganda online Never mind the fact that ISIS is the child of reckless and inhumane preemptive wars of aggression perpetrated by the US government Such introspection naturally never crosses the mind of government bureaucrats ostensibly attemptingto understand the epic disastersthey created in the first place So who attended the meeting We dont know for sure because the plebesarent entitled to know suchthings Fortunately we have become privy to some information thanks to Buzzfeed News Heres what we learned WASHINGTON DC They flew in from New York San Francisco and Los Angeles to hole up in a windowless DC conference room for nearly five hours on Wednesday representatives of the countrys top tech and entertainment companies brainstorming with US counterterrorism officials to tackle one tough question how to stop the spread of ISIS online The standoff between Apple and the FBI did not come up during the meeting though the issues it involves are at the heart of the very things being discussed As the role of technology in our lives continues its explosive growth how will the balance between privacy and security play out in the new Silicon ValleyDC relationship They wanted to figure out how to fight ISIS online how to understand the psychology of those who support ISIS and they invited almost no one who speaks for those of us in the Arab world and from Arab communities who have everything to lose from ISISs growing popularity said one Arab attendee who estimated that less than of the attendants were of Middle Eastern descent They dont understand this community That has been proven time and time again with their tone deaf messages Why hold an event like this where there are ten white men outnumbering every Arab The lack of voices from the Middle East at the event was raised repeatedly with one attendee garnering applause when they asked why in a discussion regarding ISISs appeal to young ArabAmerican Muslims there was no one speaking to their appeal from within that community This is what happens when people fail upward and you have a country run by a cadre of incompetent corrupt and clueless elites Other media outlets who were leaked a list of attendees revealed that Microsoft Facebook Apple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Mediacom and Edelman were among those attending from Hollywood and Silicon Valley In a statement the Department of Justice noted that Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin US Chief Technology Officer Megan Smith and Senior Director for Counterterrorism on the National Security Council Staff Jen Easterly all took part in the meeting Over the last year the government has stepped up its overtures to Silicon Valley meeting with tech executives in January on the subject of combatting ISIS online The Department of Defense has opened an office in the San Francisco area and the State Department has recently appointed its first representative to Silicon Valley Tech executives who have met with the Pentagon team told BuzzFeed News that some of their requests have been jarring In at least one case the Pentagon spoke with several companies who asked not to be named as a condition of discussing the meeting with BuzzFeed News about tweaking their algorithms to promote certain types of content Both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Facebook have made it clear that they would not make changes to their algorithms to bury results supportive of ISIS Thats something that is always brought up in meetings And it shows how little they understand us said the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>representative This is a Pandoras box we wont open because if we answer a request by the US government to feature one search result over another whats to stop other countries from requesting the same Whats to stop each country from tailoring the search results of their citizens to their agenda Its not a path we are willing to explore Read that again Its always brought up at meetings Perfect example of why Apple needs to be supported in its battle with the FBI The US government wants nothing short of total control See Video of the Day John McAfee Proclaims An Apple Backdoor is the End of America As the Apple vs FBI Debate Rages Congress Plots to Mandate Encryption Backdoors Apple Vows to Defend Its Customers as the FBI Launches a War on Privacy and Security At its core said many attendees the issue was the basic distrust the tech and entertainment companies have for the government which has been amplified by the unprecedented attempt to force Apple to help the FBI break into an encrypted phone and the strong stance taken by tech companies including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Microsoft and Facebook to stand behind Apple Its like youve been asked to partner up and dance with the bully at school who keeps trying to trip you in the hallways one attendee told BuzzFeed News after the event And even though you want to learn to dance there isnt a lot of trust to build on Sat JustObserving Please it is well established that America and its allies founded and funded ISIS and still fund it today httpswwwwswsorgenarticlesisisjhtml While claiming to be committed to a war against ISIS Washington and its regional allies have time and again proven themselves to be its principal sources of strength httpswwwwswsorgenarticlespersjhtml Its beginning to look like we all should learn some encryption Multiple points of defense Hard to nail just one party Apple the latest if there were LOTS of encrypted communications even if not that robust Sat philipat The easiest way to stop the spread of ISIS is to stop funding it Then all the refugees can go home as well solving several problems at the same time There you go Pentagon fixed it for ya Sat too_big_to_fail What was not said is that the US GOV asked <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>to tweak the videos and pages from Youtube and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>for WW NWO New World Order Economic collapse Dollar Collapse Negative interest rates I have been searching these on youtube for over a year and in the last few months the videos and news articles have disapeared ISIS my ass It is censorship about what is really going on NWO used to be kk videos per month now virtually none Freedom of speach my ass we will let you see what we want you to see and private companies be dammed follow orders or else Sat Truth Eater Its real easy to figure this one out Want to stop ISIS Nuke Erdogan and his supporters Wipe out Saudi Arabia and the bands overruning Libya Let Russia finish off the savages in Syria and Iraq Expel all muslims from western countries Sat uhland It may actually be better to let ISIS cook because if you were to eliminate them it would be the threat from China that would take pride of centre place Thats is not a fight that we can win and therefore letting ISIS simmer is the lesser evil It also means that it attracts undesirables from all over the world where they can be better eliminated I rather abstain from a comment about Erdogan but nuking means to contaminate a place for a long time and then more Turks would come to Germany The alliance could become dysfunctional with millions of Turks fleeing a contaminated area He ought to pushed off the perch with less longlasting damage Sat Buckaroo Banzai Obama has spent the last seven years cleaning out the General officer corps of the politically incorrect the politically unreliable and the politically undesirable Weve got a literal faggot in charge of the Army and a Secretary of the Navy who has spent the better part of a decade striving to float the worlds first navy without actual ships Should we be at all surprised that the wide variety of defense department intelligence agencies might have been similarly repurposed in such a way to undermine the interests of the American people Sat HRH of Aquitaine The last time I checked the oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies didnt have an end date Just sayin Sat Buckaroo Banzai What I find despicable is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Apple and Microsoft have been rolling over for the Feds for years Now all of a sudden they grow a spine when the Feds come to them about ISIS Why would anyone want to protect ISIS Sat buzzsaw Sat iAmerican It isnt our government its the GogBabylon pedophile homosexual Talmud
