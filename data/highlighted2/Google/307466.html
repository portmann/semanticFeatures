Top Short For Angies List Angies List Inc NASDAQANGI Seeking Alpha Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a short position in ANGI over the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article In the wake of Facebook rolling out a new platform Angies List has an exposed valueadd The stock saw an increase of in creating a cushion for investors to begin shorting The companys earnings growth and revenue growth are slowing considerably leading me to believe Angies List will have a hard time beating future earnings reports Angies List NASDAQ ANGI is my top short of My coverage on Seeking Alpha usually pertains to energy and base metals however I am a strong advocate for shorting companies that do not deserve to trade at a premium Thats what we have here Angies List spiked in outpacing many of the markets equities and for the life of me I cant figure out why In researching this company Ive found that it presents itself as an exceptional short opportunity based on a declining valueadd component and an unjustified trading pattern Angies List is a viable short for a few simple reasons The company is currently overvalued the relationships are nothing special and the oncoming competition is going to stifle their financial health reducing their ability to generate strong earnings growth in a competitive tech sector Now the major headline for Angies List in was the unsolicited bid from IACInterActiveCorp NASDAQ IAC for per share and the stock currently trades at a small discount to that price The stock was trading above this value since midNovember but the broader market decline in January has sent shares slightly lower The bid was rejected because clevel management felt the company was worth more and that its valueadd was deserving of a premium much larger than what IAC was offering Angies List operates a national local services consumer review service and marketplace where consumers can research shop for and purchase local services for critical needs such as home health and automotive services as well as rate and review the providers of these services That is from the recent Q Now considering that Yelps NYSE YELP shares have declined in and already in the customer review component of the valueadd is decreasing considerably This is where I find initial fault in Angies List as Yelp has struggled to beat earnings reports and bring something to the table that makes the product needed Relationships are a crucial intangible for a company to have and while the companys advertisements will show you a consumerfocused caring website ready to help connect you the fact is you can do this quite easily without having to pay for Angies List thanks to a simple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL search or a quick look at the Facebook NASDAQ FB page of the business requested The current goodwill value is million the amortizable intangible assets are million Given that these are relatively small figures compared to other metrics like revenue or net income it seems as though Angies List is putting a price on their brand and it isnt much Heres the primary problem I have with this company Facebook is in the early stages of scaling Places seen below a platform integrated within Facebook to give users access to cityspecific businesses restaurants and services reviews from other Facebook users Its an allinone kind of platform Now the reason this is so detrimental to Angies List is that Facebook can afford to scale out this reviewbased platform across its billion monthly active users and million small and medium sized business pages Thats far more computing power and level of content than Angies List could ever dream of It seems quite obvious to me that this is the calm before the storm for ANGI This company looks overvalued on the surface with a PE of when we think about the SP s average PE of In an attempt to dig much deeper Ive built a comparable universe to see the relative valuation Now what were really seeing here if anything is that Yelp is considerably overvalued While thats not the focus of this article we look at ANGIs relative results The negative EVEBITDA is a frightening statistic and reflects their struggle to produce quality earnings When compared against Facebook and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>we see that this company is largely overvalued particularly on an EVEBITDA and PCF basis Theres also the argument that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Facebook are more mature companies than Angies List I believe we forget so quickly that Angies List has been around since making it much older than Facebook and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>which were founded in and respectively It should be a much more mature stage as an equity one that has been publicly traded since November Thus the stock has really only been around for a bull market and the potential for the broader market to see a retreat within the coming months is certainly speculation that could fuel more downside pressure than expected The company currently has million in LT debt a LTM declining current and quick ratio and thinning cash assets of million Angies List furthermore is only available in the United States and has not scaled its business to the international market and even if it attempted to rollout a plan it comes at a time where global markets would likely not be receptive to the plan considering the slowing growth and instability of many nations namely China Japan Brazil and Russia Many technology stocks deserve to trade at a premium because they are growing the top line by heavy double digits each quarter Some of these stocks are Facebook and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and thats why they can afford to trade at a PE of and respectively Angies List on the other hand has really seen a slowing growth rate for revenue in For example the company reported million in revenue for Q followed up by a increase to million Q however this changed drastically with the Q report where revenue actually declined by k At the same time we saw a continual increase in the stock throughout the fourth quarter I find that to be a heavy contradiction Furthermore panning to the bottom line we see that in Q they reported a net loss of million and while breaking positive in Q they were just above water with k in net income Its scary to see that they are trading at such a high PE with this kind of earnings base OCF is back in the red to complement Q and Q now at just million We can clearly credit this to the low net income level and cash burn Free cash flow has been negative three out of the last four quarters and currently is at million TTM FCF is million Its because of these weak metrics and noncorrelating trading pattern that I begin to wonder just how profitable can Angies List be when Revenue and EPS continue to level off The company actually cannot afford to have a slowing growth rate and I think thatll start become more apparent after the February earnings report Take a look at the revenue and EPS projections below In defining an entry and exit point we see that the RSI is relatively flat at and with the stock in between its two primary moving averages its been in a very normal low volatility trend for really the last sixty days After the rapid upside experienced this fall especially with the push from the rejected IAC bid the stock pushed past share Especially considering the cushion for the riskreward scenario Im looking at a PT before this stock becomes competitive on an acquisition front again Below is the last six months of trading Naturally there are different strategies you could choose to implement with options or other instruments to hedge your risk on ANGI but I believe the picture is clear As an added bonus this stock currently doesnt yield anything so theres no dividend consideration to factor into your potential short The company currently trades at a m average volume of shares which while low still provides ample liquidity for getting in and out I believe furthermore were not going to see any problems with potential acquisition speculation until my PT is hit and even then we may not see attention Finally there is no stock repurchase program in place and the current short interest is Angies List is set to report earnings in midFebruary so there are still a few more weeks left to capture some lower volatility but I think that ER is going to be a real wakeup call for current longs The company will regret not taking IACs offer as I believe the only direction for these shares is lower Especially if broader market selloffs occur like what we saw for a majority of January trading this is going to be an accelerated short The valueadd component of this company just isnt as unique as it used to be Going up against a competitor who has the financial resources to scale the same business in a faster way is just a knockout punch Ill personally be initiating a short in ANGI this week Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
