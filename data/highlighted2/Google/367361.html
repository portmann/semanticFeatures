and Verizon among failed bidspullouts by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and others Today we are going to offer another small article in our series of skeptical articles surrounding Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO and its inability to sell itself over the last year or two We have written several articles in the past coming up with wild card theories as to why the company may not have gotten the deal done already and why the equity seems to simply be a vortex for shareholder value over the last couple of years The main purpose of this article is to remind investors that the sale of a division or a sale in full of Yahoo has not yet been completed Why is this important to remind investors The stock has been trading higher and higher increasing its market cap almost from recent lows as investors bid the equity up and anticipate getting a deal done We think this is dangerous territory and we think that if we were buyers in the region that we would be selling up here around per share We dont think theres any positive surprises under the surface at Yahoo likely just the opposite that the company has used all of its tricks and unable to make something happen they finally just decided to go the sale route Nothing about a sale process guarantees equity holders that a bid is going to come in at a premium above the current share pricecore business value Many times when stocks run up in anticipation of a merger or acquisition a deal winds up getting done at a lower volume weighted average price smoking those who bought at highs strictly for the prospect of a buyout with the premium If ever there was a company that we think could be a take under its Yahoo We know the business is performing poorly and there are many questions that we have raised about the companys only other tangible asset in its Alibaba NYSE BABA stake Surely with all of the interest that seems to be coming out of the woodwork now that Yahoo has announced plans to sell its core business one must ask where were all of these bidders just months ago Yahoo has been a complete and totally abject failure under its CEO Marissa Mayer Ms Mayer was brought in to reorganize the company and hopefully catch them up with newer companies that are eating their lunch All Mayer did was come in collect an enormous paycheck and get precisely nothing accomplished Acquisitions have been written down and the core business is now being reported to continue to be in horrible shape as reported by Benzinga just days ago Yahoos financial situation is increasing dire at least according to a report by Recode Recodes Kara Swisher obtained access to the book that Yahoos bankers are handing out to potential buyers Naturally this book contains the necessary information that a potential buyer requires before submitting a binding bid Swisher stated the book shows a company in what appears to be serious free fall She continued that the book shows Yahoo is expecting its revenue to fall close to percent and earnings by over percent in At the same time Yahoos expenses are indeed declining but not nearly enough to offset the troubling landscape The only thing that has gone right for Yahoo has been its stake in Alibaba Alibabas IPO almost two years ago generated a significant amount of value for Yahoo so much so that buying the equity has been argued over and over again as a way to buy the core business for free The question then becomes Who wants to buy the core business anyway We are not going to go out on a limb and peddle crazy conspiracy theories What we will say is that we have raised the notion of something potentially being weird under the surface at Yahoo many times over Alibaba has its own questions that its going to have to answer relatively soon but one thing continues to stick out to us Yahoo has been trying to get this deal done and a sale engineered for the last couple of years and hasnt been able to do it We want to know what the hold up has been For us it seems like the company has come too far over such a long period of time to have not gotten anything done yet whether its businesswise or salewise We have mild experience in corporate mergers and acquisitions and we know that it is not a fast process Between the time that it takes lawyers and executives to conduct and complete their due diligence to the time a merger proxy is finalized and approved it can take years We are not contesting that What we continue to raise suspicions about is why a deal has taken this long to even get into these initial stages What is the hold up over at Yahoo We have far more questions then we have answers We want to remind readers that we are not saying a deal will not happen we are simply questioning what appears to be a stunning inability to get anything done at the corporate level Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayers tenure has been a mess and the Board of Directors should be held accountable for the losing of a significant sum of shareholder value based solely on the companys inability to find and execute a strategic vision that is going to move them in one direction or another Literally all the company would have had to have done is found a direction and stuck with it from the get go Sale layoffs restructuringpick one Instead we have been subjected to a CEO tenure that has accomplished almost nothing flailing wildly from one solution to the next So all of those who are out there picking up a few hundred YHOO shares in hopes that there is going to be some white night bidder that will pay a ridiculous premium to what the companys core business is worth we say dont get your hopes up There is nothing that has shown us a reason to expect any type of execution on the sale with any type of efficiency or benefits for shareholders The core business is failing the companys stake in Alibaba can be questioned loosely and like everything else under her regime we dont expect a shareholder friendly deal to get done with Mayer involved As it has become pretty clear we are skeptical of not only Yahoos ability to close on the sale that is beneficial to shareholders but on their ability to get any type of progress with the current CEO and current Board of Directors in place A sale might happen but it might just surprise some people At this stage with Yahoo nothing will surprise us Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks
