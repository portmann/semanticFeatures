Consumer Electronics Show CES in Las Vegas Nevada in this January file photo SAN FRANCISCO Former Yahoo executive Dan Rosensweig has not worked at the pioneering internet company in nearly a decade But last week as Yahoo Inc YHOOO prepared to sell its core internet business he was sporting a Yahoo Tshirt and in an interview reveled in memories of the companys heyday along with the deep impact its alumni had and still have in shaping Silicon Valley He recalled a workforce that believed they were doing something that mattered bringing people information said Rosensweig the companys chief operating officer from until I hire as many exYahoos as I can because I know their commitment their talent Rosensweig now CEO of the online education company Chegg Inc CHGGN is one of scores of executives around Silicon Valley who still bleed purple as many Yahoo alums put it despite the companys more recent instability and decline In the formative years of the web Yahoo was the biggest richest internet upstart in Silicon Valley and it incubated a generation of executives Now as a sale and possible dismemberment of the company looms a wave of sorrow and nostalgia is reverberating through the Yahoo diaspora People are sad said Changeorg President Jennifer Dulski who left Yahoo in after nearly a decade Until it really is over a lot of us believe there will be a chance for resurgence She compared the emotions surrounding the auction to when your parents sell your childhood home Launched in by two Stanford graduate students Jerry Yang and David Filo Yahoo in its early years was the destination of choice for many making their first forays into the world wide web The company soared and then crashed in the first dotcom bubble and then emerged from the rubble as one of the few internet companies with substantial revenues and profits The peak came in the mids many former executives say with advertisers desperate for a presence in the new online medium filling the companys coffers But even then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>GOOGLO was busily undermining Yahoos core business helping people find things on the internet By Yahoo was fending off a contentious takeover bid from Microsoft Corp MSFTO and struggling to define its mission That core question was never really answered leading to years of management instability and shifting priorities <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Facebook Inc FBO Amazoncom Inc AMZNO and a host of new companies meanwhile claimed much of the territory that might have been Yahoos The auction of the companys core assets which has drawn bids from Verizon Communications Inc VZN ATT Inc TN and others and is expected to conclude by the end of the month is likely to value them at about a hundredth of what Googleparent Alphabet Inc is worth The auction does not include Yahoos valuable stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABAK the Chinese ecommerce juggernaut and Yahoo Japan Corp T Some of the former Yahoo executives interviewed by Reuters carry other emotions including frustration with all the missed opportunities and anger over the management dysfunction that has plagued the company for a decade Still many former employees remember the Yahoo of a certain era as a special place pointing to a youthful energy a culture of learning and the excitement of being on the front lines of the internet revolution Working at Yahoo for people who were young in their career was like going to a large research university said Dan Finnigan a former senior vice president of Yahoo and now president and CEO of Jobvite People who started in media went into sales people who started in sales went into recruiting people went from engineering to product It was highly encouraged Luanne Calvert chief marketing officer at Virgin America Inc VAO was at Yahoo from to She credits the experience with making her career It was pretty amazing that you could kind of create your own job at Yahoo as she did I became the queen bee of buzz marketing It changed my life in terms of experience that was really relevant to the future of marketing Many exYahoos are quick to acknowledge that the company eventually lost focus as it grew big and bureaucratic and came to be dominated internally by endless meetings and powerpoint presentations By said Shashi Seth who arrived that year as a senior vice president people just looked at Yahoo as a job It wasnt their passion Still even today the eagerness of exYahoos to work with one another is undiminished A Meetup group at least two Facebook groups a smartphone app called xYz Network and a LinkedIn group with more than members tie the exYahoos together For some connections with fellow Yahoo alumni turned into lasting business relationships Slack the redhot business messaging upstart was founded by Flickr creator and former Yahoo executive Stewart Butterfield and financed by former vice president of Yahoo search Andrew Braccia who is now a general partner at venture capital firm Accel Accel has also invested in Cloudera cofounded by former Yahoo engineering VP Amr Awadallah Ann Crady Weiss a former director of business development at Yahoo and cofounder of nursery products company Hatch Baby said the majority of financing shes received since leaving Yahoo and starting two businesses came either directly from a Yahoo person or one degree of separation from a Yahoo person For me that alumni network and those referrals set me on a path for success she said Yahoo was critical to my future Rob Solomon former Yahoo senior vice president of commerce and current GoFundMe CEO last year published a list of several dozen former Yahoo executives who moved on to become Silicon Valley power players Some of its other illustrious members include LinkedIn Corp LNKDN CEO Jeff Weiner WhatsApp cofounders Jan Koum and Brian Acton and the late SurveyMonkey CEO Dave Goldberg The power and reach of the Yahoo diaspora Solomon said helps dull the pain of the companys decline We know each other we trust each other he said Weve been through a lot together and will all help each other out The key to understanding whats going on lies not with personalities campaign strategies or party rules but rather with the voter PDFDocument Reuters News Agency Brand Attribution Guidelines Delivery Options
