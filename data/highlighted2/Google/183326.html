estimated million to close the deal This isnt the first and likely wont be the last mappingbasedmappingfocused acquisition by Apple but are these acquisitions for mapping tech or something else I argue that Apple is really trying to aggregate tech and capacity that it can use to build out its iBeacon abilities I ask Bill Clark Beacontech expert and CEO of Beaconfocused company Spindle for his thoughts on the subject as well as how he views the new content portal normal Dont overlook the recent acquisition by Apple NASDAQ AAPL of Mapsense I think this acquisition and the handful of what appear to be mappingbasedmappingfocused acquisitions prior to it are bread crumbs that lead down a more lucrative stickier and higher valueprop enhancing trail than the one thats currently consensus Stating it plainly I disagree with the idea that Apple is out spending an estimated million on Mapsense and countless other millions on its collective mappingmapping tech additions to be able to get Apple product users closest to the pin Frankly I think Apple could care less about mapping per se This becomes especially true when considering the massive incumbent advantage that competitor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL has in servicing this need and the currently limited monetization endpoints of mapping I say that very delicately with the understanding that this space is rapidly evolving I think what Apple really wants out of the ability to accurately plot and direct users is to build out the next great mobile engagement system in tech I think that iBeacon is about to become a serious focus for Apple Why do I think this is the real direction Apple plans on deploying the mapping tech it has acquired towards iBeacon Because the narrative just makes more sense this way Think about it Why does Apple want to be in the business of content distribution Hasnt it always been Isnt it already Isnt that what Apple devices are a better way for all of us get the content we desire Isnt that what the app store and iTunes are content delivery portals to other content delivery mechanisms I think so I think the answer to all of the above is yes Think seriously about the fact that the most downloaded app on the planet since its launch a very recently launched celebrity based app from Kylie Jenner has an incremental monthly subscription charge associated with it Wait celebrityentertainment driven and has a charge associated Sound familiar Does this application sound at all like the foundation and contributing force for how Apple turned the music industry into its own licensed collective quasisubscription service via iTunes in the early shaping of that industrys digital transition The recent boom of celebrityinfluencer based apps are just content portals to original content as are all apps to their content as was iTunes for musician content Apple happens to have a retinafaced superchip powered way of viewing this content If Apple can drive a value prop to content whether that be from a reactionary or proactive standpoint maybe even data and analytics assisted Mapsense helps with this the population has shown its more than willing to go get it even if it has to pay But what happens if the population is paid in the form of discounts to receive content What if that content was sent to the population by the same content providers read the app celebrity that the population is following How much more effective is a recommendation for a clothing item being delivered via the Kylie Jenner app via Kylie Jenner herself rather than an email from the company Data has shown its much more powerful and closes at a higher rate Apple at least I believe understands this and also understands that sales data shows that if a recommendation by a celebrityinfluencerapp creator say Kylie Jenner can be made when the individual is close to the pin read the item being recommended is done so while the app subscriber is shopping that the valueprop and effectiveness of the advertisement grows Doesnt it make sense for Apple to sign Kylie Jenner or whomever to an exclusivity deal tethered to iBeacon I think it does I think it makes perfect sense for Apple to lock in the total content ecosystem for content portals its helping proliferate just like it has done with iTunes and with its App store Even if Apple doesnt wantisnt able to get exclusivity doesnt it still make sense to be a player at the table Again I think it does With Apples revamp of Newsstand to News at WWDC Apple has gone all in on overt content delivery It understands that with the secular move away from the ability to bombard mobile and general online users with ads largely thanks to Apple itself that the ability to market to the broader population is going to be harder to do and more inboundfocused than ever That in itself should make being able to successfully do this more lucrative than ever I think Apple realizes it can get ahead of this tech with its iBeacon and that it can build a sticky monetization chain on top of the new content providers in the same way it did this with the music industry with iTunes and the app industry with its app store Heck its even trying to do this with payments via its payment system Apple is really really good at building monetization chains on top of massive existing or even new monetization chains if that makes sense And maybe this was the plan all along to build out iBeacon via semicovert acquisitions Or at least dating back whatever distance it took Apple to come to the sudden conclusion that a better Newsstand was necessary with no apparent immediate value add to the holistic Apple platform or apparent reason to make this a focus of WWDC and that paying up for mapping tech was the thing to do I also dont believe that this confluence of seemingly content delivery focused innovation and evolution coinciding with Apple now overtly trying to convert telecom customer to Appledirect customer is without serious planning and analysis I mean I guess it all could be coincidence but I just dont think it is Apple is wanting total capture of its device user base from selling devices to servicing devices Its also wanting total revenue ecosystem deployment on top of its device user base this means including its iBeacon tech as well to capture the monetization of that precious engagement at that precious moment of timing I think in the near term it could mean being led by the iBeacon tech Yes thats right led by iBeacon I think that as we move toward a more inboundfocused advertising model and a more requestedcontent delivery model that Beacon triggered advertising is going to be one that takes off in a big big way As we move toward a user experience that centers on one that has users downloading Kylie Jenners app for instance users paying to have access to content and users very closely tying themselves to more app driven portal delivered content that beacon is going to be another iTunesApp Store type system on a greater system of monetization for Apple I reached out to Scottsdalebased startup Spindle Inc OTCQB SPDL CEO Bill Clark a friend of mine in the beaconcontent marketing space and somebody I consider an expert on the spacetechmovement for some closing thoughts on Apple its presence in the Beacon space and exactly how big Beacon can get as a result of the secular move to appdriven content Spindles entire business model is built on exactly what Apple is trying to do or at least what I believe its trying to do so I figured if anybody would have a qualified comment it would be Bill his thoughts are below As Apple matures its presence in this market with the acquisition of technology and advertising content to deliver direct user engagement they along with others in the content marketing space like Spindle who have the connection to these technologies will change the nature of marketing for good What was once a pushout model in traditional mobile marketing becomes a pullin model when the mobile shopper is consuming content I dont think most investors or consumers for that matter fully understand how big that is and what thats going to mean in the longer term This is as you know the biggest reason Spindle has been so aggressive in building out our Spindle platform with the Yowza acquisition almost two years ago now Obviously this is a significant change in the overall engagement cycle and a significant change in the valueprop of the advertising and consumption cycle which is the constant dance that takes place between advertiser and prospect customer Customers viewing location specific promotions coupons and delivery of other product material while interacting with their retailer for instance being driven by receiving a recommendation from Kylie Jenner or whatever content the customer is already consuming will lead to rapid and large scale acceptance of the norm of paying for services on the fly with their the customers integrated mobile payment platform This too will be inclusive of earning loyalty points and in general fully engaging instore online and in realtime during their shopping experience Not only is this a more monetizable customer for the monetization endpoint the retailer or whomever but Spindle data agrees with broader industry data that this is a more loyal and greater brand net promoter customer Thats exactly why if it plays out that Apple wants into the space bad enough to build out its platform by acquisitions Apple might be taking such an aggressive posture to the space Apple wants to be front and center to the next monetization revolution for the customer So do we Editors Note This article covers one or more stocks trading at less than per share andor with
