characterization and pointed to Apples service ecosystem After AAPLs disastrous earnings I feel compelled to look closer at Apples service business I also want to take this opportunity to talk about software culture and why I dont believe in Apples acquisition strategy in this segment This article is a followup to my recent longterm outlook on Apple NASDAQ AAPL as a device company Needless to say I got a lot of negative feedback on that piece Commenters claimed I was wrong about peak iPhone I underestimated Apples growing service segment and that the companys history of successful execution was a sure sign of future success While some commenters appreciated the longterm perspective the majority claimed it was flat out ridiculous to envision a world in which Apple could not defend its premium ecosystem I want to use this article to comment on Apples service and cloud strategy and in particular at its software culture and acquisition strategy First hindsight sure is Not only did Apple miss but also it guided sales downward significantly for the remaining year Major players like Carl Icahn are liquidating their positions Further the global smartphone market shrank for the first time ever Apple is selling less of a declining pie and there is no indication of how the next iPhone should change this However I do not expect this to convince anyone to change their opinion It is well known that confirmation bias makes us stick to a belief even if presented with contradicting evidence Commenters also said I was ignoring Apples growing service revenues Lets take a look at Q results and guidance for Q Service revenues were essentially flat What I feel many commenters do not appreciate is that Apples service revenues are largely correlated revenues This is a direct consequence of Apples closed ecosystem and its services Apple Care Licensing Apple Pay iTunes being tightly coupled to its devices Less devices mean less service revenue Of course if you believe Apple will soon sell more new devices again this argument is meaningless to you as well Hence instead of further discussing who is right about the future of Apple as a device company I want to comment on what I believe to be a management issue at AAPL that needs to be remedied to transform it into a less devicedependent company Apple has a drastically different software culture than other major tech companies Apple is incredibly secretive and takes its time things right to create amazing user experiences This is in stark contrast to Facebooks NASDAQ FB move fast and break things mantra If you are interested in an insiders voice an Apple software engineer has written an interesting report The key paragraph for me is this Unsurprisingly given the situation described above an employees ability to have an impact at Apple rarely exceeds the bounds of their daily work and team There are small triumphs I once managed to get more contrast in iOS by filing the original bug requesting to change the yellow color in the Notes app to something darker with more contrast However at the end of the day other teams find it more time efficient to say no than really consider your point of view Apples culture makes a lot of sense for hardware Hardware development cycles are much longer and it takes an incredible amount of precision and focus to release a product that just has the right look and feel Once a product is done you cannot easily change it Jony Ive provides the product design vision for it has served Apple well From the outside it looks like Apple is missing the same vision for software I have multiple data points that lead me towards thinking this The report comes to the following conclusion As Tim Cook often says on stage he cant wait to see what developers will come up with next As a result I realized that there was a lot more opportunity to push the boundaries of the iOS platform as a third party developer What might be hard for people outside of the tech scene to appreciate is that Apple is not a toptier employer in software except for iOS development maybe for exactly the reasons named in this report Apple does not pay worse than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL This is about the fact that Apples software culture makes it in some way unattractive as an employer Let me break this down for you Thought leaders in software architecture cloud computingdistributed systems and machine learning who do not wish to stay in academia and who are not founding their own startups have the following choices Established toptier software companies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Facebook Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT or latestage private companies like Dropbox or Palantir Large lots of perks lots of teams with many interesting tasks Flexibility to move between teams and projects Possibility to gain visibility through highprofile projects within the company Pays decently well generous stock grants Earlystage companies or growthstage startups like Snapchat Private CHAT Uber Private UBER or Slack Private SLACK More volatility less corporate overhead stock grants may turn out to be worth millions or worthless but more immediate responsibility and opportunity to move up in the growth stage Finance Quantitative hedge funds prop trading firmsHFT Very high riskadjusted return higher than tech less cool geeky stuff and a more stressful work environment While Apple is a toptier employer in general and a great destination for designers or say electrical engineers it is not a toptier software employer because it lacks exactly either the high payout from finance or startups or the flexibilityperks and opportunities of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>or Facebook As the report goes on to say internal moves are not possible without going through the same application process as an external candidate This is of course not to say that Apples software engineers are not highly skilled developers and architects It just means on average that Apple is unlikely to be the first choice of employer in this segment For instance my peers are mostly heading to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Facebook Microsoft and Palantir if they are not doing a startup This distinction might seem irrelevant to some of you but it leads me to my key point Building innovative software services and cloud platforms is hard Software is not some commodity component that just gets better if you throw more developers at it HealthCaregov anyone Software is a scene that has thought leaders and innovators that developers want to work for and this is true for both the longterm vision level as well as the concrete implementation level For illustration a lot of Googles global search and indexing infrastructure was devised by a few key employees eg Jeff Dean Sanjay Ghemawat Urs Hoelzle On the executive level Microsoft is turning into a mobilecloud company driven by the vision of Satya Nadella He made Microsoft a cool place to work for again Tim Cook says he cannot wait what developers will do next This is the wrong attitude Just releasing frameworks hoping others will make apps that generate revenue for Apple is not enough especially at times where most attention is devoted to a few core apps Facebook WhatsApp Snapchat Mail and there is an increasing threshold for users to accept new apps A let them build it and they will pay us attitude will not yield a lead for Apple I think Tim Cook does not understand software culture This is fine for the CEO of a company that makes almost all of its profits from premium devices and I do believe him to be a great overall manager Tim Cook makes hires like Angela Ahrendts and relies on Jony Ives product design vision What the executive team is clearly missing is someone who can lead the way into a less devicecentric world Craig Federighi Apples SVP of software engineering oversees OSXiOS and he has done a great job there However operating systems design is completely different from devising new cloud services that integrate into Apples existing product suite Siri was an acquisition and the founders left Apple years ago Since then Apple has not done much in expanding Sirilike services in the way other tech companies are moving into natural language processing Facebooks intelligent messenger Microsofts bot platform Amazons NASDAQ AMZN Echo Apple is simply not present enough in this space even though it would make a lot of sense to expand there Instead we hear news about internal quarrels in Apples cloud division I view this as an example of Tim Cooks supply chain mentality towards software Just acquiring small startups here and there to integrate their products will not be enough if the startup culture clashes with Apples software culture As of right now most of Apples software services are relatively mundane stuff Storage Apple Care Music iTunes Compare that to Microsofts vision of natural language interaction through bots or IBMs Watson Pay is a move in the right direction but not expected to generate meaningful revenue in the short term Apple should make larger more daring acquisitions here eg Slack Ideally they should be deviceindependent ie webbased services that can be used both from Apple devices integrating into the ecosystem as well as from nondevice owners No matter where you stand on Apples device sales I believe AAPL needs a change in software culture It needs to be able to grow revenues independent from devices It needs to attract visionaries in cloud computing SaaS and machine learning Tim Cook needs to hire a thought leader similar to Googles move of hiring Diane Greene to turn around its cloud business Satya Nadella is a great example of how a slowing company turned around its image this way If you enjoyed this article scroll up and click on the follow button next to my name to see updates on my future articles
