ads The Instagram platform just received its first D video ad from Jameson Irish Whiskey Hypertargeted ads help Facebooks deliver more relevant and actionable ads Jameson Irish Whiskey introduced the first D video ad on Instagram and Facebook NASDAQ FB Even though Instagram like Facebook is still banned in China the photosharing apps global popularity is now evolving into a potential strong revenue stream for Facebook Video ads were live last October on Instagram The groundbreaking D video ad from Jameson reeks of genuine interest from an advertiser looking to stand out in the Instagram ecosystem The creative Jameson ad was made possible by close collaboration between Jamesons ad agency i and Facebooks advertising group The more important thing is that the Jameson whiskey ad was also an example of Facebooks ability to deliver hypertargeted advertisements down to the local neighborhood level The i team leveraged the Location Awareness feature of Facebooks advertising platform so that the Jameson ad got delivered to users near New York local drinking bars The location tool was only available to the Facebook version of the D video ad but I look forward to it being enabled on Instagram soon Letting advertisers target local neighborhoods with creative video ads should please shareholders of Facebook The user base of Instagram is composed of office workers kids housewives students and small shop owners located in different areas However hypertargeting ads to inundate a specific area is one way for advertisers to promote their products where they are consumed Locationbased mobile advertising was proven to influence the offline shopping behavior of people Jameson delivered its ads to people near New York City bars precisely because it wants those people to act and go to the said bars and buy some shots of Jameson Irish whiskey Facebooks mobile advertising platform needs these hypertargeted localcentric ads to keep the loyalty of ad agencies and
