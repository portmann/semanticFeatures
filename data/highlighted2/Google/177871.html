online digital advertising <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOGL and its advertisingcontentmarketing clients will not let the new Apple NASDAQ AAPL iOS adblocking feature affect their livelihood without a fight Other contributors here at Seeking Alpha keep on harping about a mobile catastrophe for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>because of Apples recent move to support browserbased ad blocking However I am well aware that a majority of websites whether accessed from phones or desktop PCs is dependent on advertising income The digital advertising industry mafia is not a pushover that will bend down for Apple or any ad blocking advocates The iOS platform has been a gold mine for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and it will not surrender easily so that a few million users of the iPhoneiPad can browse adfree websites Googles management will be remiss in its duty if it lets app developers sell adblocking Safari extensions and just do nothing to protect its multibillion mobile search advertising on the iOS platform The millions of website owners and content marketers will fight tooth and nail to preserve their advertising clicksviews They can allocate and pool resources to create a software to defeat the makers of adblockers They can bribe the developers of adblocking browser extensions to whitelist their ads They can also hire the experts who can block the adblockers Sourcepoint is a new startup created by a former <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>executive that wants to help companies defeat the annoying problem of adblocking browser extensions People who bought adblocking browser tools from Apples app store will find it very frustrating when a site they try to visit starts blocking them from accessing the sites contents Detecting users of adblock on mobile Safari browser is easy to do I bought the Crystal adblocker and tested it on the small hackintoshzone site That adsdependent site immediately detected Crystal and blocked me from accessing its contents Apple is playing with fire with its open support for mobile ad blocking The longterm risk is that content publishers creative professionals advertising agencies and other employees dependent on advertising could take offense There is the tangible risk of a longterm backlash that many people might boycott Apple Macs iPhones and iPads as way to protest Apples overt act of promoting ad blocking <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Should Aggressively Fight Against AdBlocking Hiring antiad blocking experts andor bribing adblocker developers are unnecessary burdens to website owners Thirdparty adblockers on Safari are just a nuisance that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>could easily eliminate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>should develop and give away free software that will help websites automatically detect and block any iPhoneiPad user who use adblockers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>makes so much money on digital advertising that it could afford to give away free software Advertisers and content publishers will benefit from Googles future giveaway of a free antiad block tool In exchange they will remain loyal to Googles mobile advertising platform and will continue to ignore Apples iAD In spite of its billion cash hoard Apple is unlikely to improve iAD as a real alternative to the mobile advertising services of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Unless Tim Cook allows the same intrusive or full access to personal data of iOS device users like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Facebook NASDAQ FB do right now iAD will remain a poor choice for digital advertisers who love hypertargeted personalized ads In spite of the huge number of iPhoneiPad users iAD is still a nonfactor in the mobile advertising industry This is precisely because advertisers are turnedoff by Apples continuing refusal to fully share personal data The concept of hyperlocal hypertargeted ads is to deliver ads based on profiling of a particular persons web and mobile activities I am long AAPL and I support its idea of giving iPhoneiPad users the choice to block or not to block ads However I am not ignoring the potential longterm backlash from angry creative design professionals advertisers and content publishers who suffer from ad blocking on iOS devices There are creative people like me who could be very vindictive If I am the owner of a big content site like iMore or Hongkiat and Apple is helping greedy thirdparty developers reduce my advertising income I will be stupid not to boycott Apples softwarehardware products Furthermore trying to use browserbased adblockers as a ploy to try and steer online publishersadvertisers to its News App is a bad strategy for Apple While the News App would remain immune from adblockers iAD still remains a poor choice for advertisers who want access to personal data of target audience <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is the undisputed giant of digital advertising Apple should avoid picking a fight against a champion colossus in an area where it has repeatedly failed The combined might of <span style='background-color:

enough to bribe any developer of adblockers to remove their apps from Apples iTunes store <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>can also easily buy Sourcepoint and distribute free software to help websites identify and block the people who use adblocking software I do not think Tim Cook will allow access to personal data of iPhoneiPad users to iAD advertising clients Apple
