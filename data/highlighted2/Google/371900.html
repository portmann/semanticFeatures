Googles Android The Next PC Platform Alphabet Inc NASDAQGOOG Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has released a developer preview of its next version of Android N Android N features split screen multitasking similar to Windows and iOS Alphabets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL has released a developer preview of the next generation Android N The most important new feature of Android N is split screen multitasking very similar to what is already implemented for Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Win tablets and Apples NASDAQ AAPL iOS for iPad Android N underscores the growing importance of mobile devices as general purpose personal computing platforms Of the three operating systems Android may be bestpositioned to become the ubiquitous commodity PC platform of the future Initial takes on Android N have been very favorable with articles in Anandtech and Ars Technica complementing the implementation of the split screen approach in Android N While everyone recognizes that there are bugs this is after all a developer beta It was a little surprising that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>released this ahead of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>IO in May but apparently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>wants to get some developer feedback on N before the conference starts Since rumors first appeared that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>was working on a converged version of Android that would incorporate or absorb Chrome OS its been apparent that Android would need some form of multitasking as I wrote in Sundar Pichais Very Good Call Android already works very well as a desktop replacement Plug in a mouse keyboard and external monitor and youre good to go The mouse pointer appears automatically Android doesnt normally display apps in multiple windows or in a split screen view as in the new iOS but clearly something along those lines will be needed in the future converged OS Im sure its in the works That <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has built split screen multitasking into the very next version of Android confirms that I was on the right track in my take on the AndroidChrome OS convergence rumor Android is being positioned to be not merely the mobile OS of the next billions but the PC OS of them as well Meanwhile Chrome will fade into history In my recent article Why Microsoft Must Kill Off The Legacy Windows Ecosystem I contended that the competitors of Windows are the mobile device ecosystems of Android and iOS That may have been a little jarring to Wintel fans but this is the competitive reality driving Microsoft to adopt other features of its competitors business models especially the app store distribution model For the most part the generalization of the mobile OS to a PC platform needs to occur on a fairly large touchscreen format phablet or tablet The early takes on Android N confirms N as a big step forward for Android in the tablet space It allows Android to make better use of the screen real estate and many apps that are scaled up smartphone apps end up working pretty well visually in split screen mode As to why I believe that Android has the best chance of being the dominant personal computing platform of the future its really because of the business model It all about commoditization <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>took the PC commodity model and went Microsoft one better by distributing the OS for free or almost for free relying on ad revenue and an app store to generate revenue from Android The Android business model also relied on inexpensive commodity hardware from a variety of vendors which Googles licensing of Android encouraged The success of this model hinged on Android getting into as many hands as possible Android now has over a billion active users and is looking at billions more in emerging markets such as India and Southeast Asia With well developed app store and ad revenue streams <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>can continue to fund the expansion of Android into adjacent markets as well as smartphones and the personal computing market is a very logical target Here I see Microsoft as being pretty vulnerable Its struggling to adapt its OS and OEM licensing model to the new reality of free mobile operating systems such as Android and iOS Microsoft still doesnt have much of an app store for Windows and not much search advertising revenue either Most importantly Microsofts Nokia smartphone business has more or less imploded Microsofts Continuum feature and new phones such as the HP Elite x may reverse this but for the moment Microsoft has almost no presence in the most important personal computing platform today in terms of usage This is an open door for Android to walk in and recruit users out of the legacy Windows ecosystem And what of iOS Apple recently announced that it now has billion devices in use for all of its various platforms including Mac OS iOS watchOS and tvOS The number of iOS users is debatable but its probably greater than million given that many users have more than one Apple device Apple has a sizable ecosystem in iOS but its clear that its never going to try to become a commodity player Apple will keep itself positioned in the premium price tier where the profits are But this also means that Apple will continue to build in more and more functionality into iOS and iOS devices as Phil Schiller Apples SVP of Worldwide Product Marketing has enumerated Apples development of split screen multitasking for iOS and the new iPad Pro demonstrate that Apple is starting to target the traditional PC market as well In short I see Android trying to take over the commodity PC market with Microsoft bearing the brunt of Android market share gains in the coming years Microsoft still has a powerful incumbency advantage so I dont count Microsoft out but I do see the battle primarily between Windows and Android Based on what happened with Windows phone which was another battle between commodity business models I give the advantage to Android <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>hasnt completely seized the initiative with Android N After all iOS introduced split screen multitasking last year Apples market share losses for iPad demonstrate that Apple still has a problem however which Android N will not help General consensus has been that iPad Pro plus iOS multitasking didnt quite achieve the productivity level of Microsofts Surface Pro Apple can still position iOS as its alternative personal computing platform but it will need to double down on productivity Well probably see more progress along those lines at WWDC this June Both Apple and Alphabet are increasing the total addressable market for their mobile platforms and will probably do so at Microsofts expense I rate Microsoft a hold and Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>buys I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other
