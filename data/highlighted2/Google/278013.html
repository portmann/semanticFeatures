to unrestricted Internet access with local tech startups joining the front line against Facebook Inc founder Mark Zuckerberg and his plan to roll out free Internet to the countrys masses The Indian government has ordered Facebooks Free Basics plan to be put on hold while it decides what to do The program launched in around three dozen developing countries offers pareddown web services on mobile phones along with access to Facebooks own social network and messaging services without charge But critics say the program launched months ago in India in collaboration with operator Reliance Communications violates principles of net neutrality the concept that all websites on the internet are treated equally It would put small content providers and startups that dont participate in it at a disadvantage they say India is a test case for a company like Facebook and what happens here will affect the roll out of this service in other smaller countries where perhaps there is not so much awareness at present said Mishi Choudhary a New Yorkbased lawyer who works on technology and Internet advocacy issues Also at stake is Facebooks ambition to expand in its largest market outside the United States Only million of Indias billion people have Internet access making it a growth market for firms including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Facebook The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India TRAI said on Thursday it had received record submissions for a public consultation that precedes the rulemaking process But more than three quarters of the million comments submitted by users via Facebook will be disregarded as they did not follow the proper format TRAI Chairman Ram Sevak Sharma told a news conference In the past week Facebook has urged users in India to send a response to the TRAI both through its social networking platform and through mobiles by dialling a number that automatically generates a response on the users behalf However the social media giant faces stiff resistance In a letter seen by Reuters the heads of nine startups including Alibababacked Paytm and dining app Zomato have written to the TRAI urging it to ensure Internet access was allowed without differential pricing The executives said in the letter dated Tuesday that differential pricing for Internet access would lead to a few players like Facebook with its Free Basics platform acting as gatekeepers There is no reason to create a digital divide by offering a walled garden of limited services in the name of providing access to the poor they wrote Zuckerberg has got personally involved We know that for every people connected to the Internet roughly one is lifted out of poverty he wrote in The Times of India newspaper this week We know that for India to make progress more than billion people need to be connected to the Internet What reason is there for denying people free access to vital services for communication education healthcare employment farming and womens rights A Facebook spokesman said the aim of the Free Basics initiative was to give people a taste of what the internet can offer And Facebook has issued a series of fullpage newspaper advertisements and billboard banners in an aggressive campaign to counter the protests Free Basics is at risk of being banned slowing progress towards digital equality in India said an advertisement published in Mumbai newspapers on Wednesday urging Internet users to support the initiative Launched last year in Zambia Free Basics earlier known as internetorg has run in to trouble elsewhere on grounds that it infringes the principle of net neutrality Authorities in Egypt effectively suspended the service when a required permit was not renewed after it lapsed on Wednesday The TRAI has asked Facebook and Reliance Communications to suspend Free Basics until a final policy decision is made next month In a democracy you have both sides you have Facebook spending so much on the campaign and on the other side you have internet activists making their own efforts the TRAIs Sharma told Reuters on Wednesday Our job is to make a policy that is in the interest of telecom operators
