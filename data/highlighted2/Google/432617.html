to watch as of late As with most stocks this year hasnt been a great time for the stock Nonetheless this week could be a big week for the company sending the value of the stock soaring Thats because Disney will be opening a new theme park later on this week Today well talk about the details of the new theme park how it could send the value of the stock soaring and what we can expect to see from DIS moving forward As mentioned above this week is likely to be a very big one for Walt Disney and for good reason The company will be opening a new theme park which has the potential to generate massive amounts of revenue and profit for the company On Thursday a new Disneyland will open The new theme park will be located in Shanghai and for many this is being looked at as a massive opportunity for DIS The reality is that the companys theme parks generate massive amounts of revenue However revenue correlated with the theme parks also helps the companys top and bottom lines Find out how you can trade stocks like the pros without major time commitments Think about it Disneys theme parks are destinations for consumers around the world They have an amazing ability to capture imaginations Perhaps more importantly DIS theme parks keep the Disney tradition going reminding consumers of the movies shows and other entertainment that they grew up with and often leading to sales outside of the theme park as well So the new Disneyland Shanghai can prove to be massively profitable both directly and indirectly This Could Send The Value Of DIS Soaring Comparatively Disney is having a strong day in the market today as investors await the opening of the new theme park While many stocks on the market are struggling in a big way DIS is in the green Currently the stock is trading at per share after a gain of per share or thus far today What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward Moving forward I have a relatively mixed expectation of what we can expect to see from DIS In the short term Im expecting to see big gains this week and that could be followed by strong movement next week as well However thats the short term In the long run things are still a bit concerning Heres why First off ESPN is still a struggling franchise While the new theme park may help the company recover some of the losses associated with the network this is still a very concerning area However its not the only reason Im concerned The truth is that Disney does best when economic conditions around the world are positive Think about it DIS is an entertainment and media company When consumers are worried about the state of the economy they tend to spend less money on entertainment and media With economic conditions around the world being negative its hard to imagine that were going to see any real longlasting meaningful growth in the stock any time soon Also with the concept of a Brexit on the line and the fact that it could have a devastating global economic affect more headwinds could be coming to the stock in the near future While these issues wont be here forever theyre definitely here now So I wouldnt run to invest in the company at the moment myself Learn how to
