Inc AAPL By Eric Jhonsa SA News Editor The iAd App Network will be discontinued as of June Apple NASDAQ AAPL states on its developer site Although we are no longer accepting new apps into the network advertising campaigns may continue to run and you can still earn advertising revenue until June The App Network one part of the iAd platform allows developers to promote their App Store apps across iAds publisher network The news follows a BuzzFeed report stating Apple plans to phase out iAds sales force while allowing publishers to directly sell ads through a programmatic automated adbuying platform and keep of generated revenue BuzzFeed suggested the move could be a negative for The Rubicon Project NYSE RUBI and other ad tech firms Apple has partnered with to enable programmatic iAd buys iAd launched in has served ads on iOS devices Macs and PCs Tim Cook has suggested Apples main goal with the platform is to help developers make money rather than create a major new revenue source The business has faced stiff competition from rivals such as Googles AdMob unit and Facebooks Audience Network Update Some other Apple news As of Jan Apple will no longer support freeadsupported iTunes Radio Adfree stations will be provided via Apple Music Theres no indication yet that iTunes Matchs support for adfree iTunes Radio will be going away Great is all I can say More users can TRUST Apple The insidious use of profiling which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Facebook and other use to feed targeted ads is one of the most offensive parts of the internet Im pleased Apple is differentiating itself and not proceeding to compete by developing and using iAd Apple plans to phase out iAds sales force while allowing publishers to directly sell ads through a programmatic automated adbuying platform and keep of generated revenue I agree on top of that i understand the adv is necessary to make some money but it so annoying when you just want to chill and browse with no distraction cuff cuff youtube actually alot of them do it aswell and at this point i think its overdone posting so many ads good job apple let others do the dirty work side note all the short miniads kinda affect our younger generation and possibly lower their attention i am no scientist but just food for thought iAds had by far more ad impression counts than all of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Yet they made only modicum of income off them Its about time Apple just went to publishers straight and stops trying to compete on their closed garden walled network Think of it this way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>makes their money by directly getting paid from publishers no matter where the ad is seen Thats in App or just on the Web So what publishers did with Apple was because it was on their own managed network they put the ads right in with the content So although they got impression counts Apple wasnt getting paid for them Meanwhile Apples users were getting deluged with ads and Apple wasnt getting paid for it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>still owns the largest profit margins on Advertising and that wont even be affected by iAds staying on or getting killed AND <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has been acknowledged as more concerned with privacy and advocacy in government than Apple or Microsoft both have They anonymize their data and the others sell you out all the time that includes Apple Thats a good point Ive actually tried some searches with Bing lately because there are so many sales sites getting returned on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>searches You have to scroll down and down to get to something along the line of what youre looking for It sure didnt used to be that way In the end I think it would have hurt Apple more than they would have gained in revenue what sales ads are you even talking about i havent seen that many if at all bing search hahahaha good one i left apple because of their nazi level control of the OS cant choose default apps like the browser cant change default search apple has been selling user data for years data is being collected on ios just as much as android if not more You can change the search engine in SettingsSafari You can choose between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Yahoo Bing and Duck Duck Go And get back on your meds please This choice is congruent with Apples most recent stances concerning privacy The CES show had multiple HomeKit products on display The reported main concern that was discussed pertaining to these Internet of Things products is consumer paranoia about security Apple is in the sweet spot in this regard They have been highly critical of data mining and government agencies wanting to play Big Brother In addition they have made the security of the fingerprint sensor available to developers This consistency plays right into being the leader in the race to become the interface standard for consumer home device deployment dude apple is the one mining data they talk alot of game but the devs on the ios platforms love it because people have the illusion that it is safe it is not apple has already given the chinese a look at apples code not to mention probably a backdoor google is the only one that cares about privacy from others because google doesnt want other people to have you data but them thehash apple has already given the chinese a look at apples code not to mention probably a backdoor google is the only one that cares about privacy from others because google doesnt want other people to have you data but them looks like google just laid the smackdown on apples candy arse even more bad news for the marketing company we call apple google is just killing it in android Obviously youre an android lover and cant comprehend that Apple doesnt have to or want to delve into every aspect of your personal life to try to generate money Apple has a much simpler model Provide quality products and services and let the customer decide whether they want it Enjoy your info commercials search engine I prefer Apples way man on point glad to know there are others like me who are aware enough to realize this simple rule ie freedom to browse that is our right Tried to get people to understand this
