introduction but Im going to give you one anyway because thats the kind of guy I am is Intel You all know them as the largest and most profitable semiconductor company out there They generate anywhere from to of the total revenue in the entire semiconductor industry yearafteryear We all know them as a company that dominates the PC processors and server processors But they are also looking to dominate the processors in your phone in your tablet they are getting in to foundry getting in to programmable logic all kinds of interesting things there So here to talk about it is Kirk Skaugen who is the Senior VP and General Manager of the Client Computing Group Kirks going to have a short presentation and then well jump in to QA And that will be over to Kirk Thank you I appreciate the invite this morning and I am fresh back from Berlin at IFA Show our largest consumer electronics show in Europe where we launched the best product in Intels history So its going to be a little exciting to tell you why I am excited about that For about a decade I managed our Datacenter business last two years or so I managed our PC business and then in January we merged our modem phone tablet and client business and thats what I manage now the Client Computing Group which is Intels largest PL And the reason we merged it is theres just a large number of conversion happening right big tablets small tablets ins Notebooks and so we felt it best for efficiency and for our customer base to merge that So our mission within the Client Computing Group is to empower the worlds with the best Client Computing experiences and what weve tried to do in the last two years is just deliver more innovation particularly in to the PC space than weve ever had before If you just look at the plethora of devices at the bottom compared to where we were at several years ago and I think youll see just in simple things like color choice I would contend that four or five years ago you could get a back Notebook silver Notebook may be a grey Notebook that wasnt much of a personal computer for a lifestyle device Now you can get devices in any color shape imaginable And its not on the Notebook side its on the PC and desktop side as well What I said on stage in Germany is that this is a once in a decade moment for Intel Its probably only a couple of times that Ive been in Intel years where you have a brand new operating system like Windows combined with the best processor introduction in Intels history which is th Generation Core which we had codenamed Skylake And its interesting because as we look at tablets and whats happened with the tablet market we did see a pushout of PC purchases So what our research says time and time again is that those are traditionally companion devices and that people are still waiting for the time to refresh to another desktop or another Notebook And so as you look at the installed base today with this Windows this new introduction you now have billion PCs in the market that are over three years old and billion PCs in the market that are four to five years old And thats just an enormous opportunity for refresh before you even go after the first time buyer And these PCs literally just wont run a lot of the applications today whether you like K content thats coming online whether you want a touchscreen not to mention the security level is huge So its a once in a lifetime opportunity So why are we excited If you just look at what you can refresh Again I picked fiveyears old just because its half of that billion Half of that billion rather times faster processing performance times the graphics And you know YouTube has now announced her Video channel People will think Im crazy but the new selfie sticks are actually degree selfie sticks now You can take video on it wont even run on a couple of year old PC it wont even run and three times the battery life So literally hours across the ocean in full media playback and something thats probably half the weight and half in stint as the device you had So to put it in perspective the products we announced around Core M last week two sometimes three times the performance of the biggest performance tablets in the world Same kind of see height or thickness same kind of weight And we had unprecedented designs So more than designs system designs are coming to market Its probably hard to put it in perspective without a denominator on there but that is absolutely unprecedented from us different processors are launching across every form factor you can imagine So its a big big deal In addition for those of you who track our datacenter business you know that Xeons been relatively successful for us from a margin perspective We also announced the first Xeon for Notebook So what in the world would I use Xeon for Notebook Well workstation is a multibillion dollar business for us on the Tower side In a Notebook computer under six pounds now you can get the same performance of what you had three years ago in a pound Tower So th the weight you can now carry your workstation to you on the site and we are going to get our selling prices significantly higher obviously small volume but a good opportunity for margin there for us One of the things that were excited about is the in category So saw IDC set the in which some people said is it a toaster and a refrigerator trying to be put together It turns out people actually like these devices So it was the best of a Notebook and the best of a tablet in one device And yes the original ones were may be a little bit clunky threefour years ago This is the first product with Skylake our th Generation Core we designed grounds up for ins And we have now five quarters of data back thousands of people serving on retail or exit data that says why or whos buying these ins So first of all on the people that leave the store that bought a in So heres an example of a th Generation Core in has a super nice keyboard on it But very simply its detached Imagine some of this two to three times the performance of the highest performing tablets out there but millimeter or grams and millimeters So incredibly thin and this is Lenovo mix By the way it has a new world facing D camera in the back a real sense technology where you can now scan a room and we are working with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>on Tango their Tango project where were going to do indoor mapping Just like you do street maps you can do indoor mapping you can scan your face in and actually put it on social media site Its going to revolutionize blind dating effort or you can get a selfie of yourself You can scan in your face put it in to a video game We announced with Electronic Arts your next generation video games you can put your face in to the video game and be your favorite character So whether its detachable like this or this is the new Toshiba incredibly thin an amazing K screen Everything youd love in a clamshell but a full performance of your highest end PC and of course you can just flip around as a tablet So what we are seeing is this is now the second fastest growing category in mobile after phablets and were seeing for those that are buying this class of device we are seeing an months refresh pulling So if it took you x number of years to buy a PC people are buying these out of want versus need So they are actually coming in with a store earlier not because their screen broke or their hard drive is bad or because they want to buy a device like this fully touchscreen that type of thing And you can see here this is our North American retail data You can basically see here without ins the Notebook market is down with ins the Notebook market has had a pretty good success from a consumer perspective here and you are going to start seeing these in to our business class PCs with vPro and all the security and management there will be Not to leave out desktop a couple of interesting things about desktop This is more than a billion business for Intel desktops And we are refreshing everything across the line from highend gaming Towers We like gamers because believe it or not theres billion people that game in the world billion of the are PC gamers And in the software revenue of PC gaming crossed console gaming and its never going back And million people in the world consider themselves an active PC gamer That means they buy a PC game once a month To put it in perspective we have something called Intel Extreme Master its like the Olympics of gaming We are putting people in to gaming stadiums Theres a rumor in China of building the worlds first gaming stadium with million people on Twitch following Intel Extreme Master people showed up to watch it live And these people are refreshing their PCs every two to three years versus every five years plus So thats on the gaming side On the computer stick side now on something the size of a USB stick you can plug this in to the back of a monitor and you can get basically a full PC experience full Core PC experience So small doesnt need to be cheap You can plug this in to the back of a pointofsale terminal a kiosk a social vending machine a robot a drone or a monitor and you can get a full PC experience now with this computer stick and we are selling those preloaded with Windows and Linux on them now So the other part of my business is phone tablet and modem So we have four strategies in our mobility business separate from the PC side The first is we are building a very strong IT portfolio We just launched our first Atom x processors this year that were announced at Mobile World Congress This is first time weve put a processor and an SoC comps in a SoC So we have G versions and LTE versions coming Weve committed to be one of the industry leaders in G as we move forward and we think forward we are in a unique position because we have the datacenter communications and infrastructure business all the way down to the chip with a new Cloud and chip kinds of things there From mobile devices to street silicon whether its LTE or now their number one leader in PC WiFi back to a number one position relative to our competitors there and we launched our first WiGig silicon for docking which I will talk about in a second Plan is to compete profitably in mobile segments We are one back to Surface portfolio from ARM on the low ends we are now in both Surface Pro as well as the Surface and then weve partnered with two important Chinese vendors Rockchip and Spreadtrum to build proliferations So as we compete with that plethora of products out there from tables and phones we can have a broad portfolio of products with our partners on Rockchip and Spreadtrum And then last before QA I have been chatting about new experiences or new use experiences now for the last several years in the th Generation Core product line about absolutely starting to bring some of this to fruition So very simply put Intels on a mission as we look at consumers and about concepts every year Theres three things arise at the top of things that are pink points for user Number one is we want to eliminate all wires from computing Second is we want to eliminate all passwords from computing And the third is we want to move people to more natural ways to interact versus a keyboard and mouse particularly with voice and with gesture How we monetize that its a little bit different Usually is refresh getting people to want to buy a new computing device versus needing to buy a new computing device and then now wire space we need to eliminate the wires for data transfer like USB cables docking the you buy for a dock for display wirelessly displaying and for charging So we are able to do now on th Generation Core as weve eliminated we have LTE going in to a larger number of PCs and tablets We have launched our first WiGig silicon So theres Intel silicon now for wireless docking where we can literally just drop your tablet down and it connects to your monitor wirelessly and all your peripherals Weve launched WiDi which is wireless display whether you go in to your conference room on in to your TV at home you can just wirelessly display on to the screen seamlessly And we have an initiative going on wireless charging So guess is by end of wed be able wirelessly charge your PC very similar to how you can do your phone except in a more seamless way with magnetic resins technology versus inductive technology And all that means is you are going to get spacial freedom you can put a transmitter a charging transmitter underneath your table or your kitchen countertop or in the bar in the hotel and it will transmit through two inches of wood without having to actually drill holes in tables So very fast implementation and we are already seeing that in cars and Starbucks and this kind of things happening already And now passwords we have an initiative with Microsoft I can confidently say today you can eliminate all your passwords today if you buy a th Generation Core system And you do that two ways by an Intel RealSense camera enabled PC that has this security of D facial login So it actually measures you can do everything from measure blood pressure blink detection all these kinds of things Weve worked with Microsoft on a spec for Windows so on Windows Hello as part of Windows you look in your face it will log you And in fact in Berlin one of my funniest demos in my years in Intel is I brought two identical twins out on stage and I mixed them up and only one could log in with the PC and it actually worked so it was better That was the good part Once youve logged in with Windows Intel with our McAfee acquisition has something called True Key and what True Key did wants you to do is with that face you log in to all your other websites So we handed off from Microsoft So you can eliminate passwords now and in the future So we are doing that to obviously pull in PCs especially the new camera and we needed Windows to be able eliminate those passwords And then Natural User Interfaces we are doing two things we are fully supporting Dragon Assistant and iFly Tek for voice recognition If anyone used an Amazon Echo youll understand this is coming soon to a kitchen near you right Whats the weather whats the stock price order me some diapers order my child some diapers But talking to your PC or talking to a device thats in your kitchen is very natural and youre putting things like dualarray microphones and so why buy a new PC and Windows because Cortana requires two ears dualarray microphones need new hardware Two ears versus one ear on the new PCs And then real sense cameras for designing two real sense cameras one is for user facing for things like secure login for gesture D facial scan for your social media sites We have games that now can measure your motion if you start getting high anxiety it either slow down or make the game faster The more higher anxiety can throw more zombies at you So thats for the user facing camera For the worlds facing camera well do things like D facial capture Imagine inside of every place in the world is captured in D Just like you have street maps outside for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>were going to have a world very soon that is completely mapped in D with these cameras So we are basically putting eyes and ears on every device out there with a goal of pulling that in So thats all I have So quick snapshots of Client Computing Group phone tables modems wireless connectivity like WiFi WiGig and PC I think more innovation weve had in the last several years and here in a unique moment of time well talk about it with Chris but I am relatively bullish My job in Intel is to grow PC not see it be flat which is kind of our general public statement and I can tell you in the QA why I am confident with that So thank you very much Q Christopher Danely Citigroup Global Markets Hey thanks Kirk and thanks for coming So I can go out predict that Notepads for an upgrade cycle here any day now makes me want to get a new PC I guess before we dig in to whats happening now lets just maybe we take a step back in hindsight Why do you think PCs were so strong last year and then weve really had some issues with PC demand this year I think obviously we had a great XP refresh cycle last year with Microsoft which was part of it as the XP and the way it happened I am bullish on PC growth this year and in the future for a number of reasons I think a lot of people didnt realize that weve had five consecutive quarters with Notebook growth other than the second quarter and thats despite three of our top five markets which was Japan Russia and Brazil being down to plus And I wont predict macroeconomics but those markets will come back and UPCs will come back As we phablets in smaller screen sizes happen the requirement for a larger screen size device I think does grow and so I think thats actually helping us is that when inch tablets went to inch inch tablets and now down to inch tablets thats making a room for the PC Q was tougher for us just because of Windows People were leaning down their inventory on Windows getting ready for Windows So we are expecting a slightly better than seasonal or highend to seasonal for the second half now But there are some real gems under there that I dont think people realize like for example I mentioned desktops more than a billion business for Intel We didnt build a next generation core product our last product for Towers We made an experiment and we said maybe we are putting technology in to the market too fast but lets not build a chip for the mainstream Tower business more than a billion business Turns out that was a mistake It saved us some RD but x the end of life and then there was no reason to buy a PC this year So its just pent up demand now I think for th Generation Core as well Christopher Danely Citigroup Global Markets Weve seen some softness in the economy over the last few months How much do you think the overall economy drives PCs versus what you are doing or Microsoft and most of the chain does Well I think it used to be tightly coupled with GDP I think we are starting to question that now for the last months or so I think what Intels taught me is when you innovate people will have money to buy People are buying smartphones in China right just about talk to Huawei Xiaomi ZTE and these kind of things So I think people have the money its the innovation that I think these kind of devices bring and the good news for us is that I think we did have a elongation of the Notebook buying cycle but our data absolutely says that people want to refresh their Notebooks So they just been wanting to know when and we honestly think its the time now based on the th Gen Core Christopher Danely Citigroup Global Markets So lets talk about whats new in Windows thats out its available You were just in Europe at the PC really a big tech gathering Whats been the initial reaction what are people really gravitating towards whats the first read on how folks like I think we never had a closer collaboration with Microsoft than weve had on Windows Weve literally been working with them for four plus years putting the hardware and the software together For whatever the reason Ive talk to a lot of people that dont realize that there are hardware feature that the software sits on and relies on And then there is system level features that we spec together that we go out and drive in to the industry So if you look at Cortana for voice assistance one of the new features you really need dualarray mic summer system to do that and we have special processing in our chips as well as the dualarray microphones that drive new hardware If you look at Hello for Windows facial login you need a Intel RealSense camera in the vast majority of PCs to be able to login on Windows If you look at the new games we have special DX things in our graphic chips to make DX drivers great for digital rights management on PlayReady So probably talk to press in the last month getting ready for th Generation Core launch I would say of the press has been neutral to positive about Windows which is another boom from my perspective because theres obviously a lot of money getting pumped in to the ecosystem from an advertising perspective You see it every day on the TV as a result of that Christopher Danely Citigroup Global Markets And you talked about the Intel side Skylake new process architecture is it out is it not out could you go to the store and buy when is the availability and may be just talk about some of the new features that Skylake enables I think weve been excited that our th Generation Core products as of July were fully Windows ready as well as our tablets so we did a good job with Microsoft th Generation Core system we shipped several million units in to the market place We said that well have Pentium Core i Core i Core i and that we put new levels on the Core M products M M M all that will be out launched on shelf for holiday this year The business launch for the highend security with vPro We are in production this year and case queue for gaming overclocking in production this year So nanometer is very healthy its ramping We are going to launch the business skews in January just because they want a oneyear payments But everything else is ramping and thats why went and talk to even about Pentium and Celeron which are our value brands to show that we are going to bring Skylake and the th Generation Core down out very fast So one thing that I think also may have gotten lost is weve always said Core i i i good better best very simple positioning to consumers What we added now is Atom x x x under our Atom products and then with Skylake I just added last week Core m m and m And this is just really good because it helps users buy up the stack which means higher selling prices for us and better value to consumers The simplest way to describe it is if you are buying a Tower desktop or a Notebook youll want to buy just a Core i i i like youve always bought If you buy a Core m what you are basically getting is twice the performance of any tablet in the world withit in a in So we are building Core m for the fastest family systems in the world whereas Atom is kind of the brand thats going to compete headtohead with ARM It will be better than ARM but what Core m is is in a class by itself so you can get these in form factors no fan more than twice the performance of any thing you can buy out there from Intel or anyone else and thats why we created the m m m to be able to sell up Christopher Danely Citigroup Global Markets Great Well ARM versus Atom in a second So here comes the launch you mentioned that Q is a little bit slower theres some inventory digestion How do you guys feel about inventory in the channel right now Do you think were passed all laterals or is there something Yeah I think we are seeing a comeback nothing out of the ordinary which you would expect for getting the highend of the season for the second half So I think we did see a correction as we said in Q and its getting back to what you would expect for PC OEMs Christopher Danely Citigroup Global Markets Great And then in terms of share I think record share from you guys and I want to say youve gained more market share in the last two years than you had in the previous decade or something like that So what do you think is going on thats enabling your share gains to accelerate and is that a problem for Intel if AMD goes out of business You guys are going slip in a few bucks out the back just to make sure they are still around or I joined the server business when we were getting beat by Opteron and the reality is that we had missed a few key strategic inflexion points at Intel and it took a couple of years to recover and there is one thing about semiconductor is that you are innovating you are going to gain share and you are going to grow average selling prices and if you miss an innovation cycle or two its pretty brutal So I honestly feel that if you look at the innovation and color and style and they are just silly things it sounds like but they are like just watch Ben now that they put on this and this colored gold is the gold of the season I dont know my wife tells me that theres certain colors of the season if you will but this is the kind of style thats coming in to Notebooks and PCs So I think if you look at our relative dark competition we are winning because we are innovating and as a result we are gaining share Christopher Danely Citigroup Global Markets Your wife must from the east coast because I am from California I dont really see any changes in the season as far as colors go Do you think you guys can keep it going when you are sure in servers and I want to say somewhere in the low s in Notebooks but theres definitely some share to be gained down on the desktop side But does Intel get worried that you might be gaining too much market share Does that ever come up in discussions and do you think this will continue for the next couple of years Well I think if you look at client computing alright you are fighting for a dollar for a client and theres a lot of people in China that have bought a smartphone that have never bought a PC We consider that part of our total available market So I think when I left server I thought we were at share and now we are probably Christopher Danely Citigroup Global Markets And then if you look at Notebooks and desktops I think theres still room to grow and certainly in tablets depending on how large you think the tablet market is worried about share with the tablets we shipped last year Phones we have a significant amount of room to grow certainly in modems as well So I would say folks like Qualcomm probably occupy our minds more than AMD these days but we are paranoid about our inaudible Christopher Danely Citigroup Global Markets So lets talk about ARM you mentioned that early on versus Atom Well start with ARM and just desktop and Notebook PCs what are thoughts do you think we are going to start to see ARM processors theres all these press reports they keep popping up that Apples going to try and slip some ARM processor in to a Mac or something like that What are your thoughts there I think our position in Core is pretty strong I would say its very strong right now Its based on the performance levels weve been able to get and now with the fanless products or the Core M we saw the new MacBook launch fanless on our new Core M product line These products are both Core M fanless systems so I feel very good about our Notebook position Christopher Danely Citigroup Global Markets Do you hear more about it now than you did three years ago or five years ago or is it always been in the background there may be you hear less about it now than you did a few years ago I think Microsoft needs to speak for their terms and conditions of where they are licensing where elsewhere But right now from a PC perspective AMD is our main competitor and there are other big brands and consumer electronics out there that we would love to bring in to the PC space and I am confident if they enter the PC space well have them on Intel Christopher Danely Citigroup Global Markets So lets shift gears a little bit to your old stomping ground server Theres a big push by ARM getting in to the server a few years ago and now Calxedas bust and AMD is getting out of it Youve got other companies like Cavium making a big deal and Qualcomm to a lesser extent What are your thoughts on ARM and servers do you think that we wake a year or six months from now and AWS or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>or Facebook or whatever has some sort of ARM server project or how does Intel view that Well I think weve launched I think three generations of bit servers with our Z and D product line with the pending acquisition of Altera we have the ability to deliver a purpose filled work load And what I mean by that is in the Cloud space some of these customers buy may be million servers a year pretty crazy when you think about it And they may have a very purpose filled workload that they want us to help accelerate Now we have a solution there that we can have a purpose build product for those customers As far as I know theres one bit ARM server out there for the datacenter space So you saw other people backing out of that space So I think weve innovated that was one the last things I did before I left servers is aggressively pursue Atom based servers because we want to disrupt ourselves it turns out it was a very very small percentage of the market But I wanted to go in to it test the waters and then when people actually run it in their infrastructure they realize that Xeons is a pretty good purpose built product Christopher Danely Citigroup Global Markets That was the debutant right inaudible Before I keep going I just wanted to make sure anybody in the audience have any questions Going once going twice Otherwise I have no problem keep drawn him out there So the question was our progress in mobile has it been less than our expectations and what are our prospects there So a few things last year from a tablet perspective invested to grow share became the number one merchant market of silicon in the tablet market I publicly had said we shipped million tablets about of those were out of the China technology ecosystem So that moment and now we had shown you we had lost billions of dollars in there because that was basically more expensive to build the system around an Intel chip than it was to build it around an ARM chip With the SoFia products or the Atom x and then the Cherry Trail or the Atom x and x now we dramatically lower that So weve proven to the world that we have a good performance In fact our performance has been outstanding our battery life is now competitive our application compatibility with ARM is bestinclass You will find some things on the Android store that don work on ARM you will find some things on the Android store that dont work on Intel as we fix those pretty quickly Our manufacturing test time is now our world class in terms of test automation to get through the factory floors So all thats going well and as a result we are on track to meet our commitment to be million more profitable this year than we were last year in the business Thats because we are delivering with SoFia more products Second ship is the Rockchip and Spreadtrum relationships enable us to deliver proliferations in the first chips on the Atom x that we collaborated with Rockchip now are in the market shipped millions of units to them and they are proliferating that through their channels in addition to our channels And then on the phone I think this is an area where as we now build comps integration with Compute we have the ability to go after more business Most importantly short term is with our discreet modems because you want to find the partner that can help you get that modem qualified in hundreds and millions of units across the plus countries in the world across every service provider network in the world Because Intels vision is if its smart and connected its best on Intel So we view our future after acquiring Infineon I just bought the Lantiq business a couple of months ago If it consumers electricity its going to get connected to wireless with the internet We are as much a communications company as we are a computing company And I think if you said years ago we were going to be the largest graphics company in the world people would have squinted I think we are one of the largest communications companies and the one thing I can tell you is absolutely people want choice Thats the one thing since I took over the comp side of the business in January is people are really wanting Intel to be successful in G and LTE and G communications And so this is our first four array of building integrated comps and compute silicon and thats what we need to do next is go after some big wins right Weve had Lenovo weve had Asus You can go to WalMart Target Amazon in the US and get it to Asus Zenfone now for the first ever on the ATT Network that wasnt true a year ago So we are making progress but its a journey Like most important thing is for me to stand up in front of you and say we are much a communications company as a computing company as we get in to the IoT Internet of Things billion devices by wearable technology and we have some significant relationships with wearable right with Fossil who does Michael Kors and Diesel with Oakley with Tech Joy Christopher Danely Citigroup Global Markets Kirk as a followup to that may be just talk about the Altera acquisition biggest acquisition in the companys history Does this signal a shift to a little more focus on PLD and datacenter versus mobility as far as growth opportunities and where we would finally rank in there may be talk a little bit about that I think its a great acquisition for both datacenter as well as Internet of Things right Theres things like autonomous driving they need purpose built acceleration thats what Altera can be great at As I mentioned in the Cloud as we are on a journey to continue to grow the datacenter business on a compound annual growth rate we need purpose build accelerators for those Cloud customers that have very purpose build workloads that want something customized So those were the two primary rationale behind that as to continue those businesses growing at kind of compound annual growth rates If I can stay flat generally flat in the PC space my job as the GM of the PC business is to do better than that and try to grow it low to midsingle digits unless the innovation is going to enable us to that Christopher Danely Citigroup Global Markets By the way after what happened this year in PCs has your long term growth forecast for PCs changed have your thoughts changed on the long term growth of the PC market Are you taking a step back on man may be this thing isnt it cant be flat going poor or do you think its just a bit of an anomaly this year Well I think the focus for PC is Macro will be come back We are back to a yearly cadence on Tower desktop just remember that because its a billion business people forget about it its not a sexy business theres towers but youre on a yearly cadence versus the twice yearly cadence I certainly believe thats part of the slowdown There are new we just showed you that ins are in to months pullin on the traditional Notebook buyer and then theres some new markets for going in to Compute Sticks We werent even in Compute Sticks a year ago That has the ability to go everywhere Things like we announced Unite at Computech Unite is basically putting a PC in a conference room and you can connect anywhere you are connected to VPN in to the Unite box and display wirelessly in the conference room So you could be sitting here right now get a six digit pin and if there was a Unite box in your conference room you can dial in to there Thats total market expansion because there arent PCs in conference rooms today Christopher Danely Citigroup Global Markets You talked a little bit about how within in Notebooks if we add in ins actually the volumes are growing But as we look at the rollout of your new Core M product line and we think about ins expanding their share within that Notebook space what will that mean for your ASPs and ultimately for your revenues Without going in to a ton of detail there are two things we are doing on pricing for ins For certain screen sizes we compete and we give competitive discounting to go compete with premium tablets So traditionally in the smaller size detachables that are kind of a tablet first usage model where the screen detaches well give aggressive pricing But if we win business over for example an iPad where we dont have any silicon thats all positive revenue to Intel because we didnt have that if its a conversion from an iPad over in a larger screen size which is like a inch conversion over our pricing is the same as it is on Core So its just a tradeoff the OEMs are making do they want a thinner fanless system versus a thicker fan system but we dont have a difference in pricing there So it will be the same So as I showed you on the graph of the people that buy a product like this so this is tablet first so its every bit of a PC It has got a hard keyboard I would contend some of you out there are using Microsoft Surface user similar kind of devices but it is tablet first right So it will wireless connectivity its touch its twice in performance of those premium tablets So people are buying this and placing the tablet because they dont have to carry two devices And thats what our data says is that more than half of the people would have walked out of the store with a premium tablet had they not bought a classic device like this And so since we dont have any silicon in a product like an iPad when that buyer choses this class of device versus that its obviously a positive revenue and units for us Christopher Danely Citigroup Global Markets Copyright policy All transcripts on
