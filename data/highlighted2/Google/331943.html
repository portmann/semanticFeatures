themselves to new risks as their business models evolve If Verizon or ATT were to acquire Yahoo they would cut its costs to the bone and use its future free cash flows to feed their big dividends Verizon and ATT shareholders should be aware of potential dividend policy changes and price return differences as the companies take on new risks Verizon NYSE VZ and ATT NYSE T are big dividend telecom stocks with a reputation for safety Many investors own them specifically for their high dividend yields and respectively and their low betas and respectively according to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Finance However both companies are being forced to deal with the same fundamental challenge declining wireline business and dwindling wireless growth The companies are dealing with the challenge differently but the result is the same more longterm risk We consider whether a Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO acquisition makes sense for either company and also address two big questions for shareholders How will more longterm risk impact price appreciation for Verizon and ATT and how will it impact the dividends It is increasingly challenging for Verizon and ATT to generate profits in traditional telecom businesses eg wireline and wireless For example according to Verizons most recent annual report p New entrants are disrupting the wireless and broadband space Competition is putting pressure on prices and margins this suggests to investors that growth will be more challenging going forward And according to ATTs most recent annual report p Wireline will face continued competitive pressure from multiple providers including wireless cable and other VoIP providers interexchange carriers and resellers In addition the desire for highspeed data on demand including video and lingering economic pressures are continuing to lead customers to terminate their traditional local wireline service and use our or competitors wireless and Internetbased services Despite the growing telecom industry challenges both companies are determined to maintain their big dividend payments And as a result theyre adopting less traditional strategies For example Verizon recently ventured outside its traditional telecom business to acquire global mass media company AOL for billion Similarly ATT ventured outside traditional telecom to acquire satellite service provider DirecTV for billion you can read more on our views of this acquisition here Additionally ATT recently acquired two cell companies outside of the US in Mexico We believe all of these acquisitions will help Verizon and ATT generate more free cash flow from which to pay their dividends However they also introduce new risks that shareholders should be aware of more on the risks later In addition to the acquisitions described above Verizon and ATT may also be interested in acquiring Yahoo The main reason for the potential acquisition would be to help Verizon or ATT feed their big dividend payments To do that Yahoos spending would immediately be cut to the bone if acquired by Verizon or ATT Specifically the cultures are very different at these organizations and both Verizon and ATT would quickly change Yahoos growthoriented strategy to a valueoriented strategy For example this means far less spending on research and development and cutting out every unnecessary cost possible Instead of focusing on big future growth Verizon and ATT would look to use the majority of Yahoos future free cash flows to fund the big dividend payments that their shareholders love Verizon and ATT would likely avoid using cash to acquire Yahoo because they want to preserve cash for dividend payments and instead use debt and equity much like the deal ATT did for DirecTV This type of deal debt and equity instead of cash is easier cheaper when the company being acquired has very low debt like Yahoo Yahoos debt to assets ratio is only around Also important Yahoo does not currently pay a dividend This makes the company even more attractive to highdividend payers like Verizon and ATT because it will reduce the aggregate dividend payout ratio as a percent of free cash flows for the new combined company This is important to Verizon and ATT because their dividend payout ratios are already fairly high as the following charts show and theyll likely get even higher as traditional wireline and wireless businesses continue to face challenges Worth noting ATTs dividend payout ratio was approaching in before the company made its big DirecTV acquisition The DirecTV acquisition caused ATTs ratio to drop in for the same reason a Yahoo acquisition would cause the ratio to drop as described previously And based on Verizons steadily climbing payout ratio see chart above we believe Yahoo would be a more valuable acquisition to Verizon than it would be to ATT ie Verizon more urgently needs to address its payout ratio than does ATT Also worth noting Verizon and ATT are not the only companies interested in Yahoo For example the Wall Street Journal reports that private equity firm TPG has expressed an interest in Yahoo over the last few months A private equity acquisition would probably be a better deal for Yahoo shareholders than a Verizon or ATT acquisition because the private equity firm would likely have a more optimistic vision for Yahoos future whereby theyd cut costs and then try to resurrect growth Verizon and ATT on the other hand would likely just cut Yahoos costs to the bone and turn it into a value company instead of focusing on a return to big growth The fundamental risk profiles of both ATT and Verizon are changing as the companies are forced to take on new risks just to maintain their high dividends For example the companies they are acquiring eg AOL DirecTV are more volatile and have higher betas than the traditional telecom businesses of ATT and Verizon Further ATTs acquisition of Mexican cell companies increases foreign currency risk and volatility And if one of the companies purchases Yahoo then that too will increase volatility and risk Yahoo is much more volatile than Verizon and ATT Another risk that Verizon and ATT face as they continue to invest in new types of businesses is that they may end up losing their status as a fixed income proxy Specifically many investors have flocked to ATT and Verizon over the last decade as interest rates have fallen so low The historical low volatility and high dividend payments of telecom companies have been particularly attractive to incomeoriented investors that might have previously purchased bonds However ATT and Verizon are likely increasing their future volatility by investing in riskier businesses The good news is that they still have a lot of low volatility telecom wirelesswireline revenues and interest rates are likely to continue to stay low for quite some time In a related point Verizon and ATT may eventually lose their status as a safe haven investment if they continue to pursue new strategies Just as many investors pile into US treasuries when volatility picks up so too do they pile into ATT and Verizon For example as volatility has increased and the market has declined so far in ATT and Verizon have performed well because many investors purchased them as a riskoff safety play However if the companies continue to purchase higherrisk nontelecom companies then they may eventually lose their status as a safehaven investment As the following chart shows Verizon and ATT have a history of healthy dividends and dividend increases They understand that investors invest for the dividends and the companies wont ever cut unless there is truly no other option because they dont want to violate shareholder trust However the evolving business strategies have increased risk We believe the chance of a dividend cut for either company within the next few years is still remote but it has increased For example if DirecTV turns out to be a flop then ATT will be back in the same predicament it was in ie running out of free cash flows from which to pay dividends Similarly if Verizons dividend payout ratio as a percent of free cash flow continues to increase then so too does the risk of a cut Much more likely than a dividend cut is the possibility of smaller or nonexistent dividend increases in the future If the companies new business strategies demand more cash or involve more volatility then management will be hesitant to increase the dividend meaningfully because theyll want to play it safe and preserve cash simply to maintain the dividend payment We believe this is a real risk that investors should consider as the companies business strategies continue to evolve We believe Verizon and ATTs new inorganic growth acquisitions eg DirecTV AOL possibly Yahoo run the risk of being simply a kick the can down the road strategy whereby they purchase a business with uncompelling longterm prospects because they provide a shortterm bump to free cash flows and help maintain the dividend payments The jury is still out with the DirecTV acquisition because it is still relatively recent and the success of a potential Yahoo acquisition by either company depends on whether the purchase can be made at a cheap enough discount price Remember if Yahoo had such great future prospects then it wouldnt be up for sale in the first place The dividends at Verizon and ATT are still safe for the time being but the total risktoreturn profiles are evolving Specifically future stock price volatility may be higher and dividend increases lower than shareholders are used to because the business strategies are increasingly risky Further both companies run the risk of overpaying for acquisitions because theyre pressured to focus on shorterterm free cash flow needs ie maintaining the big dividends instead of longterm value And if Verizon and ATT want to maintain their longterm reputation for being big safe dividend growers they may eventually need to find a better strategy than simply acquiring and managing businesses with shrinking growth Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to
