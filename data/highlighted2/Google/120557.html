probably too low and based on concerns about the Samsung Galaxy S As it did last quarter Apple NASDAQ AAPL will exceed its own guidance as well as the expectations of many investment analysts when it reports its fiscal Q results on July In the process Apple demolishes widely held myths about itself In the March quarter Apple demolished the myth that the appeal of large screen iPhones would quickly diminish In the June quarter Apple will demolish the myth of Samsungs OTCSSNLF invincibility In fairness to the professional analysts whose estimates of iPhone sales for fiscal Q are well summarized by Philip ElmerDewitt Apples own guidance for the quarter was too conservative to begin with I believe this was due to concern over the impact of the Samsung Galaxy S Unquestionably the S is the best smartphone available in the Android ecosystem Samsung had gotten the drop on Apple with its own Exynos processor for the S fabricated on Samsungs new nm FinFET process With its new processor an arguably superior OLED screen improved physical design and the new Android operating system the S may have seemed a little intimidating When all the results come in from Apple Samsung as well as the usual batch of research reports on the smartphone market I think well see that the S delivered a glancing blow to Apple at most There are a number of reasons for this The design although an improvement is clearly derivative of the iPhone s generation that Apple left behind years ago Also although it looks great in advertising photos when seen in person it isnt nearly as finely crafted as the iPhone Plus Overall the Samsungs processor in the S is faster than what Apple put into the iP but not decisively so Android offers many improvements over previous gen Android operating systems but as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL acknowledged at their IO developer conference it is also very buggy In terms of operating systemecosystem Apple maintained the more desirable position As I pointed out recently in Apple Clobbers Samsung In China Apples sales in China drove iPhone yy unit growth Although the S was good it wasnt good enough to supplant the iP in the eyes of Chinese consumers Apple remained the aspirational brand with Apples retail stores serving to confirm this position My estimate of iPhone unit sales is at the high end of the analysts range as reported by PED As I discussed in my recent article on Mac sales I believe IDC arrived at the correct number for Mac unit sales that will be reported by Apple in the earnings release I also book revenue of billion for the Apple Watch as I discuss in my recent article on Watch sales The yearoveryear comps are pretty spectacular increase in iPhone unit sales increase in revenue and a increase in operating income On gross and operating margin Im a little conservative for the following reasons I believe that there were some unanticipated expenses associated with the Watch launch in terms of resolving production problems that drove down gross margin for the Watch On operating margin I believe Apple continues to grow RD rapidly and that there were additional marketing expenses associated with the Watch as well I expect RD cost to be billion and SGA cost to be billion for a total operating cost above the high end of Apples guidance of billion Lately there has been a lot of concern about the macro situation in China LF Capital has a good discussion of this in its excellent if somewhat conservative earnings preview LF concluded that there was no impact to Apple in the June quarter and I concur There may be impacts going forward I believe Apples share price has been held down recently by perceptions rooted in the two myths Ive discussed above as well as macro concerns The myths have a lot of persistence because they keep getting recycled and promoted to some degree by the tech media Whether this quarters results will be enough to finally lay these myths to rest remains to be seen but I hope so Whether the breakout occurs this quarter or not Apple investors can take heart in the longterm trend as shown in the chart below The growth in Apples share price generally tracks Apples income growth So high percentage changes in income yy will eventually translate into proportional changes in share price There always seems to be some lag in the markets response to Apples financial performance as well as daytoday noise in share price Apple investors have to be patient when it comes to the response lag and simply ignore the daytoday noise of
