In terms of operating system/ecosystem, Apple maintained the more desirable position.As I pointed out recently in Apple Clobbers Samsung In China , Apple's sales in China drove iPhone y/y unit growth.Although the S6 was good, it wasn't good enough to supplant the iP6 in the eyes of Chinese consumers.Apple remained the aspirational brand, with Apple's retail stores serving to confirm this position.My estimate of iPhone unit sales is at the high end of the analysts' range, as reported by PED.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As I discussed in my recent article on Mac sales , I believe IDC arrived at the correct number for Mac unit sales that will be reported by Apple in the earnings release. (Uncertainty) </span>I also book revenue of $2 billion for the Apple Watch, as I discuss in my recent article on Watch sales .The year-over-year comps are pretty spectacular: 50% increase in iPhone unit sales, 45% increase in revenue, and a 49% increase in operating income.On gross and operating margin, I'm a little conservative for the following reasons.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe that there were some unanticipated expenses associated with the Watch launch in terms of resolving production problems that drove down gross margin for the Watch. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On operating margin, I believe Apple continues to grow R&D rapidly, and that there were additional marketing expenses associated with the Watch as well. (Uncertainty) </span>I expect R&D cost to be $2.2 billion, and SG&A cost to be $3.6 billion for a total operating cost above the high end of Apple's guidance of $5.75 billion.Lately, there has been a lot of concern about the macro situation in China.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>L&F Capital has a good discussion of this in its excellent if somewhat conservative earnings preview . (Uncertainty) </span>L&F concluded that there was no impact to Apple in the June quarter, and I concur.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There may be impacts going forward. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe Apple's share price has been held down recently by perceptions rooted in the two myths I've discussed above, as well as macro concerns. (Uncertainty) </span>The myths have a lot of persistence because they keep getting recycled and promoted to some degree by the tech media.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Whether this quarter's results will be enough to finally lay these myths to rest remains to be seen, but I hope so. (Uncertainty) </span>Whether the breakout occurs this quarter or not, Apple investors can take heart in the long-term trend, as shown in the chart below.The growth in Apple's share price generally tracks Apple's income growth.So high percentage changes in income y/y will eventually translate into proportional changes in share price.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There always seems to be some lag in the market's response to Apple's financial performance, as well as day-to-day noise in share price. (Uncertainty) </span>Apple investors have to be patient when it comes to the response lag and simply ignore the day-to-day noise of Mr. Market.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.
