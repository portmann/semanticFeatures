could start today Intel has asked me to read a brief disclaimer on their part so I will do so now Todays presentations contain forwardlooking statements All statements made that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially Please refer to Intels most recent earnings release Form Q and K filing available for more information on the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ If Intel uses any nonGAAP financial measures during the presentations you will find on their website intccom the required reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure I also want to note that you can see question cards on your seats If you have a question youd like to ask you can fill those up those will be brought up to me during the course of the presentation and well have time at the end for those cards if you have those questions to be asked So with that out of the way my name is Stacy Rasgon I cover the US semiconductor space here at Bernstein Today it is my great honor to introduce our guest the Chief Executive Officer of Intel Mr Brian Krzanich So what is Intel Size market position the profitability capability on virtually any metric Intel stands in a class by itself in the semiconductor industry today The genesis of the industrys primary driver Moores law began with the founder and it is a legacy that continues to leave them likely the best manufacturers of silicon transistors on the planet Earth today and theyve leveraged that legacy to dominate in their core markets and the PC and data center space But of course a great company it also has its share of great controversies as well Intel is no stranger to these and theyve managed multiple high stakes transitions over decades Among the questions I get from investors and I think some of the core controversies that are out there as their core markets continued to plateau or potentially decline can they build new businesses to take their place Why has mobile proved so challenging and what lies ahead on that front Can the company keep running faster than the industry and preserve their position and data center And as they face their latest in a long line of admittedly very successful transitions can they pivot their focus away from PCs and towards cloud successfully and return to growth in doing so So to address these and other questions again it gives me great pleasure to welcome Intel CEO Brian Krzanich BK thank you so much for being with us here today Actually the reason I aim to please so I do want to start maybe with a broader question on strategy and maybe how maybe your thoughts as over the last three years as CEO has maybe changed it So Intel obviously has weathered as I mentioned numerous cusps at different points in their history very successfully Could you give us a feeling maybe for how the current transition is maybe both similar and maybe different from some of the others that the company has faced and how were your thoughts on the necessary strategy I guess to weather that transition How have those thoughts evolved over the last three years as you have the CEO position So this is probably similar to some of the real earlier transitions Intel did We started as a memory company we became a CPU company It is probably on the order of something like that Our strategy has been pretty clear One the PC is not dead right so it is a declining market It is what youre seeing is the effects of replacement cycle pushing out and some other functions eroding but it is still a very profitable business for us And I always remind people the PC for Intel last year the profitability actually grew and we actually raised profitability in a year of declining units So we believe we can continue to do that through product innovations or cost reductions moving forward Thats not our way to grow the company though thats the way to sustain our cash engine and a good healthy business It is maturity The growth engines we believe are going to be the three pillars of the data center IOT and memory And so thats really the transition you are seeing us go through is really push much more of the resources much more of the focus on to those three segments Now what that means is that we have to really get a culture thats been all about the PC PC first innovation around the PCs to be focused on innovation in these other new areas And thats really at the last earnings announcements we announced a headcount reduction and the movement of resources thats really an effort to do the last push of the organization over from being very PC centric to much more cloud and IOT centric which is what were going to drive moving forward Got it Do you feel like the third peg is that last push that last thing is that all thats necessary to get you over the hump So I always look at the world in two ways you always have to look at the company like Intel from a technology standpoint and an organizational standpoint Organizationally I think this will be the last big push we need to do If you talk if you look into the halls of Intel if you talk to the people they understand the strategy much much clearer now Theyve bought into this transition and they understand how this is the big push organizationally right from kind of an emotional standpoint Technically there is still a lot more work to do We have a great roadmap of innovation on the data center for example over the next two to three years actually even beyond that but some really dramatic changes over the next two to three years So always look at from a technology standpoint it is a consistent roadmap that really drives this So Ive got plenty more work to do there Got it I want to return to that question innovation data center in a moment but I dont want to quite step up with PCs just yet So you mentioned that obviously the PCs not yet theres hopefully some I guess sort of steadystate levels I mean when you talked about replacement cycle extension as you believe driving most of the declines that weve seen So I used to think about it this way as well the idea that tablets maybe extending their replacement cycle rather than being more direct replacements for PCs over the last year so weve seen tablets start to rollover and yet the PC decline is still continuing So how comfortable are you with that idea that this is only replacement cycle extension that were seeing So I dont think replacement cycle is the only thing So I look at it there is lets go back to tablets and lets just maybe just take a look at the last three years and whats happened in the client space right Remember three years ago when I became the CEO tablets were growing at People were really worried tablets were going to replace PCs We made a pretty strong effort to make sure that we built our position there that allowed us to if that did happen we were going to be well positioned and we actually become the number one merchant producer of tablet silicon So what happened though is you are right in that three years tablets have rolled over They are actually declining somewhere to now depending on whose numbers you get and what they see Whats happened in the PCs is it has kind of continued to decline at this mid to high single digits I think thats a combination of two things and they are somewhat related to the tablet as well First the replacement cycle for the PC has extended It was we talked about four years was the average now it has moved to about five or six years Thats us we need to bring more innovation the right things to motivate people and make it easier to transition your PC right now it is easier to move your phone to a new phone than you PC to a new PC right And weve got to go fix some of those things The second thing is what I think also affected tablets is one we built better twoinone devices but two large form platforms or tablets that people call have continued to come into the market and people are replacing what was eroding the PC in that space was the tablets So to me theres two functions that are driving PC the replacement cycle and tablets You see phones tablets started to slow down it appears We think replacement cycle will come out this doesnt mean whether it is five six or seven years but theres a point where innovation and technology does keep moving I think the decline will level off at some point Where that is Im not exactly sure and I am making sure that our company is not built on a model that has a number that has to be right in order to continue to grow Got it Then youve talked about like the benefit the PCs bring to the rest of the business even if say the market itself is in some level of permanent decline Can you talk about how I guess the continuing PC business continues to help fuel some of these other probably growth opportunities PC the IOT and memory Sure so I mean fundamentally this was started Moores law right the PC volume million units a year whatever the number is that being in one year is really what gives us the volume and scale that allows us to drive Moores law and it funds those investments and the billion a year of CapEx that it takes to keep growing in these markets So thats the first thing PC is absolutely the engine for that The second thing is that it does utilize and drive some of the core develops the core itself some of our tablet technology It helps us drive our memory and our SSDs All of those things come spin off from the PC technology Does the I guess the ability of the PCs have to fill the fab is that impacted at all as the industry continues to decline or can you manage capacity We can manage capacities It is going to depend it is really the data center growth and we have IOT and then you have memory and those three in combination we think can keep the fabs full to an extent as the PC declines Really Because memory is made in the phone fabs right I have seen data center and IOT having enough volumes to make up the difference is just out of proportion Well so first memory has typically built in its own fabs but any one of our fabs could be transitioned from logic fab to a memory fab So there is no unique structure about a memory fab versus a data center fab or a PC fab IOT I mean if you take a look at the number of units that could be reproduced and people talk about tens of billions of units over the next decade going into that space So I think the volume in IOT could be quite large If you look at autonomous cars or semiautonomous cars that could million to million units a year easily and if you look at that number it is several Xeon Processors in size average autonomous car So it can produce quite a bit of volume I guess and then on that note in terms of manufacturing and process how would you define the term process leadership At the end of the day you know we all use numbers nanometers nanometers nanometers just to make sure everybody knows there is no actual element on that piece of silicon that are actually not to mention any more Right Thats in a way probably at about microns or something like that so the real good correlation between geometry and a number You are really looking about performance and a scaling factor How many transistors per square millimeter or and could you put on the device And at the end of the day thats what you really have to take a look at So to me process leadership is cost per transistor and performance per watt type of number and thats really where we believe well continue to have leadership We try and classify that with our consistent scale ourselves but it is our scale it is not going to necessarily correlate to our competitors scale So your competitors would suggest that within the next few years they are going to close that gap I mean there is always this question how they are actually defining to your tip point but how do you respond to that I think the competitors can never get and again if I anybody can draw PowerPoint slides obviously but if I look at the PowerPoint slides that gap get near over in that period Sure yes I am always conscious to be overly not overly Im always paranoid On that statement though Im very confident Ive looked at our nanometer technology I looked at our nanometer technology If you also talked to some of competitors they will tell you that there is going to be marginal improvements in performance of nanometers They are going to go for nanometers for performance We plan to have consistent performance improvements to in each one of these nodes So I am comfortable that at least over the next two nodes we know how to stay ahead and I dont want to say beyond that because visibility beyond that technology wise is still pretty granular Sure Youve been stretching your nodes out transitioning out two and half to three years Many of your competitors at least again on paper are trying to bring those in So does that stretching out of your process node migration what impact does that have on your long term competitors then So again this gets back to what level of performance are you really providing with each one of those nodes So if you come out with a new node but you have very little improvement but you say hey I went from or nanometers to nanometers but I provided a to improvement thats not really a node they are not well What well do is stay forward out a little bit longer but yes were going to provide a standard improvement scaling factor So were going to keep all those numbers very consistent as we go and thats actually what we believe continues to keep us in our leadership In practice is that one metric in terms of density or performance or anything else is that enough I think I recall at the Analyst Day Bill Holt had a discussion on this and he was talking about in terms of just like what transistor density Intel certainly has the lead but in practice when you are looking at the different types of functional blocks that are required on todays advanced SoCs because of that mix of lots of difference from what your competitors are shipping like for example mobile space virtually you are shipping in PCs like in practice it is harder to see that advantage So how was my thinking on that I guess wrong or right No Bill was accurate He was trying to clarify for people why when you look at two different products the actual products in the market you cant always do a comparative on these things because if you look at our Xeon class system and a mobile phone chip that is scaling an amount memory so the more percent the memory is memory tends to be denser versus analog or the other logic portions So you have to take a look at those as you look at the scaling factors on a product right Thats really what he was trying to say as why you wont necessarily get a good correlation between process capability and then what products people are building on it If you built the same product so what he said was ours would still be very much in a leadership position But remember where I am going with the growth I am going with the growth in data center IOT and memory and in data center especially that process leadership that were talking about that density of the transistors and the performance of the transistors is really what is important And so I dont that is the most important set of metrics especially for those kinds of products Got it lets talk about data center then So I guess the overall kind of server hardware spend in the industry hasnt grown in years flat I think it is a minus CAGR in years per server hardware Obviously Intel has benefited from a number of positive transitions actually just over that time periods gone from of that spend there Youve picked up I mean what is this points of market share in the last years at least on a unit basis Weve had an increase in the number of processors per server and this is all I can and your pricing has been up it sounds like an CAGR on average over the last years So this is actually driven from very robust and attractive growth in this business If I look at these drivers now that some of them appear more saturated than they were so again actually this is just not the majority of server spend It has been a good thing You dont have any more market share to take You are virtually share today I dont know how much longer your pricing can continue because although we can have that discussion as well I had some questions there but can you talk a little bit to how you see maybe some of the drivers of overall growth in the industry over the next to years changing from where theyve been over the last to years for you and how that feeds into your growth targets for the statement Sure so lets step back for a second and talk about the data center right The data center is no longer one segment It is really you talk about enterprise data center and cloud based data center and high performance computing data centers and those are all growing at different rates and seeing different types of technology needs The big thing thats happened at Intel over the last three or four years is that weve moved from really thinking about a data center Ill call it from a blade standpoint where we really focused on the server blade and the CPU that going to go inside there and can we drive the performance of that CPU up to really thinking about it at a RAC level And there is really a lot of opportunity we believe in when you hear us talk about RAC Scale Architecture really thinking about the entire RAC from top to bottom from the networking through those the server the memory the storage all the way down and in the communication thats in that RAC itself So you see a set of technologies that were introducing over the next couple of years Thats why I said we have a lot of good work to do First is OmniPath fabric What that really does is provides a fabric pathway on our CPUs that allows us to make direct connections into the CPU from external products The second thing is we went out and bought an FPGA company There are workloads that really can be taken from software thats working in memory to software that is working right on the silicon right next to the CPU with a direct link through that OmniPath fabric So you can accelerate workloads like Big Data and AI much much faster Then we did Silicon Photonics So that allows us highspeed connection within that RAC Scale or the RAC And then lastly is our memory with both D NAND and D XPoint and D XPoint if you remember is a hybrid between memory and storage and again with that fabric we can make a direct connection So now were talking about really architecting and rearchitecting the entire RAC and providing a much higher performance for people across that RAC We believe that that will drive quite a bit of growth over the three to five years because at the end of the day what youre right server spending hasnt increased but server utilization And if you think about it as a clicksperdollar or page reads per dollar or however you want to take a look at data set stored per dollar those have increased massively over that time Right The growth of the cloud and the data thats in the cloud that are accessed into the cloud thats all been done through processor performance and virtualization in all of these technologies We can think we can accelerate that growth through this architecture thats complete Rack Scale Architecture So thats really whats fueled the replacement cycle and the spending And so we think as a result we can continue to grow at that rate So those exponential changes you talked about and that was Moores law playing out in some sense over the last decades Youre talking about some of these new assets I guess not on the process of basically making everything work together Is that any statement in there in terms of driving innovation outside of Moores law as Moores law is now indiscernible is that why youre focusing on these other areas So I will be careful We are going to continue to drive the Moores law and actually I dont think that that is going to eventually slow down this growth rate or change that So youre still going to see large amounts of faster improvement more cores more compactions good Moores law performance What it really is is thinking about it from how an IT person owns one of those data centers they dont think about the data center at the server blade level necessarily They think about it at the RAC level And actually when you think about it they think about many RACs together And so I was really out sitting back and say how did those guys think about their architectures and what do they need to really provide the performance So it is stepping a bit outside of Moores law but the way were able to provide this performance the way were able to integrate Silicon Photonics on die the way were able to integrate the OmniPath fabric is through Moores law Right It is through that silicon technology Right there has been a move in the data center if this RAC comes to more open systems this sounds proprietary to me Are there other issues with that No what youre really talking about there is things like OpenStack right And remember Intel is one of the biggest contributors to the OpenStack framework So no I mean thats the great thing about Intel architecture is that this RAC people will be able to choose bits and pieces You can choose the server and you can have access to the OmniPath fabric and you can choose Silicon Photonics you can choose D NAND and D XPoint and CPUs with FPGAs or without People have their options to choose but if you are really driving for the top performance if you put these together they will work faster and we believe you will have the highest performance But that will work on almost any software architecture whether it is OpenStack architecture or closed architecture or software architecture that people are using proprietary one that they have it will work with all the softwares So I think at your Analyst Day youve talked about these components of data center adding about three points of growth within your target The target for the business is ish I think youve said sort of the traditional piece of the processor is and this was like add on or top on So Im surprised it is not bigger here in the way you are talking about it Well it is not going to so FPGAs for example right Lets take that Not every workload is going to utilize FPGA So whats the percentage of workloads that really need this top level of performance And thats where we cannot work It is roughly or points right Okay okay Im sorry I sometimes confuse points and percents So yes it is like about points of the growth So whats going to drive the growth on the more traditional part of the business given many of the metrics that we talked a little earlier again it appeared to be saturated when I look at them now So I actually dont look at that as saturated You know you could have gone back several years ago and said data center is saturated as well right What we really are looking at is a replacement cycle right We have to produce a nextgeneration Xeon that has high enough performance improvement at a cost per performance right Most of these guys look at cost per unit of performance and many of them actually include power as well So it is power performance cost metrics If were able to drive performance that drives up the curve that says they are going to get a better cost performance metric out of that what theyll go in and do is replace the last generation CPU with the new generation CPU Thats the fundamental driver is us staying on that performance cost curve for the data center And when they make that decision do they make it in real time like as soon as the I guess the TCO total cost of ownership of the new products is that under the old price with a lifetime We typically especially with the big partners that the big larger data center groups and our OEM partners start to talk about what the performance is and what the general costs are going to be well in advance of the product coming out So they have an idea where it is going to be on the curve and what and so then we have an idea what our replacement cycle is going to be So I guess given the need for new capabilities does that suggest you see your I guess your outlook for pricing continuing on the same trend that it has been Yes what we said is our pricing growth shouldnt be any different than the future going forward But remember its really a cost performance So if you take a look at what a person has to spend in the data center on a cost per page or click or however they want to measure performance it should actually be going down from their operational standpoint Okay so then the utilization of these data centers the amount of access thats going through number of pages that people are viewing or the number of clicks that people are seeing on their web pages all of those are increasing at a phenomenal rate and has been fueled by this Moores law so that costs per access is actually going down Got it What happens to pricing drivers as new levers of growth take over like networking Weve already seen over the last year or so the pricing trends start to level off a bit as networking has become a bigger and bigger piece of the business So I always am very cautious of that right What you are seeing is that remember this gets to the how do you think about the RAC in its entirety and how you drive Moores law this is a great example of us driving Moores law into other parts of the RAC So typically networking CPUs are lower ASP and so as our percentage of that business grows our average ASP goes down We were sub We just crossed over of market share so we had a lot of headroom to grow But the margin on those products is still quite good for us How much of that networking talent and give us I forget what the number was billion or billion or wherever the number it is that you put up there in terms of the TAM How much of that you believe is not just theoretically addressable but something that you actually have a good chance of penetrating over time there is a good amount of those for example Switch silicon and some other things in that Sure I dont think weve actually calculated out exactly what percentage but its a fair amount of it I think we have is it Im not sure but there is a good percentage that what you are seeing is people going from ASIC type parts that they custom built to general purpose software defined networking structures and so there is good part of the stuff that indiscernible I think we have a lot of headroom to grow there So is cloud deflationary I will say by the way even among the burns and tech analysts we do not have consensus on this view all over the place but Im curious to get your and the reason I ask is your long term targets for data center still imply the enterprise portion of which is I think by the end of this year this was mostly rather conservative basis on the way to wind up now but it implied thats still growing or so Its been down for several years I think except for however So I dont know if that is macro if its in some sense a symptom of the cloud business growing so strongly but like what is your point of view on that debate So I think you have to separate out a couple things One enterprise typically is fairly well correlated to GDP So when GDP is slow we typically see enterprise growth slowdown too So some of that is just worldwide GDP spends flowing down over the last couple of years and so we see that In general though if I take a look at this cloud versus sometimes people talk about public cloud versus private cloud and private cloud considered to enterprise type structure at the end of the day I think its going to be the public cloud is going to be the plus growth engine and the private cloud is going to be in that mid to low single digit growth There is just scale and virtualization and the public cloud is working through the security issues and you can argue and especially for smaller companies security is better in the public cloud they have back up all kinds of things that says for many many small businesses smalltomedium businesses the public cloud is a much better space to put your business into I still think that the large can be like if I look at a company like Intel our design database our real private IT information is going to sit in a private cloud as onpremises So thats I think thats going to continued to stay The result is the public cloud is going to grow faster There is or tends to be lower pricing for everybody including us in that space and so that will it will generally weigh down Weve built that into our forecast this discrepancy and so but I think this trend will continue absolutely this has not been a change But you still believe that enterprise over the long term actually can grow I guess where Im trying to reconcile that is with your statement even if you just wanted to point toward the macro is that to suggest that even the macro is going to be getting better over the next five years of growth I think that if you take a look over a long term four or five years whatever the classic enterprise should still be able to grow in that mid to low single digits I mean I think there is still going to be plenty of reasons for companies to keep their data onprem in a private cloud But that is not going to be the big fuel that that public cloud at plus percent that is going to be the driver Got it And Im trying to remember again cloud by the end of this year in terms of the percentage of your data center business was going to be about a third indiscernible Okay There has been a lot of I guess news flow recently about new competition in data center whether its competitors pushing into arm whether its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>talking about their efforts on open power how should investors be assessing the risk and timeframe of new competition entering this space So I think that the announcements you hear today have not been any different really than the announcements youve heard all over the past few years There is constantly people saying that they are going to enter the data center market they are going to be competitive I think at the end of the day we take all of this competition very seriously The last thing you want to do as a technologist is become over arrogant and say nobody is going to beat my technology That is why when I take a look at it what were really thinking about is that were thinking about the data center well beyond just the CPU And when you do that then you start looking at well okay for these types of workloads Im going to add an FPGA So now I have access to FPGA technologies So artificial intelligence and Big Data certain forms of high performance computing can really be accelerated by binding an FPGA with the CPU And then OmniPath Fabric I am going to have Silicon Photonics Im going to add D XPoint for imminent workloads Now when a company wants to compete with us in the data center the CPU is not enough and youve got to have the ability to say we will Ive got to have an FPGA access to an FPGA technology and if I have to go integrate that FPGA technology I need to have Silicon Photonics I need to have access to high performance memories that are only available by a few in the world So what we try to do is build a much more RAC view the world and make it so that basically it is more difficult to compete with us its a harder part of because were looking at the entire RAC which is what the customer wants were providing a better performance as a result So why are the customers at least some of the customers trying to push their own efforts now as well if that is what indiscernible I think its exactly for the right reason The market always wants competition and I think competition for Intel is good It is what has fuelled us to bring the higher and better performance So we are constantly making sure that our performance we dont win by locking people out or doing any other noncompetitive we win by the performance These additions the FPGA the Silicon Photonics the D XPoint they are about performance they are not about lock outs and that is really the key I think there has always been customers out there that are trying to and its good they want to come up with a better solution Yes I think Diane said that most of your customers are working on this She said it is coming up in price negotiations doesnt seem to be influencing price negotiations at this point so maybe that is a statement for the relative performance I think it does influence price negotiations I mean otherwise like the prices to be higher but I mean so we make sure that again we stay on a cost curve that provides a cost per performance that we really think about how do we replace ourselves and that is really what we drive our business model What are your thoughts on I guess the process acceleration and again you obviously bought an FPGA company partially I think for that for that reason Weve seen competitors in the GP space pushing in here Again weve got <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>just announced what they call the Tensor ph Processing Unit for artificial intelligence and indiscernible the other day I guess is this a space a portion of the data centers that you see actually growing significantly going forward and how do you think I guess the Altera offering is going to be positioned against some of the others that are out there Sure So lets talk about that machine learning is absolutely a space that is going to be its part of whats going to fuel the cloud When you think about machine learning this machine learning occurs on the device the autonomous car the robot whatever you want the electrical device or whatever it is you want to put out there at the Edge and then theres the cloud and those two are constantly sharing data and sharing algorithms back in forth I absolutely believe that machine learning will be one of the key drivers for this plus percent comp growth We think we factored in the right amounts of what machine learning is going to drive into our growth forecasts but Ill be honest it is so nascent to that it could be much much bigger than even what weve estimated When you think about machine learning technology definitely you have to think about what type of architecture works best It does work well with the scalar type architecture of the GPU We have our Xeon Phi offerings so its a very high end We can we win a large percentage of the GPU high performance computing applications with our Xeon Phi The next generations down or the next scaled down the combination of the CPU in the FPGA works quite well Why would somebody go off and do an ASIC if that is always going to be the highest performing option But you have to have enough scale and volume to be able to want that But even next ASIC you need a Xeon class CPU sitting next to it to drive the data performance So I think any time theres a customer whos got enough intellectual property theyve got enough scale they are going to look at ASIC opportunities because that will provide an even higher performance than the FPGA The FPGA allows the options if you dont have the scale you can do it much cheaper as a result and or if you want to have a virtualized system and be able to run everything from AI to Big Data to other things you can reprogram the FPGA on the fly So its for more than medium to large scale guys So does that suggest you dont necessarily see the large public cloud vendors as the primary customers for the FPGA offering because again youre talking about customers of scale I mean this is by definition to Googles the Amazons and the Facebooks No I think its no absolutely in fact some of the large customers are some of our first were already sampling to be honest with FPGAs and their large cognize are going there first Its really going to depend on do they have the scale and do they want to provide put the engineering resources on that And if so is there a cost benefit for that And our job is so I mean this is where the competition and remember you said pricing is it coming up in pricing and affecting pricing our job is to price and provide the performance and so use the FPGA option Got it We have about ten minutes left do you have any questions that youd like to be brought up to the front you can fill those cards out and but Brian I just wanted to give you the opportunity I wanted to talk a little bit about mobile Can you tell us obviously this has been challenging I think recently youve we talked about the tablet efforts You recently exited most of those efforts Can you tell us why executing on that business has been so challenging and maybe what would you do differently in mobile if you had the opportunity to go back in time and reboot it So it depends on how much back in time how much is the way back machine works It actually go even after three years so lets say three years Okay so I only get up small way back So three years ago right we were all worried to death about the tablet and growth and I guess if I could go back and look at it Id say you know what take your beatings youll be right The tablets are going to fade away and dont make the investments I dont think any of us could have known but sure I would have loved to have that foresight and say yes tablets are going to die within a year and start declining to would it have saved us a lot of efforts and all You made a comment at the beginning though that said youre exiting those I just want to make sure right were still going to sell still probably going to be the second biggest or second or third biggest tablet silicon provider well sell million to million tablets this year Intel and indiscernible not much to spend this year for tablets I would tell you that weve done very well with our modem Our modem technology we believe now is world class We are able to stay up with the competition really within ahead of or right on top of or just shortly behind them in performance and characteristics We think thats going to be critical as we go into the G world We believe were leaders in G right now both of the base station and in the connectivity portion Where weve struggled I guess youd classified is in the integrated SSC Do we have a SSC with a modem and everything In tablets you didnt need that Nobody was buying tablets with modem on that so that wasnt a really requirement so and that was our major focus On the phone weve made a bunch of investments Weve started to produce silicon but you said yourself it appears that the phone business is starting to slow and may be its starting to level off The profit is becoming very tight in that market and so weve been very careful about not getting into that market in a way thats going to erode profitability and erode margin in the company so were going to continue with the modem development We think G is going to be a big transition We believe it allows us to work much better with our telco providers to base station work and grow our networking silicon there But well be cautious in the phone business which means thats why you saw us take away some of the low end phone products This wasnt exiting mobile all together We still got a modem Were very strong But these low end phone products that we are looking at we looked out in time and said boy thats a market that costs are going to be very tight Im not sure these are going to be profitable and this not probably use of our shareholder value Can you please quantify how the restructure will impact your losses in mobile and will you base spend efforts this year make money And so our cost cutting efforts will we said well take million out of our mobile loss As I remember we said million last year We actually got to billion We said million again this year We should hit that number So I thats not going to really change it For next year though I think it could dramatically change We havent forecasted what our reduction will be next year but I think it will be very strong Our baseband Im not going to tell you when were going to be profitable on that Around the mobile loss though that you are talking about to be clear you have been reinvesting until recently with the cuts youve been reinvesting the saving So you saved more than million last year but OpEx went up the company level those savings were reinvested not that thats wrong Hey what we said this year is that with the restructuring that will be about billion I know I can remember Im not the CFO I think its about billion Weve taken a onetime writeoff half of it this year and half of it next year but that youd see reductions starting this year and in our OpEx and continuing into next year and we think it will take about billion out of our OpEx billion if I remember correctly But thats already included in the guidance for where we are this year You are talking about next year but this year it is going to be up Optimal capital structure CapEx So I think we CapEx is billion I dont see that changing dramatically over the next year or two That is about the right number And then let Stacy show you at an Investor Meeting couple of years ago it takes about billion I think it was to just run the company keep the factories retrofitting at some pace and adding new office buildings and that kind of stuff billion to billion for other investments and things like that and new technologies this is out right So that billion to billion is about the right number Is it fair to say by the way that if your wafer capacities stay constant your core CapEx should go up over time given the costs youve shown the strength of the cost of the silicon area is going up over time Our wafer capacity stays same if all other things didnt change that is true The reason it doesnt is weve continued to improve our reach So the capital that could be reused from node to node has been increasing and an important factor is our speed at which we could convert those tools has improved And so thats been a major function of why weve been able to keep even in an increasing CapEx per wafer that CapEx is flat relatively Could you comment on the impact of cyclicality of your business as you shift your chip focus to storage cloud and RAC So if you take a look at it right the PC has a very somewhat of a pretty consistent cycle of you see it as it goes into the holiday season quarter before it builds up then you see in the first quarter and second quarter it is kind of inventories flow out and kind of go down We almost see a similar cycle The big cloud guys typically build up early in the year as they approach the fourth quarter they typically dont want to touch their data centers because that has been the last thing you want to do is want to just trying to order things online how about your cloud retrofit So we see some pattern of cyclicality in the data center as well It is offset maybe by a quarter or two I dont think it will dramatically shift how the company looks cyclicality wise Got it So we have about one minute left Im going to give you a soap box why should investors be excited about Intel I dont think there is a time in our history that the future has been brighter I think if you take a look at it we have done all the right moves to get to right where the investors want Weve done the CapEx improvements and gotten the CapEx down into a nice sustainable laid of that billion to billion We did the restructuring to really take the spending and cost out of the PC side of the business and really scaled the PC business to what we think the realistic market looks like which is exactly what the investment community wants And we are investing quite nicely in those growth areas and weve got the three growth areas nicely defined and really integrated into a very consistent package that says the data center and the surrounding areas of IoT and memory are really going to fuel the growth and weve made great investments in the technology for us moving forward So I cant think of a bright better time The company is restructured the spending is in the right place and the technologies are there Copyright policy All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking
