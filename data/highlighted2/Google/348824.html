solution to this pressing need There is a good chance that PC sales revival will happen this year For most of us there are two indispensable gadgets one is our mobile phone and the second is our beloved laptopnotebook Laptops are one of the most underrecognized engineering masterpieces and are a benchmark of how to blend form and function In my years of use I had a laptop crash only once This reliability that most of us take for granted is due to the effort of some of the finest minds on the planet I tip my hat to all engineersdesigners who made this happen My current laptop is four years old and has nagging issues and I want it replaced with a new one In the current laptop I had to remove a lot of preinstalled software aptly named bloatware to increase the performance I wanted to know if I am being fussy about this bloatware or do other people are also as concerned as me I did a simple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>trend search using the term bloatware and the result was revealing I am not alone as more people across the globe are concerned about this extra baggage and their numbers are growing This time my requirement is very simple I want a laptop from one of the major manufacturers with just Windows installed and the basic functions like video sound and WiFi should be superior quality Thats it I will install whatever software I need Finally my search was over and the place where I could get a laptop to my simple specification is from Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT itself and these PCslaptops are called Signature Edition computers In this site I can get my laptop of choice without any of the bloatware Its website clearly states how its computers are faster better and efficient than the ones with bloatware ie the ones laptop manufacturers sell One should congratulate Microsoft for pulling this kind of incredible deal from OEMs original equipment manufacturers I am at a loss to figure out what stops OEMs from doing this in the first place Is it that they are addicted to adding bloatware and later realize their mistake and admit themselves to this Microsoft rehab center sacrificing their margins to get cured In other words Microsoft has now become Cesar Millan to these errant OEMs I do not know on what basis OEMs think that we are going crazy for their Photo Album software and the like I tried searching through Microsoft presentations in its website to understand the size of this business but could not get enough data and so tried the usual trick the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>trend search I searched for the term Microsoft Signature Edition and surprisingly there has been a significant jump in these searches in the last year PC functionality scores over tablets PC sales have been down for four years in a row Media is rife with stories of how tablets have killed PCs in the last few years and why PCs will never see the light again so on We have two tablets at home My children off late prefer using only laptops When prodded they gave the following reasons a larger screen is easy on their eyes typing is comfortable due to the keyboard and they do not get neck strain When using laptops people use a proper desk and hence this freeformtype viewing of tablets which is not ergonomic is avoided I run many programs in my laptop that cannot run in tablets I do not see my case as an isolated one and like me many will feel compelled to upgrade because one cannot do without a desktoplaptop One of the key reasons for the PC refresh not happening is that OEMs are not getting their act together When users are screaming for fast and clean PCs the OEMs irritate them by foisting their bloatware on them As Microsofts Signature line becomes prominent these OEMs will be forced to change because in this era a business can move from one channel to another very rapidly and OEMs will be terribly disadvantaged if Microsoft becomes the most preferred channel for buying computers The third reason is that the Windows adoption will act as a tailwind and will accelerate PC sales growth Beginnings of bull markets always have these two classic symptoms First newspapers will be full of gloom and public participation will be at its lowest This analogy is apt for PC sales too and I believe a bull market in PC sales is on the cards Finally it is a winwin situation for MSFT and no wonder it is the only old tech stock that is nearing its alltime high Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged
