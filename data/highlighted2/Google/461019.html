trend and increased competition will weigh on the stock Netflix NASDAQ NFLX will report earnings after the market close Consensus expects in EPS and b in revenue The stock is down since its Q earnings compared with growth for the Nasdaq as the market is clearly concerned about the weak domestic subs growth and increased competition from Amazon NASDAQ AMZN which recently rolled out its own OTT product Although the broader macro environment continues to support NFLX given the viewership transition from pay TV to online I continue to be cautious on NFLX due to the growing competitive environment rising content inflation and questionable overseas expansion While the company is making the right moves by shifting focus to inhouse development and original content such strategy will require increased investment as the hurdle for creating the next hit show gets higher ie House of Cards Season was not as good as Season Domestic subs growth will likely remain challenged due to the growing competition from alternative OTT providers such as Hulu AMZN <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Outlook The Changing Face Of TV and HBO which have been partially responsible for the decelerating domestic subs growth over the past several quarters The recent decision by AMZN to introduce a standalone OTT service magnifies the risk profile that NFLX faces Although AMZNs content library is still smaller relative to that of NFLX with smaller geographic footprint AMZNs execution on several original contents is a good indication of its future success in my view and this poses a threat to NFLX in the long term Amazon Outlook Ready For Prime Time More important to the NFLX story is the growth in its international subs which I believe could see significant headwinds in the target markets that NFLX is targeting In Europe AMZN reported to be rolling out its own standalone OTT service in France Spain and Portugal that puts itself in direct competition against NFLX Although AMZN may not succeed to taking subs share from NFLX in these regions given its smaller content library I believe that AMZN could be competitive if it bundles its OTT product with its Prime membership to make the service even more compelling This could potentially lead to a pull back by consumers on NFLX as they gravitate towards AMZN which offers a more attractive value proposition with both OTT service and ecommerce In India NFLX made good inroads see Netflix First Dance With The Elephants but the competitive environment is becoming increasingly competitive particularly from the incumbent Eros NYSE EROS which is widely considered to be NFLX of India I note that EROS currently has m streaming users in the country and is the clear leader in the space Just recently EROS has partnered with telecommunication providers IDEA and Airtel for OTT distribution partnership giving the incumbent access to half of Indias wireless users Additionally NFLX faces competition from Reliance Communications and Singaporebased Hooq given that they have been operating in India for some time In China NFLX continues to look for inroads but without a qualified partner or NFLX making a sacrifice by taking on lower revenue share it would be difficult to break into the market see Netflix Eyes On China A logical partner would be Leeco formerly known as LeTV which has a wide distribution network and deep penetration of smart TVs and smartphones in China LeTV has the tendency to bundle its hardware and content to drive user adoption and NFLX could potentially ride on LeTVs hardware footprint to expand its presence in China However similar to any other Chinese partnership NFLX could potentially be entitled to less than half of the revenue share and this will require multiyear investments by NFLX in the country in order to produce meaningful longterm ROI I would remain cautious on NFLX and prefer content holders to be the best way to play the broader OTT theme for two reasons First content holders are the key beneficiary of the OTT trend given the growing number of new entrants wanting to acquire award winning TV shows or movies to draw audience to their platform leading to gradual content inflation Second content holders or studios with content catered to the global audience base stands to benefit from potential MAs from wellfunded Chinese bidders I note that recent reports on potential Paramount sale to Alibaba NYSE BABA Baidu NASDAQ BIDU or Wanda are good indications that quality US studios will be heavily sought after as the Chinese look to ramp up on their own content library Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
