Android Wear Smartwatch on November The Intelpowered Swissmade smart atch is much cheaper watch than Apples Watch Edition JeanClaude Biver Chairman of Hublot and CEO of Tag Heuer told CNBC last month that his companys first ever Android Wear smart watch will cost and it will be unveiled on November Biver praised and thanked Apple NASDAQ AAPL for popularizing luxury smart watches He also admitted that Intel NASDAQ INTC and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOGL are the best partners to help Swiss watchmakers Intel and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>teamedup last March to help Tag Heuer create a rival luxury alternative against the Apple Watch The much cheaper Tag Heuer Android smart watch is now an imminent threat to Apples very popular iOS watch On another interview with CNBC yesterday Biver also said Apple was a real disruptor but that its k smartwatch will eventually become obsolete This fighting words is based on his claim that only a Swissmade mechanical watch is worth buying and owning for all eternity He was merely pointing out that Apples very pricey Edition watches might be a mistake for longterm ownership I agree with Bivers assessment The Intelpowered Tag Heuer Android Watch is more reasonable for astute buyers Tag Heuer and Hublot are subsidiaries of luxury goods giant LVMHMoet Hennessy Louis Vuitton OTCPK LVMHF Biver therefore clearly knows how to pricemarket luxury timepieces LVMH has the retail stores huge pool of loyal clients and the brand power to really make a globalwide push for the Intelpowered Tag Heuer Android watch This products luxury price tag means Intel is supplying it with a highmargin processor As of Q Apple was estimated to have sold million watches most of which were likely the cheaper models I expect Tag Heuers industryleading reputation to greatly boost the commercial success of its smart watch The people who snubbed the Apple Watch Edition might eventually settle for Tag Heuers cheaper alternative While cheaper Apple Watch models will outsell this product there will be discriminating people who still favor the bragging rights of owning a Tag Heuerbranded smart watch I opine that Apple still has a long way to go before the typical clients of LVMHLouis Vuitton accept it as a real luxury brand INTC is a Buy This company has the expertise to make it big in watch application processors Tag Heuers act of trusting Intel for its first ever smartwatch says a lot Contrary to its detractors claims Intel made a very energy efficient but powerful processor for a very discriminating Swiss client This could encourage AndroidTizen smartwatch vendors like LG Huawei and Samsung OTC SSNLF to consider trusting Intel for their nextgeneration of connected watches I am sure there are still millions of potential buyers that cannot afford the price tag of the Tag Heuer Android watch Lowcost specialist Huawei could perhaps use Intels expertiseprocessors to help it create a clone version of the Swissmade watch There is tangible future economic benefits for Intel to win the support of more watch makers The market for luxury Swissmade watches is obviously still smaller compared to the total addressable market of andbelow smartwatch products Intel helped AndroidWindows tablets create cheaper alternatives to the iPad Intel also helped cheaper in touchscreenfriendly laptops that now compete against the MacBook I appreciate it very much that Intel is now also helping formidable firms like LVMH create alternatives to the Apple Watch Edition Fossil a brand famous for affordable mechanicalautomatic watches here in the Philippines also recently announced its own Intelpowered smartwatch I hope Timex Fossils main rival here in my country will also release a more expensive but Intelpowered version of its Ironman One GPS smartwatch Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks
