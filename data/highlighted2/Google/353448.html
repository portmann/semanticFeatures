class='textDiv'>Control Insurmountable Competitive Pressure Leads To Large Price Cuts And Business Impairment Control Corporation NASDAQCTRL Seeking Alpha Amazon now making a huge home automation push with Echo platform Just made a questionable acquisition that consumed half its cash We have written about Control Corp NASDAQ CTRL CTRL or the Company twice before both turned out to be quite timely and accurate calls We believe current conditions present another even more attractive opportunity to short the stock Over the last two months CTRLs stock has runup nearly despite significant negative developments including a price cut to its controllers effective January th a questionable acquisition that consumed half its cash and a massive increase in Amazons NASDAQ AMZN commitment to the Echo product line in January with a stated intent of dominating the home automation market This is compounded by an unfavorable mix shift to lower cost controllers and volume headwinds the Company faces from fewer controllers needed per job CTRLs current x LTM PE multiple is predicated on unattainable midteens organic revenue growth and a increase in net income all number proforma with Pakedge This aggressive earnings guidance and lofty expectations drove the stocks recent price appreciation The reality is the recent price cuts and competitive pressures are leading to negative revenue growth and further margin erosion in the near term We believe the Pakedge acquisition only accelerates the Companys demise Control has limited IP and no discernible strategic value thus the stock is likely not worth more than its everdeclining net cash position of per share for a potential return A borrow in the security is readily available with a rebate Current Reality Recent Developments Last year we highlighted how the Company has a structurally flawed business model and sells a single technology product that is rapidly falling into obsolescence The below developments ordered by severity should make it clear that Controls product is officially obsolete and its demise nearing Amazon Echo Family On January Amazon announced it was hiring over engineers and developers in its home automation segment to be added to its Echo team and to Alexa Note CTRL has people in its entire RD department so this single expansion by Amazon will alone bring its headcount to well over x that of Control This followed Echos M Super Bowl advertising spot and ongoing marketing blitz Amazons clear intention is to transform and dominate home automation The pain for Amazons competitors is already being felt as this recent Wall Street Journal article states From a product standpoint Amazons Echo Family is voice activated intuitive does not require professional installation and costs versus plus kk installation for a basic Control remote The rapidly evolving dynamics in home automation technology being led by Amazon has a lot of historical parallels all of which portent disaster for CTRL Amazons strategy to enter the home with Echo is analogous to Apple and Samsungs entrance into the smartphone market Meanwhile Control is the now nearly extinct guy out selling landline home phones Price Cuts In midJanuary CTRL released and began shipping its new EA series controllers The published MSRP is lower for its new entry point controller EA than its equivalent legacy model HC What people failed to realize is the EA is priced at retail versus the HC at but with the new EA CTRL is bundlingin the remote an item it used to sell separately for an additional It is safe to assume CTRL generated high margins on these remotes a product the Company now includes for free Ultimately this large price cut was in response to competitive pressures and pushback from distributors This will obviously impair revenue growth and margins significantly yet somehow it seems to have gone unnoticed by the market Declining Unit Volumes Controllers are getting increasingly powerful thus less and less hardware is required to cover a given amount of square footage Now an entry level component is sufficient for the main ground floor room of an average home The Companys K noted more than half of our consumers have Control system configurations with one controller This number is likely substantially higher now The below number of units sold per home and revenue per home indicates this trend has accelerated for CTRL In the number of controllers per home dropped between and and revenue per home declined Note we had to back into these numbers from information that was somewhat buried in CTRLs filings The bottom line in early Q prices for a product that represents the majority of CTRLs revenue were significantly cut This is exacerbated by the volume headwinds the Company faces from fewer controllers needed per job Pakedge Acquisition The Company closed its acquisition of Pakedge in January for M in cash Facing floundering growth prospects this transaction appears to be a desperate attempt to buy revenue Pakedge is a private company with limited information available but based upon information on Pakedges website it is a hardware company primarily selling routers yet Control management characterizes it as a software business perhaps to justify the lofty multiple Employee reviews of the company and industry reviews of its product are mixed Regardless CTRL used the majority of the cash on its balance sheet to acquire a slow growth marginally profitable business selling a commoditized product for x earnings In the press release announcing the deal the Company said We are excited to expand their channel with our channel and get the synergies of creativity This sounds like a pretty flimsy rationale for spending of its cash In our view this only accelerates the Companys demise We have also been hearing that there has been quite a bit of disruption and challenge integrating Pakedge Distributors have been questioning the compatibility of the two businesses This is relevant as part of CTRLs growth expectations is predicated on crossselling CTRL products at the incremental dealers with whom Pakedge does business It does not sound like there is any incentive for these dealers to suddenly start selling CTRL products and vice versa of CTRLs dealers Sonos Struggling Earlier this month the formerly rapidly growing wireless speaker producer Sonos announced it was layingoff staff and changing course as a result of the disruption Amazon created with its voiceresponse system Yet another data point showing the impact of the market shift on other hardware providers OpenSource Emergence of Universal Routers Home WiFi and Internet of Things IoT eliminated all the technology entry barriers that previously made install systems like Controls viable IoT refers to the ability to virtually connect to home and office devices that have embedded sensors Now most appliances are internetenabled smart TVs wireless speakers LED lights etc and have their own smart device applications These are free can be accessed from your phone or tablet and do not require clunky hardware installation or maintenance Additionally the latest CTRL platform is opensource on Android which eliminates the need for customers to buy a clunky CTRL touchscreen for k a product that accounted for of revenue per last disclosure Numerous hardware vendors now sell sub home routers Last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL released an Androiddriven home automation IoT platform Brillo and Weave IO agnostic communication system Part of this will include a home automation hub that will run through the home router Going a step further this technology eliminates the need for any controller and shows the direction of automation technology Control sells hardware that automates home appliances essentially a remote control for video music and lights The Company was founded in and initially positioned itself as one of the first producers of mainstream home automation hardware The k income households CTRL targeted were not addressed by the luxurypriced providers at the time For the next three to four years home automation remained a nascent market and Control was one of few selling hardware at the lowerend of the price spectrum below k per unit CTRLs hardware is sold through thirdparty distributors who also provide installation and ongoing service This is a major structural flaw in its business model Controls product costs k for the basic hardware but when you factor in programming and installations the cost increases massively to kk for one room k for a small to midsized house This is a bit of a hidden cost that typically does not get included in product price comparisons and industry reviews These upfront costs severely limit its potential customer base The Company does not generate any recurring revenue from subscriptions or licensing All revenue is from onetime hardware sales Controls product is sold through independent thirdparty distributors These distributors have historically been compelled to sell CTRLs hardware not based on the merits of the technology but because of the installation and ongoing maintenance revenue those distributors can generate As noted installation costs range from k to k depending upon the scope of the project Ongoing maintenance is also required any time the user wants to add an appliance or modify the configuration It is important to note CTRL does not receive any of this revenue A basic service visit from a technician costs This type of tail revenue is obviously exactly what a distributor loves and a customer hates as indicated by CTRLs poor customer reviews While this may not have been an impediment to sales a couple of years ago it debilitates CTRLs competitive position given the evergrowing number of alternatives including Amazons Echo which do not require expensive installation and ongoing service At per share CTRL has a M market capitalization FD shares and an EV of M M net cash adjusting for the Pakedge deal The Company reported M in revenue and M in adjusted net income in and Pakedge generated M in revenue and approximately M in net income CTRL has guided to revenue of MM with adjusted net income of MM This implies organic revenue growth yet CTRL only grew organic revenue in exLeaf acquisition and Pakedge was flat This also assumes a increase in adjusted net income off the M base This is insane given the aforementioned growth and margin headwinds Yet the current x proforma EVLTM net income multiple indicates the market is buying it At the end of the day Control has a severely impaired business model and the growth story that supports its multiple is imploding The increasingly bleak competitive picture is leading to negative revenue growth and declining margins The Company has negligible IP it can monetize One need only look at the failed sale of peer Wink to get a perspective on how little strategic interest there is for hub hardware manufacturers At a x EPS market multiple arguably generous given the business profile and prospects CTRL would trade lower Ultimately Control lacks any discernible strategic value thus the stock is not worth anything more than its net cash position of per share for a potential return The primary nearterm catalysts include revenue and margin erosion from recent price cuts and volume declines leading to performance falling well short of current lofty expectationsguidance increased competitive pressures from Amazon and others stock rerating as its fate becomes painfully apparent and potential share sales from Foundation Capital and Frazier Ventures Accounting Red Flags Other Considerations Low earnings quality In levered FCF was M vs adjusted net income of M Inventory has been consistently growing well ahead of revenue In Q inventory grew a staggering YY while revenue only grew Timing of the new product releases can only explain part of this inventory build The more likely scenario is orders have not been meeting anticipated demand and the Company will likely need to take some writedowns For six consecutive quarters AR has grown well ahead of revenue suggesting aggressive recognitionpulling forward of sales andor that CTRL is being forced to extend credit terms to its dealers The CEO CFO VP of Marketing VP of Business Development and VP of Product Development collectively own common shares It is also rather telling that Pakedge totally cashed out and did not take any stock in the deal Not favorable signals or incentives I wrote this
