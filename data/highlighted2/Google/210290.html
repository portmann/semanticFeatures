Yahoos net revenue fell in the third quarter missing Wall street targets and underscoring its continuing struggles to revitalize its business The company said that it cut spending in its workforce and facilities during Q and that it will narrow its strategy and product focus going forward Yahoos stock which has risen about percent over the past few weeks slipped in after hours trading on Tuesday As
