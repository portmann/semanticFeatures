#A9E2F3'>Google </span>IO was how different Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>are approaching mobile After years of fierce competition for smartphone market share the battle between the two companies has changed The biggest takeaway from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL IO was how different Apple NASDAQ AAPL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>are approaching mobile each guided by their own mission statement and strategy After years of fierce competition for smartphone market share the battle between the two companies has changed Googles ambitions include connecting the next billion users and obtaining scale across its suite of services which requires supporting an iPhone user base quickly moving towards million users Apples ambitions are aimed at making technology more personal and lessening its dependency on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>its primary competitor The next battle in mobile has begun and it may be just as fierce as the initial rounds The battle is moving beyond the smartphone and is now based on which platform is more successful in occupying a users time with the best experience Since the iPhone launch in the Apple vs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>battle has not remained constant instead going through distinct stages beginning with an armsrace for market share followed by an Android OEM consolidation phase led by Samsung OTCSSNLF and now the large screen iPhone renaissance ushering in the current phase where the battle is moving beyond the smartphone The early days of the smartphone war were all about market share The daily beat of the tech press was focused on which mobile operating system was doing better in terms of sales <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Andy Rubin especially prided themselves on periodically announcing Android daily activations One of the rare times Steve Jobs was on an Apple earnings conference call with analysts occurred in Q to put some cold water on Android activations news The mission was clear promote iOS as a platform worth developing apps for Here was Jobs Last week Eric Schmidt reiterated that they are activating Android devices per day And have around apps in their App Store For comparison Apple has activated around iOS devices per day on average for the past days with a peak of almost iOS devices per day on a few of those days And Apple has apps on its App Store Unfortunately there is no solid data on how many Android phones are shipped each quarter We hope that manufacturers will soon start reporting the number of Android handsets they ship each quarter But today that just isnt the case The battle was not only fought in the marketplace and press but also in the court room as Apple began setting up its patent litigation offense against various hardware companies using Android to compete with Apple Apples goal with litigation wasnt about the money but rather pride and to slow competitors down in the marketplace Market share was everything in the early days of the smartphone race The time frame was interesting for Apple as Samsung was able to make very strong inroads within the Android ecosystem capitalizing on the lack of a largescreen iPhone in the highend of the market and lack of proper competition in the lowend While there was never much in the way of widespread defections of iOS users fleeing to Samsung the ability for one hardware manufacturer with such immense distribution network to grab so much power within the Android ecosystem was alarming to Apple The battle was aired on TV in the form of a very successful line of Samsung commercials mocking Apple customers not to mention continued battles in the courtroom As evidence of how seriously Apple took the Samsung threat in Phil Schiller tried to preempt Samsungs big Galaxy S keynote in NYC by talking with the WSJ the day prior in order to discredit Android and provide some counter balance to the overwhelmingly positive press coverage given to Samsung Schiller went on to say Android is often given as a free replacement for a feature phone and the experience isnt as good as an iPhoneWhen you take an Android device out of the box you have to sign up to nine accounts with different vendors to get the experience iOS comes with It is important to note how Apple positioned Samsung as merely the preferred hardware competitor at the moment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>not Samsung was the ultimate longterm threat as Apple saw that Samsung was gaining market share purely on the back of Android Without Android Samsung phones would not be viable competition for the iPhone Apple now finds itself with an iPhone user base approaching million users and strong market positions in key geographic territories including the US sales share UK share and China share Any concerns related to iOS being crowded out by Android OEMs in a repeat of the Windows era have likely been put to bed Apples iOS platform now has critical mass or the ability to entice developers and thirdparties including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Facebook and Twitter to support iOS users One of the clearest themes from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>IO was that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>needs iOS and its million highlyengaged iPhone users for Googles business model to succeed Looking ahead a few years and assuming continued iPhone unit sales growth it will be nearly impossible for a thirdparty with a business model dependent on achieving scale to ignore what has the potential to be a million user ecosystem if not larger While one can make an argument that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>made a strategic misstep by limiting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Maps on iOS a few years ago which ended up pushing Apple into developing its own maps initiative hindsight is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>may have thought it was worth taking the bet at that time as iOS was a very different and weaker platform in than today The Apple vs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>battle has now moved beyond the smartphone Walk into a carrier store and given the choice between an iPhone or Androidpowered smartphone the two most likely options Googles services will be found on each In addition the prices between an iPhone and highend Androidpowered phone will be roughly the same While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>may be excelling at machine learningbased cloud initiatives it is not being positioned as a factor for buying an Android phone instead of an iPhone Given the limited distribution behind Nexus devices it is difficult to have much confidence in that line of Android hardware representing a viable alternative for most consumers Instead the smartphone buying decision is likely related more to the other pieces of glass either being worn smartwatches in ones purse or backpack tablets or at home and on the work desk desktopslaptops Extend the exercise further to incorporate thirdparty devices in the home and driveway and the entire iOS or Android ecosystem is becoming the much bigger deciding factor for what will be your next smartphone Apple wants to be at the intersection of technology and liberal arts Producing personalized technology experiences will require Apple to maintain control over the variables that come together to create experiences for the user A key component will be owning critical technologies and services that may otherwise rely or require scale in future initiatives A prime example would be avoiding the debacle over maps where functionality was limited by a thirdparty In the future mapping will likely be a required core competency for personal transport ambitions If iOS represents a minority share of the automobile market such a market position may pose a competitive risk in terms of relying on thirdpartners for map data The same thinking applies to Apple controlling the experience for providing content like movies and music to consumers Notice how Apple doesnt need to own or produce the content in order to accomplish its goal Instead being the broker between the content owner and the consumer provides Apple room to add something new to the experience Apple could then extend this experience to Android to further entice people to make the switch to iOS as is planned with Apple Music Another way Apple can maintain its consumer experience is to embrace the emotion and feeling found with luxury As seen with the Apple Watch relying on materials and looks as the primary differentiation between a and device produces certain emotions that would be hard to match on Android or a competing platform where the virtues of luxury dont exist Googles ambition for its cloudbased services is increasingly competing more with Facebook than Apple as Googles business model is based on solving technological problems by accessing the worlds data <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>wants all smartphone users to use its products regardless if on Android or iOS Similarly Facebook is after the same data Just like how Facebook unbundled its core app into a suite of apps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>seems to be following a similar path transforming into a suite of services and apps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>wants to be at the intersection of technology and computer science Judging by its engineering talent I dont think anyone doubts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>will continue to push the envelope with such initiatives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>IO made it clear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>needs Apple and iOS To ignore such a vibrant base of highlyengaged users especially when other companies like Facebook enjoy a prominent place in the platform would be highly destructive to Googles ambitions On the other hand Apple also needs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>as its services remain very popular among iOS users However judging from Apples prior actions and mission statement to personalize technology I would expect Apple will continue to try to minimize its dependence on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>as such a situation represents a longterm threat to Apples mission Similar to how the Nexus experience provides the closest thing to pure Android I suspect Apple wants to continue down the path of being in a position to ship an iPhone and suite of apps and services that make it possible to live within the Apple ecosystem without much interference from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>While most consumers will end up settling somewhere in the middle using both Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>products and services it is this quest to control the entire user experience that ultimately validates the competition between Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>as genuine The probability of a world where Android excels as a direct result of iOS faltering is becoming more remote as time goes on Instead <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is becoming more reliant on a healthy iOS platform which improves the chances of iOS continuing to grow and gain additional power Meanwhile the Android platform continues to become splintered and less effective at Googles mission of positioning services in such a way as to reach scale The primary question is now focused on how successful Apple will be in loosening its dependency on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>services There are signs that we may see a more aggressive stance from Apple towards replacing many <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>services with homegrown alternatives This motivation will likely come to represent the driving factor for the continued battle between the two companies While we may see skirmishes from time to time over individual features and services the much bigger battle is clear Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>are built on a fundamentally different view of the world and each will now fight to occupy a users time with the best experience The battle has moved beyond the smartphone Source The Apple Vs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Battle Has
