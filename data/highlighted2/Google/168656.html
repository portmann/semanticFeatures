capabilities are still unknown A PC class SoC inside a smartphone together with Windows Continuity could be disruptive for the market The main problem that impacts Intel NASDAQ INTC is the low mobile market penetration Its true that in the tablet sector it achieved some penetration but it is clearly not enough Skylake is an architecture meant to be used in a very wide power consumption and heat production range TDP from W to W The SkylakeY series is the most power efficient and powerless version called Core M The new Core M series is provided with configurable TDPs TDP down of W normal TDP of W and TDP up of W The previous Core M series version BroadwellY was able to provide performances not far away from ultralaptop CPUs of the BroadwellU series TDP W In fact Core M has been used in tablets and in devices thanks to the low power consumption We must say that these SoCs strongly throttle under heavy load This happens to Samsung Exynos in Galaxy S to Apple A in iPhone or to Intel Core iii of the U class this happens because a small chassis cannot dissipate all the generated heat due to excessive workload or environmental conditions Preliminary benchmarks have shown that the fastest SkylakeY Core M Y TDP W provides a raw peak performance similar to the fastest BroadwellU Core i U TDP W in benchmarks like Geekbench This achievement is quite remarkable since the Intel Y series has only onethird of the U series TDP Obviously the BroadwellU i runs at higher clocks for much more time thanks to the higher TDP that is designed to permit higher power consumption on the long term Anyway this achievement makes me think good of the progresses Intel is bringing on If we compare the same SkylakeY Core M with the new Atom X we find out that Core M is roughly X faster than Atom X which powers Microsoft Surface We dont even consider Core M iGPU which is a class beyond X iGPU Surface is powerful enough to flawlessly do light office work and with Windows things will get even better Atom X has a lower SDP about W which is the equivalent of a TDP between W The point is that if X gives suitable power to do light office work things get incredibly interesting with Core M which is a PC class CPU If preliminary benchmarks are correct the Core M series will become suitable for office work and entertainment providing the right performances for a low amount of battery drain This is only the natural evolution of the previous Core M designed for those purposes The interesting part comes with smartphones a sector which was believed to be out of target At the beginning of this month news here and here said that Intel is testing SkylakeY Core M on smartphone platforms They stated also that this chance is compelling but there are still problems that Intel will have to face even if its only a matter of time I personally think that if Intel will be able to fit a Core M a PC class SoC inside a smartphone it could be a disruptive move A Core M has a typical TDP of W that is good for tablets but way too high for smartphones Core M has a down TDP of W which is still too high even if its not too far away from a typical phablet TDP of W smartphones with inches or less tend to have a TDP of W or less These Core M have even a SDP Scenario Design Power of W which is simply a settable TDP for highly thermal constrained devices This SDP is at the limit but it would be OK for some preliminary tests It must be underlined that the Core M SoC lacks of GNSS cellular WLAN and PAN modules that increase power consumption and heat generation These components must be added on the motherboard making it more complex and expensive and theoretically less efficient A specific feature of the SDP behavior is if in that moment the temperature and generated heat are low the SoC can achieve a performance equivalent to the TDP being W W or W for a relative amount of time This means that in a smartphone like scenario where demanding tasks are quite short not gaming performances will be very high This happens because the lower the temperature at the same performance threshold the lower the power drain is By the way W of generated heat would be suitable for a phablet with around a inch screen not for a smartphone around inches or less because throttling would be too high Intel is likely to modify Core M with a TDP settable from W to W and a SDP of W What about performances Right now a Core M Y with a down TDP of W gives of raw peak performance of the W TDP version Performances are likely to be around giving around points in Geekbench Multithreading benchmark when SDP is enabled A notice about benchmarks synthetic benchmarks are not reliable because they do not provide real world usage Only those benchmarks based on real programs present on multiple platforms may be reliable If you take a list of games and you test them with the same settings over various platforms then you are doing a good benchmark If you take a big photo in Photoshop and you consider the application time of a filter that is a good benchmark If you take a commercial rendering program and you control time elapsed during the same rendering that is a good benchmark If you take a synthetic benchmark instead you will test only raw power between completely different architectures and OSs This does not mean a lot because there are too many variables OSs Compilers calculus which are only a part of real world case scenario that do not correspond to real world scenarios In any case such a result would be good enough to just have an idea The real problem is the idle consumption which is practically unknown Windows was not built like Windows Mobile so the idle behavior cannot be compared to ARM smartphones powered by Windows Mobile In any case Core M is likely to be suitable for high performance phablets and smartphones in the next months Microsoft Corporation NASDAQ MSFT Windows will be a key point in all of this A smartphone powered by a PC class SoC and Windows would be exactly like having a low power PC inside your pocket Windows features Continuity when you connect your smartphone to an external display and keyboardmouse the interface will switch to the classical desktop view with the chance to run virtually every classical windows application This implies a high grade of productivity quite unthinkable before Motorola and Asus experiments were not successful It will be possible to switch between various apps notes and calculations and when you are at home or in the office you will be able to use it like a normal PC raising up productivity Its possible that professional applications will have a sort of module that works exactly like a mobile app with the advantage of being a fully integrated part of the classical windows application In addition Windows is able to adapt itself to keep very low power consumption on low power and mobile devices This means that Windows is able to consume very low energy exactly like actual smartphones once its equipped with optimized hardware When this will be possible with Core M is only a matter of time Real Sense is a technology mature enough to get into market Skylake is the first CPU that will support this technology and it could be a game changer With Intel Real Sense its possible to make Windows login and payments by face recognition use hand movements as a flexible input device do D scans of the environment and so on Intel Real Sense is so precise that it can recognize and make a distinction between twins without error and its a Skylake exclusive feature at the moment The new Vulkan APIs and DirectX will permit decreased power consumption by lowering the header crowd on the CPU This means in simple terms that the load on the CPU is better designed until the point that the GPU will work better and flawlessly resulting in overall reduced power consumption Looking at preliminary benchmarks it looks like Vulkan and DirectX will permit a power optimization that previous reviews could not achieve at all Its clear that Windows and Intel are going toward a mobile world where smartphones will become portable PCs able to do light work and entertainment So in devices ultrabooks and laptops will be able to powe rup instead when connected to external GPUsstations through Thunderbolt Its also likely that Apple Inc NASDAQ AAPL will follow Microsoft even here after it has taken inspiration from the Surface Pro series to release the new iPad Pro which still uses a pure mobile OS and not OSx which gives lower productivity In the worldwide market saw billion shipped smartphones and million shipped tablets Intel retains the second position in tablet SoC market share but its known that it achieved this by cash subsidies that generated losses for Intel itself As for smartphone market share Intels presence is dramatically low What can do Core M in such a scenario In my opinion it will be able to attack the high end segment the most profitable one Core M will provide such a computational power and operative system flexibility not comparable to any other competitors phablet In this scenario Samsung is even losing market share first of all in the highend segment This Android market share loss would find the flexibility of Windows as a better and more suitable option to iOS In addition more than onethird of shipped smartphones were phablets in Q which predicts a phablet market over Mplus in with an increasing trend for the next few years If you take into account that high end smartphone share is around of the global market you will understand that Intel and Microsoft could generate massive revenues from this achieve a global market share made of high end devices achieve a net income of per device which is the actual Samsung net income per device that includes even mid and low end smartphones its a quite low profitability for high end market Microsoft would be able to achieve million highend devices billion in revenue and billion net income This would imply a probable market evaluation of at least given the implied better outlook of the mobile market penetration To add fuel to this selling those devices would imply an increase in related service and software sales for additional revenues and profits All of this is possible because the Android platform continues to lack continuity between smartphone tablets laptops and desktop devices Android cannot provide a message center into Windows and a lot of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>features must go through Chrome and not through a native installation into Windows itself Android users generally use Windows as the main laptop and desktop OS so Microsoft may have the right points to attract the Android user base pushing on Continuity Keep in mind that of net income for highend devices alone would be quite low In fact Intel is likely to provide more constrained Core M and Atom X and future revisions like Goldmont for those smaller smartphones andor midhigh smartphones giving enough power to exploit Continuity very well This would imply higher sales and additional profits while of profit per device would be more suitable for such a sales mix Intels scenario is somewhat similar Intel has closed with heavy losses in mobile market and its set to achieve profitability in It has achieved relative good sales in the smartphone market only thanks to the Zenphone release If Microsoft will be able to penetrate the high end market Intel could increase the SoC sales about million remembering that Core M gives a lot higher profit than Atom Somebody could argue that Atom X SoCs still have low power GPUs which cannot compete against highend competitors SoCs This is true only for now Intel has a delay in implementing its generation of PC CPU features into the Atom series Innovations released with Ivy Bridge in Q took seven quarters to be implemented into Atom Bay Trail Silvermont in Q while innovations released with Broadwell in Q took only two quarters to be implemented into Atom Cherry Trail Airmont in Q This is partially caused by the fact that Intel was already concentrating on Goldmont which will be released the next year and so they decided to spend less time on tweaking the latest Atom chip In addition the actual Atom is equipped with an Intel Gen HD Graphics which is still oneyearold All of this delay will be depleted the next year with Goldmont architecture which will implement Skylakerefresh Kaby Lake features and an Intel Gen HD Graphics revision the probable same one on Kaby Lake That will be the moment which will show the first and really competitive Intel offer for the entire smartphone sector For a better understanding think about what Intel managed to achieve with BroadwellK series and SkylakeK series With Broadwell i C Inte Gen HD Graphics EUs eDRAM CPU Intel has achieved in getting graphic performance equal to an ATI R X with of power consumption With Skylake i K Intel Gen HD Graphics EUs is able to get very close to i C even if it has half of EUs and no eDRAM Its clear that the next year will be very interesting for Intel in the mobile market That is why Intel must penetrate the highend market because once Intel is wellestablished in that sector it will be able to exploit its name to make Atom Broxton Goldmont more compelling the next year once you get the high end market it becomes easier to penetrate lower markets I would not be surprised if Intel will be able to push its own smartphone market share around in the next two years given the scenario This would mean around million of SoCs based on IDC estimates The same goes for the tablet sector which starts from a better starting point Intel has already achieved a market share in Given its Core M series which is becoming well known and powerful and given the upcoming Surface Pro I wouldnt be surprised to see Intel gaining a market share around in the next two years especially with Windows spreading around This would mean millionplus SoCs based on IDC estimates Remember IDC estimates that Windows tablets will face a fiveyear CAGR of which is quite undervalued given Windows success until now In this scenario adding million SoCs would not be a problem Since these two companies are tightly bounded in mobile market if Windows will continue to spread like it is doing now and if Intel will be able to release Core M at a lower TDP their outlook is really good So I think that an upside of in three years is quite possible and feasible Microsoft has registered million Windows activations in the enterprise sector Continuity will push hard for the creation of a flawless Windows ecosystem Microsoft Windows activations look good million right now Intel continues to improve its own processors scalability Intel has the highest world knowhow in lithography Intel will align Atom development levels to PC Core series the next year Microsoft is bringing on universal apps Microsoft and Intel analysts forecasts do not take into account the IntelMicrosoft synergy in the smartphone sector Intel has high chances to see its revenues dramatically increase in the next years most of all in the mobile sector providing a great help to Microsofts Lumia smartphones too This argument could be reverted because at the same time it will be Microsoft which will help Intel by spreading Windows Given that for Intel and Microsoft the biggest problem is the smartphone sector the high chance of a possible dramatic market share increase of Windows in relation to Intel makes these two companies a good
