New Growth Factor For Facebook Facebook NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Facebooks Shop and Service features can redefine ecommerce Many SMBs will have no need for standalone websites or apps anymore The ability to make money directly from their Facebook Pages means companies will have an incentive to spend more on Facebook ads and drive more traffic to Facebook There is no added value in going into detail about Facebooks NASDAQ FB wellknown strengths An unprecedented scale growing revenue a seamless transition to mobile and a solid balance sheet its all been the subject of extensive analysis which has contributed to the thoroughly justified confidence investors have shown in the company To the aforementioned factors one might also add the untapped monetization potential of Whatsapp and Instagram Facebook is introducing two new features targeted at businesses Shopping and Services According to the company The new Shop section helps retail businesses bring their products to the forefront of their Page while the new Services section enables professional services businesses to showcase a list of their offerings at the top of their Page In the Shop sections users will be able to make purchases directly via Buy buttons provided by Facebooks partner Shopify NYSE SHOP Its hard to overstate the potential that this move generates With more than million active businesses on Facebook it can redefine the ecommerce landscape in a very short period of time There will be essentially no need for many SMBs to even build a website anymore let alone something more expensive like an app Negotiations prior to a purchase are facilitated with the Message To Buy button which will get potential customers in direct contact with the business in case they want to discuss details Furthermore customer service will be more efficient than ever since page admins will have the option of replying via a private message to comments or wall posts on their pages and the Saved Replies feature will save time by allowing them to compose a template for frequently sent answers There are two main instantly discernible ways in which Facebook will benefit from these features First increased traffic Businesses were already advertising their Facebook pages a lot but now they will have a major incentive to do so significantly more As I already mentioned for many types of SMBs there will soon be no point in even having a standalone website and therefore their Facebook pages will be their goto online location Second increased ad revenue Facebooks ad business is already in great shape and constantly improving with advertising revenue growing rapidly Q ad revenue was million up from million in Q Imagine how much more advertisers are going to be willing to spend when they will be able to directly make money from users landing on their Facebook pages A big part of SMB business strategy is centered on web presence if not fully defined by it It is hence no surprise that companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN are vying for the attention of the numerous small players and local services markets worldwide Facebook however possesses the advantage of being in a position to directly link costumers to companies in a way no one else can Sure a user can click on a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>ad and land on a companys web page but this is a oneoff occurrence On Facebook if you like a companys page that company will have everyday access to your timeline and therefore countless opportunities to attract your attention As web usage shifts to mobile there is little doubt that Facebook is where companies will want to have a strong presence According to COO Sheryl Sandberg more than one in five minutes spent on mobile phones is done on Facebook or Instagram Facebook says that approximately percent of its US users already like at least one SMB page so one can only imagine what will happen if firms take a big part of their sales operations to the social network In conclusion Facebooks new shopping and services features have the potential to massively leverage its existing scale when it comes to business presence and can be expected to have a strong positive impact on traffic and revenue Disclosure Iwe have no positions in
