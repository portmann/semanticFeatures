Seeking Alpha ReCode is reporting that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Twitter will launch a JV to compete with Facebooks Instant Articles product This JV is an admission of Facebooks dominance in the content and content marketing space as well as the growing problem Facebook is presenting Publishers will have a secondary Instant Articlelike product with which to publish should they so choose to pull away from the content juggernaut that is Facebook ReCode is reporting that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Twitter NYSE TWTR are working together on a joint venture that would compete with Facebooks NASDAQ FB Instant Articles While both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Twitter have declined to comment ReCode has broken stories in advance of official commentary before and I believe this lead to be credible That said this is a meaningful development in the content universe and one that could have far reaching implications based on the size and capacity of the joint venture participants Lets break it down First this is an acknowledgement that Facebook is the biggest individual threat to both Twitter and Googles business models Maybe not right now maybe not asis but this is an acknowledgement that a threat Facebooks growing ever more allinclusive platform is growing stronger and if nothing is done about it that threat could become too strong to unseat The fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Twitter are the companies doing the acknowledging is powerful Dont understate what this means symbolically and what this means literally This is indicative of the tectonic shift in content marketing taking place one that sees Facebook emerging stronger and stronger If you havent yet you should take notice of this shift as the formerly broken up content marketing land masses are seemingly coming together in a Pangea which Facebook will have majority ownership over Both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Twitter Twitter especially with Facebook recently entering the realtime market are trying to combat Facebooks growing ownership of the contentcontent marketing space Facebook as alluded to above now has a competitive if not leading presence across the entire content ecosystem Very recently Facebooks announcement of Instant Articles was the latest shot fired in the arms race to aggregate the most content or in the race to refer users to the most content Both are platform valueprop drivers illustrators and visibility enhancers that will not be taken back easily once acquired Regarding Facebooks acquisition of both according to traffic analytics firm Parsely Facebook is now the leading traffic source for news sites passing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Dont think this isnt something that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has taken notice of I can assure it has That said in an effort to slow the growing juggernaut and to give a second option to the current Instant Article monopoly that Facebook owns yes Apple NASDAQ AAPL has a similar service but it isnt expected to aggregate like Facebook <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Twitter will look to deploy an open source publishing tech that will offer an Instant Articlelike service to those willing to take it Even better for publishers neither <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>nor Twitter will look to host the content a big difference between the open source project and Instant Articles at Facebook Why does this matter A few reasons First the GoogleTwitter option which hasnt been branded yet wont alter the ad structure of the Instant Articlelike display This means the original ads slated for display on the article being shown remain untouched as intended That matters to the content creator Second this gives publishers a way to begin to fragment a growing dependence on Facebookhosted content Becoming essentially indentured by Facebook is scary for publishers to say the least in that this obviously reduces negotiating power to zero Publishers are currently fighting the should I or shouldnt I question when it comes to leaning even further into their already most important platform Facebook hasnt turned on the publishers yet and theres no indication it would use its powers for evil but it more than stands to reason that it could considering its reach and importance ReCode is reporting that the GoogleTwitter JV is launching with a small contingent of early adopters in the fall so well have to wait and see exactly what this Instant Articlelike service will look like and how it will be received before making final judgments One thing is for sure though this JV could be the beginning of a long line of JVs between these two shared interest parties Twitter does a few things that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>doesnt and clearly that statement is true in reverse I think that the model layover potential between the two which has been speculated on at exhaustive length in the now tired GoogleTwitter MA speculation of past could yield some really really interesting spinoffs if this product launch goes well It might prepare the tar and feathers even lead to an eventual MA opportunity In any case this
