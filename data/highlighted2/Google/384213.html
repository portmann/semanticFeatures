transitioning into an app platform and will now be competing with the likes of Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Live streaming has the potential to revolutionize video further biting into the already unprofitable YouTube Facebook NASDAQ FB recently had its F conference where Mark Zuckerberg unveiled his year plan The main developments that I took away from it were as follows Messenger as an app platform Facebook Video and live streaming and the Oculus Rift The Messenger app is one of shiniest gems in Facebooks crown with over million users Combined with WhatsApps billion users over billion messages go through Facebooks servers each day for free For comparison SMS usage peaked at billion per day The difference is that you would pay for each SMS or pay a monthly fee to your mobile network for the use of their equipment Messenger and WhatsApp are as yet largely unmonetized This is going to change in the coming months Mark has announced that the Messenger app will now be open to developers for much more than unwrappable Valentines Day messages As of December Uber Private UBER has already utilized this You can order a taxi through Messenger without having to leave the comfort of Facebook As a society we seek the easiest option Steve Jobs recognized this and all of his iProducts are so oh so easy to use After all why make things more complicated than they need to be We now have a myriad of apps to cater to our every need From searching for a concert buying tickets to booking a holiday it can all be done on your phone Mark Zuckerberg is taking this one step further Why should you have to leave Facebook when you see something you want to buy Wouldnt it better if you could see the concert you wanted to go to and buy the tickets through Facebook Your bank details securely stored and never having to be entered again Apparently the answer is yes Amazons NASDAQ AMZN one click buy wasnt created because people like complication Apples NASDAQ AAPL customers spent over billion on apps last year with around half that amount being additionally spent in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Play Store These are some serious numbers and if Facebook can cut out apps as the middleman between advert and purchase this could potentially add huge value to the Messenger app Technology Product Ecosystem This is the analogy which Mark used to categorize the vast network of things owned by Facebook A technology is used to create a product that evolves into an ecosystem Facebook Video is at the product stage It is young and unevolved compared to its rival YouTube but is evolving into an ecosystem within Facebook It reminds me of YouTube in its early days There is rampant copyright infringement and no way to make a claim against someone uploading your content thus gaining likes and followers at your expense Ryan Higa a prominent YouTube video maker with over million subscribers th highest in the world posted I guess this is his video now in response to one of his videos that he had made at a cost with his production team being uploaded on someone elses Facebook page and going viral getting many millions of views More in fact than it got on Ryans own YouTube and Facebook pages The uploader of course gave no credit to him Facebook needs to implement copyright guidelines and a strike system in a similar way that YouTube has done if it is to be taken seriously by content creators who put a lot of time and money into their content At the moment content creators use Facebook to promote themselves but link back to YouTube where they can gain advertising revenue from video views This leads me on to my second point advertising revenue YouTube took in a staggering billion last year from advertising of this was given to the video creators That gives a big incentive for Facebook to create a partner program similar to YouTube so it can monetize its videos This would also encourage content creators to use Facebook as their primary website providing more content to keep people on the site for even longer Aside from the lack of advertising there is one major flaw I see in Facebook Video No negative ratings are possible on videos While it is fair to say people could abuse a dislike feature on someones pictures and statuses to bully them having a positive and negative feedback on content created for entertainment purposes is important Clicking on a video only to have seconds of your life wasted is a terrible first world problem If Facebook were to introduce a range of positive and negative emoticons when you reacted to a video a rating could be produced so the user could better be warned about what they are about to watch A clock emoticon to insinuate My time has been wasted along with a dislike would be welcome additions Facebook Live is essentially a natural extension of the status feature While you can currently update your status to tell the world what you are doing or feeling wouldnt it be better to stream it live so that your friends and family can share the moment with you If Facebook Live had a slogan it would be Nothing is sacred Facebook is paying celebrities to livestream their personal lives in an effort to promote this service It may seem alien at the moment but where celebrities go the masses will eventually follow People watching live videos and then broadcasting their own will keep people entertained for longer making the site even stickier Video has a long way to go before it catches up with YouTube It has already become a major headache for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>however as Facebook video views are already rivaling YouTubes It has the potential to become so much greater however YouTube has historically struggled to grow its audience past people in their teens and early s while Facebook has people of all ages already signed up and ready to be entertained With the Messenger platform coming into action and taking revenue from the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play app store Facebook will be nibbling into two of GOOGs pies Some investors are putting a lot of stock in the future success of the Oculus Rift I however do not hold this opinion Sonys NYSE SNE VR headset and the Vive by Valve have a true purpose gaming Sonys PlayStation is the leading console and it has the experience and huge developer backing to make the Sony VR a success The Vive has the huge Steam the largest PC gaming digital distribution platform developer and gamer community to support it Facebook has none of these advantages When it comes to new competing technologies there will be a winner and a loser VHS beat Betamax Blueray won over HD DVD iPods crushed the MP player market While the Oculus Rift is not a direct competitor to the Sony VR as they have somewhat different target audiences I feel it will not become one of top headsets when it comes to sales It has a price point which is more than the Sony VR and you have to have a highend computer to use it Angry Birds Farmville Clash of Clans all these big names in casual gaming have a few things in common They all have a low or free initial purchase price and use micro transactions to generate the bulk of their revenue I personally dont see these same people paying a premium for a casual gaming experience The Samsung OTCSSNLF Gear VR a cheaper VR headset powered by Oculus technology retailing at about that plugs into your phone may get a large amount of initial sales but when the gimmick wears off the revenue will quickly dry up The first Wii console sold over million units However people realised that you use it for a while and then it gathers dust the gimmick wears off The second Wii console that was released three years ago has sold only m units By comparison PlayStation has sold m and Xbox One has sold m So while Facebooks venture into VR will undoubtedly provide innovation and competition to the VR market I think it will add very little to FBs bottom line With all this in mind I would recommend buying into Facebook Of the four FANGs Facebook is the one that has the most bite Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in FB over the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article
