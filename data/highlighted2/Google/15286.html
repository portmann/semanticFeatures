class='textDiv'>Facebook Sells Ads Its Not Disruptive In Payments Or ECommerce Facebook NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Facebooks efforts to monetize its messenger wont come from transaction costs against cash transfers This will likely be the case for the foreseeable fiveyear future Instead Facebook is trying to build engagement and trust with users so users feel comfortable with transacting directly on Facebook This effort will take a while to scale perhaps five to ten years as costsperimpressions are trending higher negating the effectiveness of directcommerce via the timeline Whats more likely to drive growth in the messenger business is the involvement of thirdparty developers as they will create new revenue models When looking at Facebooks NASDAQ FB recent efforts with the messenger platform one could easily assume that Facebook will quickly capitalize on the payment transfer business by merely luring in users to use the service and then charge for the service thus earning a sizable chunk of the profit in the global payment services industry Sometimes its better to leave free things free especially when everyone else is offering to do the same exact service for zero dollars I use PayPal NASDAQ EBAY to transfer money to friends already The only differentiator is that Facebook is able to transfer directly from one bank to the next Banks already offer this service via an ACH transfer and again the theme repeats itself ACH transfers are completely free The alternative is to wire money over to a friend in case of emergencies but I often find that a PayPal transfer is even quicker as I have transferred funds to another PayPal account in roughly two to three minutes Thats much quicker than a Wire transfer and ACH deposit so I have a hard time imagining how the messenger business will grow gangbusters Also Facebook is targeting PP transactions ie peer to peer The downside to this model is that the transaction volume isnt likely to be all that meaningful as debit cards have a variety of uses of which very little is directed towards peertopeer transactions So the market opportunity is actually constricted to more of a narrow niche When looking at the above diagram mobile payments are not used in the vast majority of cases for any type of transaction Therefore a Facebook enabled ecommerce platform is so improbable of succeeding in terms of revenue I dont see why people speculate on the monetization potential when in reality most people make large scale transactions directly with the vendor via a debit or credit card and smaller transactions via cash So if I were to lend my friend money chances are Id give them cash not a PayPal transfer even though Ive went the PayPal route before Also Facebook doesnt have a way of skimming added value off the top of each transaction without blasting users with fees so its a free service competing with a network of other free services When theres no flexibility to move pricing along a curve to compete on the basis of price its hard to be competitive Just look at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG search whos going to succeed at the search business by charging consumers to use their search engine The answer is zero Bing NASDAQ MSFT doesnt charge and neither does Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO and yet theyre still in second and third place At this point success should be measured by monthly active usage of the service rather than the amount of revenue that it generates For Facebook creating a platform thats perceived to be safe is a much bigger priority than it is to earn revenue from payment services Currently users are skeptical of mobile wallet and phone application based transactions When looking at the data most rely upon cash credit card and debit cards to make a transaction The more direct the transaction with limited likelihood of fraud or loss of data the better at least according to the survey data presented by Walker Sands Also consumers really like to transact via retail channels they have already had a positive experience with So companies like eBay Amazon NASDAQ AMZN WalMart NYSE WMT Target NYSE TGT are uniquely positioned as theyre able to provide users with secure transactions and lower pricing According to the Walker Sands report four out of ten consumers were willing to buy via established ecommerce platforms of which Facebook isnt included because theyre not a real BC ecommerce platform but more an intermediary thats attempting to compete with eBay and Amazons rd party seller program The opportunity to simply capitalize on every available opportunity based on the large installed base of users is becoming an argument thats both redundant and misleading as Facebooks value to advertisers comes primarily from the volume of prospective customers theyre able to generate via native ad units along the timeline Various adagencies will compete aggressively for ad inventory and will attempt to maximize the value for both lower cost and higher cost ad units This implies that the cost of advertising will likely trend higher which will make it even more difficult for directcommerce transactions to flourish alongside ads that are intended for brand awareness or conversions for services that cannot be transacted via a payment portal on Facebooks website Also the lack of scale is another concern that Facebook has yet to address At the present moment Facebook doesnt have hundreds of millions in debit and credit card account information basically the total opposite of where Apple NASDAQ AAPL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>are in terms of account information for their respective app ecosystems Its simply easier to make transactions via the app store I have the perceived notion of security when using a biometric reader to unlock the buy button Also various fraud prevention departments at my bank closely monitor every transaction that I make especially on mobile This sense of security isnt going to be felt on a social network at least not for quite a while There may be a method to monetize the messenger without damaging the user experience I anticipate that interaction with thirdparty developers could lead to creative developments that lead to a much better revenue model than charging fees for payment transfer services Now Facebook is doing the same on mobile with the Messenger platform Its extending what counts as family by inviting over developers to build companion apps for creating and discovering content to be shared through Messenger This time around developers get help with discovery and virality and again Facebook gets to soak up all the engagement they lure in Messenger usage translates to platform lockin driving views of Facebooks News Feed where it shows ads Also I anticipate the ARPU figure to continue to trend higher due to the addition of new services and the broadening of ad inventory to other uses like videobased ads Video ads have way higher CPMs and the addition of adinventory from related applications will increase the amount of revenue thats generated on overlapping users across Facebooks network of applications Furthermore there are promising developments in tech like virtual reality and augmented reality that could extend the growth phase for a couple additional decades Sure I might be arguing about future technology but wouldnt you imagine the most important aspect of being a tech investor is the ability to capitalize on future tech before its ever monetized Well in that case Facebook still has a couple other areas in which growth can be exploited Also the company has a pretty consistent track record of growing sales and earnings while having the right mentality towards innovation and accretive acquisitions Therefore I continue to reiterate my high conviction buy rating However my expectations on paymentbased revenue is low as I dont anticipate Facebook to earn any revenue from mobilebased payments for the foreseeable decade But to be more blunt its entirely plausible that Facebook never generates any revenue from payment transfers between users on the social network Source
