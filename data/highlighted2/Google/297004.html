opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Apple App Store customers opt for other Apple devices based on apps already purchased The gap between Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>downloads is widening not shrinking Apps revenue to ultimately drive more sales of Apple computer products was a bumper year for both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Apple NASDAQ AAPL but for very different reasons The year saw <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>smash Apple in the download stakes hitting double the numbers Apple did Thats seriously impressive What isnt so impressive is that despite all those additional downloads and the attached overhead Apple pulled away in trackable revenue The market is missing an important part of Apples potential when forecasting future stock value how integral App Store sales are to Apples overall offering This area of sales alone is central to the business cultivating an evergreen ecosystem of customer loyalty where iPhone iPad computer or app purchases influence future purchases Click to enlargeSource App Annie Retrospective China has catapulted to the third spot in iOS revenue territories and demonstrated growth in revenue yearonyear The forecast is for China sales to surpass those in Japan and hit second spot during A key aspect of the report for me is the trend in developed markets for Apple In the US Apple saw downloads drop but revenues rose by This allows us to draw a picture of consumers who are more selective in what they download but are also far more willing to pay for quality when they find it Further to this is the rise of subscription services Music video TV dating and more show us that people are willing to make longterm commitments to brands they like What is interesting about this trend is it creates even more lockin to the platform and ecosystem Seeing the growth in music subscriptions above we can only deduce that Music Industry is in full swing and music purchases are going to disappear entirely in the future Its key to note that this figure does not include the M paid subscribers Apple already has for its Apple Music service as Apples own apps are not tracked in App Annie The wearable market definitely came into its own last year especially for Apple The number of apps on the App Store grew from in April to over in December The stats are a bit thin in this report but its interesting that they are starting to emerge and we expect to see this market really starting to consolidate and grow in Apple generated billion from its AppleCare Apple Pay and Internet Services in FY This covers the iTunes Store App Stores iBooks Store and Apple Music So nearly the same total revenue of billion the company generated in FY This is quite remarkable especially when you compare it to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play which has far greater reach and far lower revenue according to all industry pundits source Variety TechCrunch <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is obviously coming along for the ride but seems to be struggling to monetize the market in the same way Apple has If you factor in the growth shown in the report for App Store revenue and consider the M subscribers new to Apple Music were more than likely looking at a division of Apple that has surpassed the entire Apple business of within eight years of it being born Apples evergreen ecosystem of products apps services and distribution is great news for investors What the App Annie report has shown is just how central App Store sales are to this model Consumers prefer to purchase apps through the App Store and it follows that they will prefer to buy more devices compatible with those apps iPhone users looking for a tablet for instance are more likely to opt for an iPad because all their apps will be available without further purchase Follow this up the food chain and those same users are therefore more likely to buy an Apple computer eventually for the same halo effect We believe this ecosystem approach to be fundamental to both Apple and Googles future growth but we think the effect will be far more pronounced on Apples longterm revenue and profitability than everyone is giving it credit for Were still forecasting growth at the bottom line for Apple despite the negative press that it is receiving around iPhone sales We believe investors are going to see a drive in sales through three avenues of growth More software sales and subscription revenue More hardware sales as a result of the ecosystem halo effect Revenue will continue to grow in Apples Internet Services collective As the image below illustrates over the past years weve seen Apples share price bounce around our fair value line and this is the lowest its been in relationship to that As a result were still very much long on the tech behemoth with a fair value of upside to the current price The only contributing factor to our Hold rating is the timing wed recommend waiting for the market to react to this discount before wading in if youre not in it already Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
