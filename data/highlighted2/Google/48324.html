Bloomberg Microsoft is one of the most widely cited candidate for such a deal Satya Nadella should have no problem with securing the support of the board as he has a lot of experience in cloud and enterprise he can integrate the two companies Satya Nadella is a part of the board and has strategically positioned Microsoft to grow both cloud and mobile revenue Over the long run Microsoft can argue the mathematics behind such a deal without sounding unrealistic or overly optimistic in its reasoning Microsoft sits on billion in cash Very few opportunities could leverage the scale of Microsofts cash pile Salesforce is that rare exception Ive heard of crazy technology rumors in the past but its been a while since Ive heard of something as crazy as a Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and Salesforce NYSE CRM marriage It seems feasible by the numbers and by the looks of it Satya Nadella has unanimous support by the board to pursue acquisitions make strategic decisions and return the company to growth If Satya can argue the merits to Bill Gates and a couple other major stakeholders in the company the deal has some feasibility There are only two other companies that can really afford to take this risk and those two companies are Apple NASDAQ AAPL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Microsoft cant risk losing its edge in commercial software licensing to its two major competitors so it has to at least consider the deal despite its scale and despite the lack of CRMs profitability <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Apple will eye the situation closely as theyre not very good at charging money for software Theyre really good at monetizing a marketplace for software but they dont have a software business that appeals to a broad customer base of business users <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>doesnt charge anything for its software and Apple doesnt either Theyre both commodity providers of software and quite frankly only Microsoft and a few other companies are really proficient at direct software monetization Microsoft needs to build out this moat even further and quite frankly it can do this by reducing the number of competitors it has to compete with According to Gartner Microsoft had market share in the customer relationship management space and Salesforce had market share Unifying the product offering by creating integration into various other Microsoft products and offering bulk licensing discounts in conjunction with Azure Windows Enterprise and various other softwareasaservice products could give Microsoft added leverage to gain a significant market position in various software verticals I anticipate accretion from such a deal over time as Microsoft can lower the rate at which it outlays its cost even as revenue for the combined division grows at a to CAGR For all we know the segment could grow at an even faster rate assuming a broader software bundle can appeal to a broad base of business customers If market share figures were to improve the growth rate would most likely accelerate as a larger software bundle will have more appeal to business customers I can imagine the rumors to have legs if reputable research organizations like JPMorgan and PiperJaffray are willing to opine on the topic Heres the logic presented by JPMorgan Analysts at JPMorgan have weighed in on the stock and have reaffirmed an Overweight rating on the stock with an upward revision in target price from to According to JPMorgan analyst the stock could be worth in the buyout According to the analyst the deal could be around billion as it is currently valued at billion making this acquisition as one of the biggest deal in the software industry Theres compatibility in the culture of both organizations therefore moraledraining layoffs are unlikely Microsoft can use the added human capital from software design and sales If there are too many software engineers working on overlapping projects Microsoft can assign software engineers to emerging projects and reallocate the sales organization to handle other growth areas inside of the company like Office Bing and consumer electronics Adding in the workforce from Salesforce into Microsofts employee base will diminish the need for Microsoft to hire additional employees and gives Microsoft further depth in terms of its overall employee pool In Silicon Valley its really difficult to hire and retain high quality employees so gaining an entire organization gives Microsoft significant operating leverage because it can improve profitability over time while it increases efficiency Unlike other industries software business models tend to have really high margins so building cost efficiencies seems feasible Combining Salesforces software cloud with Microsofts preexisting server infrastructure may also result in unanticipated cost synergies as well I anticipate Salesforcecom to generate a CAGR over the next five years in terms of sales For sake of estimation that would imply revenue of around billion Assuming Microsoft can reduce operating costs as the business increases its volume CRM alone could generate a profit margin which would translate into billion in net income I think revenue ramp will cause margins to widen as costs wont scale as quickly as revenue Microsoft is notoriously disciplined with its cash spend and has an established track record of turning losing operations into reasonably profitable business divisions just look at the transformation of Nokia NYSE NOK I think higher profit margins are attainable due to Microsofts lowered effective tax rate as a result of Irish tax laws Admittedly these laws could change over the next couple years though I reckon Ireland has little incentive to change its tax code Microsoft may need to acquire CRM at around billion and assuming those future earnings get the conglomerate discount the added billion will likely be valued at Microsofts earnings multiple Microsoft has really high quality earnings so investors may price the stock at an even higher premium over the next five years So if the incremental earnings from CRM are valued at around x the valuation for the acquired business segment could grow from billion to billion over the next five years Microsoft sits on billion in cash and cash equivalents The company has grown its cash position by billion per year so the company has a ton of flexibility to both pursue acquisitions and return capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks Therefore unlocking some of the value in the balance sheet through a major acquisition of this scale could make sense for the company Its not exactly clear how shareholders will respond However Microsoft has a really great track record of growing nascent business units into massive business ventures So shareholder buyin seems likely Microsofts gaming and consumer electronics business would probably qualify for the fortune and those arent Microsofts biggest business units in terms of revenue or earnings The company is really massive and I have reasonable suspicion that it can afford to absorb a couple additional companies even if they were on the scale of Salesforce as the company can pursue a combined cash and stock transaction I think the dilutive effects would be offset with cash increasing Microsofts goodwill balance The combined organization would probably fetch a market cap of billion as combining business units tends to put upward momentum into the combined valuation of companies so as long as institutional investors believe in the longterm accretion possibilities which is already evidenced by the sellside commentary I think theres a decent likelihood that Microsoft will leverage some of its cash especially if it can put together reasonable numbers for shareholders to sink their teeth into Operationally Microsoft has a lot of control and quite frankly building a reasonable breakeven analysis that takes into consideration operational leverage through cost synergies and incremental margin improvements wouldnt require rocket science Its just plain accounting and quite frankly the presentation material will likely be convincing enough so as to get buyin from the Microsoft board and major institutional shareholders Of course weve seen bad business deals in the tech MA space but this time around Microsofts operational excellence definitely mitigates some of the agency risk There could be further upside for CRM stockholders Receiving Microsoft shares in a cash and stock transaction wouldnt be a bad thing as Microsoft trades on solid fundamentals Investors would get the immediate upside from a buyout premium that could be above CRMs most recent stock price and would also get the benefit of longterm appreciation from owning Microsoft assuming Microsoft can match the longterm returns of the SP which it most likely will Source Microsoft And Salesforce A Potential Marriage Made In Heaven Disclosure The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next
