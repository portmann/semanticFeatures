class='textDiv'>Apple Was Not The Magic Number Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Apple did not hit billion in revenues or million iPhones sold Stock sold off as guidance failed to meet analyst estimates After the bell on Tuesday technology giant Apple NASDAQ AAPL reported its fiscal third quarter results Apple reported a solid quarter well above its own revenue range and beat analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines However the numbers were not as good as some as hoped and fiscal Q guidance was below estimates That sent the stock lower and produced headlines like the one seen below As I stated in my preview article was the magic number for this quarter Unfortunately a number of s did the company in Apple sold million iPhones in the quarter a bit below many analyst expectations for more than million While unit sales were light the company did increase its average selling price sequentially by compared to a sequential decline from Q to Q last year On the conference call Apple CFO Luca Maestri stated that the company reduced its channel inventory by about units leaving the company at the low end of its target inventory range While sales may have disappointed Apple still grew iPhone sales by year over year highlighted by growth in Greater China Another that did not come was in terms of Mac sales which came in just below million units As I detailed in my preview article IDCs estimate that Apple shipped over million units had many Mac figures rising The Mac still grew yearoveryear sales by almost despite a market decline Apple finished the quarter below its target inventory for the Mac Average selling prices rose a little more than most likely confirming my belief that global prices were increased to combat the stronger dollar Overall Apple reported revenues of billion That beat the Yahoo Finance estimate but again fell short of the magic mark The company reduced total channel inventory by over a million units and I estimate that cost Apple at least million in revenues Had inventory been kept flat the company would have topped billion in revenues producing more than a meager beat Dont forget that currency issues also hurt revenues about by about billion in the quarter including a ASP hit for iPhones The final was the main reason for the demise in shares Fiscal Q guidance was for revenues of billion to billion while analysts were at billion I dont think investors should panic The table below shows Apples last four fiscal quarters where guidance proved to be quite conservative Especially if management decides to refill its channel inventory I wouldnt be surprised to see Q revenues end up above the current billion plus estimate Source Apple financial information page Apple reported EPS of which beat by four cents Part of the beat was operating expenses of just billion a bit below the billion guidance midpoint billion in the quarter was spent to buy back shares more than I expected This was one of the keys to the quarter as management showed it really stands behind Apple shares With this postearnings decline Im guessing the company will come in as soon as its blackout period ends and use some of its remaining billion repurchase plan I can certainly understand the frustration investors are feeling after this report with shares down about in after hours When the company beats on the top and bottom line investors expect shares to rise This is especially true after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL saw its stock soar last week despite a revenue miss However I want investors to remember some of these key positives for Apple The iPhone had the highest quarterly switching rate from Android that Apple has ever measured Only of Apples installed base has upgraded to the or Plus so far Phone ASP rose sequentially the opposite of the average sequential decline seen in the last four years from Q to Q The iPad sold nearly million units and Apple reportedly has of the market for over tablets App store revenues increased and more than doubled in China Service revenues topped billion a record Greater China revenues were up overall In the end investors should be happy with Apples results but not completely thrilled The stock sold off due to a number of key numbers starting with With shares going into the report near their alltime high this needed to be a great report Good was not enough with the decision to reduce channel inventory being key In terms of guidance remember that Apple guided basically inline last time around and shares declined by the next day Between that report and this one analysts increased their revenue average by about billion yet Apple still came in above that and well over the top of its guidance I personally think management has guided conservatively again as the table above showed for the last four quarters especially ahead of its next iPhone launch The pullback does provide investors a chance to get in at a lower price The most recent pullback to the low s didnt last long and I think that was during a time where Apple was blacked out from buying back shares Management will step in when it can and investors should too While we might hear some analyst negativity in the coming days just remember that even if the median price target drops by it will still represent a nearly increase from
