However, I want investors to remember some of these key positives for Apple: The iPhone had the highest quarterly switching rate from Android that Apple has ever measured.Only 27% of Apple's installed base has upgraded to the 6 or 6 Plus so far.Phone ASP rose sequentially, the opposite of the $25 average sequential decline seen in the last four years from Q2 to Q3.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The iPad sold nearly 11 million units, and Apple reportedly has 76% of the market for over $200 tablets. (Uncertainty) </span>App store revenues increased 24% and more than doubled in China.Service revenues topped $5 billion, a record.Greater China revenues were up 112% overall.In the end, investors should be happy with Apple's results, but not completely thrilled.The stock sold off due to a number of key numbers starting with "4."With shares going into the report near their all-time high, this needed to be a great report.Good was not enough, with the decision to reduce channel inventory being key.In terms of guidance, remember that Apple guided basically in-line last time around and shares declined by $2 the next day.Between that report and this one, analysts increased their revenue average by about $2.25 billion, yet Apple still came in above that (and well over the top of its guidance).I personally think management has guided conservatively again as the table above showed for the last four quarters, especially ahead of its next iPhone launch.The pullback does provide investors a chance to get in at a lower price.The most recent pullback to the low $120s didn't last long, and I think that was during a time where Apple was blacked out from buying back shares.Management will step in when it can, and investors should too.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While we might hear some analyst negativity in the coming days, just remember that even if the median price target drops by $5, it will still represent a nearly 20% increase from the last after-hours trade on Tuesday.
