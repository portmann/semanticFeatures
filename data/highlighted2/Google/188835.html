CEO Tim Cook Apple has achieved a commanding lead in enterprise mobile devices but this lead may be eroding If Apple is really serious it will provide more transparency for investors as well as an alternative to the Wintel PC platform that is attractive to enterprise Apple NASDAQ AAPL CEO Tim Cook announced on Tuesday that Apple had made billion in revenue from sales to the enterprise in the past months While this is not bad news its far from actionable investment intelligence Apple remains somewhat awkward in the enterprise despite partnerships with IBM NYSE IBM and Cisco NASDAQ CSCO Apple still needs to get serious in important ways by offering personal computers that businesses actually want and by breaking down enterprise revenue in its financial reports Cooks announcement during the interview by Box CEO Aaron Levie exploded all over the Internet the next day Although I try to stay as positive as I reasonably can about Apple as an Apple investor I found myself more annoyed than encouraged What did the billion really mean Its about of the companys revenue for the past year Okay thats not chump change but as a growthvalue investor what I care about is rates of change in revenue and earnings A single data point cant tell me how fast the enterprise business is growing if at all Apples enterprise business may be growing overall but is that due to the much publicized partnerships with IBM and Cisco Its difficult to tell According to a report released by Good Technology for Q iOS devices remain dominant overall in the enterprise with a share of activations registered by Goods device management software However this was a decline compared to of activations in Q In tablets specifically the iPad fell from of activations in Q to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Android and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Windows tablets both grew at iPads expense Goods iOS data suggests that Apple is not in fact growing in the enterprise but may be losing ground As Ive often pointed out qq variations are not always significant Apples new product releases tend to be on an annual cycle with sales peaking in the December quarter due to new releases in the Fall So Goods numbers may simply mirror the larger seasonality that Apple products go through Goods data also doesnt include Mac OS X systems and so doesnt reveal the full picture of Apple enterprise revenue Once again Cooks single data point can offer no insight into the revenue profile for the past year If Apple wants to convince investors and clients that its serious about business it needs to start breaking out its enterprise revenue on a quarterly basis the way the big boys do It would also be helpful if investors could get a breakdown by device and service category as well The fact that Apple doesnt do this simply telegraphs to the world that it isnt quite ready for the big leagues That really needs to change Although Apple still maintains a dominant position in mobile devices on the strength of the iPhone and iPad thats as far as it goes For mainstream business computing Wintel laptops and desktops are still the rule A recent article in infoworldcom was only able to offer a few anecdotes of Mac usage in corporate enterprise Cisco Systems now has about of its users on Macs The article tried to make the case that total cost of ownership is no worse for Macs than for Windows PCs despite the higher purchase price This may be true but its probably a tough sell to IT departments As obsolete desktops are being replaced in the enterprise theyre almost always replaced by laptops IT departments know they can get a very powerful Windows laptop for around whereas the lowest cost Mac laptop is about twice that While iPads may be a good fit for specific usage scenarios where the compact tablet form factor is essential iPads as general purpose PCs still fall short in the office For general purpose computing and office work a MacBook would be a better choice than the iPad even the iPad Pro If Apple really wants to compete in the enterprise it needs to produce an affordable laptop Maybe not a laptop but something that gets well under Then maybe with IBMs help Apple could make a case for lower TCO Heres a role for IBM especially if IBM is selling a device management package to the enterprise that has a guaranteed service and support cost structure Well Im not holding my breath for that affordable MacBook With the iPad Pro Apple seems to be staking its personal computing future on iOS and variants of the iPad There are significant advantages to focusing on iOS rather than Mac OS X iOS represents a clean sheet operating system design that exercises much more control over apps and how theyre developed Its more secure as a consequence Users cant without jailbreaking download apps outside of the app store All apps exist within sandboxes that isolate each app from the other This makes the OS more resilient to crashes by apps as well as keeps apps from accessing data from other apps These are both characteristics that have endeared iOS to government and regulated industry users According to Good iOS continues to be strongest in the public sector with of activations Mac OS X has an App Store and apps from the Store must be sandboxed But Mac OS X also allows apps downloaded from anywhere as well as older style nonsandboxed apps Windows is more or less in the same position It has an app store with sandboxed apps but it also has to support the huge legacy of Windows software The clean sheet approach of iOS may well be better than trying to transition the legacy operating systems to the newer approach This seems to be why Apple is pushing iOS more as an enterprise solution If thats the case then iOS has some growing up to do Were seeing that in the iPad Pro The iPad Pro supports multitasking and will probably feature what may be an incredibly powerful processor based on what the new iPhone s is capable of iOS is also starting to bow somewhat to practicality by supporting a new cursor mode in which the keyboard area of the screen behaves like a conventional trackpad for manipulating an onscreen text cursor Apple needs to go a step further in iOS and support an external mouse or track pad which Android has done for years Apple has been overly fastidious in wanting to preserve the purity of the iOS user interface The new track pad mode is a sign that Apple is becoming more pragmatic about iOS Once Apple makes this simple change it really will have an operating system that can replace Mac OS X for most personal computing applications and begin to challenge Wintel in the enterprise We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell
