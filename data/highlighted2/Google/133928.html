YHOOs market capitalization The company is spinning off its Alibaba stock to correct a distortion in the Yahoo stock price The distortion is inhibiting the companys ability to compete in the market both for talented employees and attractive strategic merger partnerstargets The IRS has concluded in published guidance that there is a substantial nontax business purpose for a spinoff when it is the only way to issue equity compensation that is directly tied to the value of the company thereby attracting or retaining key employees The IRS has recognized the goal of maximizing the value of a companys stock as acquisition currency as a business purpose that satisfies the taxfree spinoff rules The following adaptation of a letter to the editor from the July th edition of Tax Notes has been expanded to include the above summary Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO is spinning off its Alibaba NYSE BABA stock to correct a distortion in the Yahoo stock price that is inhibiting its ability to compete in the market both for talented employees and attractive strategic merger partnerstargetsi As of the close of trading today Yahoos ownership of Alibaba accounted for of Yahoos market capitalizationii Suppose one of Americas best corporate citizens Berkshire Hathaway NYSE BRKA NYSE BRKB wanted to spinoff its appreciated American Express NYSE AXP stock and added its smaller Borsheims Fine Jewelry business to the mix which is assumed for the purposes of these examples to be an active trade or business under the spinoff tax rules The transaction would be taxable if there was no substantial business purpose for the spinoff other than an attempt to avoid corporatelevel tax on the distribution of the appreciated American Express stock When Warren Buffett was actually asked about the Alibaba spinoff during the questionandanswer session of the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting this past year he understandably expressed some skepticism about whether it could be accomplished taxfree Imagine instead that Berkshire Hathaway was trading at only the value of its American Express holding and it spunoff its American Express stock with the Borsheims Fine Jewelry business This transaction may have a substantial nontax business purpose if conducted to correct the distortion in the Berkshire Hathaway stock price so that for example Berkshire could issue equity awards or use its stock as acquisition currency as recognized by the IRS itself discussed below Assuming that Borsheims comprises an active trade or business and provided the other requirements for a taxfree spinoff are satisfied the transaction would qualify for taxfree treatmentiii Yahoos position resembles that of Berkshire Hathaway in the second example because of Alibabas overwhelming effect on the Yahoo share price Specifically the Yahoo spinoff has the following business purposes that have been recognized by the IRS as strong business purposes supporting taxfree treatment These business purposes are not only powerful nontax motivations for the transaction they are exigent issues crippling Yahoos ability to conduct business that need to be rectified as quickly as possible Yahoo expenses approximately million per quarter for employee stock options and is having a hard time attracting top talent to drive a turnaround of its business In part this is because the value of the Yahoo stock is driven by its Alibaba holding meaning that a talented Yahoo employee may be unable to realize appreciation in the value of their Yahoo stock options as a direct result of their hard work to improve the business Without the ability to incentivize and reward employee innovation Yahoo has struggled to attract the talent that it needs For example assume that a talented Yahoo employee is issued an option to acquire its stock at a fixed price and as a result of their innovation and hard work the companys earnings rise At the same time however the stock price of Alibaba falls by an offsetting amount due to events wholly outside of the employees control and this causes the Yahoo stock price to drop because it overpowers the effect of its positive earnings growth Instead of seeing their contribution to the company rewarded with growth in the Yahoo stock price the employees options have actually lost value despite their good efforts Under these perverse circumstances if you were a talented computer programmer considering competing job offers in Silicon Valley would you prefer the stock option package at Yahoo over a similar one from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL or perhaps a startup In the latter two cases you have a better chance to see your work add value to the share price but not necessarily so at Yahoo In Silicon Valley stock options that grow in value with the business are considered standard compensation for employees and the fact that YHOO cannot credibly provide this incentive is hurting its ability to compete in the job market By spinning off its Alibaba stock Yahoo can attract and incentivize industryleading employees that are drawn to the ability to reap the benefits of increasing the fortunes of the company The IRS has concluded in published guidance that there is a substantial nontax business purpose for a spinoff when it is the only way to issue equity compensation that is directly tied to the value of the company thereby attracting or retaining key employeesiv One key way to grow in Yahoos industry is through acquisitions and in such deals it is common to use equity consideration A strategic partner today looking to take advantage of the synergies arising from growing its business with Yahoo would be less likely to want Yahoo stock whose value fluctuates based not on the growth of the combined business operations but rather the fortunes of Alibaba Yahoo has cut of its contractors and laid off more than of its workforce this year Troubled as it may be the company still generates one billion unique visitors per day and its top priority is to return to growth as quickly as possible A large acquisition could offer a path back to profitability but it would have to be an allcash deal given the current disruption in the Yahoo stock price that is caused by the companys Alibaba holding According to Bloomberg data Yahoo has acquired other companies since its formation for billion in total consideration Twelve large strategic allstock deals account for billion of this billion figure Fortytwo smaller allcash deals account for billion of the billion and three stockandcash deals account for billion Finally small transactions whose terms were not disclosed make up the remaining of the billion Therefore in of Yahoos acquisitions and in nearly all of its large transformative deals the company has primarily paid in its own stock As of the second quarter of Yahoo held a cash position of roughly billion billion net of convertible debt In the first quarter of this year the company announced a billion share repurchase program and has bought back million of stock in to date The company has an exigent need to effect a strategic transaction to reverse its fortunes but is restricted to the use of cash consideration Yahoo ought to be able to follow its historical pattern of using its own stock as consideration but as described above its stock is currently unattractive as an acquisition currency because its price fluctuates based on Alibaba stock rather than the value generated from a strategic transaction By far the best solution to this urgent problem is to decouple the Yahoo stock from the Alibaba stock so that a potential strategic partner or the shareholders of a strategic target is willing to take Yahoo stock as an acquisition currency that will appreciate from the combined synergistic value arising from combining YHOO and its potential target or partner Otherwise the company becomes the proverbial sitting duck a target for an acquirer that can efficiently unwind the Alibaba stake on behalf of the combined company Even an allstock merger of equals would be challenging In light of Verizons NYSE VZ recent billion acquisition of AOL nothing short of Yahoos ability to control its own destiny is at stake The IRS has recognized the goal of maximizing the value of a companys stock as acquisition currency as a business purpose that satisfies the taxfree spinoff rulesv Yahoo is spinning off its Alibaba stock to correct a distortion in its stock price that is crippling the companys ability to turn around its business That distortion is inhibiting Yahoos ability to compete in the market both for talented employees and attractive strategic merger partnerstargets The IRS has repeatedly recognized that correcting this type of issue is a strong business purpose for taxfree spinoff treatment i The tax law in question section states A distribution that is expected to cause the aggregate value of the stock of a distributing corporation and the stock of a controlled corporation to exceed the predistribution value of the distributing corporations stock satisfies the corporate business purpose requirement of and b when the increased value is expected to serve a corporate business purpose of either the distributing corporation or the controlled corporation or both even if it benefits the shareholders of the distributing corporation ii As of July rd Alibaba closed at and Yahoo closed at There is of Alibaba stock x worth of Alibaba stock inside each share of Yahoo stock Therefore of the current Yahoo stock price consists of Alibaba stock ie iii This same reasoning would apply even if Berkshire traded for somewhat more than the combined value of a much larger basket of its liquid holdings but still at a price that was sufficiently depressed to cause problems of the type that have given rise to business purposes recognized by the IRS as sufficient for taxfree spinoff treatment Apologies to Mr Buffett for any agita
