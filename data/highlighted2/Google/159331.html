class='textDiv'>Wayfair Is The Most Mispriced Stock Citron Research Has Seen In Years Fair Value Under Wayfair NYSEW Seeking Alpha Must Read Sep AM ET About Wayfair W by Citron Research Wayfair NYSE W makes Citron feel like apologizing to every company we have written about in the past years Compared to Wayfair you all have viable business models Any analyst who defends this stock is clueless about furniture retailing and even more clueless about ecommerce Shake Shack NYSE SHAK FitBit NYSE FIT Tesla NASDAQ TSLA Ambarella NASDAQ AMBA and GoPro NASDAQ GPRO Each of these stocks has passionate bulls and bears of equal conviction While each of these stocks still sells at nosebleed multiples each has a disruptive cultlike or bluesky prospect which longs and shorts will continue to debate Wayfair is not a battleground There is no bull case whatsoever and Citron will prove it As we have previously tweeted Citron admired the work of the Friendly Bear published last week on Seeking Alpha explaining why Wayfairs current business is in the doghouse While acknowledging Friendly Bears piece Citron elaborates on the real context of Wayfairs actual business prospects predicting that its stock will soon end up in single digits We will defer to the Friendly Bear for all relevant information about Wayfairs dangerously high customer acquisition costs Meanwhile for longs a challenge Finish this sentence First we would like to stress the obvious which everyone except the company and the analysts will admit Wayfair is Overstock NASDAQ OSTK plain and simple The only difference is that Overstock has better brand recognition and higher traffic of all Overstock sales are furniture and home goods Here is a quick comparison of the two companies What is more amazing is that in Wayfairs analyst report from Evercore we see a consumer survey showing that in the past months more people shopped for home goods on Overstock than Wayfair With only slightly more top line revenue Wayfair is running x the amount of commercials as Overstock Notice even the advertising agencies make the apples to apples comparison Both companies even have the same corporate strategies This month Overstock partners with HGTV And a few months ago Wayfair partnered with HGTV For those who are not convinced this is the same business as Overstock take this While never PRd by Wayfair local news stories have confirmed that as of this month the company has committed to open a million sq ft warehouse facility in Cincinnati so much for the assetlight model Overstock was spending a similar portion of its gross revenues on marketing until when it reduced this unsustainable spend rate to around of sales What happened Revenue growth fell from per year in to in and never really recovered Nothing more to be said Wayfair actually intentionally shuns the comparison incredibly the company refuses to mention Overstock as a competitor in its SEC filings The ONLY conceivable rationale for this omission is that if it acknowledges Overstock as a comp it becomes apparent to all that Wayfairs stock is not worth more than a share Will someone please come to my office and sit on my hands to keep me from covering my short at and then come back and bash my knuckles so I dont cover at Andrew Left Editor Citron Research Before we prove why Wayfair will face the same uphill battle as Overstock in selling furniturehome goods online lets look at the fallacy of the companys last quarter Wayfairs stock surged earlier this month after reporting seemingly strong numbers The bulls cheered the fact that marketing spend declined marginally relative to its revenue growth The analysts were quick to tout this as a breakthrough and validation of their business model We have seen this movie before Saving money by realizing marketing efficiencies while riding the wake of a shortterm marketing blitz is a onetime event It cannot be extended in a linear fashion especially when you are competing with Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Target NYSE TGT and WalMart NYSE WMT The onetime event of Wayfairs most recent quarter is the IDENTICAL play Zulily NASDAQ ZU ran in Q which drove the stock to its peak from where it plunged by over From the Zulily Conference call when the stock was over Thank you and thanks for taking my question I wanted to go back to the marketing efficiency I mean pretty remarkable I mean your business was up about million in revenue on just under million and I mean incremental marketing spend Can you help us around what some of the what channels were most productive and I dont know if you can maybe give out some mobile app downloads update and what you saw from that channel and I have one followup Darrell Cavens Chief Executive Officer Sure I think if you look at our channels we dont disclose the kind of difference between each one and what we are seeing across channels but what I can say is we saw great efficiency across all our channels We continued to see kind of strong diversity across the channels there Wayfair is not even as efficient as Overstock or Zulily look at this startling chart to understand what a bad business the company has created Anyone who believes that a vertical market retailer selling furniture exclusively online is a good business model does not understand the furniturehome furnishings category and does not understand ecommerce Will analysts please understand the shortcomings of this assetlight business model The Fallacy of the AssetLight Model in Furnishings Sales Wayfair brags that they have an assetlight business model That is like a homeless man bragging that he doesnt have a mortgage WalMart has stores around the United States that each serve as return centers and you are bragging that you dont Restoration Hardware NYSE RH has created the most beautiful stores in the country that connect emotionally with the consumer and you bragged that you dont WilliamsSonoma NYSE WSM has of its brand stores throughout the most strategic parts of the county but you brag that you have Lastly Amazon has built out a distribution system with technology and warehouses on a scale that the world has never seen but again you brag that you are assetlight In the universe of highend furniture the ONLY model that works on large scale is omnichannel selling This is not the isolated opinion of Citron Research this is years worth of experience of industry experts and billions of dollars in profits ALL AGREEING on the point For those who think WilliamsSonoma and Restoration Hardware are brickandmortar stores it should be noted that both companies generate of all their revenues online and they do so profitably These are not merely stores with websites they are omnichannel retail companies Wayfair CANNOT survive being an online seller of mid to highend furniture and home goods without physical locations plain and simple If you do not believe Citron then believe the words of home decorating Bible Architectural Digest But as anyone whos ordered a light fixture or piece of upholstery online can attest when you havent seen the item in person theres always a looming element of uncertainty Is the color true to the way it looks onscreen Are the proportions right in your space If there is any way you believe that Wayfair is investable because it is unique and revolutionary it must be pointed out that the company is selling its own branded furniture in the most nonrevolutionary way possible Catalogs Just like the Sears NASDAQ SHLD and JC Penney NYSE JCP of old and exactly what its most experienced and lowmultiple profitable competitors do Andrew Left Editor Citron Research Citron has to conclude that to the analysts assetlight means unmodeled expenses eg you guys dont have the slightest idea what it takes build a profitable furniture home furnishing company Note the following chart there is only one pureplay Internet company in the home furnishings space Wayfair That is not an accident it is because it is a losing proposition Has Wayfair really cornered a unique strategy Or has it just committed itself in a margin race to the bottom pitted against Target and WalMart in the lowtomid omnichannel and highly sophisticated prestige brandbuilding omnichannel retailers on the high end all while dodging the fullcourt press of Amazons dynamic pricing Citron has provided readers some additional research illustrating how omnichannel retailing is the only route to profits in scale at the high end of the furniture business Multichannel Retailing Drives Growth for Restoration Hardware If you think Wayfair faces challenges against branded highend omnichannel retailers this is nothing compared to the challenges it faces online at the low end First of all nearly all consumers motivated to shop online in this category want to save money How difficult is it for them to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>search for the lowestcost source for nearly any item they are interested in The Elephant in the Room Amazons Dynamic Pricing Model It is impossible for Wayfair to compete against Amazon on pricing Here is a recent interview given to Bloomberg with Wayfairs CEO in which the interviewer actually names specific products and prices calling painful attention to cheaper pricing on Amazon on many items Wayfair Furnishing a Revenue Path to Profitability Here is how Amazon makes it completely impossible to compete with it on price Dynamic Pricing By using algorithms to change prices on millions of items hundreds of times a day every day Amazon makes sure that any product showing a meaningful sales volume trend will always have a lower price at Amazon therefore it will either win the customer or at best obliterate the margins of competitors Amazon implements million changes per day to pricings take that Wayfair Wayfair will contend that it will outmerchandise Amazon So as long as your users DO NOT KNOW HOW TO USE GOOGLE you might have a business Just plain stupid Citron has read every analyst report as of the last quarter and unfathomably not a single one of them even mentions the word Amazon Note to analysts If you think you can analyze an ecommerce company and not even refer to Amazon it is time you quit your job and take up another line of work There are millions of ways to demonstrate just how difficult and competitive this space is After earnings last week the Bloomberg interviewer referenced above immediately questioned the future of a company that cant offer better pricing than Amazon Citron wanted to illustrate that the vast majority of goods that are less expensive on other sites namely Amazon so if any potential customers refer to a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>search Wayfair loses In order to avoid the appearance of having cherrypicked a few items Citron went to Favorite Wayfair Purchase links selected by the companys own management on their executive profile page Lets see what we found Meet the Team page WalMart and Target also have aggressive price match policies While they clearly dont have the price change flexibility that Amazon does changing prices on shelf tags and POS scanner systems is a bigger task than just changing the price displayed to an online customer clearly nobody is going to be able to expand gross margins competing against Target and WalMart either much less having to go headtohead against Amazon The power of omnichannel marketing is just as impactful in the lowtomid end of the home furnishings sector As anyone who has ever bought furniture online knows the biggest risk is that todays online furniture purchase winds up in your garage tomorrow WalMart and Target offer return policies that Wayfair cant possibly ever compete with While Wayfair online buyers are stuck with paying return shipping fees buyers at Walmartcom and Targetcom can return products bought online to any WalMart or Target store location Except notably in the case of Walmartcom items fulfilled by Wayfair Wayfair items cannot be returned to WalMart stores or to Walmartcom Because furniture items are often bulky this could be a hit on a purchase to keep the item from winding up in your garage It is Citrons opinion that many consumers will continue to consider it a superior value to pay a slightly higher price merely for the level of return assurance and convenience afforded by box stores like Target or WalMart Through a rarely publicized artifact of its business called Get it Near Me in which Wayfair sells ads to retail furniture stores Wayfair offers up a oneline admission that proves in its own words the inherent flaw in the companys business that cannot be changed What you are about to read is all you have to know to pinpoint why this unicorn is doomed to certain death Although the vast majority of consumers go online to begin their research for a major home purchase the vast majority of consumers will ultimately make their purchase at a brick mortar store This presents an incredible opportunity for retailers to get the attention of consumers as they conduct their research The company states in its own Get it Near Me FAQ Q If Wayfair sells furniture why would I want to advertise on your sites Arent we competitors Yes and no As an onlineonly retailer of furniture most people use our sites as a way to conduct product research before going to one of their local brickandmortar furniture stores to make a purchase Wayfairs Get it Near Me program is all but an admission that the companys core business will never change consumer home goods buying behavior to the point that Wayfair will be profitable The most obvious indication of the problems with the Wayfair business model is the extraordinary amount of customer complaints online When selling nonbranded merchandise for which you do not control the ship dates and the product is often too large to return easily have fun returning a sofa you have an uphill business model Maybe that is why Wayfairs assetlight model continues to lose money while its omnichannel competitors rack up profits quarter after quarter Everyone knows just <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Wayfair complaints and your head will spin A recent Bloomberg interview with Wayfair CEO Niraj Shah just proves how clueless he is about his own business This is the same guy who couldnt figure out to start a furniture brand until <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>changed its search mechanisms Citron adds comments italicized on his statements No It did not drive a profit line It made you have a smaller loss big difference Home is a billion retail market and as it is shifting online we think there will be a big winner and we are having success at being that winner How are you a winner with million in accumulated losses after being at the business for years while your competition both high and lowend have generated billions of dollars in profits in the same category For the first years of this business we were profitable You were As the filing of the S your company had million in cumulative losses before you went public and the number has done nothing but escalate There is a difference between generating a small profit as a private company and trying to scale a business How many times have investors read this dishonest description of Wayfair To transform the way people shop for their homes Wayfairs Our Mission Q Investor Presentation What is transformative here Using the internet to buy goods What is the differentiated retail experience The only thing differentiated is the ability to lose hundreds of millions of dollars while Wall Street allows insiders to dump stock at a staggering pace that truly is differentiated in the furniture and home furnishings space where its competitors are held to the burden of making a profit Conclusion Why Wayfair Will NEVER achieve massscale profitability simplified The companys muchtouted recent quarter netted it a loss on revenues which were up over the prioryear quarter The law of large numbers has claimed billions of dollars invested in internet companies over the years Unless you have a viral strategy paying for traffic flow is an extremely highrisk strategy If it doesnt bind longterm customers you have flushed your investors money on nothing Etoys and petscom are but two examples among hundreds of forgotten URLs which used ad spend trying to carve out online turf for a vertical market Meanwhile the margins on online furniture and the brutal realities of dynamic pricing strategies promise that this company is unlikely to ever see margin expansion and in fact margin contraction is in fact a very real risk Wayfairs gross margin which the company has been unable to expand by even one point over several years is so narrow that driving revenues higher alone wont get this company into the green So Wayfair wont become profitable regardless of the size of the top line without slashing its allin marketing costs to the low teens At the moment those costs are of gross having peaked in at With an intense marketing spend for instance running x more TV ads than Overstock the transactions generated from this ad spend arent profitable The company hopes that a large percentage of these firsttime buyers will become longterm customers of Wayfair Evercores model for example has this company losing an additional million through the end of and even then just breaking even And to merely breakeven years from now Wayfair is required to hit the trifecta of while slashing marketing spend by nearly points less than current quarters lowered rates And despite withering competition carve out marginally positive gross margins too For those reasons Wayfair is the
