class='textDiv'>Apple Watch Will Not Disrupt iPhone Ever Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Smartwatch sales should not be forecasted or accepted in a positive light on the basis of the Swiss Watch market Sellthrough of smartwatches has remained poor Apples singular home run in the iPhone was a successful implementation of converging technologies Untethering smartwatches is a good step in the right direction that doesnt solve consumer problems or address consumer needs The latest data concerning Apples NASDAQ AAPL smartwatch continues to paint the picture of a poorly conceived product with poor consumer reception and poor sellthrough It wouldnt matter if that product was issued by Apple Samsung OTCSSNLF or any relevant competitor in the smartwatch business they all find declining unit shipments and sales over time as has been evidenced Raymond James recently offered their latest CESI results for the Apple Watch when compared to other smartwatches like those offered by Garmin NASDAQ GRMN and Fitbit NYSE FIT Spoiler alert for the Apple Watch it aint pretty With that being said and if you own an Apple Watch quickly take a photo with the device Sarcastically speaking this article will get back to that most relevant point that no media outlet and no analyst cares to discuss to date Im not interested in conjecture anecdotal experiences or falsehoods From a due diligence perspective Im only interested in the facts and the facts have long since evidenced the poorly performing smartwatch category and its headline act Apple Watch I alerted investors and readers to just how poor the Apple Watch was performing at retailers several months ago in an article titled Apples Watch Presents Less Potential Than Investors Think The article aimed at opening the Apple Watch product to greater analysis which would prove most accurate in depicting the actual addressable market for this product and sales outlook I followed this article with empirical evidence of how poorly the Apple Watch was performing at its leading retail partner in North America Seeking Alpha and its readers got their first look at actual retail sales from the Apple Watch product from my article titled Apple Watch Price Reduction Highlights SellThrough Issues Apple Watch retail POS sales Data Because Apple doesnt break out sales data for the Apple Watch and with the Watch garnering high expectations even through a lackluster holiday selling period for the device I thought it relevant to show readers and investors just how badly this product was performing Regardless of price reductions to the product the sell through has not gotten better but worse The concept is all wrong and that is not me speaking that is the consumer speaking as evidenced in sellthrough results Other media pundits and authors might offer a better performance from the Apple Watch is still to come from future iterations but rest assured that will once again only be from the benefit of advancing distribution and untethering the Apple Watch The sell through will find itself an equally poor result longterm The Apple Watch and most any smartwatch in the same class of devices is an illogical concept that borders on the impossibility of usurping the smartphone The decision to recognize these devices as smart was equally ill conceived as they have yet to exhibit the smart characteristics of the smartphone in total But if the media and suppliers wish for it to be recognized as being smart so it shall be I often find it funny to see narratives that draw the disruptive correlation of smartwatches to the Swiss Watch market These narratives hope to extrapolate the potential of the smartwatch but it is quite the smoke and mirror analysis Nope not an opinion at all as will be demonstrated Such a characterization is actually nothing more than lowhanging fruit and lowrelevance correlation Swiss Watch market has the following issues Modestly impacted by sellthrough of smartwatches Have no forbearance on the FUTURE of smartwatches Most obviously dont have the ability to achieve the smartphone market share not to mention total cell phone market share That last bullet point is the smoking gun with regards to the Apple Watch being a very poor concept If we accept that the Swiss Watch market has lost market share in part due to the prevalence for cell phones over several years the smartwatch could never be the best product concept to replace the smartphone by sheer logic People have chosen the cell phone more often than the watch On the basis of pure analytics rationalizing the prospects of the smartwatch by Apple or even Samsung this couldnt ever be the proposed usurper of the throne for smartphones You simply cant get there analytically speaking and based on the preponderance of market share potential if one chooses to use the Swiss Watch market as the guide and having a smaller total addressable market The media has chosen this analogy in favor of smartwatch prospects because its easy to do requires little logic and is easy to understand from a pure numbers standpoint today But forecasting the future requires a deeper analytical dive into the products In a recent article by Mark Hibben the Seeking Alpha author accepts the Swiss Watch comparison in the following statements Unlike fad products such as D printers smartwatches have a predecessor industry in electronic watches and Lehar makes a persuasive case that the advent of the smartwatch is disrupting the watch industry In addition to the steady decline in Swiss watch exports over the past year that Lehar pointed out Strategy Analytics estimates that smartwatch shipments overtook Swiss watch shipments in Q According to Strategy Analytics million smartwatches were shipped vs million Swiss Watches But the worst part of the offering is that it lends no value to sellthrough of smartwatches IDC doesnt either as they dont have the ability to track sellthrough They wait for the individual company notations on the sales of the product and make an estimate hoping future results will prove previous estimates to be right Mr Hibben offers his opinions and sentiments for smartwatches that have already proven to fail to generate a single quarter of sellthrough results equating to mm units sold Its why each successive quarter of sellin has diminished since the launch of the Apple Watch Try and try as they may retailers havent been able to unload these devices even with price reductions Not one smartwatch maker has recorded a quarter whereby theyve sold mm units to consumers not retailers but consumers If they had the paltry units shipped in Q as estimated by IDC wouldnt look as they do in the following chart Its all logic supported by those proposed bullish smartwatch fans Imagine how long it would take for smartwatches assuming they ever could to achieve quarterly shipments achieved by smartphones at this rate Its so bad that even with the second generation untethered Samsung Gear S smartwatch the company cant sellin mm units as estimated by IDC The first version of the Samsung Gear smartwatch shipped mm units in nearly double the amount shipped in the IDC estimate for Samsung Gear And that is with all ATT NYSE T and Verizon NYSE VZ retail locations promoting and offering this smartwatch As a collective vendor group smartwatches cant even sell mm units to retail and distribution partners let alone sellthrough mm units The complete enormity of the switch in consumer engagement with smartwatches would have to be so magnificent to ever replace the smartphone in units shipped There has not been an Apple product concept that has been positioned against such enormity from a predecessor product and as such the analysis should recognize convergence was the largest attribute that has benefited former Apple products that found success The smartwatch sellthrough problems that cant be denied are a product concept problem rooted in form factor and all the analysis points in that direction In the smartwatch form factor converge is impeded I couldnt disagree more with Mr Hibbens following statements and the current sellin and sellthrough results make it virtually impossible to achieve IDCs smartwatch forecast with such smartwatches like Apple Watch IDC has been proven most inaccurate in the past and likely will once again with its forecasts for smartwatches Just as smartphones came to dominate the mobile communication market I consider it inevitable that smartwatches will dominate the electronic watch market The same technology innovations in processors displays batteries and wireless that enabled smartphones also are enablers for the smartwatch This expectation is consistent with IDCs forecast for smartwatches IDC predicts that by unit sales will reach over million per year For IDC predicts sales of million with Apple Watch having a dominant market share of For Q Apple Watch had the dominant share of the smartwatch category at with million units shipped Ive mentioned smoke and mirrors already once but I would ask that readers and investors also consider the most important factors for achieving disruptor status are form factor and pricing Mr Hibben offers that energy efficiency is a factor for advancing technology in place of former products but Ive never seen that as the objective in the concept stage or completion of a product development What is also missing in his respected statements is any relevancy of form factor Im not saying that energy efficiency doesnt play a role in innovation Its a factor but way down on the list of priorities The iPhones greatest ability to disrupt the cellular phone market and become the predominant highend smart phone device was the ability to converge technologies and not the ability to become more energy efficient as they still lack this component Convergence was the key and the main reason the iPhone displaced sales of the iPod GPS and camera devices Its also the reason most of its other products have seen declining sales for years now The iPad and iMac have no convergence factor they simply have a new form factor and in that there is very little ability to achieve longterm sales growth Both product lines are in decline with the iPad suffering now from quarters of sales declines No convergence Convergence is what led to the greatest Apple product revenue and profit generator and it had nothing to do with energy efficiency or the development of greater energy efficiency The iPhone was about the ability to converge technologies into a single form factor of greatest use with optimal features But convergence has its limitations and those limitations become everpresent when miniaturizing technologies as Ive articulated in the past Most everything the smartphone already does the smartwatch aims to do in a miniaturized form factor While that may have been where some of the success for the cell phone came from miniaturization and mobility there are limitations and consumers determine those limitations which are aligned with cost The smoke and mirrors that were presented in offering energy efficiency as a driving force for disruptive technologies by Mr Hibben is just that smoke and mirrors The investment needed to produce all aspects of tooling production and manufacturing have to be in keeping with the end goal of acquiring a profit for the product When a smaller product such as the smartwatch is aimed to usurp a larger smartphone all aspects of product development for the electronic device become more stressful and especially on cost of goods There is no variable of energy efficiency that takes place hear and battery life would not be a component issueproblem in need of solving Apple has access to better battery life and the implementation of such an improved battery comes at a cost So once again we arrive at the cost issue But in truth even what Ive offered in juxtaposing the real problems for the smartwatch and its perceived attempt at usurping the smartphone are somewhat less relevant than the physical impossibilities of smartwatch function and its end goal as a product One of the reasons the return rate of the existing Apple Watch is so high is because Apple hasnt advantaged the product with greater technologies If you desire greater product failure rate make it just as powerful but smaller and watch what happens Dell Gateway and Hewlett Packard NYSE HP come to mind as they made their products smaller but without the necessary technology to achieve relevant product adoption that would find pricing much higher What these companies did was make their devices smaller with low price points and found the absence of better technology to coincide with smaller products to be a downfall Apple has not advantaged the Apple Watch with the necessary functionality of the iPhone because the cost would greatly exceed the cost of the iPhone if it had done so and desired it to be the product disruptor In making the smartphone into a smaller smartwatch Apple is finding the same problems that Dell Gateway and Hewlett Packard ran into While the smartwatch has been offered to disrupt the smartphone market to date it lacks the most important functionalities of smartphones Suggesting the smartwatch is going to displace the smartphone is avoiding what we understand to be the impediments to execute on that goal from a form factor and cost of goods equation as Ive outlined with clearer logic Check out this web page from wearablescom and understand that wearablescom is not the only media outlet that hasnt considered one key aspect of function lacking in smartwatches They have all committed to the oversight The publication outlines the best of the individual smartwatch makers in terms of purpose ie the best for this and the best for that function Notice anything missing from that long list of purpose uses and form factors Think about what functions get the most use on your smartphone and remember the art of convergence Now think about not just what is most abundantly reported as disrupting the Swiss Watch market industry and combine it with what you know you use your cell phone for on a daily basissometimes The Swiss Watch market disruption is smoke and mirrors and quite irrelevant Its put forth to show something anything positive for the future of the smartwatch its the lowhanging fruit meant to distract Thats right we are back to taking that photo Most obviously and most simply put smartwatches are have been and will continue to find underperformance because they cant overcome the physical action of taking a photograph Samsung tried to incorporate a camera into its former smartwatches and failed miserably But you can purchase refurbished Gears from Best Buy if you like Its one of the reasons they took it out of the advanced Neo smartwatch and dont include it in recent versions Its one of the reasons its smartwatch business is in decline only two years post its original launch Its the top reason smartwatches get returned or never find a purchase from the inquiring consumer Its the number reason retailers offer consumers arent purchasing smartwatches as gathered in surveys conducted by Capital Ladder Advisory Group But its the number one aspect that nobody has cared to discuss more broadly as reason for the poor sellthrough results in the category that will impact the category and IDC estimates longterm By the way IDC has never openly recognized the lack of camera functionality on smartwatches not ever The smartwatch of today has lacked GPS functionality also but the camera is the most widely used and missing function from the smartwatch The physical action of taking an accurately desired photograph from your wristwell need I say more We lose complete dexterity with the attempt in theory and for which Samsung and Apple offer the camera application as a remote shutter to be used with your cell phone Even the latest Gear S avoids the camera application There is nothing nothing whatsoever smart about this Never mind trying to get all components of the camera into the smartwatch being a feat of strength the smartwatch cant overcome the logistics and physical activity of taking a photograph from a wristworn device A smart device that fails to execute on smart device featuresyou simply cant make this stuff up folks The logic is baffling but the sales arent Logic dictates where the sales will be found or not found in the case of smartwatches longerterm and to date Smartwatches are an exercise in avoiding logic and persuading retail buyers with new product inventions Its a poorly conceived product concept that had hoped and continues to hope for greater sales in the future The Swiss Watch marketI chuckle at the notion of this having any relevancy in the artistry of due diligence Simply go to any electronics store today and understand how much retail space the camera industry has lost over the last years Its staggering This is what people use cell phones for more today than ever before Selfie anybody And again the numbers validate what people use cell phones for and what is not offered by smartwatches Revisiting a USA Today article validates how consumers utilize their smartphones Miniaturize the camera all you want and try to fit it inside the smartwatch if you desire to do so but youre never going to overcome the physical impediments of taking a photo from a wristworn device And nobody wants to discuss that nobody Smartwatch not so much smarter than the Swiss Watch maybe but still yet an irrelevant comparison Consumers use their smartphones to take photos far too much to lose that utility Again this isnt an opinion Its a mainstay in the life of the consumer that has been the invention of smartphone vendors Now it has become a key impediment to smartwatch sales and the potential for smartwatches to be the next great thing No matter what direction you turn there is a brick wall that imposes itself in front of smartwatch sales Having said that the good news is that retailers are still willing to give generation smartwatches a chance For Apple Watch the even better news is that the next untethered Apple Watch will show increasing sales because carriers like ATT and Verizon will offer it Just remember the boost will be from sellin and not sellthrough The following years comparison will find with it declining sales once again And understand what untethered really means It means you can finally have only the smartwatch on you without the need for the smartphone unless you want to take photos of course You will still need to own the same operating system on a smartphone device however but at least you can do all the other primary functions independent of having the phone within respectable range of your person Purchasing a smartwatch will also carry with it a separate connectivity charge It also means you will carry a separate data charge for the smartwatch All primary operating updates to the software will have to commence on the smartphone device before applying to the smartwatch So how long can Apple and its peers fool retailers with this product category We shall see as they havent been able to persuade enough consumers to grow sales beyond retail inventory As I noted in a previous article titled Apple Watch Positives Remain Few And Far Between Apple Watch doesnt work for consumers Raymond James most recent study and survey continues to prove my logic and analysis as most accurate Smartwatches and the approach by Apple and Samsung is undeniably the wrong approach to the wearables category if the aim is delivering longerterm growth In comparison to lesser priced and lesser designated form and function wearables like Fitbits Blaze smart fitness watch their sales further example how misguided the Apple Watch and Samsung Gear smartwatch have come to be understood It took Fitbits Blaze just a matter of weeks to usurp sellthrough results of the Apple Watch just weeks The Garmin and Fitbit smartwatches are less about providing dozens of duplicate smartphone applications and more about what the consumer wants from a wearable device Additionally they carry a lesser price point that breaks down consumer barriers for trying these devices Tavis McCort of Raymond James has created consumer electronics strength index or CESI which he claims reflects demand specifically relative strength of monthly yy sellthrough of branded products sold by a number of companies in their research coverage We compile the CESI by tracking a number of variables from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Trends app downloads online best seller lists and other available thirdparty data that we have found helpful in tracking yy sellthrough trends in the past and then backwards test this data to make sure it has been directionally accurate at capturing real time sellthrough trends over the past years We compile the CESI by tracking a number of variables from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Trends app downloads online best seller lists and other available thirdparty data that we have found helpful in tracking yy sellthrough trends in the past and then backwards test this data to make sure it has been directionally accurate at capturing real time sellthrough trends over the past years In contrast Garmins Forerunner line of sports watches has seen meaningful improvement in our CESI metric over the holiday period and into this year while Fitbits CESI has remained in the s and is consistent with sellthrough trends remaining at relatively similar yy growth levels since last fall Below is the full CESI table of results over multiple quarters Id like to offer that sellthrough results of the Apple Watch are undeniably poor and the concept in general of the smartwatch begs for differentiating along the lines of consumer needs Todays Apple Watch will be enhanced but not to the extent that it will be able to disrupt the smartphone industry as Mr Hibben suggests The possibility is zero in all absolute terms and supported through pure logic and sales that pale in comparison to that of smartphones from both yesteryear and today In conclusion I would look toward other analysts and even IDC to revise their longterm forecasts for smartwatches as sales continue to underwhelm I have no intention to acquire shares or short shares of AAPL solely based on the companys proliferation of smartwatches Apple is a gigantic company with many levers it can press at any given time But even so I cant propose to hope for the company to press those levers to get some small move in the stock price and only to watch results further deteriorate quarter after quarter in and as the company has guided to lower YOY results Im simply avoiding shares of AAPL until greater valuation presents itself or a meaningful and sustainable return to growth appears The Apple Watch is a small segment of Apples total sales but when the discussion turns to the propensity of Apple being this great innovator of consumer goods this simply just isnt the case They are a great imitator and implementor of style but even with that theyve only hit one home runever That home run was the imitation of the smartphone product that implemented the art of converging technologies Everyone is entitled to hit a home run in a game but rarely are two home runs hit from the same player in one game Apple will not hit a home run with the Apple Watch or its future iterations And while its nice to be able to achieve billions in revenues from the device it proves to disadvantage both shareholders and profits I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Technology Personal Computers </div></body></html>
