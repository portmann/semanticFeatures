It Time to Load Up on Netflix NFLX Modest Money Netflix NASDAQ NFLX hit an alltime high of on December th Since then the price has gone downhill losing over of its value Learn how to trade penny stocks profitably Get started for free today I wrote a short post about Netflix in October when it was experiencing trouble I said that the longterm prospects looked promising and since then the stock has surged you couldve made over then tumbled you wouldve still made around Is Netflix still promising Discover the secret to uncovering the most profitable stocks Netflix has virtually saturated the United States There are currently around million Netflix subscribers in the United States meaning that of the entire US population million million is streaming the service Netflix has also saturated most devices upon which it could offer its service Nintendo Wiis PSs iPads and iPhones can all stream Netflix Is there more room to grow One could make the argument that theres tremendous potential for international growth which is true but thinning margins put them in a pinch Because the company is experiencing soaring content costs it may be forced to raise prices Netflix is currently charging per month they could always bring up their prices but this would probably backfire in parts of the world with much lower cable prices Also a higher price point would abandon a segment of the US market While those bullish on Netflix stick to their guns on international growth this assumes that Netflixs original content will grow with it Matching the language and culture of every individual market will be another hurdle for them to overcome and it may prove to be a very expensive process There is also the cost of becoming compliant with a tangled web of respective laws and regulations which creates another hurdle Competition is heating up with Amazon HBO Sling TV Go and even WWE Network for wrestling fans getting into the mix All of these content providers have legitimate services that are capturing market share in the US and around the world YouTube is still the massive elephant in the room as well With all the competition Netflixs leadership position in the United States is eroding If Netflix pursues aggressive international expansion they will also face existing competitors in each market It seems as if Netflix is stuck between a rock and a hard place The broad market has been sinking in so some of Netflixs decline is likely due to standard market turbulence rather than fundamental problems with the company It still experiences yearoveryear revenue growth of over but thats been going down too Over the past ten years revenue growth has been around per year In the last five years revenue growth has been an average of just over per year Even if revenue growth stays constant theres still the possibility for downward pressure on the stock a sinking tide lowers all ships Another nail in the coffin for Netflix is the fact that billionaire entrepreneur and investor Mark Cuban who disclosed a large stake in Netflix in recently bought puts on his position The puts may be to hedge his bet as he bought more stock in October but its still not a good sign The company which has historically had more cash than debt now has more debt than cash The PE ratio is skyhigh at over and it doesnt pay a dividend Growth stocks typically dont pay dividends but how much more can Netflix grow Given the current scenario it doesnt seem to be much In November there were insider sales Now company insiders can sell for a few reasons such as needing the cash for a new house college tuition etc so take this with a grain of salt But insider sells just as the stock was peaking Seems suspicious to me The CEO Director and Chief Communications Officer have all been unloading their shares and consistently at that It doesnt seem that Netflix is a good buy at this time In my humble opinion I would sit this one out Disclosure This author has no positions in any stock
