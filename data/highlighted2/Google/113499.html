class='textDiv'>Facebook Suggested Videos Isnt A Legitimate Competitor To YouTube Facebook NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Facebook is creating an adsupported video model that will clutter news feeds with suggested videos YouTube is a much stronger platform for content creators as its easier to build an audience organically and the placement of content is much more democratic Finally I dont think the new adsharing model will win over more established content creators or move the needle much for shareholders Facebook NASDAQ FB is in the initial stages of releasing a revenue sharing video model in which theyll split revenue with Facebook taking and partners taking The suggested content will come from partnered content creators like Fox Sports and the NBA However this strategy is unlikely to hurt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL by much because YouTube is simply the most dominant video viewing platform Sure Facebook video has grown but its not designed to scale the way YouTube allows content creators to expand grow and build an audience over time Googles moat in crowdsourced video is hard to compete with even for an established platform with a huge audience like Facebook <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has perfected the various algorithms for surfacing relevant content and has worked closely with top YouTube channels to ensure a unique mix of high quality content Unlike YouTube Facebook attempts to adjust the signal to noise ratio by filtering content before a user even gets anything into their newsfeed However YouTube tends to be pretty agnostic with what it shows a user on the homepage so as long theyve subscribed to the various channels In other words Facebook inherently puts content creators at a disadvantage via its algorithm so why bother Theres so much content and so little attention span where do you fit in the suggested videos with ads Unless if theyre broadcasted out to a wider number of users youre limited in reach by the number of friends you have or the number of followers Furthermore theres a cap on the number of friends you can have which is set at and the Facebook Pages dont do anything for advertisers or content producers because Facebook doesnt surface that content on users newsfeeds The only way for someone to earn money is if the algorithm picks up on a trending video and a ton of people share in response to how funny or insightful the videos is But even then thats not going to woo any of the major YouTube stars nor is it going to get the Vine stars over onto Facebook either In other words Facebook has to compete with YouTube directly but given the constraints of the platform theres low probability of success or scalability for anyone wanting to make a living off of Facebook videos In other words just because FB boasts impressive video statistics does not mean the individual partners will be successful On the Internet we often hear about the kid on Vine NYSE TWTR who gets paid a couple thousand dollars per video just to include a product or in the case of YouTube you have multimillionaire independent video creators who have built a following ie Michelle Phan PewDewPie Bethany Mota Justin Bieber Yeah I included Bieber because he became famous thanks to YouTube then blew up once he got a record label to get behind him The point is YouTube and Vine have a consistent track record of shooting out super stars whereas Facebook is more for the community oriented guy who needs a way to plug into his social life while he stalks grandma on a Saturday afternoon and his girlfriend later into the night Its not a place for people who want to build a strong online presence nor is it going to generate the kind of additional revenue that will lift the eyebrows of investors The stock really hasnt reacted that much to the news either so its an attentiongrabbing story but in reality Facebook isnt really in any position to knock YouTube off of its lofty pedestal Also the content will be dropped at random into everybodys Facebook feed My guess People wont want to see content that they have not first subscribed to Also building an organic audience on Facebook is next to impossible hence YouTube is a great place for aspiring video bloggers and will continue to be So to conclude I still think Facebook is a great stock to own and invest into But I dont see its recent move in videos adding much value to shareholders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>on the other hand is still expensive for my tastes but it still owns dominant web and mobile properties so you cant complain about the durability of Googles earnings Source Facebook Suggested Videos Isnt A Legitimate Competitor To YouTube Disclosure Iwe have no
