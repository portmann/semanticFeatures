as an indicator of Apples decline Sales were probably limited by sheer availability and dont indicate supplydemand balance If anything the sales number indicates that the primary thesis of Apple bears of a sales slowdown in China is unsubstantiated SA contributor Michael Blair has asserted that the iPhone ss Plus launch weekend sales of million should frighten investors I disagree His case is based on many flawed assumptions including assumptions about a slowdown in China impacting Apples NASDAQ AAPL growth The lynchpin of Blairs negative take on iPhone s first weekend sales is that of those sales supposedly went to China He bases that assertion on another assertion that Apple reports China contributes more than of iPhone revenue These assertions are not supported by the facts that Apple has disclosed regarding China revenue In the June quarter Apple reported total revenue not just iPhone but everything for Greater China which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan of billion which was just of Apples total revenue of billion Apple doesnt disclose a geographic breakdown of iPhone sales but this percentage correlates reasonably well with Gartners recent estimate of million unit sales for iPhone in China Greater China assumed for the June quarter That would put the unit sale percentage at about of total iPhone unit sales for the quarter of million How does one go from roughly of sales to of launch weekend sales It simply isnt reasonable Especially because China as accounted for in the weekend sales figure does not include Hong Kong Hong Kong was part of the launch last year and is accounted separately as part of the rest of the world So the percentage of opening weekend sales for China should be lower than the Greater China percentage by virtue of not including Hong Kong When we make these numerical adjustments the more reasonable estimate for China is about million for China of the total and about million for the rest of the world including Hong Kong So the rest of the world posts roughly flat yy results for the first weekend I doubt that the rest of the world sales really mean anything other than an indication of how Apple chose to allocate initial iPss Plus production geographically Recent data about the split between Samsung OTCSSNLF and TSMC NYSE TSM for production of the A processor in the new iPhones is revealing TSMC is estimated to have received of the iPssPlus business much higher than the I initially thought The important takeaway here is that Apple had to hire both foundries in order to make the million units sold on launch weekend This indicates that the number of units sold was limited by availability and not by demand Lack of supplydemand balance is typical for initial iPhone launches and if thats the case here theres really no conclusion to be drawn about rest of the world sales Apple had to include China in the first weekend launch As an important and rapidly growing area for Apple not including China would have been interpreted as an insult Theres a deeper problem embedded in Blairs assertion about China sales It entails an intellectual trap of sorts that I was fairly sure the Apple bears would walk into regarding the first weekend sales figures Mr Blair has echoed the widely held sentiment that Chinas assumed economic downturn would be the downfall of Apple He makes the case for this scenario in a previous article Will Competition In China Upset The Apple Cart Blair appears to see no contradiction between his bearish view of the Chinese market and his assumption of a disproportionate of first weekend sales in China But I do I submit that if the bears have been correct about China then first weekend sales in China should have been weak and the percent contribution much less than last quarters of global iPhone sales If thats the case then the rest of the world outperformed last years sales Ive prepared a chart below that shows relative contributions of Rest of the World compared to China for a wide range of scenarios characterized by the per cent sales contribution of China Theres only a small region between the two vertical dashed lines where either the rest of the world or China doesnt outperform Blairs assumption of sales contribution for China on launch weekend amounts to trying to have his cake and eat it too He cant do both but he tries nevertheless In addition to China Blair offers other information to bolster the bear case One of them is the Statista chart reproduced below The chart is as of the end of calendar so it excludes much of the sales expansion iPhone has enjoyed due to the iPhone Plus in the past year But I believe that the number for iPhone installed base is about right The number for Android however appears to be an overstatement As of Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL recent September Event <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>CEO Sundar Pichai stated that the number of day active Android devices smartphones and tablets was billion up from the billion he stated at the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>IO developers conference in June How does Statista get to an installed base of billion Android smartphones by the end of I guess it depends on what you consider to be the installed base This goes back to the longstanding controversy regarding white box Android sales in China Many of these phones are little better than feature phones that never get registered with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and dont participate in the Android ecosystem or generate revenue for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Should they be considered part of the installed base I dont think so So I think the number for the Android smartphone installed base was about billion as of the end of Another piece of data that Blair shows is the relative performance of the iPhone s compared to the Samsung Galaxy S using Geekbench Ive discussed the widening performance gap between Apples SOCs and commodity processors such as the Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Snapdragon so Ill simply refer readers to Anandtechs preliminary results for the iPhone s When you look at the big performance picture Apple comes out ahead in almost every category The only processor that really can be said to be close is the Samsung Exynos in the Galaxy S That is testimony in my view to the power of the custom SOC paradigm that both Apple and Samsung have embraced The rest of the commodity Android phones are a year or more behind Apple and no threat to its premium position And this leads us to the important takeaway Apples latest iPhones cement its position as the premium smartphone brand Apple bears never seem to understand why Apple is earning of the profits of the smartphone industry Theres a good reason for this and its not savvy marketing fueling the next iFad That explanation is so worn out The simplest explanation the one that doesnt require the convoluted rationalizations of the Apple bears is that iPhones command a higher price because theyre better Thats an assertion that is open to reasonable disagreement of course but I consider it well substantiated by the facts Benchmarks substantiate the superiority in terms of processing speed of Apples custom SOCs The high adoption rate of iOS now over of all iOS users substantiates the superiority of iOS compared to Android in which the latest release has a very low adoption rate of Based on what I see in the quality of the iPhone ss Plus hardware and software Im very bullish for the December quarter I expect that as consumers realize how strong the product is this year demand will build I still expect iPhone sales to top last years very impressive December record for yy unit sales growth in the mid teens The first weekend sales if anything are encouraging not frightening since they indicate that demand in China remains strong We only use your contact details to reply to
