Microsoft would do well to follow this strategy.Microsoft can also greatly further its single most focused on and strategic current initiative of unifying its total platform as a whole if it can get Send to show traction over time.I explained why this is important to Microsoft prior in stating, "Microsoft has one goal right now and that's to unify its platforms into one, synergistic, closed-loop ecosystem".<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Send, if it can show traction, would be an easy to use and device agnostic app that could be a huge new user base introduction funnel into the Microsoft product ecosystem. (Uncertainty) </span>Again, Microsoft clearly understands that this is a must-do in order to survive going forward and has deployed Power BI and its other SMB/enterprise freemium products in an effort to cover lost ground.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So far Microsoft has done this quite effectively I might add. (Uncertainty) </span>Most people, especially recently, view productivity as productivity.Instead of reaching for a brand what polling and usage rates are showing is that more and more users are simply picking the best product.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Send can evidence itself to be the Slack-mobile that even Slack to this point hasn't proven it can be or if Send can show to the markets that it being integrated with Power BI is the difference maker in the BI arena that's going to matter in a big way for Microsoft as a whole. (Uncertainty) </span>Again, at the very least it shows a strategy and a culture shift from our "grandfathers Microsoft" to one that can be much, much more relevant in the new tech normal.I have great expectations for what Send and think that its progress is something Microsoft investors and enthusiasts should watch.I'll update readers as developments come along.Source: Microsoft: Send, Slack, And Power BI Disclosure: I am/we are long MSFT, AAPL, FB, TWTR.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
