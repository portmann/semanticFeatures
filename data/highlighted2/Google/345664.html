the most lucrative routes and FedExs customers just want to lower their costs by destroying FedExs margins FedExs NYSE FDX CEO is in a dangerous state of denial and is missing the point Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Uber Private UBER Lyft Private LYFT and other customers and competitors may not be able to chip away much of FedExs sales this year But thats not the point at all The point is that they will slowly but surely and with increasing speed and effect keep stealing FedExs mostlucrative routes and segments and aim at lowering delivery prices in order to negotiate better fees with FedEx This will hurt FedExs sales only a bit but it will absolutely destroy FedExs margins FedExs CEO probably thinks Amazon wants to take over FedExs entire business whereas in reality Amazon most likely just wants to destroy FedExs margins to save money and take the most lucrative business including its internal delivery business Naturally United Parcel Service NYSE UPS will be impacted as well But new competition and margin pressure is not the only issue for FedEx The current valuation of x forward nonGAAP adjusted earnings that still ignores net debt is a problem as well especially in connection with the following factors FedEx operates in an oligopoly with UPS and USPS in the US and with DHL internationally After the pending TNT Express OTCPKTNTEF acquisition its external growth opportunities will be very limited due to further mergers having a slim chance of being approved by antitrust regulators So the topline growth is most probably peaking and there are very few new organic growth opportunities at the high ROI that FedExs current business generates Margins are most probably peaking as well Profits have been rising much faster than topline growth partly due to cost cutting This margin expansion trend is clearly unsustainable FedEx currently operates very close to the highest margins of the past decade and we are arguably significantly closer to the top of the business cycle than to its bottom FedEx is a very capitalintensive business with highfixed costs It even touts this as their major advantage I see it as a weakness if the industry starts changing FedExs CEO correctly argues that no customer accounts for more than of its sales and it will take time and money for competitors to make a major dent in sales But what the CEO is missing to mention is that even a small drop in sales will have an outsized impact on operating profits due to the high operating leverage that works both ways as well as because of the negative product margin mix when the company loses the most lucrative business first Given the cyclicality strong operational leverage and at least some financial leverage FedEx also is an excellent hedge of a long US stock portfolio against a potential US and global slowdown In short FedEx is a good short candidate in the long run but may see some strength for one or two more quarters Even FedExs CEO boasts of the high margins and advertises them to the entire world in case some competitor or customer missed the fact If we were to isolate our ecommerce business one could argue that FedEx is one of the most profitable ecommerce companies in business today This boasting about high margins is bound to keep motivating Amazon and other FedEx customers to build small flexible networks of their own to service their most lucrative deliveries and put pressure on FedEx to negotiate better rates History is littered with lessons of CEOs underestimating competitors and the industrys potential fastpaced change FedExs CEO sees his industry in the narrow definition of competitors considering only the big three that control of the US shipments failing to see new entrants and most importantly to see its own customers as its competitors So while I agree with FedExs CEO that it would take time and money to seriously take on FedEx I believe the negative effects on FedEx will be stronger than what the CEO and the markets expect and they also will happen sooner I will debunk FedEx CEOs statement that it would take way too much time and money to take on FedEx Time and money are totally irrelevant for some customerscompetitors such as Amazon Here is why First money is not an issue We live whether I like it or not in an era of ZIRP and NIRP where strong companies are flush with cash and are able to borrow even more at almost no cost or issue new shares at high valuations In this funny money era a startup like Uber can grow from nothing to a B valuation in five years Moreover it is not without interest that Amazons Jeff Bezos participated in one of the earliest Uber funding rounds through his Bezos Expeditions I see a clear connection there with the current Amazons ventures into FedExs territory via planes and drones As a side note Ubers current valuation is higher than FedExs When Ubers valuation grows to B and Uber takes over FedEx with its stock I believe that will be a clear sign of the peak of this bubble cycle similar to AOLs takeover by Time Warner years ago at the dotcom bubble peak How much time would it take really to hurt FedEx If you have the money and use a leasing business model instead of building or owning the infrastructure and the fleet the time drastically contracts Plus markets are always forwardlooking Even if competitors start chipping away at FedExs most lucrative business very slowly the markets will discount some of the erosion forward and this could mean weakness for FedExs stock as soon as the current earnings euphoria fizzles and as soon as the TNT revenues are reflected in the numbers in several quarters from now Amazon has always been focused on the long picture so time does not matter for the company as long as the investment makes sense in the very long run Amazon is known for taking a longterm view and not caring about margins at all in the short run When Amazon just masters to take care of a majority of its own deliveries this would hurt FedEx only to the tune of roughly of sales and a bit more in margins This sounds benign However what if Amazon drops the Abomb and runs their delivery network at zero margins or even at a loss significantly undercutting FedExs margins either with the goal of attracting new clients at the beginning or simply because their goal may not be to take over FedExs business but to depress their margins to save on delivery costs paid to them Something akin to what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is doing with its Fiber business Pushing existing providers to innovate and offer better and cheaper services A similar move could push down FedEx and UPS margins on a majority of their business not just Amazons business with FedEx Think about it Is there a business that Amazon entered where margins have not dropped Amazon is a poster example of zerocost capital a zeromargin model This is going to destroy FedExs and UPS highmargin highROI model While FedEx owns most of its fleet Amazon is renting making it much more flexible to scale up and down as needed This is in line with the lowmargin lowrisk high scalability approach of Amazon Unlike FedExs fat margins Amazon operates practically close to breakeven so they dont provide such a strong incentive by competitors to take Amazons share I believe FedExs CEO is downplaying the threats facing the company Amazon and other competitors will chip away at FedExs attractive highmargin business naturally attacking the most lucrative routes and segments first and aiming to lower FedExs margins and their own costs The capitalintensive FedEx will slowly but surely underperform Im bearish on FedEx in the long run though I see one or two more quarters of strong results which will likely drive the stock price higher Im also bullish on Amazon in the long run but the price is stretched Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within
