Big Dividend Investments We Like More Than Ford Ford Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Ford offers a big dividend yield And if you factor in the special dividend the yield jumps to Ford faces significant risk exposures such as the industrys wide cyclical swings Fords lack of competitive advantage its expensive workforce and its absurd pension plan assumptions Ford NYSE F currently offers a big dividend yield And if you factor in the special dividend they paid earlier this year the yield jumps to However we believe there are better dividend paying opportunities than Ford because of the significant risk exposures the company faces such as the industrys wide cyclical swings Fords lack of competitive advantage its expensive workforce and its absurd pension assumptions In this article we review Fords dividend and risk exposures and then provide details on five big dividend stocks that we like better than Ford The dividend has been increasing steadily since being cut to zero during the financial crisis And this years special dividend may become somewhat of a regular occurrence in the future because it gives Ford some flexibility to deal with the industrys wide cyclical swings ie they can skip the special dividend in challenging years but still maintain the regular dividend The Auto Industrys Wide Cyclical Swings By nature the auto industry is exposed to the risks of wide market swings For example we are just coming out of one of the worst where Ford had to cut its dividend to zero and General Motors relied on a government bailout just to survive Fords beta is over one according to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Finance which means the stock price has a history of being more sensitive to marketwide swings than average Specifically Ford sells autos in North America South America Europe the Middle East Africa and Asia Pacific and any downturns in these markets can stall the companys growth plans and there is very little they can do about it Generally speaking stocks with higher betas should compensate investors by offering higher longterm returns assuming the overall market rises but this may not be the case for Ford considering its lack of competitive advantage Fords Lack of Competitive Advantage The auto industry is extremely competitive and Ford has no significant competitive advantage versus many of its peers For starters the high capital costs of manufacturing autos once acted as a barrier to entry but as efficiencies have increased and foreign competition grows Ford profits are increasingly pressured Plus new disruptive technologies such as autonomous and electric vehicles continue to put pressure on the company Ford has recently been able to increase profitability by increasing operating efficiency for example theyve benefited significantly from economies of scale by reducing the number of common vehicle manufacturing platforms over the last several years but this effort can only go so far and its unlikely theyll be able to grow meaningfully by wrestling market share away from their competitors For example Fords attempts to grow its highermargin luxury Lincoln brand could bear some fruit but realistically not much because competition is already so intense in the industry Historically speaking it seems many hardworking Ford people were able to build quality vehicles and lives with the help of collective bargaining However as competition grows at home and abroad Fords workforce is relatively expensive and risky For example Ford acknowledges the risk on page of their most recent annual report by saying A work stoppage or other limitations on production at Ford or supplier facilities for any reason including but not limited to labor disputes could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations Substantially all of the hourly employees in Fords automotive operations are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements Also worth noting its not just the automotive operations workers that are expensive For example the following table from page of Fords Proxy Statement shows how much some of the big wigs are taking home As a specific example CEO Mark Fields took home million in total compensation over the last three years Thats no small amount Wed be remiss not to point out the growing pension plan risks created by artificially low interest rates being set by central banks around the world For example according to page FS of Fords most recent annual report the longterm return assumption for Fords US Pension Plan is This assumption becomes totally absurd when you realize the US Pension Plans target allocation is fixed income and growth assets primarily alternative investments which include hedge funds real estate and private equity and public equity There is virtually zero chance they will achieve this target return considering interest rates are at alltime lows Realistically they might achieve this target if they were invested in growth assets For some perspective weve included some of JP Morgans longterm capital market assumptions below As the table shows the experts expect US equities eg US large cap to deliver a compound return of only on average over the longterm For further reference the current yield on the year US treasury is below and investment grade corporate bonds arent much better according to the WSJ Disney for example just issued year investment grade corporate bonds at And according to page FS Fords US Pension Plan is invested mainly in government bonds and investment grade corporate debt as shown in the following table Its simply absurd to believe Ford is going to meet its longterm return assumption of and almost inevitably they will have to pony up more cash for those pensions and that will be a drag on the stock price Valuing Ford based on its big dividend payments alone is not enough For example if we discount Fords dividend payments billion including the special dividend by its cost of equity we use CAPM derived and assign an optimistic growth rate of the company is still only worth billion which is roughly below the current market value of its equity And if we ignore the special dividend then its worth only billion using the same assumptions Alternatively if we discount free cash flow of billion by an assumed weighted average cost of capital of the same growth rate and adjust for its outstanding debt its still only worth billion which is roughly lower than its current market value These valuations are basic estimates meant only to be a guideline and theyre highly sensitive to our assumptions For example if Ford can achieve a higher growth rate of only then the discounted free cash flow valuation quickly changes from Ford being overvalued to undervalued However it seems unlikely for Ford to achieve a significantly higher growth rate given the high level of competition and risks that weve described previously The Bottom Line on Ford and its Dividend The bottom line is that Fords bottom line will continue to be challenged going forward due to the industrys wide cyclical swings automakers tend to have higher betas Fords lack of competitive advantage competition in the industry is fierce and growing its expensive workforce operations people and the big wigs and its absurd pension plan assumptions artificially low interest rates will cause pension plan returns to fall short of assumptions Realistically Fords basic dividend not including the special dividend is safe and the stock will likely experience moderate longterm price appreciation However given the risks we believe there are better investment opportunities elsewhere EPR Properties Yield If you are an incomefocused investor EPR Properties NYSE EPR stands out and we like it better than Ford Its a real estate investment trust REIT that offers a big safe growing monthly dividend It invests in properties such as megaplex theaters entertainment retail centers public charter schools waterparks and golf entertainment complexes In addition to the nice dividend payments it also offers attractive diversification benefits and it has exhibited very low volatility And even though its price has already been performing well this year we believe it has the growth prospects to support continued longterm price appreciation AmeriGas Partners Yield AmeriGas NYSE APU is the largest propane distributor in the US with about retail market share its organized as a master limited partnership MLP and it currently pays a big safe growing distribution yield It also offers low volatility a low beta and an exceptionally attractive return on invested capital Further we believe AmeriGas is uniquely positioned to successfully execute on its growththroughacquisitions strategy and fears of a declining propane market are largely overblown For incomefocused investors we believe AmeriGas is a better option than Ford HCP Inc Yield HCP Inc NYSE HCP is a big dividend healthcare real estate investment trust that is also a dividend aristocrat ie its increased its dividend more than years in a row The company has recently faced challenges related to its largest tenant HCR ManorCare and we believe HCPs decision to spinoff HCR ManorCare into a separate company is a smart move that will unlock value for shareholders And we also view yesterdays press release regarding the new interim CEO to be a positive part of the corporate restructuring process If you are a longterm incomefocused investor we like HCPs dividend and growth prospects significantly more than Fords Frontier Communications Yield Frontier NASDAQ FTR is a big dividend telecom company that is currently trading at an attractive price Frontier paid out million in dividends last year and it also received million in government subsidies Annual Report p Said differently Uncle Sam pays of Frontiers dividend Frontier has created a niche for itself by operating in regions that are heavily subsidized and they deepened their foothold in that space with their April st billion acquisition of assets from Verizon We believe Frontiers niche is attractive the company easily covers its dividend payments and its current valuation is compelling We like Frontier more than Ford Main Street Capital Yield Main Street NYSE MAIN is an internally managed Business Development Company and we like it more than Ford because of its bigger dividend and relatively low volatility Additionally its investment income consistently exceeds its dividend payments and its net asset value continues to enable additional supplemental dividend payments We believe it is worth significantly more than its current market price and if you are a longterm investor Main Street Capital could be a valuable addition to your diversified incomefocused portfolio The information on the five bigdividend investments we like more than Ford is meant only to be an overview Before investing its critical to understand an opportunity including its risks and for this reason weve provided our most recent full report on each of the five investments in this appendix And with regards to Ford we certainly do NOT believe its the worst investment ever nor do we think its going bankrupt tomorrow In fact we realize the dividend is nice and we suspect Ford will deliver some price appreciation over the longterm albeit with plenty of risk However we also believe there are better bigdividend investment opportunities than Ford and weve highlighted five of them in this article Disclosure Iwe have no
