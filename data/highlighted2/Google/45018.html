Yahoos transformation under Mayer has not yet materialized as revenues continue to shrink The potential return of the Yahoo Japan assets to shareholders will buy Mayer and Yahoo more time and flexibility for mobile business Search deal with Mozilla and restructure partnership with Microsoft will increase revenues going forward New mobile search app can help the company compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>to be indispensible to digital information Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO released its most recent earnings report on April st in which it missed market estimates for both sales and profits CEO Marissa Mayer has been emphasizing the companys strategic imperatives which revolve around mobile technology The new focus on the company is showing considerable growth and potential but has not yet been able to turn the Yahoos fortunes around While the companys core valuation is still extremely cheap when taking into account its assets as analysts have covered extensively investors are still worried by the lack of progress in revenue growth But Mayer teased investors with the possibility of returning more value to shareholders buying herself time as she attempts to challenge in the mobile search market and for the mobile first strategy to begin driving revenue growth Mayer has previously been able to buy herself time to carry out the transformation of the company by returning value to shareholders such as the taxfree spin off of the companys remaining shares in Alibaba NYSE BABA Worth approximately billion the announced spin off is on schedule to take place during the fourth quarter of and has caused activist investors to give Mayer more space to carry out her plan Now she is floating the possibility of a similar transaction regarding Yahoo Japan Corp OTCPKYAHOF which has a market cap of roughly billion Yahoos stake in the company is worth more than billion During the earnings call Mayer mentioned that the company had hired advisers to maximize the value of this stake exploring all possibilities to return capital to investors The return of capital is vital to the company right now as revenue from Yahoos legacy business has consistently fallen over the past few years During that time however the stock price has been propped up by its stakes in the Asian companies giving Mayer the time and financial flexibility to make the MaVeNS strategy which is her shorthand for mobile video native and social viable While this activity is transparent to shareholders it works because of the success the company has had at carrying out the return of capital and cost cutting Besides the planned spin off of Alibaba later this year Yahoo has returned billion to shareholders since Mayer was named CEO in This is well beyond any public commitments the company has made according to Mayer and has reduced the companys share count by Besides the strong history of capital returns Yahoo under Mayer has also done a good job of cutting away some of the fat of the company In her two and half years as CEO Mayer has closed office locations approximately products that were underperforming or not key to the company reduced the number of contractors by nearly and reduced the fulltime employee headcount by nearly The cut costs along with the return of capital to shareholders has made the mobilefirst transition possible which will begin materially increasing profits in During Mayers two and a half years as CEO Yahoos revenue from the MaVeNS businesses has grown from what was essentially nothing to more than billion in annual revenue in The company has made acquisitions including Tumblr Flurry and BrightRoll that amount to billion This sounds like a large amount but looks much more reasonable when taking the value the company has returned to shareholders over that time While revenue from these businesses continues to grow with Tumblr on its own on pace to record revenues of billion a year eventually there is still lots of progress to be made Yahoos share of search has continued to fall since Mayer took over However recent activity and a new future plan could turn this trend around The most recent quarter was the first full one since Yahoo entered into an agreement with Mozilla to be its default search engine The partnership increased volume and profitability in the search market for Yahoo attracting new users and retaining them on Yahoos services Yahoo also restructured its partnership with Microsoft during the last quarter giving it more flexibility The new deal gives Yahoo more control over how search results are presented as well as how to monetize those search results More importantly the new agreement also gives Yahoo the right to terminate the contract in June These two deals should immediately increase revenues going forward This is key as the company focuses in on becoming as Mayer put it in the earnings call to be an indispensible guide to digital information Mayer who built her reputation working on Googles search engine has the experience needed to help the company do so Instead of focusing on the traditional search model such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Yahoo will focus on a newer more diversified field of search This kind of search assistant will be more important in the future as search continues to shift away from desktops and more towards mobile One example that Mayer gave during her earnings call was searching for JFK on the way to the airport This new kind of search would be able to use the users information to understand that they were on the way to the airport and would pull up their flight information instead of pulling up information about the US president The advanced search model will only grow to be more important in the future as people perform their search needs using new devices such as televisions and watches The possibilities of this newer field of search are vast and Yahoo has the advantage of having a large amount of data about its users thanks to its legacy There are rumors that Yahoo is already working on a pilot version of a mobile search app which it plans to release during the second quarter The algorithmic analysis for both the onemonth and threemonth forecasts for Yahoo is especially strong as can be seen in the figure above The threemonth forecast is especially strong with a signal strength of This indicates that the algorithm believes that the stock price is in currently undervalued which makes sense considering the companys stakes in both Alibaba and Yahoo Japan With the potential further return of value to shareholders through a sale or spinoff of Yahoo Japan the introduction of a new mobile search application and strong algorithmic analysis Yahoo is a good
