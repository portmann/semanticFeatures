style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>recently announced Android Pay as a launch partner with a new tokenization security service from Visa The Visa plan includes blocking transaction fees on mobile payments for technology companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is positioned to benefit long term via other arrangements including marketing fees from credit card issuers and loyalty programs with consumers Making money off any service is always a nice outcome but sometimes the intent of services is to maintain customer loyalty or attract new customers In the case of mobile payments the vision heading into the end of May was that new payment providers would collect small fees that might eventually add up to billions The news of the day suggests that the apple cart might have been turned over by the payment processors of Visa NYSE V and MasterCard NYSE MA With the recent release of Android Pay by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL the expectations were that the tech giant would garner transaction fees similar to Apple NASDAQ AAPL It only seemed logical that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>would sign a similar deal The news though suggests <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>was blocked out of the mobile payments fees and that Apple might be next The payment networks including Visa introduced a new tokenization standard for cardsecurity The new Digital Enablement Program by Visa VDEP is designed to allow for financial institutions and technology companies to quickly scale mobile payments without complex connections The company made the following statement in the press release regarding the fees for the platform Nocost commercial framework Financial institutions merchants and technology companies can drive growth through a simple scalable commercial construct with no passthrough fees between technology partners and financial institutions At the time of the May release Visa listed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>as a launch partner What isnt as obvious is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>would so freely forego the fees that the card issuers agreed to pay Apple Not to mention the mobile payment services are the ones that control the consumers Why allow Visa and MasterCard to dictate the transaction fees The part that isnt clear and what the market might misunderstand is that the terms clearly state no passthrough fees but the original Wall Street Journal article clearly states that marketing arrangements can still exist between technology firms and financial institutions Otherwise it seems very odd that Visa could legislate that it collects tons of fees while also blocking other participants from making money Michael Cheng from paymentweek went further to explain the potential arrangements that will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and possibly even Apple to make money without direct transaction fees from credit card issuers Many expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>to offer other types of moneymaking arrangements to affiliated banks Marketing arrangements such as logo placement and other promotional terms could help the tech business profit from Android Pay while keeping its services enticing and affordable for consumers The deal Apple obtained from the major banks is of the credit card transactions values and for each debit card purchase The individual amounts are relatively small but it would eventually add up to billions if enough customers use the service with trillions spent annually via debit and credit cards If the news is accurately covered by the media that Apple will increasingly face pressure to not collect fees in Europe and eventually sign a similar deal in the US when the current contracts are up in roughly two years it ushers forward the theory that Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>will look to push the payment networks out of the picture The ongoing theory all along is that the technology companies would work out a method to eliminate the high costs and big margins that go to Visa and MasterCard that dont even take the financial risks A couple options already in the works is the IBM NYSE IBM test using blockchain technology for a lowcost payment network and the major retailers working on their own payment system called CurrentC Neither system appears a legitimate threat to the current payment networks but the backing of a scorned Apple or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>that control the mobile customers could quickly kick start these or similar efforts For now though the amount that is at stake for Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is minimal According to the numbers calculated by payments expert Karen Webster Android Pay will only have an estimated million phones with a current enough operating system and NFC capabilities to handle mobile payments At the same time common knowledge is that Android phone owners earn and spend considerably less than iPhone owners Remember that trillion spent via credit cards on Apple Pay is only equivalent to billion in fees <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>expects total revenue to approach billion this year and Apple is headed towards billion in total revenue The revenue potential from mobile payments is immaterial at this point to the levels the tech giants generate from current business lines Visa alone processes close to trillion in annual payments so it isnt that the payments spend doesnt exist for billions of fees but the ability to capture a large percentage of the market will take a considerable amount of time and likely fail to match the other revenue buckets of the tech giants One thing to keep in mind though is that Visa is worth billion and produces annual revenue of around billion Combined with MasterCard the top two payment networks are worth over billion and generate annual revenue of billion These amounts are far from insignificant if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>or Apple could capture more of the revenue from payments in the future Since a fraction of a percent of a small user base would add up to very little revenue currently the impact is very minimal now The bigger issue for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is keeping consumers searching with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>on mobile phones <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>pointed out in its own blog post that countries including the US and Japan already see more searches via mobile devices than via desktop The news of the last few weeks regarding mobile payments are no doubt interesting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>apparently accepted a mobile payments agreement that doesnt include transaction fees even though Apple managed to work a arrangement that included fees The news is peculiar because it appears that Visa and MasterCard are trying to dictate terms to the technology giants It doesnt appear all that clear whether Apple agrees with them At the same time the lack of transaction fees isnt as important to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>in the near term The number of potential customers and the level of mobile payments wont add up to material revenues for a long time Ultimately though one needs to consider that the technology giants will eventually control the consumer payments experience via their mobile phones and the payment networks will disappear into the background <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>will eventually make its money from payments but it just wont occur now Source
