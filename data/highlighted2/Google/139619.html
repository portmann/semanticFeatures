cause of the correction With Apples NASDAQ AAPL share price already down from its high in April numerous business articles have announced that Apple is in a correction By the usual definition corrections occur to adjust for overvaluation of a stock Even at its all time high Apple wasnt over valued making this a false correction As Apple prepares to unleash new products this Fall it already appears to be losing the Game of Expectations in much the same way that Ned Stark lost the Game of Thrones Paul R La Monicas article about the correction in CNN Money should serve as a comprehensive list of talking points for Apple critics for the rest of the year His explanation for the correction is disappointing iPhone sales and the Canalys report citing Apples market share decline in China in the June quarter Can Apple find new geographies to drive growth Probably not Will they be able to lift the average selling price Probably not Are they dependent on the iPhone Yes Theres only so much room to grow I like this quote because it captures so succinctly all the classic arguments about why Apple must fail Before I pick apart the Gillis quote let me first talk about La Monicas other key points Disappointing iPhone sales Okay I was a little disappointed A lot of us were This is one area where Apple really lost the Game of Expectations I may even have had some small part in that for which I am duly penitent Mea culpa But how disappointed can you be over a yy increase in unit sales The depiction of disappointment always seems a little self serving coming from perennial Apple critics Declining market share in China Canalys reported that Apple had slipped to third place in market share in China in the June quarter down from first place in the March quarter The focus on sequential changes in product shipment or market share has often been exploited by Apple critics to portray Apple as on the decline Such portrayals are inherently deceptive Being a consumer electronics company all of Apples products are subject to seasonal variations Sequential declines are not unusual especially from the December quarter Apples smartphone market share in China has tended to follow the ups and downs of Apples global market share Sequential changes simply are not a meaningful metric but year over year changes are In the chart below I plot global market share date from IDC As is my custom I use the IDC data to calculate market share among the top five smart phone vendors for any given quarter This excludes generic white box smartphones In the same plot I include Kantar WorldPanels smart phone market share data for China Note that the final Q data point for China market share is approximated from Kantars data for the three months ending in May Kantar doesnt have data yet for the full June quarter As can be seen from the chart Apple posted a decline in market share in China from calendar Q but Q was quite a bit higher the Q The sequential decline from Q means nothing by itself Apple cant find new geographies to drive growth First of all its not clear that Apple really needs to for the for next few years Its not as if Greater China is saturated with iPhones What China is saturated with is cheap white box Android phones that nobody wants anymore The upgrade potential is still huge This is the reason why iPhone sales were up over in Greater China in the June quarter as Apple disclosed during their June quarter conference call But Apple is growing robustly in emerging markets with revenue up yy iPhone sales were up in India In most other regions iPhone sales growth is outpacing the overall smartphone market by healthy multiples Apple wont be able to lift the iPhone ASP At last quarter Apples iPhone ASP is the envy of the industry Everyone knows that Apple scoops up most of the profit of the entire smartphone industry According to WSJ Apple made of the profit from selling just of the phones in the March quarter Why is this even an issue Apple is too dependent on iPhone This is one of the many variations of an old stratagem in the Game of Expectations A critic will point to an area where Apple has been very successful and manage to twist it into a negative iPhone has been phenomenally successful and grown much faster than its other products therefore Apple is too dependent on iPhone As if there was nothing to Apple besides iPhone Last quarter Apples noniPhone revenue was billion Thats more than Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL total revenue last quarter of billion If we apply Apples corporate operating margin rate of then the noniPhone operating profit would have been billion once again beating Googles total operating profit of billion Only in terms of yy growth did <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>beat noniPhone Apple Theres only so much room to grow This sounds like a veiled version of the law of large numbers argument another Game of Expectations stratagem Apple has been hugely successful therefore it cant continue to be hugely successful Ive already dealt with the law of large numbers argument so let me assume that this was meant to be more limited in scope to just iPhone sales Another point that was made at the June quarter earnings call is that only of the installed base of iPhone customers have upgraded to the iPhone Plus CEO Tim Cook believes that the upgrade cycle for iPhone and its successors still has legs and hes right After a few years of following media coverage of Apple its become clear to me that theres a proApple camp and an antiApple camp Neither side exhibits a great deal of original thought but just keeps recycling the same themes over and over again Since Apple shares have a great deal of retail investor ownership the media may exercise excessive influence over the stocks price The average retail investor may not be well enough informed to filter out the rhetoric from either side As such Apples stock price is to some degree a function of which side holds the upper hand in the eyes of the public Judging by the coverage of this correction it appears to me that the antiApple camp holds sway at the moment Just the use of the term correction says a lot At its peak share price in June Apple had a PE of about hardly an overvaluation Now that the share price has fallen as of this writing to below the PE is at about according to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Finance The correction has the character of a fever and what Apple investors want to know is when will the fever break Of course its impossible to know for certain These kinds of fevers always play to investor fears and insecurities Apple could always screw up The next iPhone could be a flop It could happen But Im not going to lose any sleep over it The product pipeline is very strong going into the December quarter led by an invigorated iPhone SS Plus In the coming months well probably hear all the reasons why Apple is going to fail repeated in infinite variation The difficult comps will get frequent mention Leaked supplier reports will claim that iPhone sales are disappointing Apple Watch will be an unmitigated disaster The litany of negative speculation will seem endless And it probably wont end until Apple reports fiscal Q results next January Under the circumstances I wouldnt blame anyone for bailing out of Apple especially if theres profit to be taken I wont be doing that I continue to regard the negative sentiment as an opportunity to accumulate especially as the negative sentiment reaches fever pitch Source
