class='textDiv'>Pelorus Capital Weekly Update March th Seeking Alpha The big news this week was the US GDP print which was revised to from Aside from this other economics news new home sales existing home sales flash PMI results were mixed Housing prices continue to climb while a slowdown in sales was largely due to seasonal factors such as Januarys blizzard on the east coast Yearoveryear growth in industrial production was down again This is unsurprising to us as its fitting with a number of macro themes including a high US dollar and slower international growth This creates a slight drag on GDP growth for the US and fits into our view that US GDP growth will average around for the foreseeable future On the earnings side since we are approaching earnings season we suspect there may be some upside on an aggregate basis for the SP on earnings terms The recent increases in oil prices coupled with the decline in USD improves the picture for US companies should it continue However we view the x multiple on the SP as inflated in spite of low interest rates In China this week the most interesting news to us was the default of Guangxi Nonferrous Metals Group which defaulted on billion of debts including bank debt China didnt allow defaults on SOEs until and even now many market participants still assume that the government backstops many entities Indeed Guangxi had been receiving government support for many years thus it is quite a statement that the entity has been allowed to default Because Chinas SOEs hold significant bank debt we view this as a significant negative for the Chinese financial system largely because SOE lending is a far larger portion of banks balance sheets than private sector lending Because of the assumed government backstop until now markets assumed that the SOE loans on balance sheets were safe This is no longer the case We are particularly bearish on the Chinese resource companies and the banks that lend to them According to documents submitted to parliament by one of Chinas coal companies Huaibei Mining coal and steel debts amount to trillion yuan trillion of which about is bank debt If of these loans fail it would put significant stress on Chinas banking system Given significant overcapacity in China coupled with an active effort on the governments part to rotate the economy away from industrials into consumer focused activities we believe that recovery rates will be very low on any NPLs coming out of the resource sector Also of note is the rise in yields in socalled wealth management products which are effectively used as shadow financing in a number of industries most notably real estate Yields have been kept low for years because of an assumed government guarantee on these products These products have seen their yields rise recently due to the default of Guangxi which has shown the governments guarantee is significantly more intangible than once thought This hastens the day of reckoning for a number of uneconomic projects in China which only survive because financing in the wealth management product space can simply be rolled over at stable interest costs Once interest starts to rise more and more must be borrowed and eventually the whole thing comes crashing down SunEdison NYSE SUNE this week suffered a large decline in the value of the companys equity as rumors circulated that the company was in DIP financing TerraForm Global NASDAQ GLBL also sold off as a SUNE bankruptcy threatens the opex guarantees that SUNE has extended to GLBL The trouble with SUNE for us is that we love the business model and there isnt really another operator in the solar space that we feel has the competitive advantages that SUNE does Unfortunately as we are not A qualified we are not able to participate in the debt which we would view as an attractive position Currently the June convertible senior debt trades at of par with a YTM of about The notes are pricing in bankruptcy and we would enter the trade with the expectation that the company does go under with the express desire to receive equity or warrants in a newly restructured SUNE We believe that the majority of SUNEs publicly traded debt has been accumulated by distressed funds that have the experience necessary to restructure the company and which are likely to press hard for some form of equity in a newly restructured SUNE This would be a situation in which we would love to find ourselves and should SUNE emerge from bankruptcy we would be high on the list of potential buyers for any publicly traded securities Because of the uncertainty regarding SUNEs cash position and liquidity we structured our SUNE position in small size and using options Given the news about SUNE seeking DIP financing which we view as plausible and DE Shaws opportunistic purchase agreement of SUNEs Hawaiian assets we took the opportunity this week to exit our SUNE position As stated above we still like the companys business model and so we view this as unfortunate We will continue to monitor the situation and are also looking for alternative ways to play what we feel is a coming green revolution worldwide This week Teslas NASDAQ TSLA VP Finance and Worldwide Controller scuttled back to Amazon NASDAQ AMZN from whence he came There are many potential reasons for the move and ultimately we are never going to know the reason However given our skepticism of Teslas accounting and presentation of the companys results for example producing different gross margin numbers we think it is interesting that the companys finance team has seen the significant turnover that it has The news this week from Alphabets NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>which affects Amazon AMZN is Googles plan to open new data centers in a bid for market share The attractiveness and success of Amazons AWS business is a key reason underlying our short thesis in the company where there are profits and competitors who can break into the market profits tend to shrink Given the very slim margins at Amazon coupled with market expectations of a perpetual monopoly of Amazon on everything it touches anything that threatens its competitive positioning in turn undermines the companys financial performance and therefore its valuation Because AWS is Amazons most profitable segment from a margin perspective AWS earns a operating margin vs the operating margin in the rest of the business any decline in that margin from price pressure will place undue pressure on Amazons consolidated margins If AWSs margin was to decline as it did in when AWS was under significant competition Amazons margin expansion would likely reverse and the very high expectations that have been baked into the companys valuation will have to come down Here Amazons weakness is apparent Amazon did billion in free cash flow in Alphabet did billion in Amazon has billion of cash and marketable securities of which a significant portion is operating cash while Alphabet has billion of cash and marketable securities to play with Simply put Alphabet has more than double the financial flexibility of Amazon and as such can stomach a price war in its cloud services business if it wishes to steal market share from Amazon We suspect this is already happening Alphabet has signed Spotify Private MUSIC an AWS customer to its cloud services and has also signed on Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Home Depot NYSE HD We suspect that Alphabet offered significant pricing advantages to these key customers as AWS has a much larger feature set and ecosystem than Alphabet does presently The key here is presently Alphabet is arguably the most sophisticated tech company on the planet today and it has the resources to build out an ecosystem rivaling Amazon in a relatively short order This new investment in data centers is part of this strategy I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged ETFs Portfolio Strategy Portfolio Strategy
