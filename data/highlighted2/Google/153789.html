class='textDiv'>Apple iOS Ad Blocking Googles Apocalypse Now Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Ad blocking in iOS is a fundamentally new technology that will allow users to block ads efficiently from within the Safari browser for the first time Making ad blocking available from within Safari will greatly increase the popularity of ad blocking among iOS users The growing popularity of ad blocking in iOS will cascade to other platforms such as Android and Windows Following my recent article on the new Apple NASDAQ AAPL iOS ad blocking technology fellow contributor Alcaraz Research raised some interesting points about the technology Alcaraz concluded that Apple is unlikely to exploit the technology He bases this on what he claims are performance issues for mobile devices as well as a potential loss of revenue from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL After considering his objections Ive come to exactly the opposite conclusion Alcarazs concerns about potential performance and battery drain for iOS devices cannot be dismissed out of hand The technology that Apple is introducing with iOS is so new that its not clear how well it will work or what the performance penalty will be in using it However leaping to the conclusion that there will be a serious performance penalty is not supported by the facts Alcaraz concludes that What iOS is promising to deliver is a Content Blocking extension API Application Programming Interface that uses JavaScript and CSS to block content before a page is loaded on Safari This is simply incorrect and indicates that Alcaraz doesnt understand Apples description of the new content blocking API What Alcaraz describes above is the current approach used in Safari running on Mac OS X not Safari in iOS Here I need to provide just a little technical background that I hope will clarify things for the reader Safari in Mac OS X provides developers with a way to write extensions basically plugins for the Safari browser that enhance its functionality JavaScript is a programming language commonly used to provide applike functionality for web pages CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets CSS are just text files used to specify web page layout details such as which font to use in a text block This approach to creating browser extensions was pioneered not by Apple but by Mozilla over a decade ago Currently it is impossible for a developer to write an extension of this type for the iOS version of Safari nor will it be possible to do so for the future version of Safari in iOS Alcaraz is correct in asserting that such extensions would have performance drawbacks which is exactly why they are not allowed in iOS This point was made clear by one of the references Alcaraz cites to support his case a blog post on the WebKit site WebKit was developed by Apple and serves as the basis for many browsers including Safari and Googles Chrome in part The post was made shortly after WWDC rolled out the new iOS content blocking technology and is intended to explain why its superior to the oldfashioned approach of JavaScript and CSS The blog post doesnt really clarify the difference between the old type of extensions in Mac OS X Safari and the new type in iOS This may be the reason why Alcaraz misinterpreted the post Its possible to write extensions for Safari in iOS but not the Mac OS X type App extensions in iOS are mainly for linking one app with another in a convenient way For instance social apps like Twitter and Facebook provide Safari app extensions that allow the user to bring web page content into the social app These extensions are available from the Share drop down menu in the app The extension framework consists of APIs made available to developers under iOS Apple created the framework in order to provide a way for developers to do things like develop extensions for Safari where it is often used that would still be very energy efficient The content blocking in iOS is based on expanding the iOS extension framework with a new type of extension Its not based on the old JavaScriptCSS approach at all and should be a lot more efficient Apple is always very conscious of performance impacts within iOS and generally takes a very conservative approach when deploying new APIs in iOS in order to ensure that battery life is acceptable What isnt clear is how well the new content blocking extensions will actually work Developers have to first build the extensions for iOS using the new API The technology may not work as well as the older approach in Mac OS X This was noted by another one of the references that Alcaraz cites a blog post by the developer of Adblock Plus an ad blocker that is available for Mac OS X Safari as a conventional extension However its better than no ad blocking extensions at all which is what we have in iOS Currently to get ad blocking in iOS users have to use a stand alone browser app Ive tried a couple of them and they work reasonably well in blocking ads Performance was a mixed bag however with some browsers loading much faster than others If the reader is interested in trying one out I suggest AdBlockWeb which is available free AdBlockWeb works very well and doesnt appear to impose much of a performance penalty compared to Safari Alcaraz also speculates that Apple would be reluctant to jeopardize the income supposedly derived from fees paid by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>to be the default search engine in Safari This fee amounts to billion per year Given that Apples net income in fiscal was billion its hard to see this as significant motivation More importantly the issues arent really linked Blocking display ads in web pages probably wouldnt impact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>search results which push sponsored links to the top of the search results Filtering this kind of advertising is probably not within the bounds of what the content blocking API can achieve <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>might voice objections to the content blocking API when its agreement with Apple comes up for renewal in a couple of years but I doubt it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>needs first and foremost to maintain its share of searches This is its core business Apple may elect not to go with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>anyway Apple has been gradually enhancing its own search capability called Spotlight beyond just internal device searches to include Web derived information Siri also provides limited Web search capability As I pointed out in Apples Search Opportunity Apple doesnt need to monetize search with sponsored content and has a motivation to provide a search capability rivaling Googles but without the advertising Here the motivation is simply to provide a better experience for iOS and Mac OS X users Apple also has the resources to create a search capability This may come about slowly but it probably will come in time Apple is continually looking for ways to widen the moat around its Mac OS X and iOS users Reducing Googles advertising revenue from iOS devices appears to be a very logical way to do that As I thought about my previous article on ad blocking Apple Is iOS Ad Blocking A Threat To <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>as well as the article of Alcaraz Research I concluded that I had really mistitled the article by framing it as a rhetorical question Theres no longer any doubt in my mind that iOS ad blocking will have a direct impact on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Right now its not popular in iOS because it requires a stand alone browser and most iOS users tend to prefer Safari The addition of ad blocking to Safari means that many more iOS users will choose to employ ad blocking Ad blocking in iOS has already been demonstrated to work well and I can attest to the fact that it really improves the browsing experience I expect it to become almost universal within a few years This elevates ad blocking to greater than a mere threat for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Its a reality that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and its investors will have to face As ad blocking becomes popular in iOS it will tend to be adopted in Android and other platforms as well The effect is a cascading collapse of display advertising revenue as ad blocking propagates to all computing platforms and as advertisers abandon the display ad approach As I have already pointed out display advertising amounts to about of Googles revenue The impending loss of this revenue should cause <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google
