the market as of late and for good reason The company released a statistic with its most recent earnings report putting fear in the minds of investors Today well talk about what we saw from the earnings report what were seeing from the stock at the moment and what we can expect to see from NFLX moving forward As mentioned above Netflix recently reported its earnings for the most recent quarter In reality the earnings report really wasnt all that bad When it comes to revenue the company posted a slight miss producing billion while analysts expected to see billion In terms of earnings the company actually came in ahead of expectations by producing a profit of per share That all looks great but whats the bad news right Well the bad news is international growth During the earnings report previous to the most recent report NFLX announced that it would be taking its company global On the day of earnings the company opened its services up to more than countries worldwide Of course this was overwhelmingly positive news After all with what the company has done with a relatively small audience in mind investors expected to see sales climb in a big way once the company went global Find out how you can trade stocks like the pros without major time commitments Unfortunately that didnt happen While the company did see international sales that jumped into the hundreds of millions of dollars these sales fell short of expectations in a big way Unfortunately the company doesnt seem to have the ability to sell its services internationally at the volume investors wanted to see and thats producing a real scare As investors one of the first things that we learn is that the news moves the market Any time there is positive news released with regard to a publicly traded company we can expect to see gains in the value of the company as a result Adversely when negative news is released with regard to a publicly traded company we can expect to see declines With that said since NFLX released its earnings report weve seen quite a bit of downward movement on the stock Unfortunately that bearish movement is continuing today Currently NFLX is trading at per share after a loss of per share or thus far today What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward Moving forward I have a mixed opinion of what we can expect to see from Netflix Unfortunately the stock is likely to see further declines in the short term as concerns with regard to international sales continue to weigh heavy on the minds of investors However in the long run I have relatively high hopes for the stock The reality is that few products jump off of the shelves as soon as they are launched When it comes down to it NFLX took quite a while to build up momentum in the Untied States and its going to take some time for the company to build momentum internationally However the services provided by the company are top notch and they come at a relatively low price As a result Im expecting to see international sales soar in the long run leading to long run gains for NFLX Where do you think NFLX is headed moving forward and why Let us know your opinion in the comments below Learn how to trade smarter risk
