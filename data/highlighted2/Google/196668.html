However these trends arent substantial enough to indicate an inflection point in annual shipment run rate Investors could be overpaying assuming the company falls short and iPhone shipments end up being flat yearoveryear However the arguments dont seem compelling enough and one could simply extrapolate the longterm growth in installed base to come away with a more concise picture As such it seems analysts are rationalizing the valuation and are likely confirming the market bias as its hard to rationalize sustained outperformance when based on conventional market theory While Im not necessarily bearish on Apple NASDAQ AAPL its fair to say that investors should also consider the counterarguments being made by analysts For the most part I felt like the most compelling argument was made by Jefferies analyst Sundeep Bajikar who had mentioned that interest in the iPhone seems to have peaked in the United States He substantiates this with the below graph Hes one of the highest ranked Wall Street analysts on TipRankscom So the guy isnt a scrub and hes making some pretty legitimate points here When looking at the above graph the iPhone S fetched the lowest level of interest when compared to prior years excluding China Furthermore it seems like these sentiment indicators arent merely isolated to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>trends I opened the latest Taking Stock with Teens report from Piper Jaffray and for the most part the report offers confirmation here because teenagers are demonstrating signs of consumer fatigue with the iPhone In the spring survey there was a slight decrease in yearoveryear ownership of iPhones and expectations of purchasing the next iPhone Of course these trends can be offset with emerging market growth But for the time being replacement demand in developed markets should either slow down or stabilize Increases in market share seem unlikely and the recent release of competing handsets from competing OEMs seems to have won a small fragment of this market Again both broader demographic data and techsavvy teens seem to be in agreement here However to offset these concerns emerging markets show a lot of promise and more specifically there could be upside despite weakness in domestic demand Again the Jefferies analyst mentions that the Chinese market offers a lot of upside in calendar year However he disagrees with my stance on iPhone generating market share gains in the calendar year To be fair Sundeeps stance isnt isolated The broader consensus feels the same way about Chinese iPhone market share peaking in For whatever reason the broader consensus believes that competitive threats will limit iPhone saturation in the Chinese market However its quite apparent that Apple tends to dominate the plus price category and in the United States alone it has market share Im not saying that those same exact trends will play out in China but given the fact that the Chinese middle class is growing at a CAGR according to McKinsey and Company estimates the broader economic landscape can accommodate for approximately in organic growth with perhaps a small fraction given up to competitor handsets at premium pricing tiers Since Apple tends to dominate that specific category perhaps macroeconomic trends can accommodate for growth in excess of per annum in terms of Chinesespecific shipments Again those are our longterm average growth assumptions In the past couple years growth was driven by execution as Apple opened retail stores across tier and tier Chinese cities closed deals with major Chinese telecoms and was able to substantiate the value proposition of a faster iPhone as network technologies started to catch up to specified baseband uplinkdownlink speeds The rollout of G frequency bands and network virtualization trends helped reduce OpEx and CapEx costs over at China Mobile NYSE CHL which sped up base station deployment in Apple increased pricing on its iPhones and also generated a percentage point increase in market share In the United States Apple sustained market share at an average selling price of Now obviously going into the next year Chinese revenue will have to be driven by increases in shipment figures as ASPs are unlikely to improve I anticipate Chinese shipment growth will be in the to range and the remaining developed markets will likely report single digit or flat growth rates In mix shift wont drive much of an ASP increase But to really neuter assumptions on growth analysts have to anticipate a combination of declining shipments in developed markets and substantial deceleration in Chinese shipments Pessimism seems to be the order of the day and as I have mentioned theyre making their case based on observable trends in data However I think all of these factors can be captured by extrapolating the trend line in installed base or annual shipments Yes Im well aware that growth can be patchy in certain years depending on the qualitative factors of updates Sometimes interest is heightened when releasing the midcycle upgrade But given the lack of interest when based on consumer surveys and somewhat promising first week shipment figures one can assume that Apple is really highlighting the strength of the iPhone in foreign markets and not domestically Furthermore given the fact that theres still room to further saturate the upper middle class in China theres no real indication that Chinese market share figures should decline yearoveryear which is what analysts on consensus are forecasting After all its hard to forecast yearoveryear iPhone shipment growth unless if youre anticipating that FY was a fluke in terms of iPhone sales Thankfully Apples brand is fairly strong and isnt faddish even if consumers are showing some signs of fatigue Therefore I anticipate iPhone shipments greater than million units based on consensus estimates growth I anticipate similar growth trends despite concerns pertaining to Chinese macro and waning interest from US consumers While theyre legitimate risk factors theyre not solid enough indicators for analysts to anticipate inflection in iPhone shipment delta Sure I could be wrong on my calculus here but the cited risk factors of slowing US iPhone shipments and growing shipments in developing markets are trends that can be observed in prior years Therefore since all of that data is already built into the historical data set one must merely extrapolate the data to arrive at a reasonable forecast Economists continue to cite concerns when pertaining to China and thats probably why analysts were skeptical of sustained momentum in China However Credit Suisse released a fairly promising report when pertaining to the Chinese situation as their macro team anticipates patterns of stabilization We have consistently believed that if house prices in China fall by or more from here then we would have a hard landing Real estate is of GDP directly of household wealth of banks collateral and up to of local government revenue Recently real estate turnover and house price data have improved with prices rising in half of Tier Chinese cities This combined with some lead indicators stabilizing Korean PMIs Shanghai Rebar rates and a greater policy response in recent weeks makes us believe that near term Chinese momentum could stabilize We remain fundamentally bearish given the degree of overbuild overvaluation and the size of GDP it represents similar to that of Ireland and Spain in Albeit Credit Suisse also is anticipating some deceleration over the long run but like everyone else theyre not declaring to be the final inning of the Chinese growth story As such it would be fair to assume that some of the longerterm macro models may hold more water than originally anticipated as the shortterm divot in economic data is likely driven by asset price fluctuations and not due to changes in aggregate consumption and consumer confidence indicators Its another way of saying that Apples growth in China should hold up and while there are holes in the ship the plugs are working more effectively than what many would honestly like to admit The stock is slightly outperforming the broader index but is still trading below fair value The stock will likely exceed the expected return which is based on beta implied volatility Of course the possibility of outperforming volatility seems elusive to many and quite frankly the path to least resistance is to assume that minimal volatility equals minimal returns However these valuations are just too cheap In fact almost irresistible to a point where some cant help but assume that its too good to be true The stock is starting to stabilize and I dont anticipate the company to fall back below As such I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation as I anticipate Apple to sustain a reasonable growth rate in key product categories Assuming my estimate is correct well have another year where sales can grow at above midteen rates which is why the stock seems unfairly undervalued And while conventional value metrics indicates misvaluation the technical factors ie global liquidity is weighing more heavily on recent price action than company specific fundamentals These factors are temporary and eventually I anticipate the stock to reflate to a more reasonable valuation as company specific fundamentals reassert institutional interest for the balance of and the duration We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the personal
