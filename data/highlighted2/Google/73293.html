Pay player to payments last week Googles Android Pay threw its hat into the mobile payments ring as the other operating systemsbased payments scheme to launch in less than a year To no ones great surprise we added another Pay player to payments last week Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Android Pay threw its hat into the mobile payments ring as the other operating systemsbased payments scheme to launch in less than a year Apple NASDAQ AAPL Pay as is old news by now was first out of the gate with the launch of its iOSbased payments scheme in September Many pundits have characterized Android Pay as a copypaste version of Apple Pay and as such have already crowned it the other dominant mobile payments scheme And like they did when Apple Pay launched many have inferred that its pretty much curtains for anyone else with ambitions to compete for market share in the mobile payments ecosystem Apple Pay is for stuff that is bought by people who own iPhones Android Pay is for stuff bought by people who own devices that run Android Done and done Like Apple Pay Android Pay went to market arminarm with the existing payments ecosystem All of the major card brands are supporting it along with a handful of issuers Though not nearly the stampede that we saw when Apple Pay launched And like Apple Pay its embracing NFC technology and will work at all of the same merchants that accept Apple Pay today and enable NFC going forward That is some k retail locations not merchants theres a big difference That k includes k vending machines Tokenization is also at the heart of its security and digital identity strategy perhaps allaying the fears on the part of merchants that Android Pay is all about scarfing up consumer data and using it against them later Which is where many of the comparisons end First unlike Apple and Apple Pay Android Pay is not really an Android play it is a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Android Play and the two arent the same <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>of course has been regarded as the unofficial godfather of Android since it acquired it in but Android is an open source software platform that can be licensed and modified out the wazoo by anyone who wants to use it Which means that it has a huge fragmentation problem staring it right in the face a huge obstacle when trying to replicate an Applelike strategy At its launch <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>announced that Android Pay would be supported on devices running KitKat and higher Thats roughly percent of Android enabled devices and none of those that operate a forked version of Android like the Amazon Fire phone for instance or Samsungs Tizen That means that despite Android having a humongous share of the operating system market worldwide its potential Android Pay customer funnel is reduced by the number of consumers with handsets that have both NFC capabilities and that are running a current version of Android By comparison more than percent of iPhones have upgraded to its most recent operating system iOS Heres why that matters with a little back of the envelope math for the US which is where its launching In the US as of March comScore says that million people own smartphones Android has a percent of that market so some million phones run the Android operating system That actually beats Apple by a whole lot like million But only percent of those handsets run a version of KitKat and higher Less than percent run Lollipop its most current version A rough guesstimate of how many of those million are NFC enabled and therefore ready to rock it with Android Pay is million In percent of all handsets shipped were NFC enabled and percent of those were Android So percent of million and then percent of that number is million Kantars latest reports say that percent of the million iPhones in the US are s thats million phones ready and able to enable Apple Pay That doesnt translate to Apple Pay usage we estimate the number of active users to be k but simply estimates the size of the addressable market for Apple Pay That means that out of the gate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Android Pay has about half percent of the addressable market that Apple Pay has According to Pews latest study of smartphone demographics which was done before the iPhone was released and before all of the stats about Apples ability to attract switchers were too the differences were stark percent of adults earning more than k owned a phone running an Android operating system compared to percent with Apple phones percent of adults earning under k own Android phones compared to percent with Apple phones percent of Android users are college educated compared with percent of Apple phone owners All of which suggests strongly that the commerce advantage goes to Apple Not only are there more Apple users in the upper income categories but more of them are concentrated in their peak spending years In fact we estimated a year or so ago that roughly percent of retail spend in the US is driven by those who own iPhones This suggests that on the basis of Android Pay alone <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>will have great difficulty persuading merchants that Android Pay will drive a ton of incremental volume for them Its no wonder they decided to embrace a carbon copy of the Apple Pay model they get to ride the draft of whatever momentum the networks and issuers create for Apple Then theres the whole issue of getting Android Pay into the hands of consumers in the first place Apple is a closed ecosystem It controls what goes on its handset emphasis on the word handset The only models for sale now are the and Plus and Apple controls everything that goes onto them The mobile operators dont have any say Its why when consumers buy Apple devices theyre not all junked up with icon after icon of mobile operator dictated apps Now I know what youre saying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>spent million to buy the Softcard licenses that will give them the right to push an Android Pay icon onto every handset Yes they get the right to do that But that doesnt mean that consumers will use it they didnt when it was Softcard Or that will be free Android Pay still has to negotiate separate deals with each of the handset manufacturers and thats just here in the US When Android Pay wants to move to Canada the UK Europe it will have to negotiate deals with all of those carriers too Apple doesnt have to do diddlysquat Meanwhile in Europe the European Commission and a lot of countries seem to have it in for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>which has been under antitrust investigations for years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and China parted ways many years ago when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>decided it wasnt going to put up with all the censorship nonsense Taking Android Pay global will be interesting to watch Speaking of the Android Pay business model the operators Im sure will want a piece of the action Its what theyve always wanted from payments going mobile But unlike Apple Pay my guess is that the flow of revenue around the Android Pay ecosystem is more likely going away from Android Pay rather than to it to get it off the ground Android Pay just doesnt come to market with the same swagger and brand cachet as Apple Pay did But thats probably not all that important to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>They have gobs of money to pour into Android Pay My guess is that like Apple Pay Android Pay isnt really about monetizing payments per se but using it as a way to gain another advantage that drives revenue for them Apple Pays something else is about getting consumers to buy handsets hardware sales account for percent of Apples revenue When analysts publish estimates of Apple generating a billion dollars from Apple Pay in a few years thats not even a rounding error for them Its a freckle on a pimple for a company with billion in cash just sitting around waiting to be spent Android Pays something else Well its not clear that there is one Android Pay may be one of many building blocks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>needs to overcome the impact of mobile and Apple on its main source of revenue Eighty percent of Googles revenue is via searchbased advertising a fact well known to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>More <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>searches take place on mobile devices than on computers in countries including the US and Japan <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>posted last week on its blog which also touted the tremendous opportunity for marketers to reach people that these new touchpoints on the consumers path to purchase represent A New York Times article last week extracted data from a Goldman Sachs report on Googles search revenue challenges In it it was reported that this year Googles ad revenue will be split desktop to mobile In thats expected to adjust further to It isnt hard to imagine that by those numbers will not only flip as mobile expands to become wearables cars and a collection of other connected devices that consumers own and use but change entirely as search becomes less about using search engines and more about consumers using apps to find the things they want to buy That detail suddenly becomes pretty important since mobile ad revenue on a good day clocks in at a lot less than desktop revenues More mobile search means less search revenue even if volume is increasing All you have to do is review Googles last couple of years of earnings reports to see the impact that its already having on its revenue Today percent of product searches no longer start via a search engine at all but a site where consumers can find what they want and buy it in one stop Sites like Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and Walmartcom NYSE WMT and shopping apps like Wish and Lyst and NetaPorter and Spring all make it possible for consumers to dive into apps that curate what they like to buy and have purchased and make it efficient for them to do more of the same New entrants like Messenger for Business are also experimenting with the notion of retail inside of messaging Wanna know what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Plays No free app is by usage Messenger The bottom line is that as more consumers are given more opportunities to default to apps that eliminate the friction from the commerce experience the more at risk <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>becomes to losing its search ad revenue cash cow Approximately percent of Googles mobile search revenue is the result of people using iPhones and iPads to find things on their path to purchase A search initiated via Safari is actually powered by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Having one of your biggest partners also be your biggest archrival down the road in Cupertino cant make anyone at the GOOG feel happy pappy or very secure Now the Apple Maps fiasco taught Apple a valuable lesson about what happens when you decide to move consumers to an inferior experience just because you want to control everything they do on your platform You can only do that if you have a really outstanding alternative ready to offer them Which is why Safaris search default is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>unless or until Apple redefines search in a way that minimizes a users need to use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>for search or replaces it altogether Googles decision to buy Android in and invest in it has given it a ton of distribution but not as much control as Apple has over how developers use it how consumers experience it and how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>could make money from it Nothing that was all that important when desktops ruled the world and mobile never mind online was an asterisk when retail sales were reported And Apple was just getting off the ground A decade later <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>now has to pull out all of the stops so that more and higher spending consumers become more sticky to its mobile operatingbased ecosystem Something thats less about payments and Android Pay and more about what to do when your biggest competitor also happens to drive the bulk of the revenue coming from the devices that are changing everything about commerce Because payments after all isnt something that even their biggest and arguably better positioned competitor is
