social networks are working on cloud systems and messaging for work but Microsoft already has the tools to do this with Yammer and Skype Per user MSFT would be paying times what FB paid for WhatsApp if they made this purchase at this ridiculous valuation News broke late Friday afternoon that Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT had thought about acquiring messaging service Slack Private SLACK for billion We think this would be an enormous waste of capital and absolutely terrible decision for the company It looks like the company made the right move in avoiding purchasing Slack especially for that much money Slack is similar to Skype or other person to person messaging services but it focuses on providing tools for the enterprise For instance it offers cloudbased document sharing discussion and collaboration on top of simple messaging It takes the best of social media functions across several apps and tries to do what many other companies are working on doing using cloud computing to create efficiency in the workplace Microsoft has the choice of starting anew if they wanted to enter this market or trying to build out services they already have like Skype In addition Microsoft already acquired enterprise messaging system Yammer in There are two other products that we can compare Slack to WhatsApp for persontoperson messaging and Facebook NASDAQ FB at Work the companys goal of creating efficiency in the workplace Lets put it simply Facebook bought WhatsApp for its user base The user base is the commodity WhatsApp was only earning about Myear when it was purchased The users are the key and Microsoft either doesnt seem to understand that or theyre just poor negotiators So Microsoft could be targeting Slack for its already existing user base We are guessing Microsoft is thinking about trying to capitalize on what it clearly sees are the strengths of other companies like Facebook and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL even BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY in their messaging platforms Even LinkedIn NYSE LNKD added messaging capabilities to its platform LinkedIn like Twitter NYSE TWTR and many other social network services is starting to look suspiciously like Facebook Its clear that enterprise messaging and cloud for collaboration is already the next thing social media companies are targeting Could Microsoft be trying to follow in the social media giants footsteps With the quarter Facebook had last quarter why wouldnt you try But B for Slack is not the answer Microsoft We think you understand that We are guessing that Microsoft is thinking about getting in on this trend and perhaps trying to stretch out the way that they are monetizing mobile users by adding a high octane messaging platform While we certainly admire Microsofts effort to try and think about carving out new moneymaking segments for itself we dont think spending billion for this enterprise messaging product when you already have Yammer and Skype is a reasonable idea We think shareholders should be happy that the company seems to agree Why not spend the billion to build out your already existing technology People will note that in the case of Facebook the company shelled out for WhatsApp because it had an enormous user base It clearly turned out to be a fantastic move for Facebook because they were essentially buying hundreds of millions of users That is why the WhatsApp purchase still looks like a fantastic idea to this day This new system Microsoft was considering would have about paid users and million total users which is absolutely nothing less than of WhatsApps base when acquired when compared to the mass of numbers that other messaging platforms have Facebook paid about B for WhatsApp which conservatively had about M users at the time This works out to about per user If Microsoft were to pay B for Slack theyd be paying per user or about times what Facebook paid for WhatsApp What more would they be getting Document storage and sharing that Microsoft already can handle with Azure and enterprise communication that the company already has with Yammer Yammer again already handles messaging and is already integrated with document sharing for the Microsoft Office suite By ducking out of this deal Microsoft may be saving billion for shareholders Its a smart decision that is indicative of the new Microsoft under Nadella Were not sure Ballmer would have had the composure to skip a deal like this How many times have we watched the company come in second on something because of an impulse purchase from Ballmer or lack of innovation Take Zune for instance Apple NASDAQ AAPL came out with the iPod Microsoft invested a substantial amount of money in coming out with their own personal music device and it went absolutely nowhere We would have been looking at a repeat of this Zune with Slack except were guessing far more expensive and substantially more pointless for the company in this potential acquisition As weve written in previous posts we like the new Microsoft under Satya Nadella Nadellas regime has shown smarts in the way that it has done business and its immediate ability to grow Azure Avoiding this Ballmeresque acquisition may have been Nadellas latest great move We think torching billion that could be used for many purposes not the least of which is improving Skype or issuing a special dividend to shareholders would have been completely foolish move and we surely hope that Microsoft does not go down this route Prudent capital management at Microsoft continues to be one of the reasons its easy to like as a longterm investment and this latest news encourages us that managements judgment continues to be on point Steve Ballmer Image Source Wikimedia Commons
