such as monetization and high cost Verizon Communications NYSE VZ is really pumping the promise of its new mobilefirst video service Go When Verizons CEO Lowell McAdam was talking about a growth plateau in and he specifically noted Go in the conversation of what will drive off to the races growth in and beyond Unfortunately for McAdam hes probably putting too many eggs in this one basket First and foremost the concept behind Go is that it will spark data consumption growth and be a pioneer for payTVs move to mobile Go will include adsupported content with networks like ESPN CBS NYSE CBS Sports Discovery Channel and TLC among others Theoretically an increase in data consumption means larger data packages and more wireless revenue for Verizon According to Ciscos VNI report mobile video traffic will grow from petabytes per month in to exabytes per month in good for a compound annualized growth rate of more than Therefore if Go is a success then theoretically it should lead to much higher revenue for Verizon as larger data packages are required The problem is whether or not Verizon is able to leave data plan prices intact long enough to capitalize on this increase in data consumption LTE customers currently consume about GB of data per month and Macquarie expects that to exceed GB per month by Despite Verizon making significant cuts to its wireless data plan prices over the last year its prices still remain well above the likes of TMobile NYSE TMUS and Sprint NYSE S With TMobile and Sprint both aggressive with promotions and showing no signs of slowing down Verizon will surely have to once more lower data prices by The big question is by how much As a result the likely scenario of Verizon having to cut data prices to keep up with competitors limits the amount of revenue that Verizon can earn from Go Another potential problem for Verizon is the use of WiFi and the growing competition within mobile first video services Currently Netflix NASDAQ NFLX YouTube and to a lesser degree DISH Networks NASDAQ DISH Sling TV are the top streaming services for mobile And most consumers who use these services do so on WiFi not only because it is free but due to higher performance While G LTE networks have made major strides in the right direction no wireless network is a match for the more advanced broadband networks Specifically PC Mag found average download speeds of Mbps on Verizons G LTE network Thats fast but large broadband service providers like ATT NYSE T Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA NASDAQ CMCSK CenturyLink NYSE CTL and even Verizon have popular plans with twice that speed and some of the more advanced networks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Fiber or ATT GigaPower can offer speeds that are x greater The bottom line is that when WiFi is available it is the superior option to LTE and thats a problem that Verizon must deal with As a result the business model of Go seems flawed but expensive for Verizon nonetheless According to Macquarie the additional capacity needed from Go could be a backbreaker for Verizons network thereby forcing the company to increase capital expenditures and spectrum investments to handle the increased strain on its network Recently I wrote an article explaining why Verizons growth initiatives will fall flat due to its lack of financing options and its need to divest essential assets to fund necessary investments With over billion in debt capital expenditures of more than billion during the last four quarters and Verizons month free cash flow essentially wiped out with dividend payments Go could present a big risk for the company The reason is because Verizon has adopted an allin approach to Go with McAdam expecting to report the services wild success by this time next year However the structure of Go combined with the growing competitive landscape for similar services suggests it wont be a monetary success for Verizon but rather a monetary drain as company executives soak more and more money into the service to compensate the drain it will cause on the wireless network Thats why overall Go is likely bad news for Verizon and yet one more reason to stay away from the stock Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it
