cloudbased software distribution Sales from Office subscriptions are growing but there is increasing competition from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and WPS Desktop Office is also facing headwind from cheaper rival products Microsofts software business can perform better if it expands beyond Office and Azure Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT chairman and board members want Nadella to accelerate the software segments transition to cloudbased distribution The board is worried about the longterm effects of declining demand for onpremise or desktop Microsoft Office Some of the suggestions made by the board are to revamp the OfficeAzure sales and an increase in Research Development The board is not satisfied that Office and Azure can only contribute around of Microsofts projected billion for FY My own take is that Nadella should consider expanding Microsofts cloud offering beyond Office Diversification is essential toward satisfying Microsofts urgent need to increase its revenue from cloudcentricsubscriptionbased software An increase in Research Development budget or reshuffling of sales people will not reduce the threat from rivals of Microsoft Office Investors should realize that expanding beyond Office is the best way for Microsoft to grow its subscriptionbased cloudsoftware business Microsoft has so much idle cash anyway Microsoft needs to acquire firms that will expand its software portfolio and grow its online Windows app store Yes growing the Windows app store should also be part and parcel of Microsofts cloud strategy Apple NASDAQ AAPL has multibillion cloudbased revenue stream from getting a cut from thirdparty softwareapps purchased from its Mac and iOS app stores My idea to sell not just Officeproductivity software is better than Microsoft wasting money on acquisitions like Xamarin Microsoft paid at least million to buy crossplatform development tool Xamarin After this acquisition Nadella gave away Xamarin for free Microsoft also made Xamarin open source I disagree with this Xamarin treatment What I want to see is for Microsoft to buy companies with proprietary software products Microsoft can then rent these software like Adobe NASDAQ ADBE is doing with Creative Cloud Adobe trades a skyhigh valuation because of its fastgrowing population of Creative Cloud customers Microsoft can and should try to break Adobes pole position on graphicdesign software Challenging Adobe could help Microsoft improve its market valuation Adobe has x PE valuation more than twice than MSFTs x Autodesk has also followed the subscriptionbased business model of Adobe Microsoft can compete with the subscriptiononly software products of Adobe and Autodesk by buying Corel Corporation I know Microsoft and Corel are currently under a litigation war over alleged Officerelated IP infringements I subscribe to Sun Tzus philosophy that the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting Corels WordPerfect and Corel Office software products are persistent rivals of Microsoft OfficeOffice Buying Corel will make it an ally After acquiring Corel Microsoft can either kill or rent out WordPerfectCorel Office Adobe killed Freehand MX after it bought Macromedia This was to protect Adobes inhouse vector drawing software Illustrator CC Taking control of Corel will also give Microsoft CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X Painter MotionStudio D VideoStudio Ultimate X CorelDRAW Technical Suite x and CorelCAD Instead of selling CorelCAD for Microsoft could rent it out for year to quickly disrupt Autodesks lucrative monthly plan for AutoCAD CorelCAD is more userfriendly than AutoCAD while also offering almost the same features that mechanicalcivil engineers and architects need Instead of selling CorelDRAW Technical Suite x for Microsoft should also rent it out for year to disrupt Autodesks monthly fee for Inventor Microsoft can also rent out a bundle of VideoStudio CorelDRAW Graphics Suite and Painter for month This can quickly disrupt Adobes month enterprise plan for Creative Cloud Corel has equivalent products to compete against Adobe Creative Cloud Microsoft can market Corel products to their existing corporate OfficeOffice clients Big and small companies usually have inhouse creativedesign teams that use Adobe products Im confident that Microsofts corporate influence will help it effectively diminish Adobe and Autodesks presence in the enterprise I guesstimate that taking control of Corel Corp will cost million to billion This is still a small price compared to the billion that Microsoft paid to buy Minecraftmaker Mojang If Microsoft could waste million on Xamarin gambling million on Corel Corp is a risk worth taking Microsoft bought more than million nonvoting shares no board seat of Corel for million in Microsoft then sold its inutile stake in Corel to Vector Capital in I hope Nadella now realizes just how important Corel can be to his cloudfirst mobilefirst master plan Corels loyal pool of customers and strong portfolio of designfocused products can complement Office s revenue stream Renting out Corels software products could generate annual revenue greater than my estimated millionyear sales of Minecraft Challenging Adobe and Autodesk is the best way to accelerate Microsofts plan to increase its revenue from software sales Yes Office now has more than million paying customers However I see this growth peaking soon There are other cloudmobile Office suite available now Alphabets NASDAQ GOOG dirtcheap month plan for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Apps For Work will eventually slow down Office s rapid growth Zoho is another enterprisecentric online productivity suite provider Hancom also offers free cloudbased Office Suite ThinkFree The year subscription fee of crossplatform WPS Office Business Edition is much cheaper than the monthly fee of Office Business SoftMaker also offers cheaper alternatives to Office The crossplatform Pro version of Polaris Office cost only year for up to devices The free and muchimproved Android version of OpenOffice is available now The development team behind LibreOffice is also working on the free Android version By giving away free mobile versions of Office to iOS and Android device owners Microsoft itself is also hampering the growth of Office The boards enthusiasm for cloudbased software distribution is good for Microsoft I just hope they are smart enough to see that instead of spending more on Research Development they should consider buying other companies Nadella should only look to Oracle NYSE ORCL on how to exploit the inorganic method of growing in the cloud Oracle has been on a buying spree thats enlarging its cloud enterprise products Yes Microsoft cannot afford the skyhigh valuation of Adobe and Autodesk It should instead buy the rivals of these two companies Corel Dassault Systemes OTCPKDASTY Xara and Serif
