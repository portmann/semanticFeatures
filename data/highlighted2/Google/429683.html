Things Apple Must Do At WWDC To Keep The Stock From Tanking Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Apple is at a critical juncture in its history with declining iPhone sales Apple also appears to be falling behind in key technologies such as mobile search artificial intelligence and cloud based applications WWDC will provide investors with insight into the state of Apples development in these areas as well as future products such as the next iPhone and Watch This years World Wide Developer Conference WWDC starting Monday could be the most critical in Apples NASDAQ AAPL history Apple faces crises on many fronts declining iPhone sales lack of new products to take up the slack and the sense that Apple is falling behind in crucial technologies of cloud services and Artificial Intelligence WWDC is Apples opportunity to show that it is still capable of selfreinvention that it can still surprise and delight us that it isnt the next Blackberry NASDAQ BBRY in any sense Im optimistic that WWDC will show that innovation is alive and well Heres what Apple must do at WWDC With benefit of hindsight its clear that there was a crucial mistake made in the iPhone ss Plus and it had nothing to do with hardware This was the decision not to introduce iOS multitasking on iPhone Multitasking was first shown at WWDC last year but was confined to newer generation iPads especially the iPad Pro This was a monumental and costly failure to exploit Apples unique advantage in hardwaresoftware integration Apple simply played it too conservative hoping to resuscitate sales of iPad It didnt work but it did deprive iPhone of a much needed advantage compared to the very good Android phones that were introduced in especially the Samsung OTCSSNLF Galaxy S The result was the first ever decline in iPhone sales in the March quarter and more of the same expected for the June quarter With the new A processors of the s there was no technical reason why iPhone couldnt support multitasking At the very least it should have been enabled on the larger s Plus which had enough screen real estate to support split screen comfortably If Apple doesnt fix this problem this year it will be in serious hot water as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>IO made it very clear that a similar feature is coming to Android this year To Do I consider this so critical that if Apple fails to do this I will probably reevaluate my current buy recommendation on the stock Fortunately I think its likely Apple will introduce this feature at WWDC Another mistake that was made was less impactful but nevertheless glaring This was the hobbling of the new Apple TV with a severely limited feature set in tvOS The result has been lackluster sales according to IHS More importantly Apple TV hasnt turned out to be a particularly lucrative platform for developers as Ars Technica has pointed out My biggest criticism at the time was the lack of HomeKit support and this has turned out to be prescient in light of Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Echo and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Home revealed at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>IO I felt that an obvious role for Apple TV was to be a hub for home automation especially with Siri as means of control Subsequent to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Home reveal there have been a lot of rumors to the effect that Apple will introduce its own product or endow Apple TV with these features To Do I think its likely that Apple will enable HomeKit on AppleTV as well as expanding the HomeKit APIs to make Apple TV a better home automation hub It isnt quite as convenient as the Echo or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Home but its a start and it gives TV functionality it should have had from the start Since my article on Apples AI gap which highlighted Marco Arments blog comparing Apple to Blackberry asserting that Apple is the next Blackberry has become a favorite pastime of Apple bears I should have expected it As Ive acknowledged its clear that Apple trails rivals <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT which both hope to leverage their AI capabilities to promote their OS platforms I dont see any point in becoming embroiled in a debate about the magnitude of the gap since its very difficult to assess that from the outside Apples secretiveness allowed it to completely blindside the mobile device industry with the worlds first bit smartphone system on chip SOC in for the iPhone s the A So I dont think its reasonable to discount Apples secretiveness in the matter of AI development To Do That being said Apple needs to show developers and investors significant progress in AI at this years WWDC That means making Siri more effective and reliable in voice recognition and most importantly it means that Apple has to show progress in its own search capability Apple cant afford to rely on either Microsoft or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>for search Theres been considerable discussion that Siri will become available to developers through a new set of APIs Yes This is a must If Apple fails to do this this will constitute another reason to reevaluate my rating of the stock But once again I consider progress in this area very likely Another long standing complaint of analysts has been Apple lack of presence in enterprise cloud services While Microsoft <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Amazon all offer hosting for cloud based apps and extensive developer tools for those apps Apple offers nothing comparable The importance of cloud based apps is not so much in Web apps that are accessed through a browser as in the services and support that cloud apps can provide to mobile apps in general Everything from video and music streaming to Web based shopping relies on cloud apps As Ive pointed out Apple currently seems to want to rely on partnerships with companies such as IBM NYSE IBM The problem with this division of labor is that it deprives Apples extensive base of developers iOS tvOS macOS watchOS with tools for cloud apps that they can use in a frictionless integrated way with the current Xcode tools for app development Apple is missing a huge opportunity and its being perceived as falling behind To Do In past WWDCs Apple has been creeping up on the enterprise web services business by offering developers some useful tools but stopping short of full cloud based apps This year Apple needs to go all in Period And the logical tool for this Open Swift Open Swift gives Apple a tremendous opportunity to simultaneously create a robust enterprise web services business as well as afford developers the best way to enhance the power and utility of mobile apps My belief is that Apple created Open Swift with this in mind and well see this come to fruition at WWDC I wrote recently on the Watchs ultimate destination as a disruption of the smartphone taking over many communications functions such as voice calling and messaging In the context of where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM are going with connected smart watches its clear that the trend is for greater standalone capability which includes an independent LTE connection for voice and data I dont expect Apple to be at the bleeding edge here Apple will hang back and learn from the mistakes of the first movers Also the technology is still a little immature and probably doesnt come up to Apples user experience standards But Apple needs to make the Watch more capable and independent and the next version of watchOS can be expected to anticipate this To Do The key advances in Watch hardware will be a faster processor with more memory and storage combined with standalone WiFi capability This will allow the watch to perform messaging functions as well as download apps without being tethered to an iPhone I expect that the next watchOS will reflect these changes Apple needs to show the next watchOS at WWDC although its less critical until a revised version of the Watch makes its appearance Its part and parcel to the sorry state of the coverage of Apple that there is so much focus on trivialities such as whether Mac OS X will be rebranded macOS Im just assuming it Im also assuming that not much of interest will be shown for the new macOS itself It would be nice if Apple would cease its idiotic stance on convergence and endow macOS devices with a touch screen but I dont see that happening and I dont consider it critical It would be a nice to have I consider all five of the todos to be must haves and lack of progress in a combination of these areas may be cause for me to reevaluate my rating of the stock The absolutely critical areas are the ones Ive identified above iOS multitasking for iPhone and significant progress in Siri and search Failing to make progress in these areas in and of themselves will trigger a reevaluation However Im optimistic that well see good progress in these and other areas and remain long Apple I continue to recommend it as a buy for investors with year investment horizons pending the outcome of WWDC Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL QCOM I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not
