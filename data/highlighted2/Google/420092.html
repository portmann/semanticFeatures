pace Identifying the underlying motives behind the companys content play is important for investors looking to see into its longterm future The environment is ripe for Verizon to start capitalizing on noncore operations since it will give the company a foot in the doorway of a highgrowth industry The acquisition of AOL by Verizon NYSE VZ will not only put the company in control over a huge volume of video and original content but more importantly it will also allow it to participate in the supply chain portion of the mobile video phenomenon that is sweeping across the world Thats where the ad revenue opportunities lie and AOLs programmatic advertising technology is the vehicle to get VZ there The real objective and this is not something thats been discussed at length is its control over a portion of the supply chain responsible for getting content streamed to mobile devices As a wireless carrier it makes sense to want to be a part of that because it not only helps enlarge data volumes over its networks but also gives it a way to lock in subscribers through various bundle plans that include streaming video as a core offering Lets see how its made its moves in the world of content and how those moves make Verizons stock more attractive than ever TechCrunch Verizon Press Release Verizon isnt new to acquiring contentrelated companies and their technology It started in with its acquisition of the content delivery network operator EdgeCast Networks At an estimated million in revenues from this segment in its clear that Verizon didnt necessarily acquire the company for topline growth What VZ wanted is the CDN platform and its ability to move video content Its next move was to buy Intels NASDAQ INTC media assets which include cloudbased content and services around INTCs OnCue Cloud TV platform Again this purchase was not about the content itself but the platform that would give VZ enhanced video delivery capabilities over the cloud In the case of AOL Verizon gets two benefits highquality original content with a captive audience of nearly million people every month and the technology to provide highly targeted audiences for advertisers Essentially AOLs contentbased adtargeting serves digital advertisements based on the type of content that the user regularly reads To put it in perspective <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL AdWords targets its audience based on the sites they visit their general interests and so on In contrast contentcentric advertising helps reach more relevant customers per advertising dollar because the advertiser already knows the type of content that audience is consuming on a regular basis The end result is higher costs per click for these ads because they target specific niches that are more likely to click on the ad and sign up or purchase By slowly beefing up its content portfolio and delivery networks Verizon is essentially doing three things The first is to exploit the steady stream of revenues from owning highvalue content the second is to own assets for creating and delivering that content and in the process benefit from advertising revenues the third is to set the stage for its own streaming video service Go Admittedly the service hasnt seen the kind of success that Verizon was expecting but the addition of AOLs content gives VZ the breathing space it needs to nurture its new venture with DreamWorks Animation NASDAQ DWA and Hearst via AwesomenessTV The new service will be merged with Go and is expected to start airing at the end of The significance of this service comes into focus when you consider certain statistics around the growth of mobile video content From an investors point of view this is the right mix diversification into a highgrowth industry that gives Verizon more control over content and additional revenue streams such as video advertising and contentbased advertising In addition this play will also generate more traffic over VZs own wireless networks and more data means more revenue obviously So while I think the content itself is a big piece of this diversification puzzle it is the volume and delivery of that content that holds the most promise for Verizon My take on the stock is that a PE ratio in the range of makes it a little expensive but not over the top Besides a longterm holding can give you the benefit of its current dividend yield that has been more or less consistent over the past several years Despite the fact that the Verizons acquisition of Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO is still only an expression of interest by the former it may well have played a trump card this Monday past with its tentative labor agreement with the Communications Workers of America which could see Verizon employees going back to their ninetofives as early as Wednesday this week The move doesnt affect VZs possible bid for Yahoo in any tangible way but it does make a statement about its ability to resolve burning matters of the human resource kind With an expected layoffs at Yahoo yielding a savings of billion it may well have to make that cut in the workforce if it does proceed with the asset purchase If such an acquisition does come to fruition this year or even in the first half of Verizon will have acquired half a billion visitors a month and two proprietary advertising network technologies within the span of two years Estimates put the bid range between billion and billion for Yahoos core assets and thats around what Verizon paid for AOL Again the intent would primarily be in my opinion in Yahoos advertising network via the content it serves to over million unique monthly visitors Like AOL Yahoo has its own ad algorithms and this along with a readymade audience is what Verizon would be after Admittedly Verizons handsoff approach with acquired companies may not work well with Yahoo but it already has AOL CEO Tim Armstrong to take control if the deal goes through hed be the natural choice for VZ
