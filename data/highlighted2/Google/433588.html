leader these investors are looking at the cloud industry as a single industry One of the most lucrative subcategories of the cloud industry is that targeting enterprises While many individuals and small businesses see Amazon as the default provider even I use Amazon enterprises are much less biased toward Amazon This article is in response to a question made in the comments section in my article on how to play Amazon after earnings The question follows This is an important question for any investor in the tech market as the current trend is moving to the cloud While most investors in this industry see Amazon Web Services as the market leader these investors are looking at the cloud industry as a single industry In fact it can be segmented into many subcategories One of the most lucrative subcategories of the cloud industry is that targeting enterprises While many individuals and small businesses see Amazon as the default provider even I use Amazon enterprises are much less biased toward Amazon This is important in gaining an understanding of the cloud industry as enterprises are increasing their budgets The question you should be asking here is Why Why are Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>able to double their market shares year over year If they were both tiny companies we could easily attribute their growth to the idea that its easier to double the size of a small company than a large company However Microsoft and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>hold a large enough market share to where this explanation is not adequate In addition if this were a rising tide raises all ships situation we would see IBM and Salesforce also growing at fasterthanAmazon rates Instead it seems that Microsoft and Googles growth in this market can be attributed to their focus on niching their businesses to serving enterprises When you cut the cloud industry to only look at the enterprise layer you see that Amazon loses its status as the market leader Here Microsoft is the leader and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is in third place And with these two companies respective growth rates we can see them squeezing out Amazon to become the leaders in enterprise cloud services Now consider the first image in this article it has a point Individual cloud service users and more importantly enterprises are increasingly aware of the dangers of cloud storage With this awareness comes an escalating concern for cloud security Needless to say security is more important an issue for enterprises than it is for individuals or small businesses It is no wonder then than the companies with stronger security mechanisms should secure the market share in the BB sector A comparison of the security of the top four enterprise cloud services follows ignore Rockspace From a security standpoint only IBM can be considered weak Amazon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Microsoft all offer security benefits over one another However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>might leave a bad taste in some mouths with their reputation for spying on its clients and collecting voice data without permission Microsoft Azure and IBM both have firewall weakpoints The lack of a firewall in IBM is of course a problem Azures firewall lacks the management properties over internal traffic which both Amazon and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>offer Nevertheless Microsoft understandably has it easiest from this point forward as the company has their foot in the door with Office The cloud connection makes it easy for companies to integrate software that is already part of their systems with Microsofts cloud service I pointed this out in a previous article on the company In addition the recent purchase of LinkedIn NYSE LNKD on the part of Microsoft is another foot in the door The MSFTLNKD deal seems to be somewhat misunderstood Many stories are reporting this deal as Microsofts entry to the social media market A more likely explanation is that Microsoft is that Microsoft will be using LinkedIn to leverage relationships with enterprises to expedite its market share growth in the corporate area Some investors dislike the deal stating that it was too costly However the deal barely makes a dent in MSFTs B of cash It was less than a year ago that LNKD was trading close to a share the per share buyout seems like a discount in this regard Other investors point to other deals Microsoft could have made such as buying Twitter NYSE TWTR A MSFTTWTR deal would not be nearly as useful for Microsoft in growing market share in the BB cloud industry With LinkedIn at its disposal Microsoft can hasten its outreach to the corporate need for cloud services a task much more difficult to design through Twitter outreach In addition this deal will reduce future costs for Microsoft The company is currently a client of LinkedIn but the client relationship will soon disappear saving MSFT money in the longrun Now that MSFT owns LinkedIn they own a backdoor to marketing their services to large enterprises thereby closing the distance on Amazon in overall market share and continuing to outpace <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>in the corporate cloud service industry Moving forward Mircosofts growth will outpace the rest of the cloud providers allowing it to dominate enterprise cloud services Amazon will continue to sit on the throne in the nonenterprise industry IBM with little to offer over the other three will surrender its thirdplace position in the infrastructure as a service IaaS and Platform as a Service PAAS markets to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Investors interested in investing in the growing cloud industry should consider MSFT first as the company shows the greatest potential for growth Amazon is also a safe bet despite its growth rate being outpaced by its rivals <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is also growing quickly making it a good choice for capturing growth in IaaS and PaaS IBM and CRM here are the laggards but are working together to create a cloud service with enhanced security which would be offered to banks financial institutions and the healthcare industry Despite their belowaverage growth I wouldnt bet against them because they are nevertheless showing success and innovation in a growing industry However either will make a suitable leg in a pair trade if youre looking to hedge market risk in the cloud industry Smaller overlooked companies in the cloud industry should also be considered as they do not suffer the risks that the above glamor stocks do when failing to meet earnings expectations Two more worth
