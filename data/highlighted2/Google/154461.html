NASDAQGOOG Seeking Alpha Have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>investors considered potential losses of default search engine revenues on mobile and PCs Microsoft has replaced <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>as the Default Search Engine on Windows At the time of writing this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG is trading near alltime highs Investors cheered its most recent earnings report Investors also appeared to like the companys planned reorganization into Alphabet a newly named company where investors will have further clarity into the performance of various <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>segments However with an Apple NASDAQ AAPL iPhone announcement imminent I wonder if this enthusiasm may be overexuberant Imagine a shakeup in the search industry where another player becomes the company where advertisers must go to reach many iPhone users There have been many reports that Apples search deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>expires this year On September Bloomberg reported that Googles thenCEO Eric Schmidt said in an interview that the search deal with Apple was recently extended To date I have seen no public document indicating whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Apple have renewed their search agreement I believe for multiple reasons that the answer to this question will be revealed when Apple introduces its next iPhone prior to its release Forbes has reported that the next iPhone will be released on September First although the Bloomberg report didnt give details of the terms of any agreement renewal it seems that the deal has historically been renewed some time during or before September So the upcoming release of the iPhone is vaguely close to at least one anniversary of a prior renewal Second if there is a new default search engine the ideal time to introduce it would be at the time of the introduction of the new iPhone This is because Apple competes with Googles Android operating system and has a history of dropping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>products when it can Examples include when Apple created its own mapping system to replace <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Maps and removed Googleowned YouTube from the iOS home screen If Apple has a goal of convincing people not to switch from a new default search engine back to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Apple needs to sell the new search engine to the public and tech media as being better Since Apple publicly demonstrates products at its keynotes it is logical that any change to iOS affecting future iPhones and iPads be introduced with the introduction of the next iPhone Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO recently updated its mobile search engine which Engadget described in June of this year as looking a lot like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Last year Yahoo made a deal with Mozilla to become the default search engine on the Firefox browser In Yahoos July second quarter video conference call CEO Marissa Mayer stated Weve been really thrilled with our partnership with Mozilla It was a profitable deal right away in Q which you often dont see with such a large partner and it remained profitable in Q During a conference video call in January Mayer responded to a question about a potential Safari deal by saying The Safari users are among the most engaged and lucrative users in the world and its something that we would really like to be able to provide In Yahoos Q filed on August the company provided interesting information with respect to its search deal with Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Specifically on or after October either the Company or Microsoft may terminate the Search Agreement by delivering a written notice of termination to the other party The Search Agreement will remain in effect for four months from the date of the termination notice to provide for a transition period This timing is interesting as it is within weeks of the reported next iPhone release date Yahoos Q also states the Company will now have the ability in response to queries on both personal computers and mobile devices to request algorithmic listings only paid listings only or both algorithmic and paid listings from Microsoft So for those who think Microsoft has better search technology in America or elsewhere it appears that Yahoo has the ability to use Microsofts algorithms Further Yahoo has four months to transition out of its agreement with Microsoft So if Yahoo became the default for iOS it would perhaps have time to continue using Microsofts algorithms until it further improved its own Or perhaps it could come to a further amended deal with Microsoft to use its algorithms As noted above Microsoft also has an ability to terminate its deal with Yahoo on October Microsoft has demonstrated an interest in pursing search as its Bing search engine has recently become the default search engine of AOL NYSE VZ In Microsofts July Q conference call CEO Satya Nadella when commenting on search partnerships with Yahoo and Apple stated With advertising revenue growth of year over year Bing will transition to profitability in the coming fiscal year I assume the Apple partnership referred to in that comment is the Siridefault search deal reported in June Remember this date its important later in this article Microsofts conference call did not reveal the specifics of Bings previous losses So we do not know exactly what it will take for Bing to become profitable although its CEO saying that it will be profitable seems pretty confident However very importantly Bing is the default search engine of Edge the new default browser on the recentlyreleased Windows So if Apple really wanted to stick it to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>it could make Bing the iOS default search engine Advertisers who wanted to advertise on PCs iPhones or iPads would have to pay Microsoft instead of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>to reach anyone that kept the default search engines As mentioned at the start of this article Apple has historically removed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>products from iOS when it can This is presumably because it views <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>as a powerful competitor Microsoft has also demonstrated through Windows that it obviously prefers that people use its own search engine over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>As mentioned Yahoo says its deal with Mozilla is profitable which means that the traffic acquisition costs Yahoo is paying Mozilla are worth it Presumably this is because a sufficient number of Firefox users are sticking with the default Yahoo search instead of switching back to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>One can imagine how many Windows users will stick with Bing on Windows However if Apple gives Microsoft iOS default Bing could be an advertising powerhouse on PCs and on mobile Further as mentioned above Microsoft reportedly became the Siri default search in June Months later in September Microsoft acquired Nokias mobile phone business In Microsofts most recent earnings report million in revenue came from Microsofts iPad competitor Surface It seems that when Apple gave Microsoft default search on Siri it was far less of a hardware competitor to Apple From a strategic point of view if Apple is interested in weakening <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>giving search business to Microsoft would greatly strengthen another direct competitor In contrast Yahoo does not produce hardware or Android If Apple wants to weaken its competitors it seems that convincing people of the positive merits of a Yahoo iOS default would support that cause better than continuing its agreement with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>as iOS default or giving default to Microsoft I have read various analyst commentary on the potential impact of a loss of iOS default by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>According to Apple Insider a UBS analyst stated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>will obtain billion in revenue from its search deal with Apple this year or of its gross revenue That article estimated a switchback rate in determining that the impact on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>including costs previously paid to Apple to be the default search engine would only reduce <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>net revenue by about Apple stated at its most recent World Wide Developers Conference that Apple Maps usage to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Maps usage on iOS devices is about to Yahoo has told us that enough users have not switched the default on Firefox for Yahoo default to remain profitable A potential loss of iOS default should be considered with the impact of a Bing Windows default If Googles iOS and Windows search queries decline then it makes sense that advertisers will go elsewhere to buy ads previously purchased on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>In other words <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>may no longer be the automatic goto place for advertising on PCs or mobile As such a scenario would provide <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>with an incentive to focus on other segments like YouTube <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>investors may want to consider the timing of its latest Alphabet announcement Disclaimer The
