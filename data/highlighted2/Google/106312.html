class='textDiv'>Apple MusicFirst Impressions The Big Picture This would be a rave at least a qualified one if it werent for those pesky interface issues And if I have them what about the punter Apple and the industry hope to get on board and pay The service is much more comprehensible in iTunes At nearly PM Apple pushed iTunes to my Mac The install was easy Working the programnearly impossible What if they built a maze with goodies at every turn but you couldnt figure out how to get out never mind retrace your steps Thats Apple Music Although its more comprehensible on the phone once you get over the hurdle Why are there so many hurdles You load iTunes and youve got no idea where to go how the program works You expect to see a button that says Apple Music but you dont Rather you see the usual suspects plus For You New and Connect Also you have Radio Was that there before I cant remember I never listened to iTunes Radio as a matter of fact the only thing I used iTunes for was to synch my devices my iPhone and iPad when it came to musicI used Spotify and Deezer So where do I click How do I get started Turns out Radio is just that Its easy to listen to Beats its at the top of the page I did some listening not much its gonna take some time to find out if Beats changes the industry What we want most is for Beats to break actsrecords But with so many deejays and only one channel in an on demand universe where I never want to hear a tuneout Beats is passive Even more passive than Pandora Yet people love Pandora But Pandora theoretically plays music you want to hear most people dont want to hear whats playing on Beats thats the nature of a singular radio station You see a ton of albums But is this the iTunes Store or can you play these for free You gingerly click around and find you can listen Thats cool Then you go to For You And here you get recommendations based on what bubbles you picked and pricked An inane idea that yields no fruit I could explain further but just try it its nearly worthless But the playlists Theyre near genius But to get to the playlists Youve got to click on New and scroll down I stumbled on them by accident and then I couldnt get back Frustrated me so much Like I said shouldnt playlists be under For You And there are two types of playlists Apple Music Editors and Curators Whats the difference Didnt anybody at Apple ask this Click around and you can see that Curators is outsiders like Rolling Stone and Pitchfork And there youve got the essence of Apple Music once you know how to use it its pretty good but its less than intuitive and the learning curve is if not steep definitely uphill Theres one other playlist type Activities thats too generic for me my music means too much to me I dont do random Clicking on Apple Music Editors you get to the heart of the matter the genre playlists You cannot open multiple pages Getting back to where you once belonged can be challenging You pick one and Let me mention right here Apple Music looks much better than Spotify Spotify sucks when it comes to advertising and distributing its message and design too This is the legacy of Steve Jobs look counts And Apple Music looks good Not quite good enough to lick but close So once youre in the genre area picking lets say SingerSongwriter youre confronted with five rows The first is the most important Its the playlists the general ones the hits and You click on a playlist andyou discover new music Really Well done Apple I already heard something I liked that I never heard before Forget You In LA by Poema who Id never heard of before never mind played And there was a track cherrypicked from Arlo Guthries old Washington County album on another SingerSongwriter playlist soits kinda thrilling Assuming you have confidence in the curators Below the first row of playlists theres a line Albums You Need To Hear Of which there are five in every genre This is great it separates the wheat from the chaff you can sample what you should And then theres a line In Rotation SingerSongwriter Radio I thought clicking on these albums would get you customized radio stations but instead you get full albums you can stream on demand So why is it Radio Im not suremaybe they play these songs on Beats this is just evidence of the many frustrations on Apple Music loose ends that any editor could point out and could be fixed but it appears no liberal arts major oversaw the overall program to make it coherent And on the last line youve got Intro To Where youve got playlists of significant acts This is much more coherent and understandable than Spotify and intriguing But if you quit iTunes and try to get back to the playlists Good luck Just remember click on New and SCROLL DOWN And thats the essence of the service the playlists They do not coincide with radio I checked out the Electronic area andthe tracks in the AList theres an AList for every genre did not coincide with the chart Diplo the king of the summer was nowhere to be found never mind DJ Snake and So whats more important Radio or Apple Music Whos got the chart that counts This is the essence of the issue The iTunes sales chart drove sales people would check out what was on top Will Apple Music playlists drive consumption Maybe If enough people subscribe and use whats on the AList will drive the culture Thats a pretty big if but not an insurmountable one All of this is much easier to use on the phone But just like in iTunes youve got to get over the hurdle youve got to figure out youve got to click on New at the bottom of the app to see the playlists which once again you have to scroll down to encounter Normally youd click on New last after My Music and For You but thats not how it works in Apple Musicland So what weve got is a program with a steep learning curve that makes music consumption fun and rewarding yet is harder to navigate and understand than Spotify Once again once you figure the program out its best to use it on the desktop thats where you can SEE the playlists and understand everything And Apple Music looks better than Spotify PS Theres a setting in the app to make sure your subscription is canceled on and you dont get billed its all over the web heres an example How to turn off Apple Musics autorenewal before your free trial ends Do it now so you dont forget later bitlyTIPO And this is why Apple Music will not reach its goal of million subscribers in months If people can figure out this trick in a matter of hours they can figure out how to listen to music for free especially when its there for the taking on YouTube where the search works as opposed to on Apple Music Thats right start searching youll get into backwaters you cannot get out of assuming you end up where you want to be to begin with PPS Connect is a disaster dead on arrival Theres almost no content Its Ping without the hope Yes Ping was early enough in the social media arc that we were interested now the acts dont even seem interested Connect should have been fully populated upon release its not PPPS Every genre page has buttons on the top Featured Playlists and Connect Whats the difference between Featured and Playlists One of the many questions Apple didnt ask itself before it foisted this design upon us PPPPS We wont know if Apple Music is a success for a very long time Even if youre interested and I am its going to take weeks to get into the nooks and crannies and find out if its a superior experience to what has come before never mind worth paying for PPPPPS Functionality is hobbled Youre gonna get the spinning gear Id say its release day blues but isnt the goal to have MORE people use the service PPPPPPS There are heart and plus sign icons that dont reveal their meaning when you hover over them and dont seem to be reversible once youve clicked Apple built its reputation on the seamless experience Steve Jobs wanted as few buttons on the remote as possible he was all about leaving stuff out to avoid confusion That ethos has left Cupertino PPPPPPPS On the homepage when you log in there should be the five tracks you MUST hear This is what the music business is looking for a way to draw the confused in expose them to music that titillates them and makes them fans Instead youve got to get into the weeds and thats too much for most people Botched launch Terminal Probably not but we expect so much of Apple We had to listen to Jimmy and Drake testify but no one focused on usability no one told us how it actually worked that would have been a better use of WWDC time instead we got smoke and mirrors about a revolutionary product how classic entertainment business I dont think the average person would be aware of this however I am I know you need a new iTunes and a new iOS I decided to download both simultaneously a big mistake There were no notices on my computer nothing telling me about this great new product So I went to Software Update where I found waiting for me I figured Apple Music was baked in Now Ive got a maxedout iMac k and down and it took me the better part of fifteen minutes to install the update And then it didnt work I went to iTunes Kept clicking saw nothing Went to Safari followed the prompts Got back to iTunes was told to upgrade but then the program said it was up to date Downloaded the latest iteration and it still didnt work Then I went to research <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>told me APPLE HADNT PUSHED TO CUSTOMERS YET Thats right on launch day you cant use it at least not on your Mac or PC until Apple deigns to send the software all that hype fornothing My iPhone gave me no notice of an update I had to go to the Settings to General and then search to see if they pushed new software But eventually my iPhone rebooted Which took forever and Im running a And I found Apple Music It immediately wanted to charge me Hmm I dont like coughing up my credit card and neither does anyone else And since Apple already has my credit cardIm more fearful of cancelability or forgetfulness Thats right you cant cancel subscriptions in America just call your cable company and try Furthermore gotchas abound If I try to cancel a subscription one minute into the next month they charge me for that so I abhor making the commitment to subscribe whenever it requires financial information Now we know why Jimmy said he was gonna kill free Through timetreasured American bait and switch techniques The barrier to entry is supposed to be low youre supposed to charge AFTER How many kids are gonna ask their parents to pay and get no in response How many parents are gonna be PISSED when they find out theyve been charged for something they thought was free which will happen in October So I decide to log in with my Beats account all the news says its gonna prompt me to convert to Apple Music That didnt happen But I hit the button on the mobile app and registered anyway And what did I find NONE OF THE INTUITIVE GRACE APPLE IS FAMOUS FOR Kinda looked like the old iTunes Store all I could see was what I paid for On the bottom I found radio I clicked and heard what I did not want to Looked for the OFF button Hard to find Eventually found a triangle near the bottom of the screen So there are five buttons at the bottom of the screen and the first is For You I click and I get the damn bubbles for Beatss curation algorithm Didnt this fail once already Apple does not do cutesy but it does here So Im waiting for the new iTunes so I can listen more to Beats I dont want to use my iPhone while Im working at my desk As for the vaunted playlists Where are they how do I find them Do I have to click on the damn bubbles Now Im not saying Apple Music is a failed product that will get no traction But I am saying people have an unrealistic expectation of its functionality and ultimate impact First and foremost youve got to let people know about it Ill argue Apple has not done the greatest job here its equivalent to a soft launch but with more than a modicum of publicity Second USABILITY What Apple built its rep on How do I download install and use the damn product Ive never been flummoxed to this extent before with an Apple offering Even the Watch was easier And they said they were gonna beat Spotify on interfacemake me laugh Third USABILITY Once Im in how do I use it All I keep hearing is about playlists but where are they How about one page with easy instructions how about instructions in the app I didnt see them Apple Music will have an impact it will gain customers The brand will get people started but only word of mouth will make it primary The truth is many people dont have subscription streaming services and a great proportion of them may not even be aware of them or how they work So despite Spotifys penetration were not that far from the starting line But when you make it hard to install and want me to give my credit card up front You look like a sleazy American company like a hated cable operation and you make people reluctant This is no way to launch a revolution PS Yes the first three months are free But right up front you commit to paying when that runs out you link to your iTunes account which has a credit card attached PPS We do live in a mobile world so desktop functionality is secondary But those most prone to subscribing are the Luddites and they start on the desktop machine PPPS Apple bought SoundJam to build iTunes and cleaned it up to be easier to use as well as adding functionality If you dont think Apple Music looks just like Beats Music you never used Beats Music Except theres more clutter and its less intuitive Makes me think you should keep techies and music business people separate As in Jimmy Iovine can hype but he cant

have neither said nor implied If you could repeat previously discredited memes or steer the conversation into irrelevant off topic discussions it would be appreciated Lastly kindly forgo all civility in your discourse you are after all anonymous Apple has always overplayed the value of their brand Now they seem to have lost the understanding that the only way to get away with those exorbitant prices is to deliver a premium first class experience The Apple brand and overcharge model prospered on understanding what the costumers need and would want enough to forgive the exorbitant prices When the bean counters take over a company the costumers stop being someone to cherish and pamper and become something to milk as much as you can and that is the end for that type of business model
