recent week high of After the WWDC will AAPL stock finally break above its resistance level at which has served like a fortress for the past three months Apple NASDAQ AAPL will kick off its Worldwide Developers Conference Monday in San Francisco And aside from rumors related to possible hardware and software unveiling the question Im most interested in is Will AAPL stock finally break above its resistance level at which has served like a fortress for the past three months Note I own AAPL stock and I trade a block of shares whenever it suits me Can AAPL stock finally break free Yes it can Note Im not saying it will After getting my butt kicked by the market last month Im done making predictions for now Im not expecting any new hardware announcements Monday Software particularly iOS is where the action will be There will likely be a revamped OS X operating system for the new line of Macs But the real star of the show will be what Apple finally unveils for its move into ondemand music and the realm of radio streaming To what extent can Apple which picked off Beats last year take share from Spotify and put the proverbial nail in Pandoras NYSE P coffin Will just announcing an updated Beats platform be enough I dont think so not unless Apple at the same time figures out a way to include video into the platform allowing it to at the same time take a bite out of YouTube Not to mention thats the direction Spotify is heading in And heres the thing with iPhones and iPads accounting for of mobile video views it makes sense for Apple to want to distribute that content right Apple is already leading the race for digital supremacy Avoiding it any further doesnt make sense So take that as my only prediction for Monday Aside from music and radio Im expecting a mix of video in the new Beats package whatever its going to be called Next if youve read the news blogs Apple has likely scratched any mention of the television service Its not ready for prime time says the headlines Forever the perfectionist I dont have a problem with Apples decision assuming the reports are credible But any news regarding the Apple Watch especially yeartodate sales figures or projections will send AAPL stock materially higher AAPL stock closed Friday at down translating to a down week of But the market is all relative The shares are still up on the year dominating the broader averages And you would think AAPL stock was the worst performer of the Dow given how gloomy many Apple shareholders have been recently Read the comments on my articles here here and here Granted AAPL stock has been a relative disappointment thats if youve only watched it for the past three months But expand that horizon by one year and the shares are up some crushing the major indexes Why is that important Its been a year since Apples last Worldwide Developers Conference three months prior to Apple launching the bestselling smartphones of all time in the iPhone and Plus My point is it was precisely at last Junes Worldwide Developers Conference when the narrative about Apple changed Innovation was back Growth had returned facilitating the commensurate demise of Samsung OTCSSNLF and the recent struggles seen in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and neither company has yet to fully recover What has AAPL stock done during the span How about soaring from a splitadjusted price of around to its recent week high of And there is evidence to suggest that Apple following its WWDC event will heighten the pressure on its competitors
