class='textDiv'>Netflix Buy The Dip Netflix Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Highly critiqued billion streaming service provider Netflix NASDAQ NFLX plunged after according to The Guardian it missed secondquarter expectations announcing that it added only million members worldwide and blamed price increase for drop in membership But the company did not lose subscribers it is still growing rapidly As for its high valuation Amazon NASDAQ AMZN also has a high valuation very similar to Netflixs numbers Like Amazon Netflix had a clear competitive advantage in the past but does it still have an advantage Was this plunge an overreaction and is it now a buying opportunity Click to enlargeSource SEC filings On Monday July the company reported it added million streaming subscribers in the second quarter July or about million streaming subscribers per month as shown in the graph above This was smaller than the million new streaming subscribers it expected for the quarter and much smaller than the million streaming subscribers it added in the second quarter of last year It was also a big drop from the million streaming subscribers million streaming subscribers per month it added in the first quarter The company gained about million streaming subscribers per month over the last three years As of last month Netflix had about million streaming subscribers This does not include those subscribers who opt to get just DVD by mail services The light blue box is the companys forecasted numbers of streaming subscribers in the third quarter The company forecasts it will add million streaming subscribers in the third quarter Worldwide streaming subscribers seem to peak in the first quarters and So a second quarter slowdown should be no surprise Worldwide streaming subscriber growth from the first quarter of to the second quarter of was million This is almost the same as worldwide streaming subscriber growth from the first quarter of to the second quarter which was million On a year over year basis quarterly worldwide streaming subscribers have grown almost linearly over the last three years International streaming subscribers are increasing more than US streaming subscribers and could overtake US streaming subscribers in a few years But both are increasing nearly linear US DVD subscribers are declining and its decline is also nearly linear Currently the company has million US streaming subscribers million international streaming subscribers and million DVD subscribers According to the graph below TV cable subscribers was million in the first quarter and slowly declining That means Netflix US streaming subscribers would soon overtake US cable subscribers But US broadband internet subscribers was million in the first quarter and slowly increasing at about million new broadband subscribers per month Netflixs US streaming subscriber growth averaged about million per month but slowed to million per month in the second quarter There seems to still be plenty of room for the company to grow in the US as long as US broadband subscribers grow faster than Netflixs US streaming subscribers But it is clear that international expansion will become the main driver of growth in the future Source Broadband subscribers continue to climb while cable sees mixed subscriber trends In May of Netflix sent an email to subscribers telling them that only new members would be paying a month Existing subscribers will keep paying a month per month was later raised to per month in The onedollar raise affects new subscribers in the United States Canada and Latin America right away But it wont affect most existing subscribers for a year Existing subscribers still paid only per month Now all subscribers have to pay per month and that is what seems to be making customers angry Netflix said Monday that customers who learned in April that the price was about to increase had begun canceling their subscriptions But this price hike was already known for two years Since the hike started in and and the company saw a short term slowdown but later recovered the same thing would probably happen again The current situation also resembles the price hikes when looking at US subscriber growth In the second quarter of the company added just US subscribers from April through June which is the lowest quarterly gain since it split its streaming and DVD by mail services five years ago In July of Netflix raised prices for its combined streaming and DVD by mail services from per month to per month Then in September the company split its streaming business and DVD by mail business at per month each allowing customers to purchase the service they choose However customers were furious with the price hike for the combined service and caused the company to cut its subscriber forecast by one million or Shares plunged But subscriber growth recovered and share prices rose The same thing would probably happen again Also as noted above US subscriber growth seems less and less important compared to international subscriber growth Growth for the company would be determined by how well it grows internationally However as shown in companys K above the company lost money from international streaming over the last three years The good thing is that the loss decreased from to But due to an increase in marketing cost the loss increased in Both domestic and international subscriber totals include about free trial subscribers Also as noted on page and of the K average monthly revenue per paying domestic subscriber was and growing but it was only per international subscriber and that was a drop from in As stated in the K the decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership was due to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and to a lesser extent the impact of absorbing higher VAT valueadded tax rates across our European markets beginning January These decreases were partially offset by our pricing changes and plan mix We believe international revenues would have been approximately million higher in if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with those for the year ended December Since loss was only million in that means loss could have been only million This is very bullish for the company assuming exchange rates become more favorable In January of the companys streaming service became available virtually everywhere in the world except in China and territories where US companies are not allowed to operate The poor subscriber numbers overshadowed the companys second quarter report which beat on earnings and met on revenue It reported EPS earnings per share of beating analysts EPS estimates of Revenue came in at billion meeting analysts revenue estimates For the third quarter analysts estimate EPS of on billion in revenue For fiscal analysts are looking for EPS of on billion Below are the revenue and earnings graphs for the past three and a half years with analysts estimates for the next two quarters The estimates in the revenue and expense graph are surrounded by an orange box Revenue has been soaring nearly linear and should continue The difference between revenue and total expenses was greatest in the second quarter of and has been shrinking This could be a warning sign as earnings may fall And earnings has fallen since the second quarter of but earnings seems to have hit bottom and may fall back to that bottom as analysts estimate But looking at the year over year earnings graph it seems that earnings may beat expectations Fundamentally I see no reason for Netflix to fall Like Amazon Netflix created a massive digital library that is easy for consumers to use and sells a service to them at a great price People go to Amazon not just because it is inexpensive but because they do not want to spend hours going from store to store to find what they want Like Warren Buffett said about Amazon Dont just satisfy your customers delight them Any business with delighted customers has a sales force they wont have to pay Like Amazon Netflix delighted customers with its platform and created a loyal following The time and effort to create that massive digital library in addition to signing deals with content providers and having loyal fans gave Netflix a competitive advantage Yes as time went by competitors narrowed that advantage But pricing is only one part of the equation Netflix still has a larger offering than competitors with good quality content YouTube Red by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>GOOGL GOOG offers millions of adfree movies music videos and restricted original content for per month However YouTube Red membership does not include access to any content that requires purchase such as rentals payperview purchases or paid channel subscriptions Additionally most videos are available on YouTube for free with ads Many of the original content will also become available on YouTube for free with ads after a length of time Amazon Prime Video offers adfree movies TV episodes original content music books to borrow and day free shipping on all Amazon purchases for per year per month Hulu offers around shows and movies but with limited ads starting at per month Basic service is free but shows are limited Hulu has an adfree service for per month Good thing is that one can usually find shows a day after they air on broadcast TV CBS NYSE CBS All Access offers over CBS TV episodes ondemand plus the ability to stream CBS locally with limited ads for up to per month Netflixs cost is per month which ties YouTube Red as the subscription service with the second highest cost Hulus adfree service is the costliest Netflix offers about adfree movies and TV shows a little more than twice the size of its nearest competitor Amazon Prime While many of the movies and TV shows are old Netflix offers some of the most popular shows such as Orange is the New Black and House of Cards On July it signed a new multiyear content licensing with CW Network a joint venture between CBS and Warner Brothers Entertainment NYSE TWC to allow Netflix exclusive US subscription rights of series broadcasted on The CW Shows available include FREQUENCY NO TOMORROW RIVERDALE the hit DC series LEGENDS OF TOMORROW and SUPERGIRL ARROW FLASH JANE THE VIRGIN CRAZY EXGIRLFRIEND and fan favorites such as THE VAMPIRE DIARIES THE IZOMBIE THE ORIGINALS and REIGN Also on July it signed a deal with Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA which lets Comcast subscribers watch Netflix programs on its new X voicecontrolled cable box The idea is that by exposing Comcast subscribers to Netflixs content they may switch to Netflix On July it signed a licensing agreement with CBS for the new Star Trek television series Netflix will be the exclusive premiere home of Star Trek in countries excluding the US and Canada Additionally all existing episodes of the iconic Star Trek television library including Star Trek The Original Series Star Trek The Next Generation Star Trek Deep Space Nine Star Trek Voyager and Star Trek Enterprise will be available on Netflix around the world by the end of Netflix will also start benefiting from a deal it signed with Disney NYSE DIS back in Beginning in September Netflix will be allowed to stream all Disney films including Marvel Pixar and Lucasfilm titles in the same window that theyd typically be made available to HBO Starz and other paid TV networks More importantly the deal keeps Disney films released after August off Amazon Prime Hulu and other streaming services and allows Netflix to be the exclusive US pay TV home of the latest films from Disney Marvel Lucasfilm and Pixar Taking a quick look at the stocks data from Finviz it is clear the stock has a huge valuation The trailing PE is The forward PE is Both match up well with Amazon Interesting is that Netflixs price to book is lower than Amazons A notable difference is that next years EPS growth rate is estimated at for Netflix vs for Amazon Netflixs PEG ratio is about twice that of Amazons but next years EPS growth rate is more than three times that of Amazons Thus should Netflix demand a higher valuation than Amazon due to higher next years EPS growth rate Looking to Netflixs graph above one can see that the stock price bounced below resistance and zoomed to support due to the disappointing subscriber numbers Drawing my own black lines on top of the computer generated technical graph the price movement has also formed a descending triangle with a price target of above or below the breakout point I assume that the stock will bounce off of support and break above resistance leading to a target price of about But if the stock breaks below support target could be about However a move all the way down to seems unlikely as the stock would have to cross below the long term support line Also note that the support line falls on the day moving average The day moving average provides another level of support at The graph below seems to show that prices could likely bounce back soon The Stochastic K the WR and the RSI Relative Strength Index are in or near oversold bullish territory The MFI Money Flow Index is halfway between overbought bearish and oversold territory One time when all four technicals the MFI RSI Stochastic K and WR were at similar levels as indicated by the purple line the price fell But another time when all four technicals the MFI RSI Stochastic K and WR were at similar levels as indicated by the orange line the price rose The MACD Moving Average ConvergenceDivergence Oscillator formed a bearish downward cross sell signal on July In the MACD a crossover of the red line below the black line indicates a buy signal while a crossover of the red line above the black line indicates a sell signal Could it make a bullish upward cross buy signal soon Conclusion Overall Netflix seems to have a bright future and the pullback seems a buying opportunity Even though a week has passed since the plunge shares are still very low and could be ready to head higher Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in NFLX DIS over the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in
