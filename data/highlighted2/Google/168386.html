Includes ALU ERIC NOK QCOM SSNLF VZ by Ryan Crane Verizons announcement both validates Straight Paths MA thesis and accelerates the timeline Verizons chosen partners are very publicly huge proponents for using Straight Paths LMDS and GHz spectrum for G Straight Path is the largest holder of GHz spectrum with over of the active licenses On August I posted on SA Straight Path NYSEMKT STRP FCC Move Bullish for the Stock I posted this article following FCC Chairman Wheelers favorable comments regarding the potential inclusion of millimeter wave spectrum for use in G wireless networks I further wrote in August New spectrum requires years of network planning construction to deploy and carriers typically buy spectrum years before actually deploying it With the commercial rollout of G slated for I would anticipate Straight Path will have MA options by Q at the latest The big four carriers Verizon NYSE VZ TMobile NYSE TMUS ATT NYSE T and Sprint NYES S would certainly be potential buyers Internet companies such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL are already actively investigating millimeter wave mobile wireless and could also be interested in acquiring an immediately available national footprint of millimeter wave spectrum licenses I believe yesterdays Verizon announcement both increases the likelihood and accelerates the timing of my conclusions in my August th article This week Verizon announced that it will be testing G wireless services next year and anticipates commercial deployment of G by Now the largest wireless carrier in the US has publicly stated their intention of going full force into the development and deployment of a G network While multiple bands are most likely going to be part of any G network given comments from FCC Chairman Wheeler and Verizons technology partners public comments I believe that millimeter wave bands will have an important function within the next generation G network With an increased likelihood of inclusion into the G framework and STRPs portfolio of millimeter wave spectrum currently trading at a valuation of less than of the most recent auction prices for mobile spectrum I believe STRP is an attractive riskreward proposition I believe this is a very bullish development as it relates to STRP for two reasons timing and the technology partners selected I had originally projected a timeframe which was consistent with South Korean and Japanese carriers targets of for a limited release of G and a full deployment scheduled for Verizon stated that they intend to target initial commercial deployment in several years ahead of my original expectation In their announcement Verizon indicated that their G wireless service will offer single millisecond latency and times the throughput of current G LTE Verizons partners that are developing the equipment have publicly stated their preferences for and GHz spectrum to achieve these goals To develop the technology Verizon has partnered with AlcatelLucent NYSE ALU Ericsson NASDAQ ERIC Nokia NYSE NOK Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and Samsung OTC SSNLF All have been extremely vocal about the need for G Incidentally all also have focused on achieving G performance by accessing the enormous bandwidth of millimeter wave spectrum Indeed Verizons Roger Gurnani told CNET in an interview last week that G will require big bands of spectrum a clear parallel with what Verizons new partners have been saying about G for over a year now Verizons chosen partners have publicly stated that they are proponents for using Straight Paths LMDS and GHz spectrum for G Samsung Participants in this proceeding including existing licensees in the bands under consideration have echoed Samsungs support for a licensed G regime in the and GHz bands Qualcomm Qualcomm encourages the FCC to promptly issue bandspecific Notices of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to exclusively license for mobile broadband services large blocks of spectrum currently assigned to the LMDS GHz and GHz services Ericsson The LMDS bands at GHz will be of particular interest to the mobile industry for systems that may follow G into higher frequency bands over time the GHz band could likely be harnessed in a way that is useful to industry The operational characteristics that would be needed are similar to what has been detailed for the LMDS band All of this bodes very well for Straight Path I believe that the equipment makers are going to drive the ultimate framework for G network development From the quotes above its apparent that there is a focus on millimeter wave bandwidths Straight Path is the largest holder of GHz spectrum with over of the active licenses Straight Path is a clear winner from Verizons push into G as it is currently trading at less than of the most recent auction prices for mobile spectrum G is no longer a dream of the distant future said Roger Gurnani executive vice president and chief information and technology architect for Verizon We feel a tremendous sense of urgency to push forward on G and mobilize the ecosystem by collaborating with industry leaders and developers to usher in a new
