GOOG GOOGL selfdriving car project has hired a dedicated general counsel Kevin Vosen has been tapped for the role and will begin late this month Recode reports Hes chief legal officer with environmental data analysis firm The Climate Corp started by exGooglers The project is still part of skunkworks lab X but has hinted that it is heading toward separate company status under the Alphabet umbrella I am new to investing and have been trying to learn as much as I can before jumping in the market I really like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and would like to own shares some day Googles PriceEarnings to Growth is according to MSN Ive read that this may indicate that the stock is over valued Would buying at this time be speculating on the market Or fundamentally sound Im not sure if the price is at a good entry point right now Is the market too optimistic about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Im not looking for a definite answer but to get a concensus opinion any feedback would be appreciated IMO it all depends on your timeline and investing objective If you are looking to own <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>in years does it really matter if you overpaid a little today Plus adding on at different valuations over time will DCA down Then again if you believe that only purchasing at certain valuation stick to that if it works for you Though over time you may look back at missed opportunity Investing for years now Ive changed my philosophy a couple times and only have a handful of missed opportunities that I really look back on They all taught me to stick to my investment plan and be patient while keeping the the long and short term in mind Hope this helps The Q quarterly results and conference call so you get a better idea of current and Q projections Generally I use both fundamentals PE PEG etc mostly to analyze a company and then technicals charts to find a good price near support levels to time my purchase As a final note many are turning bearish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>as Facebook is providing lots of search especially in mobile and that will hurt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>going forward I also know of many better stocks including a decent number with PEGs less than and certainly less than michsar gave good advicebut you should at least understand how to time the market It may not always workbut you should know all that is play and you should review charts for pricing and timing Haschultz I am very bullish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>long term But when you look at the recent events in the US you keep hearing about these incidents are being live streamed on Facebook <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>needs to do a better job of having these things live streamed to YouTube As bad as these events have been they are a weird advertisement for Facebook live streaming I would be very curious how much of an increase in live streaming is taking place on Facebook over the last couple of days CNN was interviewing a guy and he shared he was live streaming the interview to Facebook But in the end Facebook makes money from people watching the streams If everyone records to Facebook but the viewers are on YouTube it is not good for Facebook as they bare most of the expense without enjoying the revenue If you go on YouTube the Minnesota Shooting video is on the site with millions of views There are several versions so you have to total The events in the US have been horrible and I hope my comments do not appear inappropriate when you consider what is happening is far far more significant than a ROI from FB or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>The people that are dying no matter who they are have people at home that need them and they are NOT coming home IMO this is NOT acceptable Love to hear some tech investment ideas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Facebook and Amazon are all companies that have strong strategic positions and all have very healthy growth The old tech companies like Apple are basically in free fall Apple had over a decline last quarter and is expected to have a similar decline this quarter With nothing on the horizon to change the trend it is common sense that Apple will continue to decline quickly Where in tech are you finding companies with a strong strategic position that also has double digit growth I am all ears I think we are going to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>actually rolling something out to actual paying customers later this year They bought minivans a month ago or so best advice is do not try to time the market if you have buy every month or every other month stick to a plan ETF Screener Search and filter by asset class strategy theme performance yield and much more ETF Performance View
