profits significantly higher and likely push its stock higher in the process Wednesday on CNBC Patriarch Equity CEO Eric Schiffer called Apple NASDAQ AAPL Pay a disaster with transaction growth having slowed to an annual rate of just As many know Apple Pay was one of the companys biggest bets on services within its hardwaresoftware ecosystem and according to Schiffer there is no real convenience or advantage to using Apple Pay over credit cards and its failures are a big reason for pressure on AAPL stock Granted with Apple receiving just for every worth of transactions Apple Pay was never going to be a significant growth driver for Apple not with its current business model But still the slowed growth and lack of widespread consumer adoption illustrates a failure to innovate at the company Nevertheless there is still one way that Apple can take these failures and make them an actual success a simple move that could create meaningful growth to Apples bottom line and a real headache to Visa NYSE V and MasterCard NYSE MA Anyone who follows Visa MasterCard or the payment processing industry in general knows that the two companies have built a duopoly in this particular segment of the financial sector This in turn has given both companies significant pricing power over merchants where merchants must pay whatever fees that Visa and MasterCard set which is largely believed to be around of the total transaction Furthermore the payment processing space is one that requires a very large delicate ecosystem but once it is established the maintenance costs are minimum Thats why SGA costs compared to revenue have consistently fallen over the last six years and why profit margins have risen over the same span MA SGA to Revenue TTM data by YCharts With MA and Visa having an operating margin of and respectively the big question is what Apple must do to replicate this business The answer surprisingly is not that much There are three things needed to compete with MasterCard or Visa in the payment processing arena First the company must have banks that issue its cards In the US especially it is almost universal that when your bank issues a card it is either Visa or MasterCard This takes care of usage with debit and bank issued credit cards and then the processor often issues its own credit cards with various rewards attached Second the company must have widespread consumer usage This is quite easy for Visa and MasterCard when every bank in the US and most around the world are issuing one or the others card One of these three elements without the other equals failure for a company trying to penetrate this space it requires all three For example a company like Bank of America NYSE BAC could theoretically issue its own cards No If for some reason BofA was to pursue the payment processing space it would have no problem with the card issuing part of this equation In fact BofA has millions of consumers for usage No However it is just one of many banks thereby not having enough users to attract the widespread merchant support needed No to be successful and ultimately compete against Visa or MasterCard Thus if merchants are not accepting BofAs hypothetical selfissued card then consumers wont use it Consumers will use Visa or MasterCard that are accepted everywhere Meanwhile Apple is one of the very few companies that could make this transition work almost in a seamless manner It has an enormous ecosystem with about million iPhone users in the US alone While Apple Pay has not been a great success story it has still gotten many iOS users familiar with making payments with Apple The big problem is that Apple Pay offers no real advantage over credit cards as far as convenience and thats essentially Schiffers complaint Apple Pay also has the support of merchants and the reason is because of how many consumers use Apple products Apple Pay is accepted in over two million retail locations Therefore with two million retail locations and million US users banks would have an incentive to issue Apple creditdebit cards That incentive is a likelihood of success What makes this even more likely is that Apple already has a partnership with just about all major banks in the US thereby establishing that connection if it chooses to make the leap to payment processor While it is hard to see a large bank like Chase or Wells Fargo NYSE WFC getting rid of VisaMasterCard plastic in exchange for an Apple service it is possible that banks would offer their customers an option between Apple or VisaMasterCard As it is now banks choose one or the other Visa or MasterCard However if a third payment processor is added to the mix it creates an opportunity to give banks and consumers more options which in the end benefits everyone That said MasterCard and Visas partnership with Apple has allowed the company to build this ecosystem of necessary parts to become a legitimate threat Its quite ironic For example Apples partnership with these payment processors gave it a front door to the lobby of just about every major US bank that issues Visa or MasterCard The partnership also opened that door to all the retail locations that accept Visa MasterCard or even AmEx This is what separates Apple from the likes of Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Samsung OTCSSNLF PayPal NASDAQ PYPL or Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN With a little time and effort Alphabet could pursue the same opportunity as Apple in payment processing However Alphabet is not quite on the same level right now It would take a lot of work and there are no guarantees Sure Android has more total users than iOS worldwide But Android Pay which is Alphabets equivalent to Apple Pay is accepted in half as many retail locations Apple has countless more participating banks and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>does not have partnerships with Visa or MasterCard where either processor pays Alphabet a percentage of the total transaction Furthermore Alphabets potential pursuit of this business could be stopped by the fact that it relies on hardware companies to adopt all of its software and services Alphabet cannot very well launch a service like Visa or MasterCard exclusively to mobile phones and force all Android supporting hardware to embrace it For example Samsungs hardware is all Android Yet instead of pushing Android Pay on its phonestablets Samsung has its own mobile payment service called Samsung Pay This illustrates one big issue that Alphabet would have to manage before entering the payment processing space competing with Visa or MasterCard While I cant imagine that Apple would want to enter the banking space as a traditional payment processor issuing credit and debit cards like MasterCard and Visa I would not rule out Apples attempt to innovate the space like it did with phones tablets iPods etc The big question is can it do so without Steve Jobs enter a new product category and make it successful More than likely Apple would try to make Apple Pay work no longer being just another way to use your existing credit card but an entirely new Apple issued creditdebit card that is more secure and mostly mobile Nevertheless it is all speculative There is no way to know how AAPL will enter the space and compete with MA or Visa In fact there is no certainty that AAPL will pursue this market It most certainly should because at the very least AAPL could offer consumers an option between Visa and MasterCard adding a third service provider could shake the industry a little bit While it is also impossible to predict Apples fee structure or market share if it does go this route lets just assume it does and reaches trillion in payment volume Keep in mind that Visa achieved trillion in payment volume during its last quarter so Apples performance represents far less market share than what MA or Visa own With this scenario AAPL would dominate the majority of mobile payments a market that is expected to surpass billion this year and a slight share of the more traditional payment and credit card market If AAPL adopted a similar fee structure as Visa or MA then it would create an additional billion in annual revenue where at least half could would be profit Therefore AAPL could add another to its EPS longterm using this model and if some way it could disrupt the entire industry and replicate Visas business then it could add upwards of per share in EPS All things considered AAPL has everything it needs to pursue the payment processing industry It just has to take the right steps With AAPL stock down over the last year investors are desperately seeking the next big thing from Apple Investors want to see innovation something new and they really want to see a major product in the software and services side of Apples business In retrospect thats why this market is so attractive for AAPL a big market where it could create real profits Therefore it makes no sense for AAPL not to pursue this market near term not only for the sake of shareholder sentiment but also to help drive its EPS higher Historically AAPL has been very opportunistic realizing such opportunities when presented The big question now is whether or not it will realize this opportunity one that is there for the taking a market where it could be actual competitor if not leader For the sake of AAPL stock price I sure hope so I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business
