XPoint has the potential to give Intel tremendous leverage into new and developing markets Micron with its coownership of the D memories has the potential to enable Intels competitors creating a significant conflict of interest between the two companies If China resolves its IP issues and enters the memory market the return on investment for all of the memory manufacturers will be significantly reduced over the next decade In this article I propose a new business model that could provide significant benefits to both Intel and Micron as a combined entity Over the last few years there has been a lot of speculation that Intel NASDAQ INTC might or should buy Micron NASDAQ MU The two companies have a longstanding relationship and appear to have jointly developed what appears to be very disruptive technologies with the announcements of D XPoint memory and a floatinggate D NAND technology On the surface a marriage between the two companies seems to make a lot of sense but the volatile operating results of manufacturing memories have to be a hindrance for Intel Intel is the dominant manufacturer of microprocessors where it often commands gross margins in excess of Micron despite significant consolidation is still a pricetaker for what is largely a commodity product of bits of memory Memory factories have to run fullout and it is difficult to regulate output in the short run Meanwhile demand fluctuates significantly from period to period and when you throw in a secular decline in PCs you have major fluctuations in pricing and gross margins Nowhere is this more evident than in the respective gross margins of the two companies Over the last years Intels gross margins have varied from to averaging and they are often measured on basis point variations During this same period Microns gross margins have varied from to a high of on You can see why Intel would be cautious about combining this type of volatility with its results Intel obviously sees a tremendous opportunity in data center solidstate storage It has made it a centerpiece of its growth strategy So much so that the company recently announced that it plans to start building D NANDs at its factory in China and may invest up to billion over the next several years I dont think Intel has any desire to sell D NAND components and believe its intent is to combine the unique features of the D XPoint memory with a floatinggate D NAND to dominate the growing data center storage market and to add to its competitive advantage in the data center processor market So far Intel and Micron have highlighted the benefit of the new D XPoint memory to big data applications The product has been described as the speed of DRAM to the cost of DRAM no need for data refresh and unlike NAND Flash the bits are directly addressable With these benefits D XPoint should also provide a disruptive benefit to a whole host of memory applications from PCs to smart phones IOT automobiles and networking Having access to this unique memory technology has the potential to provide Intel with significant leverage as it enters these other markets by combining them with its processor technologies Intel has invested heavily in the mobile market but to date has had limited success Could D XPoint have the potential to provide a lower cost simpler memory structure by replacing the DRAM and NAND in smart phones Its unclear at this point because both companies have been pretty quiet about a lot of the details but it sure seems possible that D XPoint could create a lower power simpler structure in not only phones but also a variety of products that are in Intels target markets But heres the problem Micron too wants to grow in these markets And how is it going to do that By enabling all of Intels competitors To utilize a new memory is going to require the development of new software many new controller technologies What if Micron does a deal with Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM to optimize D XPoint with its nextgeneration mobile processor Or with Arm Holdings NASDAQ ARMH for IOT applications or microservers What about a deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL or Facebook NASDAQ FB or Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT enabling it to develop its own customized data center SSD applications Can Intel compete with these competitors Sure but it is not just competing with Micron it is competing with the entire ecosystem that Micron enables Intels competitive advantage becomes severely blunted Its becoming clear that these two partners may have significant conflicts of interest There may be limitations on who Micron can partner with on technology development but nothing I have found in the public documents will confirm this It is not allowed to transfer the technology but it needs controllers which optimize D XPoint in new applications So we potentially have two competing issues incongruent business models and strategic conflicts of interest I am recommending that the two companies get together and change the business model There is an incredibly unique and fortuitous set of circumstances occurring today that provide this opportunity Microns stock has been devastated this year by a combination of events which started with a significant decline in DRAM prices as PC sales plummeted at the same time new supply has come on line primarily in the form of technology migrations Wall Street might be able to look past this situation as a temporary demand and supply imbalance but then there has been a series of capacity announcements First by Samsung Electronics OTCSSNLF last year with its announcement of a billion expansion followed by Hynix OTCHXSCF and SanDisk NASDAQ SNDK with its own expansion initiatives Then the announcement from the Chinese of a major initiative to become a player in the memory industry And most recently its good partner Intel announced that it will be entering production in China with a billion investment Wall Street seems to have jumped to the conclusion that this is the same old memory industry all over again And who can blame it It has reached the point that if we extrapolate Samsungs new facility cost across Microns capacity you reach a billion replacement cost for the Micron facilities and working capital This means Micron trades at a discount to the cost of its facilities and working capital and is given absolutely zero value for the technology Tsinghua Unigroup and its affiliates recently announced a billion private placement with the stated intent to build a memory business in China It appears it has dropped its DRAM ambitions and seems focused on NAND technology now Obviously to be competitive it will likely need a D NAND technology Where is it going to get this technology Theoretically it could develop it itself but is it going to develop this technology and have it ready for production by the time the fab is complete in two years Not to mention develop a process that doesnt violate the thousands of patents held by the incumbents It could purchase an existing manufacturer It sounds like it tried that with Micron and it did not go very far That leaves licensing I doubt the Korean companies would license a Chinese company but maybe Spansion recently acquired by Cypress Semiconductor NASDAQ CY supposedly has a D chargetrap technology which it has already licensed to the Chinese foundry XMC Its hard to believe that its technology would be competitive with the existing highvolume memory producers Discussions between Micron and Tsinghua seem to have gone nowhere and analysts are now suggesting a joint venture between the two companies is less likely That leaves SanDisk which is being acquired by Western Digital NASDAQ WDC Tsinghua is purchasing of Western Digital and I think it is fair to assume that there may be some backroom deal which allows Tsinghua access to the SanDisk technology in exchange for financing a big part of the acquisition I assume Micron and Intel are aware of this potential and will be doing whatever they can to disrupt and extend the merger process that is likely a backdoor takeover of an American company and their technology So here is my idea for the new business model Intel should buy Micron and then develop a joint relationship with Tsinghua to produce the more volatile commoditytype memories Existing Micron facilities would be used for the development and production of new types and the latest generation memory products where there is a sustainable competitive advantage over Samsung and the other memory manufacturers for the first year or two of production and then transfer to the China facility as they become more commoditized Presumably these products would have substantially higher gross margins in the early years before becoming commoditized and this should fit well with Intels current business model As the products become highvolume commodities Intel would transfer the process and knowhow to Tsinghua and charge a royalty maybe given the huge cost to Tsinghua if it were to try and go it alone Typical IPoriented companies such as Arm Holdings Rambus NASDAQ RMBS and Tessera NASDAQ TSRA receiverun gross margins so this new model would potentially be accretive to the existing Intel business model China has access to lots of lowcost capital and a strategic desire to develop a competence in memory manufacturing incountry so this relationship would also appear to be in its interest So think of what is accomplished by Intel under this new business model It retains the manufacture of the highermargin memory technology for strategic purposes and obtains additional capacity for components to incorporate into its data storage solutions The company maintains control of potentially disruptive memory technology during the early years so it does not compete with companies that may be enabled by Micron and its future relationships And the company potentially creates a sustainable royalty stream that is accretive to its gross margins Intel clearly benefits from a world where memory is cheap and plentiful Micron does not Given that China will also be adding to available memory capacity the combined entity will be able to immediately cut back on planned capital spending which would enhance cash flow in the near term Transitioning to this new model is a multiyear process Ive been in business long enough to recognize that there are many more complications and unknown considerations than I am able to outline in this article As an
