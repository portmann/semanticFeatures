Apple NASDAQ AAPL is challenging the watch industry with the new Apple Watch collections of smartwatches Already there has been a great deal of speculation as to whether the new devices will be popular or not The products enter a field with many entries from startups like Pebble and major existing players such as Samsung OTCSSNLF <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL has created a toolkit for its Android operating system The investor wants to know several things The first is impossible to say There are many estimates being floated in the media from a total flop to anywhere between and million units for this year The Wall Street Journal Digits reported that Apple was building between and million watches just for the launch But to get to revenues one also needs to know the distribution of the various Apple Watch models since the prices vary enormously In my analysis I present several possible distributions models calculated in terms of million units The reader can then easily evaluate both revenue and profits for each level of sales Profit margins are all important as they determine the bottom line The margins on the gold Edition collection models are of particular interest as they are expected to be very high some say as much as We will evaluate this in a follow up article Apple Watch comes in three collections The lowest priced anodized aluminum Sport the stainless steel Apple Watch and the k gold or rose gold Edition collection Prices are summarized below I have taken these prices and applied various scenarios or projections in which each scenario is presented as a percentage split between the Apple Watch collections Apple WatchSportEdition Collections are split into the mm and mm sizes Additionally estimated average selling price for each of these is estimated and these ASPs may change in different projections All the projection tables are presented on my blog Here I summarize only One example table is given here for what I consider a reasonably conservative projection Apple Watch Sport and Edition For each watch category collectionsize there is an estimated percentage of total units sold These are consolidated for the collection color coded Base price and estimated ASP is then given A projection is made of the value for sales of that collectionsize for a total watch sales of one million units That is Percent X ASP X million as can be seen here When these figures are totaled we have the Total expected revenue per one million unit sales From this is computed the Percent of total value for each line blue divided by light yellow and these are summed for the two sizes of each collection for Edition collection in this scenario Also from this Total the collective ASP for the entire Apple Watch line in the yellow box can be computed Finally from the ASP we can easily computer the estimated revenue for any given number of units sold Just pick a model scenario that appeals to you and your estimate of total sales and here is total revenue Of note here is the way the revenue grows rapidly with the increase of Edition sales as a percentage of total sales This is of course what is to be expected but when looking at real values it is still a bit startling The chart below shows the relationship The final number in the Xaxis label is the number of Edition watches sold as a percentage of the total number of units eg for the Pessimistic model Personally I tend to the conservative model but in the long run For the launch I can see Apple planners thinking that they would rather run out of Sport models than Edition models and scheduling production for the latter As for numbers I think that million figure for the rest of the calendar year would be extremely successful and quite likely Comparing the Conservative and Moderate models the difference is only but the revenue difference is In the next post on the topic we will discuss the Profit Margin aspect of the different collections and how the sales of Edition watches will affect this figure even more Source Apple Watch Revenue Projections Disclosure The author is long AAPL MoreThe author wrote this article
