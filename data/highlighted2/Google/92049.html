Ways Facebook Could Expand Its Dominance Facebook NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha To take on a titan in the online video industry Facebook needs better organization To grow its Payments Other division Facebook first needs to copy its rivals You would think that a site with almost billion monthly users wouldnt have to worry about expanding further However Facebook NASDAQ FB cant just assume that users will continue to use the site because of sheer size The company must continually look for ways to expand its business and make it more useful There are two particular ways Facebook can improve its experience and generate better profits for investors at the same time The first way that Facebook can expand its dominance is by taking on a rival in the video space The company believes that as social media has matured connections have moved from text to picture and increasingly to video Facebook pointed out several times in its last earnings and conference call that video usage was increasing significantly both on the desktop and mobile versions of its site This trajectory of video growth puts Facebook on a collision course with one of the titans in online video Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL YouTube site Representatives for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>have stated in the past that YouTube has been growing revenue by annually Based on its huge growth Merrill Lynch has suggested that YouTubes value could be as much as to billion YouTubes user base is estimated at about billion users and few companies can match that type of scale That being said Facebooks mobile monthly active users alone trumps YouTubes scale Facebook is the web site where everyday people go to share their experiences Increasingly the way users are sharing is by posting videos This same type of video growth is being seen at Twitter NYSE TWTR The companys native video player Vine and recent hit Periscope are the three pronged attack Twitter hopes will increase its user growth Twitters decision to begin autoplaying videos in tests increased promoted video viewership by X and users recalled the content more readily The key difference between Facebook Twitter and YouTube is organization Facebook centers around the users newsfeed and Twitter will center on its new Project Lightning YouTube is designed to let users browse videos based on topic they can follow particular content creators and search for what they want With a few tweaks Facebooks video library would be far more searchable Before posting a video asking the user to choose a category by topic share to only their timeline or with the public and a brief description would likely do the trick Facebook already allows native videos on the site and sees about billion searches a day Organizing this massive video library could allow Facebook to compete directly with YouTube If Facebooks market cap is roughly billion without a direct YouTube competitor what would this number climb to given a projected value of YouTube at billion The second way Facebook could expand its social media dominance is by putting more focus on its platform as a retail destination The company only generated of its total revenue from its Payments and Other Fees business last quarter While Facebook has stated it expects this division to report declining revenues this year and next <span style='background-color:

</span>Express which offers sameday or overnight shipping from local retailers The company also has reportedly been looking at a Buy button as part of search results Twitter on the other hand has tested the Buy button as part of a small number of its advertisements already Facebook has the opportunity to combine this buying option as part of its advertisements In addition the company has already tested a buy button with a limited number of small businesses However the site has another huge opportunity to improve its Payments divisions results Reportedly there are thousands of Facebook pages dedicated to buying and selling items Facebook needs to reach out to these groups and offer a package where the addition of a shipping option and the use of Facebooks money transfer service would allow them to advertise their goods to an expanded audience for a small percentage of the final sale Given that eBay regularly charges a fee for a sold item a small singledigit percentage might entice some of these groups to expand their presence Even if only a portion of these groups took advantage of these options Facebooks Payments division revenue would grow As we can see Facebook may have almost billion monthly active users but there is more the company can do to expand and grow further The point is if you are an investor who thinks that Facebook is getting too big to be an exciting investment think again Source Ways Facebook Could Expand Its Dominance Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours
