In effect Intel may bury its mobile losses within its new Client Computing division Smart analysts should not be fooled by this sleight of hand For its latest quarter Intel NYSE INTC classified its businesses according to Client Computing Data Center Internet of Things Software and Services and Other groups The Client Computing Group then included chip sales to power desktop twoinone tablet and smartphone machines In effect Intel has simply folded its old Mobile and Communications Group into the PC Client unit Smart analysts however will not be fooled by this accounting sleight of hand Mobile after several years of false starts is still an albatross on Intels bottom line Intel is a vertically integrated semiconductor company that designs manufactures and markets its own chips The integrated Intel strategy stands in stark contrast to the more so specialized wings of the highly complex semiconductor industry Beyond Intel major chip players would include Apple NASDAQ AAPL Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM ARM Holdings NASDAQ ARMH Samsung OTCSSNLF and Taiwan Semiconductor NYSE TSM Taken together these companies form the backbone of the iOS and Android ecosystems where the chip sets are designed around ARM architecture before being massproduced in Asian factories on the cheap Intels vertically integrated business model of course has been highly capital intensive especially in terms of research and development costs For Intel reported billion in RD spending or of billion in total revenue On the statement of cash flows Intel accounted for billion in depreciation charges after having directed billion in cash toward buying up property plant and equipment The massive scale of the Intel operation dwarfs that of archrival ARM which does not own any foundries but instead collects royalties on intellectual property ARM at a relatively diminutive billion in market capitalization may still boast that its technologies have been installed within more than of US smartphones in circulation The nimble ARM has proven itself to be better equipped to serve a mobile market where cooler temperatures and battery power are more so at a premium rather than raw processing power According to Economics Intel must sell premium product at significant volume in order to leverage its staggering fix costs to turn real profits For several years running Intel has supplied highend computers and servers with the most powerful chips on the market Last year the PC Client billion and Data Center billion groups combined to drive billion or of company revenue Further analysis would reveal that Intel gets a huge chunk of its business from three customers in Hewlett Packard NYSE HPQ Dell and Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY At the same time Mobile and Communications posted million in net revenue which was literally a rounding era at Intel Intel does appear somewhat desperate to barge its way into the mobile with the PC market being very much mature if not locked into irreversible decline Last April research firm Garter released ugly estimates that the PC market contracted by through Q The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Android and Apple iOS ecosystems again still dominate the mobile market According to comScore Android and Apple platforms combined to take of the US smartphone subscriber base through the first calendar quarter of Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY actually lost basis points in share through this time frame The mobile chip market beneath this structure also branches off into two separate wings with ARM as the central focal point Apple ASeries chips power iOS devices obviously while Qualcomm Snapdragon chips drive premium Android BlackBerry and even Windows mobile machines ASeries and Snapdragon chips are both designed around ARM architecture before being massproduced at Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor foundries Intel again has remained largely shut out of mobile after several false starts At this point Intel rhetoric comes off as a broken record as the company has literally repackaged its failing mobile chip line beneath different code words in Bay Trail Cherry Trail and SoFIA Last March Intel unveiled its Atom x x and x chips at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona For years Intel has hitched its wagon to the apparent expansion of the twoinone market To gain traction Intel may even sell select chips as loss leaders after doling out liberal rebates to original equipment manufacturers Intel now lists out only five separate smartphones powered by its mobile chip technology These five handsets do include the ASUS ZenFone Etisalat E Lenovo K Motorola RAZR I and Safaricom Yolo which are each available throughout the developing world For now Intel has been left to rely upon the Microsoft Surface for any hope of breaking into the mobile market Microsoft pitches the Surface as the tablet that can replace your laptop The Surface however has lagged significantly far behind the Galaxy iPad and MacBook after this awkward attempt to be all things to all people Intel again reported million in total net sales out of its Mobile and Communications Group This unit has been steadily deteriorating as it generated billion in revenue as recently as By however Intel Mobile and Communications had racked up a staggering billion in losses Alternatively the PC Client Group posted billion in operating profits off billion in total net sales through Going forward these old figures may help in comparisons with Intel working to stuff Mobile and Communications losses within the dominant PC Client Group Intel did close out its latest quarter with billion in total revenue on the books Of this amount the newly minted Client Computing Group brought forth billion in Q total net sales to the table Last year this Client Computing Group accounted for billion in quarterly revenue or billion and million in total net sales between the old PC Client and Mobile segments respectively A triangulation of the recent data may confirm that Intel is struggling to close sales in mobile while also staring down a rapidly contracting PC market In all Intel yearoveryear comparisons for revenue and net income have been all but flat with servers remaining the lone source of growth Last quarter Intel reported billion in revenue and billion in net income Intel improved its top and bottom lines by a mere million and million respectively between Q and Q On June Intel shares closed out the trading session at At these levels Intel shares last traded hands at more than times trailing earnings This is too steep of a price to pay for weak mobile chip sales and flatlining net income out of Intel Source Intel Still Shut Out Of Mobile Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses
