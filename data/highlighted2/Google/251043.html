regarding iPhone specs are now catching up to it Together with overall smartphone weakness due to a good enough effect these risks allow for a significant prediction The prediction is that by Q FY at the latest Apple will probably be seeing yearonyear shrinkage for the iPhone s Ive often written about how Apple NASDAQ AAPL is taking some risks with the iPhone which are in a way new They are new because with Steve Jobs and up to the iPhone s Apple tried to keep ahead of the spec race deploying the most advanced solutions available at the time including such things as the display resolution camera resolution and quality and even the RAM size and storage size That all ended with the iPhone s Since then Apple has let iPhone specifications lag those of most Android flagships While rational tradeoffs can somewhat explain such lag the lag is nonetheless real Ive talked about these risks in such articles as Apple Android Photography Is About To Take A Huge Quality Jump and The Android Blunders That Helped Apple Some time has passed since then so now might be a good time to revisit how things are evolving regarding this thesis and whether some of these risks are materializing In the meantime Apple has launched the iPhone s and while some of the risks were addressed many remain It can be argued that due to Apples leadership in SoC design as well as the strength of its brand and ecosystem the Apple iPhone is and remains the smartphone to beat Yet something is slowly changing As I said Ive already written on how Android smartphones were going to get a whole lot better in the camera department in general Up until the iPhone Apple was the undisputed leader when it came to cameras The iPhone had a resolution of just Megapixels but it made up for it in image quality and ease of use Android phones tried as they might with their higher pixel counts came up short This iPhone advantage was wellknown in the market and a subject of many articles claiming it as a powerful reason to get an iPhone such as this one from TheVerge titled To beat the iPhone you have to beat the iPhones camera By then however there was already an inkling of change Competitors were drawing near and Samsung OTCSSNLF with the Note in particular seemed for an instant to have matched or surpassed the iPhone with a smartphone of the same generation Yet if you were going to choose based on cameras you could get the iPhone or a single Android smartphone out of the dozens or hundreds of different Android models There just being an exception would not stop the iPhone juggernaut when it came to the camera Hence the relevance of what I described in my article that soon many Android handsets would get much better cameras even down to the midrange of the market Such thing happening would obviously eliminate the camera advantage when the camera came to be the deciding factor Well for the most part that day arrived The iPhone lost its top camera spot This happened both because Android smartphones evolved rapidly as predicted and ironically because Apple in trying to up the pixel count while remaining stingy with its costs managed not to improve the iPhone s camera at all while moving from Megapixels to Megapixels There is an abundance of reviews which will argue that the iPhone is still on top or was just matched at the top However the most objective and renowned photographymobile photography website seems to have confirmed what others had already been saying subjectively I am talking about DxOMark Previously any beating of Apple was sporadic and quickly erased However now Apple is left behind even though the next generation of several of the Android devices which surpassed it will be out before the next iPhone model Also very relevantly the iPhone was not just matched or surpassed by competing flagships It was also surpassed by smartphones which will cater to the midrange such as the Nexus X same camera as the Nexus P listed in the table or the Motorola X Style Pure Edition which while being a flagship comes at a midrange price This trend of course is likely to soon expand even to Chinese midrange smartphones now costing around How did this ultimately happen to Apple I think there were two factors at work beyond Android cameras simply getting better These were Apple cheapening out on the component specs again Apple went from an Megapixel sensor to a Megapixel sensor probably because the low pixel count was beginning to constitute a marketing problem Apple needed a spec bump to convince customers to upgrade and the low pixel count was also beginning to show its age in some reviews due to less detail captured by the iPhone But while Apple bumped up the Megapixel count it didnt change the sensor size Result it stuck with a sensor in a mobile world which had moved to Samsung S Nexus PX putting itself at a disadvantage in light collection right there Then to make things worse Apple has a lens cover made of Sapphire This has a purpose in avoiding scratches to the lens However with Sapphires lower light conductivity this is probably also the reason why other Android brands now have lenses with ff apertures whereas Apple is still stuck at f Again this compounds the lightcollection problem To sum things up the camera risk which was identified has slowly materialized Today getting one of the best camera smartphones no longer requires buying an Apple iPhone Indeed its starting to even be possible to choose a midlevel Android phone and get a competitive highquality camera with it One of the other risks Ive mentioned is how Apple had been shipping unnecessarily lowresolution displays with its topend phones including the iPhone s At this point the Apple iPhone s has a display resolution of x pixels This is nearly the same as p x pixels p at this point in time is only found in the lowest rung of Android phones This means budget phones costing little more than unlocked The reasoning is that the user might not see the difference anyway though even Apple uses an higher resolution p x pixels for its larger iPhone s Plus This reasoning may at times make sense in power consumption and speed but one also needs to remember that even if the user cannot really see the difference this is still a highend product and as such it becomes strange when it fields such obvious lowend specs The problem however becomes even more evident when the difference can actually be seen This might happen because of the phone having a nonstandard display resolution The iPhones resolution is slightly different from p so p content needs to be adapted either by not using all the display or by scaling to a nonnative resolution which will destroy some of the detail and contrast But thats just a might Theres also a definite to talk about I am talking about VR Virtual Reality The virtual reality boom is slowly taking place and awareness should explode during early when Facebook launches the Oculus Rift Mobile phones can also provide a good VR introduction since they have all the requisites including the movement sensors high resolution displays and powerful mobile GPUs Now when using a mobile phone as a VR display you use a headset where the mobile phone is inserted This headset includes lenses for one to be able to comfortably focus on the display at such close range These lenses expand the display to fill your visual field and thus immerse you in its artificial reality When the lenses magnify the display it becomes a lot easier to see the pixels creating a kind of grid effect This grid is much more visible the lower the display resolution is By now you see where I am going The following image exemplifies the problem Click on that image to see it in full size The left side of the image shows a VR headset running at p while the right side shows a headset running at p As you can see the effect is much worse on the display as is to be expected The same thing happens with VR using smartphones So even if you couldnt see the difference with your naked eyes now you can see it when the VR headsets hit the market en masse One such headset is the recentlylaunched Samsung Gear VR retailing for just So this particular headset isnt even compatible with the iPhone and it showcases Samsungs superiority at a very cheap price To have it youll need a recent Samsung smartphone Maybe its also symptomatic why Apple doesnt have the equivalent product because it would expose the iPhones weakness In this or any other more generic VR implementation like the very basic <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Cardboard one thing will become painfully evident during the VR boom that iPhones are awfully inadequate So here again Apple is running an unnecessary risk And one which will be most evident for the younger generation the generation defining what cool is Do you reckon it will be cool to experiment the latest revolution using an inferior device by design I dont think so On top of the risks Apple is taking with its iPhone breadwinner theres a general effect taking place which hits both Android handsets and the iPhone alike Its just that like PCs these smartphones are increasingly getting good enough If you hold a flagship smartphone from two years ago be it an LG G Nexus iPhone s or any other phone built to similar specs youll notice that it can do the same things as todays flagships and the speed difference isnt deal breaking These phones actually remain competitive with todays midend phones and todays midend phones are entirely usable and will remain usable for years Except for battery degradation which will be cheap to solve and some general care with software these phones should thus start eliciting longer substitution cycles This should drive a stagnated or slowgrowing market both for Android and the iPhone The Result Possible QQ yearonyear Drop In iPhone Shipments Where do all these risks lead to They lead to the chance that all smartphone flagships start having trouble showing yearonyear growth rates The iPhone is particularly vulnerable because it finally sated the demand for a largerdisplay iPhone with the iPhone It might thus not be surprising that by QQ FY Apple will have difficulty in seeing yearonyear growth in revenues and profits Present consensus already only allows for weak and yearonyear growth in revenues for Q and Q as we can see Source Yahoo Finance red highlight is mine But it can easily be worse For instance there are reports of iPhone s sales dropping up to yearonyear in Japan and declining meaningfully as per Pacific Crest Q FY might be the first quarter to show this and if not then Q FY will certainly be it While AAPL is already priced for some demand weakness it should be evident its not priced for stagnation or shrinkage of iPhone sales The consensus estimates say as much AAPL will not have rising yearonyear EPS if the iPhone posts negative yearonyear sales As always Apple is the iPhone Apples stock will mirror the iPhones performance The iPhone represented rds of Apples FY revenues and due to its higher gross margins it likely represented of Apples operating and net profits With such a large relevance for Apples financials anything that happens to the iPhone will be determinant to what happens to the stock Talk about Apple Pay the iPad Pro the Apple Watch and anything in between is basically irrelevant for the stock right now When it comes to the stock the iPhone is all that matters The risks about which Ive talked in the past are materializing rendering Apples iPhone unique competitive position weaker and weaker By now the iPhone has been matched or surpassed by several Android handsets in the camera department At the same time the iPhone risks being uncool when the VR boom hits in full since its lowly display resolution will show the handset to be inferior for that purpose These risks are also compounded by the fact that increasingly smartphones have less and less to offer in terms of added capability justifying upgrades Their life cycle will be extended by this effect slowing down replacements and overall demand For Apple stock this is tremendously important The iPhone is so dominant in Apples financials that any failure to show continued growth is sure to have an outsized impact on them Given the risks both specific and general to the smartphone market along with Apples pent up demand which inflated FY iPhone sales its now likely that by Q FY at the latest Apple will be showing yearonyear declines in iPhone shipments This is not yet in the share price so AAPL is likely to underperform until JulyAugust By then of course the focus will change to the upcoming iPhone We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information
