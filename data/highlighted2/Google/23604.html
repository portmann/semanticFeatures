Reasons Why Yahoos Turnaround Could Be Succeeding Yahoo Inc NASDAQYHOO Seeking Alpha Yahoos display revenue has been on a downward spiral for years leading some people to discount the companys turnaround efforts The segment however is likely to start growing again in the current year and maintain the momentum going forward I recently came across an article on Business Insider which painted a rather gloomy picture of Yahoo Incs NASDAQ YHOO turnaround efforts by stating that the companys recovery is so weak that Twitter NYSE TWTR was on course to leapfrog it and become the thirdlargest display ad company in the US in While the authors line of argument was quite valid I beg to disagree with her conclusion because she only presented part of the companys business segments and failed to look at the bigger picture When current Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer took over at the helm about months ago one of the key pledges she made to investors was to reverse the fortunes of the pioneering Internet company by returning it into positive top line growth in her first two or three years on the job and eventually achieve doubledigit growth five years down the line While it might be too early to judge whether the CEO has delivered on her promises considering its barely two years since she joined the company its certainly worth exploring whether she can achieve her targets Its an open secret that Mrs Mayer has lately found herself besieged by a clique of powerful disgruntled investors Nicholas Carlson in his book Marissa Mayer and the fight to Save Yahoo points to the CEOs missteps and how a groups of activist investors have been pressing her hard to alter her strategy in particular to liquidate Yahoos billion stake in Alibaba NYSE BABA and pass the proceeds to shareholders while avoiding spending the money on large acquisitions Yahoo has acquired more than companies during Marissas short tenure Everyday investors are of course not always privy to the inside operations of the companies they invest in or the ongoing political machinations After all what really matter to them is that they get a good return on their investment at the end of the day The only real test of Marissas strategies is whether she succeeds in returning Yahoo to consistent growth Yahoo reported its fourth quarter and fullyear fiscal results in January The company reported revenue of billion or yearonyear growth of The growth certainly does not look like anything to write home about but was nevertheless a notable improvement compared to the previous year when the company posted top line growth The bright spot on the report was the companys GAAP EPS which grew from during the previous year to in fiscal a huge jump If Yahoo is able to start recording positive revenue growth consistently by the second half of the current fiscal year then Marissa will have delivered on her first pledge to return the company to growth in the space of years My bet is that it will Lets delve deeper into how Yahoos key segments performed in and why Im convinced that the company is on the right track Yahoos display revenue accounts for of its overall revenue Revenue from the segment has been falling over the past few years Yahoos display revenue fell to billion while in it fell to billion Its important to note that the companys display revenue has not been falling due to a decrease in the volume of ads served up but rather due to a huge decline in the average priceperad For instance Yahoos ad volume increased in but was accompanied by a decrease in the average priceperad leading to a decline in revenue by the segment In the company recorded a healthy growth in volume of ads sold but unfortunately this was once again accompanied by a huge decline in the average priceperad leading to yet another revenue decline Its quite likely that this segments revenue is not falling due to poor execution by the company but rather due to intense competitive pressure in the space leading to lower rates by marketers I would have wanted to compare Twitters averagepriceper ad to Yahoos to see if my theory holds up but unfortunately Twitter only reports ad revenue per timelines and not the average priceperad so this would be an applestooranges comparison The good news however is that Yahoo might finally be able to reverse this trend and start recording positive growth in the current year eMarketer estimates that Yahoo will record growth in its display revenue during the current year and growth in the two subsequent years The even greater piece of news for Yahoo is that its mobile revenue growth is projected to accelerate Yahoos share of US mobile advertising search display and messagingbased ads is estimated to be in the current year and in This means that Yahoo will leapfrog Twitter as the thirdlargest mobile ad player in the country since Twitter is expected to have a share in the current year and in Yahoos huge investments in the mobile space has started paying off The company acquired Flurry mobile app network in and has an inhouse initiative Gemini which is a native advertising platform This is highly significant for the company because mobile advertising is projected to surpass desktop advertising during the current year and to continue outpacing it going forward Yahoo started reporting its mobile revenues in the third quarter of when it recorded revenue of million The figure then grew to million during the fourth quarter a healthy QoQ growth The company finished the year with mobile revenues of million This is impressive growth eMarketer estimates that the US mobile ad market will grow from billion in to billion in The company is placing a special emphasis on the segment when Marissa joined Yahoo the companys mobile division had only workers or less than of its workforce but now it has workers If Yahoo can maintain its mobile ad market share projected for all the way to then the companys mobile ad revenue will reach billion by a robust CAGR and more than enough to offset the companys weakness in display revenue Yahoos search segment is one of its key pillars accounting for of its revenue The company managed to turnaround this segment and recorded positive growth last year In the companys search revenue fell to billion In revenue for the segment grew to billion I expect Yahoos search segment to continue recording faster growth Yahoo inked a year agreement with Firefox last year to become its default search engine in the US instead of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL The deal paid off almost immediately and Yahoo was able to reverse its year market share loss Yahoos search engine market share improved from before the Firefox deal to three months after the deal Meanwhile Googles share fell by a similar margin Amazingly Yahoos share has continued increasing several months after the deal despite Googles efforts to lure back its customers This can be chalked up to the companys sustained efforts to promote the New Firefox Yahoos search engine market share clocked in at around seven years ago There is a good chance that it will hit over the next two years which should provide a nice boost to the companys search revenue If the companys search engine market share is able to hit the mark in the next one year this could translate to a growth in the companys search revenue Yahoo reports its mobile video social and native revenue under its Transformative Investments segment This is the segment where the company reports most of the revenue from its acquisitions as well as its homegrown initiatives Yahoos Transformative Investments grew a blistering to billion in meaning the video social and native revenues excluding mobile were million This is a new revenue segment for the company This growth is being powered by some of Yahoos smart acquisitions such as Tumblr Source Piper Jaffray Teen Survey Tumblrs userbase has increased since Marissa took over as Yahoo CEO to million monthly active users exceeding Twitters million users Tumblr is projected to bring in revenue of million for the company in the current year Yahoo has been wooing top YouTube users to make Tumblr its distribution channel of choice With such a large userbase the company might succeed in getting topquality content and increase traffic even more The outlook for virtually all of Yahoos revenue segment is good Display advertising is the only segment that has been consistently losing money but is expected to start growing in the current year Yahoos mobile segment and transformative investments especially look promising and will give a good boost to the companys top line growth This is a company to watch It might be popular right now to bash Yahoo but
