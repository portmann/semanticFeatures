class='textDiv'>Facebook Becomes The Business Partner Of SMBs With Pages Updates Facebook NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Facebook is out with meaningful updates to Pages I believe these updates do more than just make the SMB experience better I believe theses updates will make the user experience better as well Facebook is smart to cater to SMBs as the TAM is much larger than that of enterprise and frankly it just makes more sense Facebook should be able to drive positive outcomes for SMBs by becoming their primary hosting platform for web services this is a good thing for the financials Look for Facebook to leverage this momentum into greater Instagram ad capture as well as passthrough revenues for other ancillary services Facebook NASDAQ FB wants to be the smallmedium business SMB owners onestop shop you dont need a Wix NASDAQ WIX or a Wordpress page location for all his or her customer engagement and online presence needs And why not The SMB space is much much larger than the enterprise space in aggregate is generally more sticky doesnt run as high a risk of commoditization of services and fits much more in line with Facebooks intimacy based core user valueprop Ive argued in the past that unlike Twitter NYSE TWTR which has a newsy discoverybased value prop to users that Facebooks value prop and UX is based on intimacy and familiarity Its my opinion that users view their Facebook pages as threads in the fabric of their life whereas Twitter users view their accounts as the new newspaper For me Facebook targeting the SMB with Pages and the seemingly constant evolution of Pages to better fit SMBs is a marriage thats made to last But maybe the biggest reason that Facebook wants to be the SMB business partner is that the SMB owner is typically not a business owner at all typically these are product people or idea people What do I mean by this I mean usually the flower shop owner knows flowers not how to run the most efficient business especially when that comes to online For instance the local florist isnt going to school anybody on webpage design or backend payment system integration to a webpage The local florist isnt going to lay out the case for the next great growthhacking method or even how to construct high conversion blog posts But with the help of Facebook this isnt a concern The SMB owner can simply set up a Facebook page for his or her SMB a process he or she is already familiar with because the UI and enrollment process is the exact same as that on the personal page side and voila instant online presence on the largest social network in the history of the planet One that now refers more traffic to news sites an example of its traffic flow influence than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL So Facebook is smart to target the SMBs Facebook is also smart to constantly make things easier for the SMBs and to proactively try to drive more and more positive outcomes for the SMBs Recently Facebook took this effort one step further with apparent updates to Pages It appears now that Pages has a different customerfacing look Pages has much more optionality from a customization and customerfacing standpoint and Pages has new functionality for SMBs The last bullet is really really important for Facebook equity investors to pay attention to as its something that I think will drive key metrics on an immediate basis and also help convert Pages owners to Instagram ownersad buyers Lets break out the above paragraph by bullet point First for those that dont operate a Pages account or who arent in the business of helping others do this Pages has some serious new additions as it pertains to being customerfacing Now each Page not only has the classic Timeline setup for incoming public posts but it also has a silo display which separates out Home Services Photos and Shop silos Dont think that matters It does A simple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>search will show that users typically only give a new idea read a new Page a mere seconds before abandoningexiting If the user has to struggle to find what they want prior to the silobased aesthetics of Pages this was a cluttered messdriven problem for most Page owners they bail Bailing isnt good for the SMBs business and it isnt good for Facebook being associated with driving positive outcomes positive outcomes that by association would likely and have shown to likely drive advertising revenue opportunity Facebook decluttering the Page for the Page owner is huge Thats a great start Pages now also has more optionality for how a Page owner can communicate with prospective customers Specifically from a topoffunnel standpoint Pages now offers several new calltoaction CTA options that include options like Call Now which is the most exciting of the options in my opinion Facebook still offers previously available CTAs like Contact Us Use App etc Ive opined in the past that I think eventually Facebook charges for recurring engagement conversion for SMBsenterprises This would include items like App downloads it sort of already does charge for this in its ability to charge a premium for advertising services based on its effectiveness for driving positive outcomes newsletter enrollments and other offplatform conversions The point to be made here for this bullet point is that Facebook just became that much more of a onestop shop with its now oneclick ability to create a call converter out of your Page Easy enough to understand but you better bet that matters in the scheme of things Finally and maybe most importantly Pages now has a new functionality The addition of Shop and Services silos as a focus of the UI is huge Huge like I cant even really do it justice in explanation huge Think of these silos now being made a focus as the webpagification not a word but expressive to the point of using of the Page This is what Im referring to when I point out that Facebook is now giving mobilefirst SMBs the ability to avoid WixWordpressSquarespace Now that I have a full web pagedesktoplike experience via Pages what do I need a full web pagedesktop experience driver for I dont is the answer and thats a great thing for Facebook In fact if I want to focus on a particular product launch I can even use Instagram to launch a fullscale highdefinition advertising campaign which will also be linked back and inserted directly into my Page Timeline as well as my Shop feed How conveniently convenient Are you starting to see why Facebooks Pages focus is meaningful to the overall bull thesis If Facebooks wide reach yet capacity to stay local in feel wasnt enough a reason for an SMB to initiate a Pages setup these new additions should make the case even stronger I just dont see any reason for any business in any vertical to not participate I think the growth of Pages in volume as well as the ancillary revenue expansion from ad campaign participation and overall engagement data that Facebook can use to perpetuate the cycle of both is a huge tailwind for Facebook equity that should have staying power I actually think like all things Facebook this tailwind grows in time As Facebook Im speculating here continues to make Pages more attractive for SMBs I anticipate an eventual secondary career vertical being built on top of the platform similar to how there are entire firms now deriving revenue streams exclusively off WixWordpressSquarespace expertise When that happens look out above from a growth standpoint But with that being speculation and impossible to determine from a duration standpoint just focus for now on whats already in place Facebook is continuing to evidence itself as the premium home for SMB online presence and thats going to
