ever heard of Amazon gold box Well if you havent then make sure to check it out here Basically Amazon gold box is their daily deal offerings across all of their categories These are daily deals lightening deals and just plain savings It even includes their coupons which you can instantly clip Amazon tends to highlight two specials for their daily deals section at the top of the gold box They will then highlight a number of lightening deals which go away after the time has expired or the quantity is gone Now since Im a fan of Amazon and a dedicated Amazon shopper I check the gold box deals often Why You never know what you might find They put a wide assortment on sale so I check it often At the end of the post I will show you how to get the daily deal emails delivered to you without going to Amazon free of charge Before we get to that point I wanted to provide you with a little information on how Amazon does pricing for its daily deals and gold box deals They indicate massive savings but that is really not true You are saving money but the percentage off is misleading Amazon is the biggest retailer around They are the lb gorilla overtaking Walmart They know how to get people to buy Remember all of the media attention to Prime Day Well I shopped that day and the deals were not great Yes I did score a Fire TV Stick for and a watch for my wife but those were all luck Most of the deals were junk Yet people were there shopping and browsing and they had their biggest sales day Cant complain with that When Amazon puts something into their gold box they want to make sure to attract buyers In order to do this they fudge the savings amount a tad Below is an example of how they show pricing for daily deals You can click the picture to check out their gold box deals This looks like a normal listing on Amazon It has the product image the title reviews description and the pricing They also add in when the deal ends and how much you are saving on the deal In this example the savings on the Dremel Volt Max tool looks promising I do have a Dremel tool and love it so I didnt need this product but the pricing intrigued me Amazon lists the price as which is extremely high for a Dremel tool with just some attachments that I can pick up from Lowes or Home Depot I decided to investigate and its what I do when searching all of the deals in Amazon s gold box I was lucky when writing this post because the Dremel daily deal sold out and went back to regular price or what Amazon really charges They only show you the when you want to buy it and its in the gold box This shows a higher percentage off What you really need to know is how much are people buying it for when its not in the gold box deal section For that we can go two different routes Weird name but good service I uncovered this service when writing my popular post about unknownways to save money at Amazon This free website allows you to easily track the pricing of a product on Amazon This is just an Amazon service All you have to do is enter the product URL or ASIN in the search box on CamelCamelCamelcom The service will do the rest If you want to know how to find the ASIN then just look in the URL when youre on the Amazon product page Its a strange sequence of letters and numbers but it looks like below Once you enter the information CamelCamelCamel will give you a wealth of knowledge regarding the price It will give you a graph tracking it over the last price changes It then puts it into a nice little table for you to help you discern the pricing changes It looks like this for our example You can see that today was the lowest price of the tracking period and the average was In this instance you are saving on the average price Thats not a bad deal but its not the they are showing you on the gold box deals page Another great way to look at pricing is to just use the old Googles You can easily put in the product and see what comes up Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has a product called <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Shopping they have a ton of data from a wide number of retailers This allows you to leverage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>to find the information you need Here is what came up when I was searching for the Dremel daily deal You can see from these results that the lowest price is but it might not include shipping If we just went off that price then you would only be saving at the low end Still not a bad deal especially if that low price doesnt include shipping When you search <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>make sure you either use the Amazon product title or the part number listed in the product information section This way it gives you a good comparison So is a Gold Box Deal Really a Deal The answer to this question is simply yes and no While you are saving money when purchasing an item in the gold box deals section you arent realizing the savings Amazon says you are For the Dremel tool example I was able to get the regular price they charge when its not on daily deal Yes it fluctuates based on the findings from CamelCamelCamel but its never been nor does anyone sell it at that price So the savings they say you get really only boils down to much smaller savings In this case the regular price is with free shipping as shown below The Amazon Gold Box Deal said so really you are saving not Thats a pretty substantial change if you ask me This boils down to a much smaller savings than the advertised savings I put this post together to show you how to research and make sure youre getting a good deal when searching the Amazon gold box deals If you want to get their daily deals in your email every morning then all you need to do is head to this link and sign up for their emails Its free and they only send one a day with the two daily deals they have for each day This way you can see
