see aVERYserious collapse in the next few months Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Submitted by Charles HughSmith of OfTwoMinds blog The reason I dont want an Apple Watch has nothing to do with its look functionality price or battery lifeThe reason I have no interest in an Apple Watch or any of its competitors isI cant afford to be connected to a device that destroys my productivity with an endless stream of chirps beeps buzzes or vibrations every time an email tweet text etc arrives A number of readers sent me this article on the luxury status of quietude The Cost of Paying Attention Silence is now offered as a luxury good Being chained to the network is now the default Everyone on the bus is either talking on a mobile phone or staring at a mobile device Whatever status there once was in being connected has completely evaporated As I have noted here before the highest possible status now is reserved for thosewho cannot waste their valuable time being accessible to everyone with a network connection Thinking clearly and productively is impossible when a train of thought is constantly interrupted by incoming messages and notifications Being constantly interrupted and distracted is fine if your work is routine and doesnt require any concentrated thought or creativity and this is why the heavilyhyped myth thatbeing connected boosts your productivityis so risible the Apple Watch certainly notifies you of your meeting in Cupertino in an hour but since youve been connected to the network every waking hour of every dayyouve had no mental space to come up with any ideas worthy of a meeting in Cupertino Its ironic isnt it All these networked devices are supposed to boost your productivity by flooding you with mostly uselesstrivial messages and notifications when the reality is being connected is a sure way to destroy productivity Yes salespeople have to be connected to respond to customers but outside of sales and oncall workers being connected offers diminishing returns that are directly correlated to the concentration required to get the work done The need to concentrate is just as high in skilled manual trades as it is for creativecontent work Getting a message or notification of any kind feeds our desire to appear worthy and important but the ubiquity of messages and notifications now matches the ubiquity of adverts The status value of being connected is now zeroThe status value is in being unconnected If Apple offers a watch that can only display time and date I am interestedat or lessI like the look of the Apple Watch and as an accessory that displays time and date it is functional to me because I leave phones and other devices off to avoid being distracted A watch that cannot interrupt or distract me is the only watch with any productive value Thu Hitlery__Dictator Think about this for a min First it was brick cell phones then smaller flip phones then smart phones smart glasses now smaller smart watches next smart implantsthats where its headed folks And of course the mentally enslved mellinial morons will be the first to line up to be even bigger slaves Thu SheepDogOne Thu Hitlery__Dictator Thu pods Thu mlml I think the NSA is getting frustrated with everyone putting their phones in their pockets They cant hear a damn thing when you do that So the watch is perfect it will pick up every word you say Thu InjectTheVenom Thu Bokkenrijder Thu El Vaquero Ive had the same watch for nearly a decade I spent on it but it has lasted In fact I spent that much because I knew that it was designed to last It tells me the time It recharges itself via solar It has alarm function and a stopwatch If I had to I could take it off and beat somebody to death with it I also expect it to last another or years and Im hard on watches Why the fuck does anybody need an Apple Watch that needs a cell phone that has the same functionality but with a bigger screen The shark has been jumped Thu Tall Tom If I remember Seiko marketed one of those some years back They would have dropped in price on the Secondary market by now Sooner or later one will walk through my door Thu Tall Tom Thu Hitlery__Dictator Thu nuubee To be fair theres a difference between owning and carrying a tabletsized smart phone and being unable to ignore said tabletsized smart phone Thu Hitlery__Dictator I refuse to be friends with someone that owns a smart phone call me a hater but I like thinkers Thu nuubee Theres plenty of use a thinker can get from a smart phone Again youre blaming the tool just like antigun people blame the gun rather than the nut who shot someone Thu Hitlery__Dictator Thu nuubee Thu Hitlery__Dictator Thu _SILENCER Apple Watch is just another electrospy slave device that will eventually give you bone cancer Avoid I dont wear watches but if you must make a watch statement go old school go mechanical Enjoy the craftsmanship Thu Anglo Hondo I dont need a watch to tell me the time If its light its daytime If dark its nighttime Easy Thu youngman Thu iofera Just because they are not a Smartphone does not mean that the Camera the Speakers and the Microphonecannot be remotely activated Although it was not as well publicized those features are still therealong with GPS tracking and Cell Phone Tower triangulation Personally the only Cell Phones which I own are destined for destruction to recover and refine the Plaidium and the Gold and then refine it I REFUSE TO PAY ANY CORPORATION TO HELP THE GOVERNMENT TOVIOLATE MY FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS I refuse to own any Cell Phone for outgoing and incoming calls Furthermore I cancelled my landline many years ago Over NSA Tracking Devices aredestroyed and countingAnything that I can do to help the cause It has cost me and I will garner that in returns for the Precious Metals recovered and refinedif not more OPT OUT Your level of complicity is up to you I choose to minimize my complicity It may be a sacrifice but I am willing to make that Thu Hitlery__Dictator Good for you I know how to take the battery out btw Also when you own businesses I have no choice but to use a cell phone gotta do what you can when you are a baller Thu Tall Tom Tearing as many of these apartas I have there is a small Button Battery that is soldiered to the board As the Tantalum Capacitors do not suffer from bleed off as much as Aluminum Capacitors and theystore High Potential for extended lengths Thu TeethVillages Provocative as usual Hey I have some old phones Id like to locate a local to buy the precious metal inside them All I am aware of is a vending machine that does buy backs of modern phones I live in small town type city area We are big enough for or more Wall Marts and or more malls Id guess I should look to some local computer repair tech guys or call the Auto Salvage guys Then maybe some phone stores Probably I will lose huge on even a scrap metal rate Thu MillionDollarBogus_ Reggie Middleton I personally do not see Apples pipeline as comparable to its major competitors Apples anticipated larger screen phones are playing catchup with the Android competition from three years ago and their stock buybacks Beats purchase and apparent dearth in innovative products iWatch inch screens do not make the cut pale in comparison to the pipelines from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Glass selfdriving cars Project Ara Modular Smartphone etc and Samsung flexible phones foldable screens quarterly hardware updates etc Thu teslaberry mdb fuck you for going out of character i put up with your shit for years and now NOW YOU GO OUT OF CHARACTER Thu jimijon The AppleWatch is purely fashion medical and fun And yes you can turn off notifications and the like But as a developer I am loving the new language Swift and the new frameworks too But then again I see under the hood of these technologies and developers love Apple Thu Anglo Hondo Thu indygo I was going to make a comment but hold on huh Oh yeah I was going to make a comment but what Hold on Huh Thu walkre Thu Squid Viscous Maybe you are not a terrorist today but maybe you decide to be one in about years and they will have all your history on file Thu jakesdad or maybe if you become politically inconvenient you will suddenly find despite no intention of causingpromoting violence your postsearchetc history is conviently consistent with the profile of a terrorist the other bigger concern I have is unintentional false positives by law enforcement in run of the mill nonterrorist cases unlimited datasurvellience means every unsolved crime will have at least one Tim Masters Cameron Willingham etc that most strongly correllates combine that with the fact that theres rarely any adverse consequences when there is never proportionate to prosecutors convicting innocent people you have a recipe for a lot of bad outcomes personally Id give at least even the Justin Harris case here in atl is one I wish people understood how accuracy can still lead to far far more false positives than supposed criminals actually caught on that Do NOT follow this link or
