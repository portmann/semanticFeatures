cord cutting options for those looking to get out from under the burden of a monthly cable bill We currently have service through DirecTV and have written about that in the past but bought a Fire Stick recently as we became Amazon Prime members at the end of the year This Amazon Fire Stick review shares our experience using it The Fire Stick is actually the second foray into streaming options by Amazon They first introduced the Amazon Fire TV as a set top box that streams content and comes in at Since we have DirecTV we currently have no need for a set top box but may in the future as we continue to look at challenging expenses Did I mention that the Fire TV Stick is incredibly easy to use Well it is As you can see from the picture below it comes in a small box from Amazon and contains the following items Its not only easy to use its easy to set up Mrs Frugal Rules has had bad experiences in the past setting up wireless routers and other pieces of technology that claim to be easy to set up but then require her to spend an hour or two on the phone with a customer service rep in Malaysia to work correctly The Fire Stick wasnt like that You simply take the Fire Stick out of the box put the batteries in the remote and connect the USB cable to the dongle and then to your TV I actually recommend as does Amazon to plug it in to a surrounding outlet as they provide updates to it that you will not get if you simply plug the stick into the TV One thing to keep in mind is that the cord is a bit on the short side thankfully we had an outlet within reach Once I got the Fire TV Stick out of the box we were watching a video in about five minutes In actuality the time potentially could be less than that but Amazon has a short intro video that walks you through how to us it as well as an option to sign up for Amazon Prime if youre not currently a member As an aside Amazon does offer a free day trial of the Prime service by purchasing the Fire Stick if thats something you want to look at If youre looking for cord cutting options then features are going to be a big thing for you As a whole the Fire Stick does not disappoint when it comes to features The first thing many are concerned with are the channels youll receive Here is a sampling of the channels available through the Fire TV Stick The Amazon Prime app is actually the only app that is loaded on the Fire Stick but adding the others is relatively easy You can also add other apps through the Amazon App store if you like but Ive not tried that out yet Beyond the channels you can watch the Fire TV Stick also has a number of games you can play but many require the Amazon Fire TV game controller to play them Having used the Fire Stick thus far Id say you dont necessarily need to have a Prime membership to buy and use it Yes it does add to the features of course but there are plenty of options available through the standard apps and those available through the Amazon App store Ive not used any of the other similar options out there like the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Chromecast but here is a visual from the Amazon site that covers the differences in what each offers to get a flavor of how the Fire TV Stick stands out I have really liked what Ive seen from the Fire Stick thus far The price alone has made it worth it There are a few other things to really like about the Amazon stick such as Its incredibly simple to use You can get the dongle set up and ready to go in under minutes You cant beat that Fast platform I was curious as to how fast the platform would be and have not been disappointed The platform is super fast and ultra responsive A huge amount of content available Whether or not you have Amazon Prime there is a lot of content available on the Fire TV Stick If you do have Prime then youll be even more impressed with the available content Simple to use remote The remote while on the smallish side is simple and easy to use Its relatively easy to move around the on screen platform through the remote and when you need to type things in its very responsive Great wireless coverage Our router is at the other end of the house on a different floor and was picking it up at full strength New XRay Feature The newly added XRay feature allows you to identify favorite actors or songs in shows and find them in other shows or movies Excellent storage capacity The Fire TV Stick offers GB of internal storage vs GB from the Chromecast Not everything is perfect with the Fire Stick though there are only a few things I dont like such as Limited voice search It is available but you must download a smart phone app to use it One click ordering You may like one click ordering though we prefer not to have it in our house You can disable that through setting the Parental Controls so its not that much of a hassle Weve been using the Amazon Fire TV Stick for roughly a month or two now and are really enjoying it Were not in a place to cancel cable yet as were still under contract but it could be a great go to option for those looking to keep costs down There is a ton of content available through the device and while a good bit of it isnt free like Netflix or Hulu Plus if youre already subscribing to one of those services youll find the Fire TV Stick seamlessly integrates with your TV watching habits If youre an Amazon Prime member then the Fire Stick can really maximize the value you receive from the membership Amazon has a library thousands of titles large and growing daily The other feature I really like is that you can use the dongle on any TV in your house So if you have multiple TVs you can simply pull it from one and plug it in another without a problem as well as a new feature that allows you to take it with you if you travel The Fire TV Stick wont replace all the shows you watch but with the wealth of content they do have it goes a long way towards getting you there while allowing you to cut the cord on cable Now if I can
