department stores Apple wants to present watch as fashion item Fifty line up at one Tokyo store more in Berlin By Yasmeen Abutaleb and Teppei Kasai NEW YORKTOKYO April Reuters A small group of Japanese techaddicts lined up in Tokyo to become the first to buy the Apple Watch from select stores on Friday but there was no sign of the frenzy that usually accompanies Apple Inc product rollouts So far buyers can get the device from only a handful of upscale boutiques and department stores They include The Corner in Berlin Colette in Paris Maxfield in Los Angeles and Dover Street Market in Tokyo and London Apple courted the outlets to help present the watch as a fashion item rather than just another techie gizmo Paired with an iPhone the watch allows users to check email listen to music and make phone calls It also tracks a persons health for instance by monitoring heartbeats or tracking calories burned during a workout The gadget which has a tiny screen cannot be bought in Apple stores yet For the past two weeks the company has been directing people to order online instead drastically curtailing the long lines of devotees who typically flock to iPhone launches At New Yorks Fifth Avenue Apple store dozens of customers crowded around watch displays and demos FBR Capital Markets senior analyst Daniel Ives polled customers at the store and said about percent were there to either try or better understand the watch which he called a good early sign Several customers said they planned to buy the watch after trying it while others said they had already preordered it but had yet to try it on I wanted to check it out for the first time said Steve Sosebee a yearold nonprofit chief executive who preordered the Sport version It has a lot of functions that are useful

easier for people on the move but gave it poor marks for battery life and slowloading apps In Berlin more than people stood in line at designer boutique The Corner on Friday morning First to walk out with an Apple Watch Sport was Alex Anikin from Russia who waited in line overnight outside the store We came first at yesterday so we have been waiting hours approximately he told Reuters Technology lovers and investors keen to find out the watchs components were frustrated with a tough resin coating protecting the core computing module from immediate scrutiny Gadget repair firm iFixit which has successfully pried open other Apple products on their launch day said the US company also appeared to be promoting the watchs inner workings complicating a detailed analysis of its origins from underlying parts suppliers The lack of lines at Apple stores will make it hard to judge popular demand for the watch which comes in variations US prices range from for the Sport version to and more for the gold Edition Prices are higher elsewhere ranging from euros to euros in Germany and pounds to pounds in Britain A survey of British consumers earlier this month by GfK a market research firm found percent planned to buy a smartwatch in the next six months But nearly threequarters percent said they were ready to pay no more than pounds the cost of the most basic version Samsung Electronics

not released any numbers since it began taking orders on April although many buyers were told their watches would not arrive for a month or more as the initial supply appeared to dry up Wall Street estimates of Apple Watch sales vary widely FBR Capitals Ives raised his estimate for this week to million from million based in part on online order backlogs The guesswork was backed up by sources on
