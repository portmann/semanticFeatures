theyve been hiding under a rock that the broader market hasnt generated strong returns Even so I wanted to write an article to remind everyone that shortterm price action isnt always indicative of longterm returns So before rushing over to your broker to sell Apple also remember that momentum names fall bellow the day moving average all the time But so as long as the fundamentals remain intact momentum stocks also tend to recover and exhibit abnormal returns relative to the market So as many of you are well aware Apple NASDAQ AAPL has declined from its alltime high of down to the current level of I wasnt anticipating this to occur but given the weakening market sentiment in both international and domestic markets I guess it was inevitable For the most part Apples fundamentals remain strong However the stock will experience difficulty with pricing momentum as a result of broader technical factors First the Chinese Yuan needs to stabilize The issues in China are broad as growth is relatively weak which resulted in a selloff of the Chinese YuanDollar pair Earnings in the United States are denominated by the dollar When the dollar strengthens it becomes that much more difficult for companies to perform in line or better than analyst estimates Apples earnings growth is fueled by China However the PBOC issued a statement where they will step in if in the event the currency were to weaken even further Second the broader US market underperformed relative to what analysts were forecasting Initially the expected return for the SP was to Unfortunately the market performed much worse than that as the yeartodate performance of the SP was At this point the bond market had a much better year than what many were anticipating despite the impending rate hike by the Fed This really messes with CAPM models as the expected return across broad equities has declined which correspondingly impacts the expected return of Apple Despite this challenging environment theres no denying that Apple grew earnings and revenue considerably I think that the strength of the iPhone will continue and the valuation is relatively cheap As you can tell Apple has declined below the day moving average Generally speaking market participants perceive this negatively However Im starting to see the volume stabilize and broader market sentiment improve which is why I believe the stock will eventually recover in the next months In many cases stocks move right back above the day moving average so as long as the fundamentals of the business remain sound For example <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL was below the day moving average between October and July I was covering the stock at the time and for the most part the advertising business was underperforming as analysts were having a hard time determining whether or not the company would generate meaningful growth in FY The company also was facing a potential fine worth billion which will likely be much less than that The issue was very temporary as management was able to report sales growth that exceeded expectations and create efficiencies in which operating costs would ramp at a slower rate The yeartodate performance of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>was as a result of strengthening fundamentals The stock performed a lot better than the SP which also proves that shortterm price action isnt always indicative of longterm returns Investors should take this into consideration when looking at the recent weakness in Apples price action as it is somewhat indicative of what will likely happen over the next months Another chart that comes to mind is Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT As you can tell the stock fell below the day moving average in January of before recovering later in the year This action was mostly driven by weakness in PC sales however the PC market is expected to recover due to the relatively strong launch of Windows which will correspondingly drive growth in the holiday quarter Markets tend to be forward looking so even though Microsoft reported a charge due to goodwill impairment earnings are expected to recover which is why the stock is trading back above the day moving average I illustrate these two prior examples to make a point So what if Apple fell below the day moving average It doesnt change the fact that Apple operates a high margin cash cow business Ongoing share repurchases will move the stock along with better than expected growth in iPhones and iPads Therefore I continue to reiterate
