class='textDiv'>The Thing About Windows Microsoft Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Windows is pushing Windows on users with some success Its a makeorbreak effort to create server space against Apple on one end and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>on the other The results of the current quarter will tell a lot It was no big deal My user interface didnt change I didnt need a disk It all downloaded in the background and installed itself The computer didnt get faster nor did it get slower as in past Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT upgrades Previous versions of Windows competed only with themselves They were distributed as discrete products users upgraded with cash and the versions competed with one another Even after killing support for Windows XP there were still hundreds of millions of XP machines out there All these machines and their successors became vulnerable to hacks malware and bloat Users have become accustomed to buying a bunch of addon products adblockers and grime cleaners antivirals and speederuppers to keep things going This is not just true on the consumer level Its also true in corporate accounts The cloud and device era made all this obsolete and Microsoft was very slow to respond The company first thought it could offer a crippled version of Windows then it tried a different type of Windows What it needed to do was make a complete break with the past a Windows that would compete directly with Apple NASDAQ AAPL iOS on the highend and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Android on the lowend A client operating system that is constantly updated so everyones on the same page is less vulnerable to attack because bugs can be stomped out centrally A secure operating system can also run servers which remain a thing just not on the top of the computing stack Clouds are now the top of the stack servers are basically PCs with connections to devices below productivity applications at the center and central storage on the cloud As a middle ground device OS Windows doesnt have much going for it Critics will call it a Macys NYSE M in a world that either wants Apples version of Nordstrom NYSE JWN or Googles version of WalMart NYSE WMT The hope is that by creating something thats as useful as a home server but as simple as a client but which also runs the productivity applications like Office corporations depend upon Microsoft can get the space needed to grab a competitive market share against its two rivals The only way to do that of course is to do what Apple did with U Dont just give it away but push the giveaway on people Ask them prod them and finally insist on the upgrade Already just two weeks after its first release Windows is running on of all Windows machines This is a good start and it is making a dent in the huge mistake that was Windows although Windows users like me have been slow to get on board Critics and the media wont take this lying down Windows is being called Microsofts paypaypay plan But can any operating system be maintained and kept secure without cost Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>keep the money flowing through planned hardware obsolescence and that is at the heart of what Microsoft is going to do over the next months and years encourage its users to depend on the cloud then pay for new frontends and maintenance on a schedule Microsoft will have to spend some time then paying for the sins of its past and CEO Satya Nadella doesnt have much time to waste Microsoft usually brings of its revenue to its bottom line the last quarter was an aberration as it wroteoff Steve Ballmers secondfavorite mistake Nokia Id say his favorite these days is Clipper guard Chris Paul but thats another column Investors are expecting a return to normal when Microsoft reports in September but there wont be a lot of Windows licensing cash to spread around and the successful Azure cloud and XBox game machine may not fill the gap Nadella badly needs to get some good news from users so heres some The Windows upgrade is pretty painless you already know how to use it if you have any earlier version of the operating system and it wont overtax your hardware Well see how many agree with me in a few months Ill give away something from Green Day here Wake me up when September ends Disclosure I amwe are long
