the world on Friday without the usual frenzy or fanfare for an Apple Inc rollout as a handful of boutiques in major cities like Tokyo and Paris sold the timepiece but not for purchase at its own stores Shops included The Corner in Berlin Colette in Paris Maxfield in Los Angeles and Dover Street Market in Tokyo and London Apple courted the outlets to promote the watch as a fashion item rather than just another techie gizmo The watch has been on display in Apple stores since April when it became available for preorder Customers began receiving the smartwatch on Friday though there were delays to June or later as Chief Executive Officer Tim Cooks first product has drawn more demand than expected Paired with an iPhone the watch allows users to check email listen to music and make phone calls It also tracks a persons health for instance by monitoring heartbeats or tracking calories burned during a workout Apple could introduce watch down the roadLance Ulanoff A small group of

it while others had already preordered it but had yet to see it in person I wanted to check it out for the first time said Steve Sosebee a yearold nonprofit chief executive who preordered the Sport version It has a lot of functions that are useful especially the fitness Reviewers say the smartwatch could make life easier for people on the move but gave it poor marks for battery life and slowloading apps Technology lovers and investors keen to find out the watchs components were frustrated with a tough resin coating protecting the core computing module from immediate scrutiny Gadget repair firm iFixit which has successfully pried open other Apple products on their launch day said the US company also appeared to be promoting the watchs inner workings complicating a detailed analysis of its origins from underlying parts suppliers The lack of lines at Apple stores will make it hard to judge popular demand for the watch which comes in variations US prices range from for the Sport version to and more for the gold Edition Prices are higher elsewhere ranging from euros to euros in Germany and pounds to pounds in Britain A survey of British consumers earlier this month by
