products Strategy Analytics Q report revealed Alphabets Chromecast is the worlds topselling streaming video device The living room TV is an important conduit for targeted advertising Amazons ban of the Chromecast will affect sales but Googles streaming product already has an insurmountable market lead There is no update yet on Alphabets NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Android phone ambitions Therefore I will report that Alphabets other dirtcheap product the Chromecast is supersuccessful in the streaming devices industry Because the Android One project is unlikely to happen soon the Chromecast is the mass market product that can help Alphabet further increase its audience for targeted ads People who still cling to their dumb HDTVs are potential customers for the Chromecast Alphabet believes in the Chromecast It has allocated a budget to create promotional video ads for the Chromecast While there are now Android TV boxes and fullsized smart TV products the Chromecast caters to the sector that still doesnt want a Android TV Box or a Android smart TV The average TV product cycle is also seven years The Chromecast is an easy cheap upgrade option for people who have era Android smart TVs that are no longer powerful enough to run modern Android apps and games The appfriendly feature of the Chromecast keeps it popular among consumers As per the Q report of Strategy Analytics the <span

AMZN Fire TV and Roku The Chromecast helped contribute to the notable decline of Apple TV Strategy Analytics Q report last year gave the Apple TV a market share Apples TV box now only has share The new Apple TV will not help Apple catch up with the new Chromecast version Like the latest Apple TV iteration the secondgeneration Chromecasts biggest selling point is its appsgaming compatibility While the new Chromecast still doesnt come with a dedicated game controller Android phones and tablets which most people already own serve as game controllers Alphabet has improved the wireless connectivity of the Chromecast It now has three instead of one multidirectional WiFi antennas It means it has better WiFi speed for latencyfree video streaming and gaming Alphabet sold more than million units of the original Chromecast I expect the improved version to do better because this product is affordable enough even for people in emerging markets Alphabet launched the Chromecast in countries and it still retains the price tag of the original version The Chromecast is now even available here in the Philippines for due to import taxesdealer markup Even people with older Android smart TV products are potential customers of the Chromecast The better hardware specs of the Chromecast gives a new lease on life to older Android TVs I have a threeyear old Android inch Smart TV It only has MB of RAM and GB of ROM which makes it unfit for news apps or gaming The Chromecast has GB of RAM GB of ROM and a dualcore processor it could meet the exacting hardware requirements of new apps Its also more than just an internettoTV gadget It has the essential hardware to really make minicomputers out of HDMIequipped TV sets Thanks to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google

product is compatible with iOS and Android apps Linux Windows and Mac OS X computers that use the Chrome browser also has webbased apps that really give Chromecast owners access to thousands of

streaming services The more Chromecast users there are the better chances that more people will buyrent a movie from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Movies As long as there is a Chromecast Apple will find it hard to disseminate enough TV boxes to lay the groundwork for its ambitious streaming videoTV service for Anything that hurts the expansion plans of Apple is good for Alphabet Yes Amazons ban of the Chromecast will still hurt future sales of the Chromecast However there are other online stores that Amazon customers could use to buy the Chromecast this holiday
