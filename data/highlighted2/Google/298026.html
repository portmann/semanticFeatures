opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Facebook recently announced Sports Stadium a sportstailored feature of the social media platform dedicated to being a centralized location for everything sports This is a natural step for Facebook which is attempting to add sufficient functionality to its multipleappecosystem to make it so that users get all they need within four apps Having written on Facebooks excursions into discovery and commerce we actually see sports news as a more natural step than both because it blends seamlessly with Facebook Trending We see the market for sports information as highly fragmented among the likes of ESPN CBS Sports Yahoo Sports and many others making consolidation of information an attractive solution Facebook NASDAQ FB recently announced Sports Stadium a sportstailored feature of the social media platform dedicated to being a centralized location for everything sports Sports Stadium currently exclusive to US iPhone users and available only through search is a place where users can receive game information time TV airing and location browse videos and expert posts get realtime stats and check out what their friends are saying about the game on Facebook all in a tabulated format We took a picture from Facebooks press release of what the feature looks like on the mobile platform and have pasted it below for reference This is a natural step for Facebook Facebook is attempting to add sufficient functionality to its multipleappecosystem Facebook Messenger Instagram and WhatsApp to make it so that users dont have to spend much time outside of those four apps They are doing this through consolidating and layering various functionalities into each app For example we have previously written on how Facebook is creating a discovery and rating system which will eventually make Yelp NYSE YELP obsolete We also have previously written how Facebook is transforming Messenger into a consolidated commerce marketplace As we have noted previously this consolidation will work because of what is dubbed as the app enigma People love smartphone applications but dont download new ones Around of smartphone users do not download a new app every month and an average phone user spends of his or her time in just five apps The story is no different with Sports Stadium We actually see this as a more natural step than both discovery and commerce because it blends seamlessly with Facebook Trending Facebook Trending is a personalized and organized news feed Sports Stadium is a similar type of news feed about a particular sporting event We find this particularly useful given the high amount of fragmentation in the sports information world in ESPN Fox Sports CBS Sports and Sports Illustrated among several others Sports Stadium looks like a mobile <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL search with filtered results and within the greater context of a platform where you can see what your friends are saying about the game and check the ingame stats We know that what is currently available is not a finished product but we believe Facebook can do a lot more with Sports Stadium that what it currently is doing Within each game interface itself we think Facebook has significant potential to convince users to use the Sports Stadium feature as their goto app for mobile game checkins We believe adding more to the game information section could be beneficial including the line on the game weather conditions if applicable and previous matchups between the two teams As it stands one cannot view historical stats for each team so we would like to see that functionality on there as well Facebook also could afford to add a separate Sports Stadium chat feature where Facebook users can create their own private chat groups specific to the game As it stands the Friends section is for public Facebook posts only Adding a layer of privacy to supplement the public post section could generate greater user engagement We imagine Sports Stadium being a place where Facebook users cannot only post publicly about the game but also chat privately with friends about the game as well Sports fans already do this on Messenger or with text messages creating group chats to talk about the game so it seems intuitive to build out a feature that allows for this directly through the Sports Stadium app It also is important to note that sports fans already use a Facebook account to comment on sports sites like ESPN Sports Stadium can essentially move that conversation between Facebook users to the Facebook platform and create a Comment section within Sports Stadium On a broader scale we think Facebook can flesh out Sports Stadium to have a central page As opposed to being forced to search for the game we imagine there being a button within the Facebook interface that says Sports Stadium Clicking that button would redirect the user to the central Sports Stadium page We imagine that page to list all games sorted by sports filters NBA NFL MLB etc and time filters live upcoming and completed In the longterm picture we think this should be able to be incorporated well with team pages and league pages which Facebook already has for most sports teams and leagues There is potential to flesh out those team and league pages to include stats schedules rosters and standings For example imagine a user goes to the Broncos vs Patriots NFL game on Facebook The user then clicks the Broncos teampage and can see their record roster and stats The user then clicks on Peyton Manning and can see his personal stats and gamelog It would be an ESPNlike setup sans articles and analysis within the Facebook platform This however is a lot of data to add to the platform and the setup of pages currently is that the data would have to be inputted by those running the team and league pages not Facebook This is why we label this as a more longterm picture for Sports Stadium and do not consider it something that will happen any time soon As is stands Sports Stadium is a nice idea that points to Facebooks desire for app consolidation If Sports Stadium incorporates the functionality we have detailed in the prior few paragraphs we believe the new feature could transform into a comprehensive destination for mobile sports information We see the market for sports information as highly fragmented among the likes of ESPN CBS Sports Yahoo Sports and many others This makes consolidation of information an attractive solution for the typical sports fan At the end of the day we think Facebooks size billion daily users and million sports fans gives the platform leverage in consolidating functionality It is in the very early stages of Sports Stadium but we view this as a crucial step in the direction of increasing the amount of time a user spends on Facebook We remain long Facebook and affirm the strength of the secular story that Facebooks share of users mobile app time will grow Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
