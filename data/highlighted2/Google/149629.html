blockers that will be distributed through the Apple App Store Ad blockers are part of a larger bifurcation of Internet content delivery into subscriptionbased and adbased systems Revenue and profit will tend to drain out of the adsupported part of the Internet into the subscriptionsupported part Apples NASDAQ AAPL iOS contains technology that will enable third party ad blockers within the Safari browser These ad blockers will be available from the Apple App Store Ad blocking has the potential to remake the Internet user experience This could also deny <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL a lucrative revenue stream that comes from the wealthy iOS ecosystem For iOS Apple introduced a couple of new technologies related to its Safari web browser The first is the ability of developers to write extensions for Safari that would be approved by Apple and distributed through the App Store The ability to write extensions or plugins for web browsers has been around for years but hasnt been allowed in iOS until now The second is the ability to write a content blocking extension for Safari To quote Apples official documentation The new Safari release brings Content Blocking Safari Extensions to iOS Content Blocking gives your extensions a fast and efficient way to block cookies images resources popups and other content This week the ramifications of the new tech finally started to sink in Here I admit I was a little behind the curve since I blew off the Safarirelated portions of WWDC out of lack of interest An article in Apple Insider pointed out that web publishers stand to lose over billion in advertising revenue this year and almost double that in presumably due to the impact of iOS Marco Arment posted a blog piece predicting the demise of the web advertising business model Web publishers had things pretty nice for a while Those days are over It wont be easy for many to move on and not everyone will make it Assuming the technology works reasonably well for iOS its hard to imagine why most iOS users wouldnt take advantage of it Internet display advertising has become a parasite that invades your devices and compromises your privacy More importantly display advertising has become so obnoxious on so many sites that its counterproductive How does antagonizing users promote products I submit that it doesnt and is therefore a waste of money for the advertiser So many of the clicks that advertisers pay for have become worthless Ah but theres still gold in them thar hills in the form of all the user data that gets forwarded to the advertiser when a user downloads a particular web page This more than paid clicks themselves is probably what has fueled the explosion of webbased advertising Ad blocking has the potential to stifle this webbased spying as well As Arment says it wont be a clean easy transition I would go a lot further and say that this is shaping up to be a battle on the order of the ongoing conflict between malware developers and security software developers Web advertising developers will constantly search for new ways to defeat ad blockers Ad blocker developers will have to constantly update their software to handle the latest ad circumventions Thus ad blocking will probably never be totally effective but it will probably eliminate of display advertising from websites Thats still an reduction in advertising revenue and thats a big hit As ad blockers become ubiquitous in iOS devices I expect the popularity of ad blockers to grow so that they also are ubiquitous for Mac OS X and Windows devices The use of ad blockers will only accelerate a process that is already underway in Internet content delivery This is a shift away from advertising supported content delivery the general purpose web page but also advertising supported video and music services to subscriptionbased content Advertising free subscription content has been pioneered by companies such as Netflix NASDAQ NFLX but were also seeing subscription content appear in the form of the new Apple Music service In the new subscription model the general purpose web browser will tend to be less preferred as a means of access than customcreated apps Even though content delivery will still be Internet based the user client will tend to be an app downloaded from an app store This makes the accessing process more secure for the provider and will tend to reduce fraud and hacking In the new subscription Internet paradigm is there still room for advertising supported content Probably Websites such as Hulu can mandate that ad blockers be disabled in order to access the site This is probably something that any site that wants to preserve the visibility of advertising will be able to do In effect the Internet is being transformed into a twotier medium The lower tier that is advertising supported and free to all and the upper tier that is subscription supported This stratification of the Internet may to some degree mirror the stratification of wealth and profit in the mobile device universe As many have pointed out most of the profit from mobile devices is going to Apple through iOS If Apples iOS profitability is any indication revenue and profits will be quickly drained out of the advertisingsupported tier of the Internet The stakes for <span style='background-color:
