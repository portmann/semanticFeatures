Stocks You Want To Avoid Before Interest Rates Rise Seeking Alpha An interest rate hike is imminent likely before years end Some stocks will thrive others will suffer when interest rates rise Just about every large financial institution has issued its list of good and bad stocks for after the Fed raises interest rates The Fed delayed an interest rate hike for September but is insisting that a hike will come this year Therefore its natural for investors to start asking which companies have the most to lose when interest rates rise While the list may be long here are four large companies that come to mind more so than any other First and foremost I am looking at companies with a large debt load lots of floatingrate debt and companies that might need more debt and therefore affected by higher financing costs Furthermore the stocks that made my list are those that have used debt freely over the last decade while interest rates have been low yet still have many questions surrounding their business Thus these companies not only present risk from an interest rate stance but also a business risk and have a likely need for further financing in a high risk environment VZ Revenue NYSE TTM data by YCharts If not for spending billion to have full ownership of its Wireless business Verizon Communications would not have made this list But by doing so Verizons debt has increased from billion to more than billion since which is why its year increase looks so high Furthermore had Verizon actually gotten something valuable for that billion it probably wouldnt make this list However just after Verizon spent all that money an allout price war in the wireless space broke out and competitors Sprint NYSE S and TMobile NYSE TMUS have essentially targeted all growthrelated initiatives towards stealing Verizon and ATT NYSE T customers VZ Free Cash Flow TTM data by YCharts Nevertheless that billion acquisition which was supposed to drive free cash flow higher has not worked out as planned Instead free cash flow has declined more than during the last five years Looking ahead Verizons decline in free cash flow means it has to seek financing to fund certain activities like spectrum acqusitions and with interest rates rising and Verizons debt already so high VZ is quite an investment risk FOSL Revenue TTM data by YCharts Fossil Groups debt increase relative to revenue growth is mindboggling With less than million in debt its not that Fossils debt load is unmanageable However of Fossils market cap is variable rate debt and like Verizon margins have fallen quite significantly for Fossil making debt payments more difficult Perhaps the bigger problem is that Fossil operates in a watch business that is changing quickly The company has already partnered with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Android Wear yet has failed to unveil or produce a lineup of smartwatch products Meanwhile smart and basic wearables are growing rapid stealing share from Fossil and thats one reason FOSL has declined nearly this year In essence interest rates are rising Fossil still has a large debt balance to pay and most importantly the need to increase debt to fund RD and marketing for a new line of products is likely In other words things could get worse for Fossil before getting better and that means its stock could go lower DISH Revenue TTM data by YCharts DISH Networks Charlie Ergen has made no secret that the company has taken advantage of a low interest rate environment to fund strategic investments over the last few years which is evident by the above chart Thats good and all but the problem is that DISH now has billion in debt and needs to make moves thatll cost billions of dollars and it cant First off ATTs acquisition of DirecTV created a payTV juggernaut that DISH has to compete against Also DISHs most valuable asset is a large spectrum portfolio that is essentially useless Therefore DISH needs to find a way to compete against this new payTV juggernaut and put its spectrum to use Most think that way is an acquisition of TMobile but where and how could DISH afford it Nevertheless DISH needs to make a big move and higher interest rates are going to pose a challenge Given the questions that surround DISHs competitive position in payTV and its unused spectrum DISH is particularly risky ahead of higher interest rates Last but not least McDonalds debt to assets ratio has steady risen to well over in recent years to fund strategic investments yet still there are serious questions surrounding innovation consumer traffic and how the company plans to grow amid a widespread shift to fastcasual and healthy dining Ultimately more debt is a likely outcome as McDonalds tries to address these questions With McDonalds already possessing a large chunk of rate floating debt according to Goldman Sachs no increase in debt would be particularly good for the restaurant giant After all higher interest rates are already going to increase the amount that McDonalds owes to creditors and if forced to raise more debt it will be tough to imagine the companys balance sheet becoming strong once more or its stock for that matter All things considered it is hard for me to imagine that any of these companies increase in market valuation once interest rates rise Not only does each company have legitimate questions surrounding their respective businesses but all have large debt loads and are likely to need additional debt to address these noted questions With an interest rate hike being imminent I see no reason to own any of these stocks now or later Disclosure I amwe are long T MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving
