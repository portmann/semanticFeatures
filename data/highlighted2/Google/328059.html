site Microsoft programmers have allowed NSA backdoors in all Windows software since or before And while Microsoft sometimes pretends that its fighting for privacy it has long been a direct partner of the NSA helping government at every opportunity Tue dexter_morgan I wonder if the Donald comprehends the situation since he seemed to be of the opinion Cook should go to jail or something if he does give them their way That wouldnt be a good sign No one cares to stop the carnage of evil as it flaunts the law in the faces of the worlds People every day There is no justice for the evil that is out of control because of the lack of the control of evil The really filthy truth is the people are angry because there is plenty of admiralty law to perpetuate the cash generating prison world complex with but there is no justice for these evil leaders and politicians and media cretins who blatantly flaunt that they are above the law of the land The people are fed up with all the trash and BS and lies and deceptions They hate with a passion the evil lying dying dinosaur media complex No one supports them or buys any products advertised on the TV drug any moar Take that hag hitlery and her scumbag accomplice the other commie Obama for instance The stack of criminality and corruption is staggering and yet not a peep in the supposed news media that is no less that the most vile evil bunch of carkin accomplices to the worst skanky evil to ever walk the planet in this charade this horrendous farce this shit show deluxe from hells arsehole Tue spqrusa Tue gdpetti Of course he supports it as hes been a long time member of the PTB club through his family which is why he got the same treatment of support with his startup same as later occurred with the likes of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Facebook Twitter see the pattern Tue Reaper Trust in government in operating systems in software in judges in black robes in FBI agents in police or in juries is for fools Is the testimony of any government hack into your internet communications to be trusted All FBI forensic evidence must be doubted ie httpswwwwashingtonpostcomlocalcrimefbioverstatedforensichair Stupid juries want to believe FBI and police testimony when these testifiers are experienced in presenting false testimony httpwwwinnocenceprojectorgfreeinnocentimprovethelawfactsheet Your only good defense is that the government aka police or FBI could not legally obtain that which they will certainly lie about Encryption is abuse protection from your supposed protectors I would venture that it was off limits Bill knows the game now and has cooperated with the government since way back Tue sgt_doom On TV interviews on Apple and the FBI Gates sounded like a complete idiot as if he didnt understand what Apple was talking about always a possibility with BG What GW is talking about was Microofts ADVAPIDLL file created expressly for NSA But rest assured if the FBI gets their feeb hands on Apples encryption scheme then the Chinese intelligence will have it within hours as the feebs have long been deeply penetrated by Chinese intelligence as too many of their agents will give up EVERYTHING for a little bit of Chinese poon tang Of course since Ann Coulters boyfriend is an FBI agent that might just be a major step up for them Tue redwater I dont think their is any candidate left who isnt for the deep state having access to everyones phone andr computer Republicans and Democrats are fighting over whos more of a pinko commie than the other Republicans and Democrats voters are at the point where theyll voluntarily apply to be sent to the FEMA camps for the good of the nation Tue xizang Amazing that in this modern age that no one car read As in READ the Fourth Amendment Any warrant has to state a probable cause and state what in particular the government is looking for This current federal government wants the master keys to access EVERYONES privacy Once they have those keys what assurrance do we have that they will follow the Fourth Amendment Or do you suppose the government will just use those keys to access everyones data willy nilly when and as they please And of course those keys will be available to everyone on the black market So much for privacy May as well just install government cameras in your bathrooms and bedrooms Tue Citxmech The Real reason How about because Gates is one of the worlds most eager whores who will do anything to protect his position including fight for the chance to be a concubine of Satan Tue peddlingfiction He was also lying through his teeth about Global Warming he forgot they call it Climate Change these days lol Bill was showing off his personal pseudo equation Probably Davos babble httpdailycallercombillgatestheworldneedsamiraclet Tue williambanzai First of all I always assumed that Apple has already given the government the keys to the back door but that is not my question But assuming for arguments sake they have not Why isnt Apple saying if you come with a proper court order give us the Phone WE will unlock it draw the data out and hand it to you in a strictly confidential basis That is very different from Apple being forced to say OK here are the keys go ahead and have fun unlocking that Phone and any other Phone you feel like unlocking with what you learn from that exercise Tue dexter_morgan This is what Ive been saying to people with dumb stares if they have a warrant then give them the info If they want more than the info tell them to go fuck themselves williambanzai They apple already complies with Fed warrants in that way Fedgov wants them to build a backdoor into the hardware like China currently does with quite a few items Oddly enough had Fedgov given Apple a phone call Apple could have taken the iphone in question back to the users location and uploaded any all info on to the Icrapple cloud drive and given Fedgov all the info Fedgov chose NOT to make that phone call and fucking bricked the iphone Oh wellLOL Tue nmewn I read they got to nine failed attempts and stopped number ten bricks it Could be wrong but thats what I understand and of course thats all we or should I say I have to go off of press reportswhich could be false reports Tue Bennie Noakes As I understand it to unlock the phone you need to guess the password which could take years if the password is strong So the government is requesting a special version of the phones software that would prevent it from permanently locking after incorrect guesses Even with the software mods the FBI is requesting there is no guarantee that the government would be able to guess the password in any reasonable amount of time or that they would find any useful information if they did But they could use the modified software on any iPhone of the same make Given the failure to the government to protect IRS information of millions of taxpayers and employment information of millions of government employees how could Apple be sure that the special hacking code they give the FBI would not end up in the hands of criminal hackers Tue nmewn On the issue of time the time to unlock one of the theories Ive read is they if they dont have a masterkey is to suspend the devices comprehension of time Doing so allows them to run an almost unlimited amount of passcodes past it in less than the blink of an eye the device thinking in terms of seconds thousands or millions of password guesses running through it microseconds until one hits Tue nmewn Im no expert either and am only relating what Ive read too but knowing what I think I know theyve already got it and this is all for public consumption They could have done all this legally under seal a gag order both parties are being very forthcoming open to set something else up IMHO probably a precedent that will devolve down to even divorce cases in the future ten years maxlol Tue dexter_morgan NEVER WASTE A CRISIS Sounds like Apple one of few companies that hasnt already given them this backdoor so use the San Bernadino incident to get it Is there really anything on that phone they dont already have like contacts via cell tower records email records etc Tue messystateofaffairs Its all a show for marketing purposes to make Apple look like they care about customers privacy The back doors been with Apple a long time I beleive strong encryption cannot be cracked by the government Independent smart people cant do it so neither can govt I use Truecrypt software and the developers of the software claimed on the website that they found a flaw with the software and its not secure Independent testers have not been able to find a weakess I think govt got to the founders and twisted their arm to discredit their product to weaken user faith in it precisely because they cant defeat it I have faith in open source software and strong encryption and that includes products like bitcoin They are going to play a vital role in the fight for freedom Tue HalinCA Tue nmewn I had always assumed the same and Im not so sure they dont this could be the old good copbad cop routine with Apple finally saying Gosh darn it we tried folks but its a court order dangit all But what you say is what should happen they get ONE government rep in the room and not some little photographic memory geek either a top dog and just one and Apple unlocks it downloads it and most importantly Apple gets a copy of whatever is on it because I really dont trust what they will say they found on it and that copy is given to a third party say like the ACLU for shits and grins and Apple keeps that key so that copy can be turned over to the defense counsel should the need ever arise The government cannot be trusted with whatever Apple says they have the encryption keyscodehack software to iphone devices theyve made that abundantly clear by their past actions in scooping up everyones data From my understanding the phone was not owned by Saaayeed Nutcase its owned by his employer local gov if I recall and they are giving the government permission along with it being evidence in a crime As an aside I believe there is only three rational possibilities going on here whatever is on it implicates gov itself or they really are trying to get a master key or its a ruse to explain how theyve had access to iphones all along Tue motley If they provide a backdoor method to crack the encyrption the encryption can no longer be trusted This doesnt matter whether the method is provided internally worrisome or externally worse because you are admitting that there is a backdoor and then people as well as the security must be trusted This is not real security any moreit means someone or something out there has a key to your backdoor that you dont know about and you just have to trust them Any encryption can be bruteforced with computing powerthe stronger the encryption the more computing power it will require and the longer it will take to busted Encryption is getting stronger all the time but so is computing power and access to large computing grids If you want to sell your product based upon secutiy you dont allow a backdoor period This is very important to Apples image as it should be Tue knotjammin All the hoopla about this story is just plain bullshit Apple gave up the codes a long time ago and thats from somebody that worked on the team No Bullshit Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site PREMARKET
