class='textDiv'>Apple The Bull Comes Back Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha In my previous article Bear Case From A Bull I thought it would be useful to come up with the most potent potential vulnerabilities to Apple NASDAQ AAPL from a bulls perspective It is important for an investor to examine both positive and negative views on a stock assuming they are reasonable The idea was to examine the factors that might negatively affect Apples share price in the long run I gave four that I thought most important though I did not label the first two as I probably should have Here I will reply to them with the bull case Once again however I will try to avoid gratuitous and hyperbolic arguments Margins are always a concern for any company but particularly so for Apple as analysts seem to be fixated on them They are exceptionally high for a hardware company The last reported gross margin for Apple was whereas for HewittPackard NYSE HPQ just while Lenovo OTCPKLNVGF recently reported Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL were at and respectively but they sell softwareservices not hardware The chart in the previous article shows how Apple margins dipped in and how the share price recovered after margins rebounded The share price retraction was influenced by revenue and earnings slowdowns as well but obviously they were all related Earning in particular were greatly depressed by the drop in gross margin So this will always be an area of great interest to Apple investors but a few things should alleviate any shortterm concern First the success of the iPhone and the higherpricedhighermargin Plus have driven margins up again Sales of the Apple Watch line seem to have gotten of to a great start and the margins for these products are almost assuredly very high Although they may be held down a bit at first by high development costs These are trends that are not likely to reverse significantly near term Consumer Intelligence Research Partners recently released analysis of the results from its research on Apple for the fiscal quarter that ended March They report Together the flagship iPhone and Plus share of total iPhone sales increased relative to the December quarter said Josh Lowitz CIRP Partner and Co Founder ASP as predicted by our US Weighted Average Retail Price USWARP may decline however The initial unanticipated strength of the Plus has moderated somewhat with the Plus to ratio declining from to in the most recent quarter though this is still a strong showing for the superpremium model However it is important to note that the data is for USA only Strong sales in China are likely to pull up the Plus in the mix as the larger format is reportedly more popular there And even in the USA the fact that the two new models together are a larger percentage of sales than last years flagship s will continue to keep margins high This years double flagship comprise roughly of iPhone sales compared to last years flagship s at only So for the time being at least I do not think investors have much to fear in the area of margins It would take serious setbacks to iPhone sales to bring these down significantly iPhone Sales Stagnation or Shrinkage Margins to a degree and even more so growth can be considered as results or functions of the other two items on the list iPhone sales and Apple Watch success or failure For this reason growth will be discussed last In the previous article I posed the possibility of limitations to the growth of the iPhone and even the possibility that at some point in time sales might shrink I met a lot of resistance here with some insisting that growth will continue virtually forever or so it seemed Others agreed with me that we must recognize that sooner or later the market will cease to grow beyond that of population growth Even today the overall growth of smartphone sales is not what it was a few years ago The following chart shows projected global smartphone sales through charts by the author data from Statista The projection for world population in is billion The units figure given for would mean that one out of every four people on the planet will be buying a new smartphone This sounds a bit high to me In any case note how future yearoveryear growth is expected to be a fraction of that from through What this means is that market share becomes much more important In the past a rapidly expanding market meant you could lose share but still grow in numbers Exactly what Apple has done In the future Apple will be able to grow sales of iPhones only by increasing market share There will of course be a more or less stable basis of sales as people upgrade Apple can increase sales by inducing customers to upgrade more frequently but there are limits to that The real problem with this situation as noted in the earlier article is how sensitive Apple earnings will then be to changes in market share The iPhone represented of revenue in December quarter Any dip in popularity will be immediately felt on the top line and bottom lines Additionally a sales drop would not only bring down revenue but since iPhone is currently the highest margin product line it would knock margins as well There are several reasons why the drop in iPhone sales is not likely at least not in the foreseeable future First at the current time smartphone sales are still growing particularly in China where the iPhone is doing very well Bloomberg reported Sunday April Apple Incs IPhone sales in China may have exceeded the US for the first time in the latest quarter thanks to brisk demand during the countrys New Year celebrations They note projections of to million units in China for the current quarter based on popularity of the larger and Plus models Apple arguably has the best engineers and most creative leaders in the tech industry The legacy of Steve Jobs is not only the physical devices but the company itself CEO Tim Cook likes to say that innovation is in Apples DNA While some take such statements as mere PR I believe there is a lot of truth in it There is a never ending train of innovation from Apple in hardware software and physical design From front running processors that seem to do more with less energy to leading photo capabilities built into the system from best in class TouchID to groundbreaking ApplePay the company leads in so many areas of innovation that they are guaranteed to keep the lead It is important to understand that Apple does not sell just hardware it sells a whole ecosystem This means that customers soon become entrenched in the system and leaving it would involve significant effort The iPhone continues to have highest customer satisfaction overall and this extends through all of Apples products All this provides a tremendous moat around the iPhone protecting it from any sudden defection Apple would have to create a very seriously defective new iPhone model to see any serious level of abandonment As for the fickle whims of fashion the ecosystem moat would dampen that significantly In theory it is a possible factor but it is something that would take a very long time to play out Additionally for this to happen there would need to be an alternative that would so overshadow the iPhone as to cause such a change This is something that Samsung OTCSSNLF has been trying to do for years In spite of some impressive hardware however they remain behind in the most significant technologies bit processor fingerprint recognition security ApplePay HealthKit handoff etc The one thing that they and other Android manufacturers have led in is larger sized handsets This however was easily overcome when Apple introduced the new and Plus models which pushed them to global manufacturer last quarter according to Gartner with over million units sold The last area addressed in the previous article was a potential failure for the Apple Watch I have discussed how the important thing for the sale of any product is perceived value I questioned whether or not there would be long term perceived value in the Apple Watch Right now millions of early adopters have snapped up all available units to a tune of most likely over million units But will this level of interest continue or will the device be viewed as a very well designed gadget that in the end has little real value So when the dust settles and a year or two has gone by how will it be viewed If Apple Watch were to eventually be a failure then that would damage Apples reputation in all areas and would be very negative for share price To me this is a tough one You have real convenience designed into the notifications updated Siri maps exercise apps and so forth Additionally the new Research Kit is something that will have profound affects on medical research assuming the platform survives The early success of this alone is extraordinary and the watch will likely play an important role Certainly if any smartwatch will break into the mainstream it will be the Apple Watch No other wearable on the planet has had such intense and dedicated design at every level of the product So the jury is out on this one Balanced with the risk one would remember the potential benefits if the Apple Watch succeeds This will provide an new very high margin revenue stream and entice new customers to the iOS product line As noted above this is a resultant of both iPhone and Apple Watch I have addressed the iPhone issue above and it is highly unlikely that there will be any significant dampeners on growth for the smartphone aside from eventual slowdown in growth as the market approaches saturation While the investor needs to keep growth in mind I think that it should not be over done for two big reasons Growth from Apple watch should it be successful Apple TV the little set top box is still only half a step up from a hobby for Apple but if rumored deals should come to fruition then this would be a large source of new revenue Currently it is thought that Apple gets a cut of HBO Now revenues ApplePay Revenue is not considered a main reason for this service but it could turn into a real source if it catches on in a big way particularly if Apple should expand into the financial services sector New products It is unlikely that we have seen the last of new products out of Cupertino We may have to wait for several years The second major reason is that growth is becoming less important to Apple In earlier years Apple was at the verge of extinction and had very little working capital to play with As first the iPod and then the iPhone turned Apple into the company it is today capital has increased to an extraordinary level currently billion and it is absurd to do anything but return a great deal to investors In short Apple has become a cash generating dividend company This alone warrants the current and even higher share price so growth can be seen as icing on the cake for some There are always reasons to doubt any particular investment and Apple is no exception In fact there are more than usual with Apple because there always seems to be people trying to tear Apple down for every inconsequential misstep real or invented I hope that my previous article has articulated some main ones that I see as areas of real concern But concern does not mean inaction Potential vulnerabilities are to recognized and assessed The assessments should then direct ones course of action Here I believe I have addressed these issues and for the most part put them aside for future review To me the future of Apple looks bright as we step into a new era of wearables and a resurgence of the iPhone with the new sizes To my mind to be scared off by potential vulnerabilities would be betting against Apple innovation That has been a bad bet since It has remained a bad bet over the past few years as well It will likely remain a bad bet into the
