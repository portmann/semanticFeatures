Jeff Weiner practically lied to Nadella about LinkedIns desire to be purchased Nadella wasnt sure about the cost synergies four days before he signed Dont risk a lot of your capital if the management is erratic as historical performance may no longer be reliable In my previous article I discussed why the MicrosoftLinkedIn NYSE LNKD deal made no sense read why Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT not only overpaid the subsequent press release was seen as a mixed pot of mumbo jumbo that included hip but meaningless words like cloud and opportunity I would be very surprised if any shareholder has a clear vision of what Microsoft is trying to achieve Sometimes companies dont like to disclose too much information due to competitive reasons but now that we have a detailed timeline of what transpired over the couple of months leading up to the transaction I can say with confidence that Jeff Weiner played Nadella and by extension Microsoft shareholders like a fiddle partly thanks to Nadellas incompetence In an acquisition especially one that is all cash the acquirer typically has performed in depth research about the target This is what we call conviction in investing By offering an all cash deal the acquirer will absorb all of the postacquisition gains and losses ie synergies vs dissynergies which makes conviction even more important We know that the acquisition was not a preconceived plan according to the filing which would have given me a lot more confidence Instead the filing showed that it was a rather rushed deal that began in February with Microsoft starting the evaluation of the potential transaction in March The events are quite telling Jeff Weiner and Nadella had a meeting to discuss current business dealings on February th it was then that a concept of a business combination was raised Or in other words it was a spontaneous decision by Nadella or the result of topnotch salesmanship from Jeff Weiner After the initial meeting Jeff Weiner courted two potential suitors who appeared in the filing as Party A and Party B According to Recode Party A is Salesforce NYSE CRM and Party B is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG Whats funny is that subsequent to the discussions with both parties Weiner called Nadella on March th to tell him that although LinkedIn was not for sale others had expressed interest in an acquisition Source Page from PREMA filed on July st So even though LinkedIn was clearly for sale Weiner conveyed a sense of urgency to Nadella After receiving this threat that Microsoft may be left out of the race unless he acts Nadella decided to express interest the next day It was then that Microsoft began to work on the project the transaction So a month after the initial idea Microsoft finally started to consider the transaction seriously It was revealed that Microsofts first offer was share made on May th This already represented a premium based on LinkedIns close of share but it wasnt close to what LinkedIn wanted which was share Of course this information was contained within LinkedIn But how can Weiner get more money out of Nadella Considering that Nadella is now on the hook LinkedIns management decided to just be more direct On June th Reid Hoffman chairman of LinkedIn told Nadella that LinkedIn would consider the transaction if Microsoft could up its offer What was Nadellas response He indicated that a discussion of cost synergies in the transaction would be necessary in connection with any potential price increases from Microsoft Source Page from PREMA filed on July st Supposedly Nadella had no idea just four days before the signing of the agreement of what were the potential cost synergies Even if he was talking about incremental synergies ie those that were not considered before was it really possible for Nadella to make a good judgment in under four days If I had any doubt about my bearish view it has now been completely obliterated by the new revelations The chain of events paints a clear picture to me a management with no vision that is growing for the sake of growth If I was a shareholder I would be absolutely furious if I learned that the CEO had to rely on the acquirer to learn about cost synergies Have you ever heard of a real estate agent telling you how terrible his listing is Me neither Nadella would have only learned about the positives from Weiner and none of the negatives Did Microsoft become a terrible company with this transaction No but it became a worse company billion isnt pocket change but in comparison to the billion market cap the overall impact will be limited So Microsoft is still investable but is it wise to hold it Maybe but it definitely isnt a good idea to allocate a large portion of your portfolio to the stock We look to Microsofts historical performance for guidance because the business is relatively predictable But if you have a management that is recklessly making acquisitions your financial analysis holds a lot less water since what happened a year ago may not be indicative of what will happen a year from now A similar situation arose in the V Portfolio MagicJack NASDAQ CALL was this great cash cow that was printing money Unfortunately the management decided to make a poor acquisition at least it was profitable significantly decreasing the upside Even then the stock was incredibly cheap but that was not an excuse to not act MagicJack accounted for roughly of the portfolio prior to the announcement the position was subsequently trimmed to The point is that when the future becomes uncertain as the result of erratic management behavior you should not risk a significant amount of your capital Nadellas behavior during the negotiation has shown me that Microsofts management is incapable of making rational decisions hence I believe that investors should not hold a concentrated position in the stock Click the Follow button beside my name on the top of the page to be
