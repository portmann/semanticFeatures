Q This estimate may be low as Apples sales figure suggests the number is much higher Far from succumbing to the commodity smartphone threat Apples position as a premium brand has worked to its advantage According to IDC Apple NASDAQ AAPL was the number one seller of smartphones in China in calendar Q According to the prevailing view of Apple bears Apple should be succumbing to the relentless pressure of commodity Android smartphones Why hasnt this happened Because flooding the market with low quality white box smartphones has hurt the Android brand IDCs report showed Apple and Xiaomi in first and second place followed by Huawei and Samsung OTCSSNLF Samsung was number one last year Apple grew the most yy by to unit shipments of million As I looked over the numbers IDCs estimate for Apple unit shipments started to seem a little low Apples yy sales growth for calendar Q in greater China was to billion If we assume that the iPhone percent of sales in China is approximately the same as the corporate average of then iPhone sales in Greater China were about billion With the iPhone ASP of this comes to million unit sales well over IDCs million for Apple It may be that IDCs China sales estimate excludes sales in places such as Hong Kong that are included in Apples reporting Regardless of the exact number of iPhone sales Apples growth in China is breathtaking and largely contrary to conventional wisdom especially among Apple bears Even now I read increasing commoditization of smartphones being cited as a threat to Apple China is the home of the white box commodity Android phone that has accounted for so much growth in the Android ecosystem in the past few years If commodity smartphones are such a threat to Apple why is Apple the number one smartphone maker in China This is a very fundamental question that speaks to the fate of Apple and the mobile device industry It remains to be seen however whether what has happened in China will be repeated elsewhere The key to understanding the situation in China is this observation made by Kitty Fok of IDC Smartphones are becoming increasingly saturated in China convincing existing users as well as feature phone users to upgrade to new smartphones will now be the key to further growth in the China market I would offer just a slight modification to Foks assessment The saturation has occurred at the white box commodity level The competition for upgrades is primarily from this level into midtier and higher level smartphones where Apple has positioned itself Market saturation has been the case for some time in developed countries so why does the situation in China seem to be working better for Apple There are a number of factors that enter into this chief among them is the poor quality of the white box phones White box phones are considered little better than feature phones and many Apple fans have argued that they shouldnt even be considered in the smartphone category White box phones generally run some version of Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Android My theory is that the poor quality of white box phones has left many Chinese consumers with a negative perception of Android This may not be quite deserved but it demonstrates what can happen when a brand is licensed indiscriminately Part of the reason for Apples brand strength is the fact that it doesnt license the Apple brand and carefully controls the quality of the products it produces When white box phones were fueling the growth of Android and Android activations topped one billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>executives seemed not to care that white box phones might hurt the perception of Android Now they should be more concerned Starting last year at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>IO we saw <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>starting to exercise more control over Android and trying to increase standardization of the platform Well probably see even more movement in this direction in this years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>IO Another factor that helped Apple is that personal electronics have become increasingly personal Devices that people carry around with them all day are seen as personal expressions of taste and wealth The cheap commodity smartphone doesnt really fit the bill And what of the good enough commodity smartphone the smartphone thats a cut above the white box In the bear fantasy of Apples decline and fall its always the attack of the good enough commodity devices that does Apple in because its always assumed that good enough at a lower price will be appealing to consumers If IDCs China data is any indication the good enough smartphone will not do particularly well Samsung and Lenovo as purveyors of good enough commodity smartphones tablets and other consumer electronics both lost market share dramatically in Q Samsung suffered a yy unit sales decline of Lenovo China is also part of a global economic trend that sees many developing nations becoming increasingly affluent As affluence increases consumers become more discriminating wanting products that reflect personal taste as opposed to being merely affordable Just as consumers want products that seem less generic and mass produced manufacturing technology has made product customization more practical Manufactured goods are becoming increasingly built to order customized to reflect the personal preferences of the individual consumer In mobile devices were seeing the convergence of both trends in a new world of hightech manufacturing that is increasingly custom and the very antithesis of commoditized The backlash against generic white box devices in China may not play a role in other markets However the IDC report points out that Chinese white box manufacturers are looking overseas as a way to boost sales Specifically India and Southeast Asia were mentioned If white box manufacturers achieve significant market penetration in these areas we can probably expect another Android backlash years hence And certainly in India there are low cost manufacturers already using Android in a way similar to the white box makers although their brands are more identifiable India and Southeast Asia appear to be the next growth markets after China for Apple but Apple isnt done with China Source
