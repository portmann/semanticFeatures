increase revenue from existing customers data usage and mobile advertising to Go app users Go content from Huffington Post Vice Media the NFL and the NBA give something for everyone but with a focus on millennials Slow rollout of Go is a smart move focus on improving and increasing content is important Growth in viewership is organic with good content Americans are obsessed with checking news feeds social media feeds and other entertainment sources daily if not hourly to get the latest updates on our mobile phones We are addicted to getting information fed to us on the go while eating on public transportation or sitting in traffic and this trend is not stopping According to Portio Research mobile data traffic worldwide is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of between and to reach Petabytes per month by end of That is a lot of mobile data consumption Companies like Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Facebook NASDAQ FB are currently capitalizing of this trend by providing a platform for the public to access or share their favorite media content from mobile devices and for companies to advertise services and products in the same space With the purchase of AOL and the release of the Go mobile application Verizon Communications NYSE VZ is joining the party and in a push to increase revenue from mobile advertising and streaming video is quietly disrupting its own industry before someone beats them to it Verizon owns the cellular services industry literally With the most reliable and farreaching cellular network in the United States it is safe to say that advertisers reach to mobile device revenue would not be possible without Verizon The only real competitor at the scale of Verizon is ATT NYSE T and together these two behemoths are the gatekeepers to the mobile device world Until recently both of these companies were not providing mobile content to customers but only providing access to other companies content via mobile data packages ATT recently purchased DirecTV to enter the mobile streaming world in a big way and now is the largest pay TV provider in the US and the world However key differences between ATT and Verizon mobile streaming video services sets Verizon apart Go is free for everyone Verizon expects to make money by selling advertisements to users of the app Offering the content for free will provide a consistent revenue stream based on users of the app and not on the number of wireless subscribers with data packages DirecTV is an additional pay service that requires even current ATT wireless customers subscribe for both mobile data and television access separately ATT customers or any smartphone user can access Go from the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Play Store or the Apple NASDAQ AAPL Store and Verizon will make money on the advertisements Push toward live video streaming will increase revenue from existing customers Verizon has a huge base of mobile data users and reported million connected devices in its network in the most recent quarter Pushing for more usage of high cost data streaming will increase the revenue of existing customers The access to an enormous existing subscriber base sets Verizon apart from every other content provider Verizon can rely less on getting new customers and can focus on making more from existing ones ATT customers still have to pay for DirecTV and are not likely to also pay high prices to stream the content in addition Exclusive content for Verizon customers will reduce churn and entice new customers Exclusive content provided for free but only to existing customers will entice new subscribers seeking mobile access to NCAA sports or other regional events such as concerts Access to local sports on a mobile device is also reason enough to stay with Verizon Reduced customer churn not only reduces the cost of acquiring new customers but provides ample opportunity to increase revenue of existing customers Go is not just a video streaming app it is a socialentertainment platform that allows for sharing and commenting on quality and timely video content Short videos seem to be the typical format on the app which lends itself well to news clips standup comedy and sports highlights Content from Huffington Post Comedy Central and Vice Media lend credibility to the platform and are likely to appeal more to millenials and younger mobile users Live sports and sports highlights are also part of the platform that seems to fit seamlessly Deals with the NFL to provide free access to local games for existing customers and with the NBA to provide highlights and payperview model for blackout games should have mass appeal Highlights of the NBA slam dunk contest sponsored by Verizon will also likely draw some attention from those seeking timewasting highlight videos on mobile devices Verizons cellular coverage of the United States and ability to pinpoint your location gives them a legup on providing local sports news and entertainment to customers College sports in particular appeals to a much more narrow audience and Verizon is in a unique position to provide regionspecific content that could drive mobile video streaming use all over the country Currently there is no reliable or consistent platform to watch many of these events on your phone Local news video could also be pushed through this platform Another interesting twist could be the use of Go during the next election to watch coverage of local regional and national political races Verizon has had an understated release of the Go app without significant promotion I think this is a smart move by Verizon Dont press too hard until you know what people are responding too Slowly increasing the level of content from a small offering to a much more broad offering will allow ample time to analyze customer preferences and respond to feedback in a timely fashion Verizon is wise to remember that the core of the business is the wireless customers and upselling them data usage without pushing them away is key Providing excellent content that is sure to please the targeted demographic is the first step to getting people comfortable with using more data The fact that the videos are free to anyone and that live events can be watched for free is reason enough to get the app The slow release and deliberate choice of quality highend content is a winning combination Verizon has taken a new approach to mobile video content to both sell advertisements to a wide audience of mobile phone users and to upsell existing customers who are ravenous for mobile video entertainment The approach is new and was unexpected by the industry which felt an acquisition to a proven business model such as DirecTV would be the more conservative approach Buying AOL for the advertising platform as well as the media content is a much more creative approach than trying to sell subscriptions to a packaged cable TV service Short videos provided by Verizon can drive advertising revenue as well as reduce churn by providing customers exclusive or local content Go is a unique approach to providing video clips and live event coverage for mobile users and Verizon is in a unique position to provide this service given the reach of its network Verizon is setting itself apart from the competition in
