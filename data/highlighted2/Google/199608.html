manufacturers The Ford Mustang saw the strongest September since as it looks to reclaim the best selling muscle car title from the Camaro in As the US economy stays strong Ford is in an ideal position to take advantage of the booming US automotive market Ford NYSE F announced September US vehicle sales of K up from the same month in This increase came in slightly above expectations from analysts who were expecting an increase of Fords large yearoveryear increase was largely due to a late labor day but it was the best retail results in September since More importantly the increase led the pack as others reported monthly US vehicle sales Toyota NYSE TM Fiat Chrysler NYSE FCAU and General Motors NYSE GM These positive results for Ford come amidst an auto market that reached an annualized rate of million units in September which is the highest rate since July Furthermore the yearoveryear gain in September was Fords impressive results from September are part of the strong second half that I have been expecting as a result of the new aluminumbodied F pickup reaching optimal inventory levels It has become clear that as the US economy remains strong Ford is in a great position to take advantage of the economy dependent auto market The key to the companys turnaround has been the remodeling of the Ford F The Ford F which underwent a drastic model change to an aluminum body starting with this years model has seen tight inventory levels so far as the company has worked to configure their manufacturing plants Because of the inventory constraints surrounding the new F model the company did not utilize heavy incentives to sell older models like competitors in the first half of However the company has reached full production and saw a increase in FSeries retail sales which pushed total truck sales to their highest level in nine years The FSeries pickup is the most popular vehicle in the US and is key to the companys future The Mustang continued to build an impressive case for comeback car of the year in Mustang sales were at their highest September level since and continue to build its case to reclaim the title of bestselling muscle car in This is a title the company has not held since before the Chevrolet Camaro was introduced During September Mustang sales were up a whopping with over Mustangs sold year to date in compared to only nearly year to date in I believe this is the resurgence of the Mustang and should provide longterm growth for the company in the reclaimed segment While the turnaround looks like it gained traction in August and continued to thrive in September there are contingencies that could derail the companys momentum These include the overall health of the US economy labor negotiations with the UAW and emergence of new competitors in the auto industry If there was an event or condition that forced the US economy back into slowing growth territory or a global recession it would definitely have a major impact on Ford Additionally labor negotiations with UAW are key to Fords bottom line as it employs more than US UAW hourly employees It is important that management keeps these costs under control and does not let costs get out of control Finally with new companies working to produce technology infused vehicles such as Tesla NASDAQ TSLA <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Apple NASDAQ AAPL it is important that Ford stays ahead of this curve and doesnt fall behind when it comes to technology used in the vehicle Management should not be looking at the industry as theirs to lose but they should rather be seeing it as an opportunity to lead the way It was no secret that Ford was losing ground to competitors due to the inventory restrictions as most consumers purchase a vehicle when needed instead of waiting for the newest model Because of this and other factors the Ford resurgence is not guaranteed However it is encouraging to see Ford leading the pack again This shows me as an investor that the new Fs results are positive and the high end models are selling well which is creating a lot of optimism around the new model going forward Given this longterm optimism with Ford I am extremely encouraged by the US sales results in September I continue to be excited about the companys future as the new aluminum bodied F is seeing quick turnaround times the recent shift in consumer sentiment to higher profit margin vehicles and the strong sales of the Mustang With consumers purchasing more expensive vehicles it will allow Ford to report stronger top line and bottom line growth in the end of I remain bullish on the US automobile industry and believe Ford has a strong product mix to take advantage of the growing market I will continue to enjoy the near dividend yield as the company prepares to be successful in the long term We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the personal
