I'm not a die hard Apple fem boy and I bought one.The watch is great and will sell better over the holidays and with due refinement.Everyone has to consider the market for smartwatches.In 2014, a TOTAL of 6.8 million smartwatches were sold worldwide ( http://bit.ly/1LBEMQZ ).The estimates from many of the analysts for the Apple Watch is between 1.9 million to 2.2 million units (current quarter).Ladies and Gentlemen.....to me these numbers are outstanding for a 3 month period (be it with a planned slow ramp up in sales by Apple).Also, their comps Y/Y is 33% which includes a 112% Y/Y increase in China.Many international companies are citing China's economy as a drag on their sales.....Not so for Apple!We consider Apple a strong buy and see this stock price decline as a huge buying opportunity.Keep in mind that Apple's buyback program kicks in this Friday....which will mean Apple will be buying Apple at a lower price point....great for shareholders.ETF Screener: Search and filter by asset class, strategy, theme, performance, yield, and much more ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes</div></body></html>
