due to the popularity of cheap Chromebooks Acer is the worlds biggest vendor of Chromebooks The continuing surge in sales of Chromebooks is a thorn in Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT sales to the K education market Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL giveaways of free productivity apps educational tools VPN cheap maintenance and cloud storage are greatly boosting the appeal of sub Chromebooks The education sector has helped Chrome OSAndroid tablets and computers reach market share in the BusinessToBusiness BB US market This is at the expense of Windows and MaciOS products In spite of their limitation as cloudcentric computers Chromebook sales posted a doubledigit growth rate since Acer one of the worlds largest PC manufacturers also is the biggest vendor of Chromebooks Acer helped <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>increase the presence of Chrome OS computers in the allimportant education market This is true not only in the US but also in other countries As per the May report from Gartner the education market in APAC and EMEA countries accounted for more than of the global sales of Chromebooks last year The good news now for Microsoft shareholders is that Nadella was able to persuade Acer to also create the affordable CloudBook Windows laptop The Acer Cloudbook is now Microsofts equalizer against the increasing popularity of Chromebooks Like the cloudcentric concept of the topselling Acer Chromebook the CloudBook is an inch laptop with GB of DDR RAM and GBGB of SSD storage Microsoft also is as generous as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>when it comes to the CloudBook The price tag comes with a free oneyear subscription to Office Personal and Terabyte of cloud storage The CloudBook also has a SD card slot for easy storage expansion Acers cheap Windows laptop is more expensive than the Acer Chromebook However the CloudBook has twice the amount of internal storage and also uses the newer nm Braswell Intel NASDAQ INTC Celeron n CPU Intel sells the Celeron n for per tray so the CloudBook has a decent SoC It should satisfy the needs of students and teachers Unlike Chrome OS computers which rely on virtualization technology to use industrystandard Windowsonly software the Windows OS of the CloudBook lets it run any customized legacy x programs from schools and universities Microsoft has a vested interest to protect the dominant position of Windows in the education market The goal now is not to let Chrome OS get too successful that enterprise buyers will notice it This can only be done through the cooperation of PC makers like Acer Microsoft must retain the loyalty of the worlds top computer assemblers to ensure that Windows do not lose out to Googles Chrome OS in the desktop PC market Windows already lost to Android in the mobile arena Emboldened by the overwhelming success of its Android OS Googles Chrome OS campaign is now encroaching on the enterpriseconsumer PC territory of Microsoft Windows Coming up with cheap cloudcentric Windows laptops is an easy way to negate the only real advantage of Chromebooks Microsoft cannot expect budgetconstrained school administrators to go for the Surface when there are Chromebooks I do not think Microsoft wants to tarnish the luxury branding of the Surface by coming up with a version of the Surface The Windows Acer CloudBook therefore serves as a proxy in Microsofts fight against cheap Chromebooks Acer sold million Chromebooks last year I expect the CloudBook to also achieve the same commercial success Cheap Chromebooks are a threat to Windows and Nadella is addressing that menace with equally cheap Windows notebooks The danger of Chrome OS displacing Windows is a serious matter for Microsoft The price assault against Chromebooks was already started by Microsoft last year In spite of Nadellas mobilefirst cloudfirst vision he is not letting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>have an easy time in its attempt to penetrate the consumer desktop PC market The generous giveaway of cheapfree Windows licensing free cloud storage and Office subscriptions serve only to negate the free apps bundled with Chromebooks Furthermore Microsofts minions of PC manufacturers would become discouraged if Nadella approves a version of its Surface The reason why no major phone vendor took Windows Phone seriously is because of Microsofts current bad habit of churning out sub Lumia smartphones Nadella is not repeating the same mistake of competing against his partners in the notebookPC industry A noncompete promise from Microsoft should inspire PC manufacturers to increase their support for Windows Aside from Acer Lenovo OTCPK LNVGY also is coming up with sub Windows notebooks The OEM partners are getting free rein on how low they can go to sell Windows alternatives to the Chromebook MSFT is a buy As of September the algorithmic analysis of I Know First Research also gives MSFT a
