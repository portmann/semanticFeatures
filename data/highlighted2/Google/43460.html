Alibaba stake alone is worth of Yahoos market cap Essentially investors now have the opportunity to purchase Yahoos core business for less than zero Ever since the Alibaba NYSE BABA IPO I have heard talk that Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO is severely undervalued These conversations havent been whispers either They have been shouts that have echoed through the market However the stock appears to have run out of steam as of late despite backing from the analyst community Now after hearing the phrase Yahoo is grossly undervalued for the thousandandsomethingth time I finally decided to try to identify just how much the parts are worth on my own and see if there was still more upside in this somewhat tired name Yahoos remaining million shares of Alibaba currently valued at BB Yahoos equity interest in Yahoo Japan worth approximately BB Yahoos remaining MM share stake in Alibaba is the first thing that comes to investors minds when they look at the companys value unlocking potential And it should be after all the stake is currently worth BB and represents over of Yahoos total market cap On January th Yahoo announced plans to realize the value in the stake through a taxfree spinoff sometime in the fourth quarter Even though there will be one legacy business tied up in the newly formed SpinCo it is assumed that the new company will act as a tracking stock For that reason it is only prudent that we at least familiarize ourselves with Alibabas valuation Currently Alibaba trades at x this years earnings estimates and x estimates These multiples may seem expensive at first glance but when comparing them to the companys anticipated growth rate they dont seem so stretched In fact I believe in the right market investors would be willing to pay up to x numbers or per share for the stock This was evidenced by the stocks earlier post IPO push to On the other hand the stock also could trade down on a bad tape In this case given the superior growth BABA should see buyers support the stock around the companys growth rate Being cautionary lets say they arrive a tad late at x numbers In my bullish case the BABA stake could be worth up to per share Meanwhile the bearish valuation presents only in value and the base case as you can imagine splits the difference at per share The Yahoo Japan stake is a bit harder to value because it trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange meaning it trades in yen This implies a bit of currency risk for Yahoo Currently this stake is worth just over BB or about per share However this same stake at Yahoo Japans current stock price would have been worth considerably more a year ago about BB The declining value is due in large part to the depreciation of the yen relative to the US dollar Therefore the value of this stake presents a significant amount of currency risk especially at a time when a US rate hike appears to be just around the corner If the dollar continues to strengthen the value of Yahoo Japan in USD would likely proceed to drift lower Along with the implied volatility of forex markets Yahoos partner on the venture SOFTBANK OTCPKSFTBY is reportedly uninterested in upping their already sizeable stake Given the size of the investment it may be a tough sell to any individual company For this reason I believe realizing the full BB value of Yahoo Japan is not as feasible as many think Additionally any sale of this business will most likely see some sort of taxation unless Marissa Mayer can work another taxfree miracle comparable to what she appears to be pulling off with the BABA SpinCo With that said its hard to image that Mayer will be able to realize the full current value of the companys Yahoo Japan stake For this reason I think a discount has to be applied to account for risks discussed above Assuming a discount which is more than fair in my opinion the stake is worth about BB or per share Its no secret that Yahoos core business is no longer accelerating with portions of the business evidently declining most notably in legacy businesses This can be seen in almost all areas of PC advertising as premium ads declined yearoveryear in contribution to an overall quarteroverquarter PC advertising revenue decline of MM in the first quarter However these declines have been somewhat offset by growth in MVNS Mobile Video Native and Social Mobile revenue was up while the MVNS segment as a whole grew to a record MM The hope is that this segment will continue to offset any continued declines in the PC space as it has thus far Overall revenue continued to increase the latest quarter advancing Meanwhile exTAC revenue declined due in large part to some onetime items The core business also has some interesting digital content thats capable of producing steady annual cash flows With new digital magazines a yearold fantasy sports franchise and social media site Tumblr Yahoo anticipates fullyear adjusted EBITDA to total between MM and MM Tech companies typically trade at some sort of multiple to their EBITDA albeit they can be vastly different This can be seen by looking at two other internet names The first <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL has been managed superbly and is considered by many to be the premier player in the space Therefore its EBITDA demands a multiple thats higher than its peers currently x On the opposite end of the spectrum there is AOL NYSE AOL which has been unable to keep up with much of the shifts that have taken place in the industry Because of this it trades at a more depressed multiple of x EBITDA With that in mind I think it would be fair to value Yahoos business somewhere in the middle at around x EBITDA At x Yahoos core business would be worth BB or per share Another thing to keep in mind is that Tumblr alone cost BB a few years back Add to that the companys other acquisitions under Mayer and the MA activity alone totals BB This should put somewhat of a floor on what investors are willing to pay for the core business However one could argue that they overpaid for some of these businesses In addition to the three parts that currently comprise Yahoo the company also has a cash buffer Looking at the balance sheet theres BB in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities All of this could easily be converted into cash Turning to liabilities Yahoo owes BB in convertible and other debt Backing out the debt the companys net cash position comes to BB or per share Summing up the parts of Yahoo is fairly easy at their current market prices The Alibaba stake is worth BB Then add to that the Yahoo Japan stake valued at BB and the companys net cash position BB The sum of these three assets total BB When compared to the companys current market cap this implies that Yahoos core business is worth negative BB However it is impossible to value a company with positive cash flows at below zero Therefore the discrepancy between the real value of Yahoos parts and that implied by the current market price of the stock may be even larger On the other hand theres a risk that Yahoo cannot realize all of the value of its Yahoo Japan stake or shares of Alibaba may trade lower Accounting for these fluctuations I composed the chart thats presented below It summarizes what I believe Yahoo would be worth in three different states of the world Given my analysis I believe that there is substantial value in Yahoo that will be realized in the coming months I also believe the riskreward sets up nicely at the stocks current price With that said I recommend starting a position in Yahoo immediately and using any future dip below to accumulate more shares Source How Much Is Yahoo Really Worth Disclosure The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a
