INVN investors are discussed However my projections are that another event in November will probably have more longterm impact Apple NASDAQ AAPL is scheduled to hold a media event next Wednesday in San Francisco Some have noted that the larger venue may presage an especially grand iteration though I continue to think the company will have difficulty topping last years financial success At the very same moment InvenSense NYSE INVN will begin its annual shareholder meeting at its headquarters in San Jose CA This is almost certainly coincidence but it bears mentioning Coincidence or no since Apple is the largest customer of InvenSense INVN investors should be looking to the former event for clues on upcoming business developments An earlier article already looked at the likelihood of InvenSense parts being included in the next iPhones and the prediction was more or less confirmed by guidance from InvenSense management Here are other things to look for OIS optical image stabilization is becoming an increasingly important differentiating factor in the minds of consumers The feature was only a part of the iPhone Plus whereas the base model used EIS electronic image stabilization which is primarily a software solution Furthermore the OIS solution used by Apple did not compare favorably to the InvenSense solution used by Samsung as shown here As a result there has been a lot of focus on camera and video system upgrades for both new versions of the phone including improved stability This represents an opportunity for InvenSense Smart Remotes Management has been talking up the opportunities in remote controls that do gesture recognition In the Q call the CEO said InvenSense has already scored a design win in this category which was enabled by the software acquired with Movea The new version of Apple TV is expected to include a new remote This is not just an opportunity for InvenSenses traditional motion sensing chips Going forward Apple TV may also open the door to sensors to proliferating throughout the home The remote is also rumored to include Siri support That very likely means that Analog Devices NASDAQ ADI unit purchase is paying off with a long awaited microphone win and leap forward in user interfaces Other devices In fact I wouldnt be surprised to see similar interface upgrades across the range of Apple devices in an attempt to keep pace with Android from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL which currently leads in this area As a result Apple has been working hard on Siri and adding third party developer support The same should be true for a new version of WatchOS Improving battery performance is also a major concern so maybe Apple can finally rid itself of the dual gyro kludge we saw in the most recent iPhones While none of the noniPhone devices offer InvenSense similar volume increased content share at Apple can only be good and there is recent evidence of momentum continuing to build between the two companies Once again while Apple currently constitutes the largest share of InvenSense revenue in the most recent quarter I see it becoming less important over the long term The main benefit to the relationship is that it allows InvenSense to build mind share We have a new data point on that front the Developer Conference website documents over developers registered in the InvenSense program Members will be able to exhibit their solutions as part of the conference as well More importantly the event was delayed so that InvenSense could introduce some new programming tools My guess is that InvenSense may debut a crossplatform sensor development suite that works across both Android and Apple platforms This would be a major coup could explain Peter Hartwell moving over to InvenSense Dr Hartwell has headed Motion Sensing for Apple for the past years and was a Distinguished Technologist in the field before that at HP Labs He is coauthor of one of the breakthrough patents for axis MEMs motion sensors My Top Idea article presented evidence that InvenSense received money for something other than parts from Apple and the size of the S discussed in my more recent Pro article may be related Still there is simply not enough disclosure to provide useful investment insight as to exactly what is going on between the two companies The market is currently very wary of all Apple suppliers and not without reason As a result INVN is attractively valued simply on the basis of the companys current business and assets on the balance sheet In my opinion management is making the best of a difficult macro market and the opportunities represented by InvenSenses increasing patent and software portfolios are NOT priced in We may get some clues about those opportunities next week or we may have to wait until November Over the longer term I continue to think that InvenSense will have to resume innovation in hardware as well as software if it remains independent Time will tell Disclosure I amwe are long INVN GOOG MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking
