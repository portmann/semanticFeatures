business leaving it as a shell company with holdings in two other public companies Yahoo Japan and Alibaba Ironically the two best investments that Yahoo made during the recent past were not in its own operations but in the other companies an early one in Yahoo Japan which prospered even as its US counterpart stumbled and the other in Alibaba in It is time get past the denial and sell Yahoos operating business while there still is a business to sell The cash from that sale and perhaps even the rest of the cash balance should be returned to stockholders As a stockholder in Yahoo I can live with that since I am getting Alibaba and Yahoo Japan at a significant discount on their traded value The big news of the day from the tech world comes from Yahoo I am going to skip the exclamation point through the entire story but dont read significance into that exclusion where stories suggest that the board of directors may soon decide whether or not to sell its operating business leaving it as a shell company with holdings in two other public companies Yahoo Japan and Alibaba NYSE BABA The story has resonance for many reasons One is the presence as is required in any good story of a villain a role that is usually assigned to an activist investor and in this case ably filled by Starboard Value a fund that has been pushing for this divestiture The second is the existence of a heroine albeit a tarnished one in the form of Marissa Mayer who was supposed to save the company by boldly moving where Yahoo had not gone before The third seems to be an almost existential question of whether the potential end game for Yahoo a company that many journalists grew up with as part of the technology landscape is an indication of their own aging Lets start with a reality check By the time Marissa Mayer became CEO of Yahoo in its glory days were well in its past as you can see in this graph that traces the companys history from a young startup to mature and beyond in the life cycle Not only had Yahoo decisively and permanently lost the search engine fight to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>GOOG GOOGL but it was a company in search of a mission with no clear sense of where its future lay Ironically the two best investments that Yahoo made during the recent past were not in its own operations but in the other companies an early one in Yahoo Japan which prospered even as its US counterpart stumbled and the other in Alibaba in a prescient bet on a thenprivate company Alibabas online sites Taobao and TMall through which almost of all online retail traffic in China flows makes it a legitimate and valuable symbol of the China story and it went public late last year to fanfare and a recordbreaking market capitalization for an IPO I valued Alibaba at the time of its IPO filing and I extended my analysis to include Yahoo which at the time held of Alibaba While my valuations need to be updated to reflect what has happened in the last year the picture that I drew in September breaking down the companys intrinsic value into its component parts remains largely intact Yahoo Intrinsic Valuation from September Note that of my estimated value of my total estimated value of billion for the company less than about billion comes from Yahoos operating assets The challenge that Ms Mayer took on was to not only turn around a company that had lost its way in terms of its core business but one that derived most of its value from holdings in two companies that she had no control over Her history of success at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and the fact that she was young attractive and female all played a role in some choosing her as the anointed one the savior of Yahoo Why Marissa Mayers quest was always long shot The odds of Ms Mayer succeeding at Yahoo at least in the ways that many of her strongest supporters defined success were low right from the beginning for two reasons It is hard enough to turn around a company but it becomes even harder when you are given control of only the rump of the company The reality is that on any given day the value of Yahoo as a company was more influenced by what Jack Ma did that day at Alibaba than what Ms Mayer did at Yahoo In a post a few months ago I noted that the tech business is an aging one and that it is time for us to retire the notion that tech equals growth I also argued that tech companies age in dog years relative to companies in other sectors and that a year old tech company is closer to being geriatric than middle aged It is for that reason that I give long odds to any aging technology company that tries to rediscover its youth I will be doing a followup post in a couple of days on my reasoning for why the tech business life cycle is compressed in time Lest I sound fatalistic it is true that there are counterexamples aging tech companies that have rediscovered their youth as evidenced by IBM Corps NYSE IBM rebirth in and Apples new start under Steve Jobs Much as we would like to give Lou Gerstner and Steve Jobs credit for pulling off these miraculous feats I believe it was a confluence of events many of out of the control of either man that allowed both miracles to happen The Lou Gerstner turnaround at IBM was aided and abetted by the tech boom in the s and as for Steve Jobs the myth of the visionary CEO who could do no wrong has long since overtaken the reality By promoting both turnarounds as purely CEO triumphs we set ourselves up for the Yahoo scenario where a new CEO Marissa Meyer is assumed to have the power to turn a company around but were then disappointed in her failure to do so I am less disappointed in Ms Mayer than many others since my expectations on what she could do at Yahoo were much lower right from the start In a recent article in The New York Times Farhad Manjoo a writer that I enjoy reading and respect for his tech savvy made a case that Ms Mayers failures can be traced to her lack of boldness at Yahoo or as he put it her unwillingness to bet the farm an illsuited choice of expressions in many ways at least for this CEO and this company First as the CEO of a publicly traded company she would not have been betting her farm but that of her stockholders Second if you buy into the notion of Yahoo as a farm it is difficult to bet the farm when you are given control of only the farmhouse Yahoos operating assets as Ms Mayer was with Yahoo and the rest of the farm Yahoos holdings in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan is offlimits to you Third betting the farm also connotes the seeking out of long odds in the hope of a big payoff entirely okay if you are a young startup with little to lose but not so in the case of Yahoo Mr Manjoo is not alone in believing that Marissa Mayers fault was that she did not make a bigger acquisition or larger investment in some new business for the most part unspecified In fact it is part of what I termed the Steve Jobs syndrome where CEOs aspire to be the next Steve Jobs While some go so far as to don black turtlenecks and strut on the stage like he did most settle for wanting to be heroic enough during their tenure to have books written about them and Ashton Kutcher play them on screen More dangerous is what follows since to be like Steve Jobs you have to make a small company into a really big one and the way to do that is to take dangerous risks or to bet the farm The end results reflect the laws of probability and the stockholders in these firms end up paying for a CEOs play for celebrity status If you accept my thesis that many aging tech companies resemble the Walking Dead you should also accept the followup proposition that what these companies need are not visionary CEOs but pragmatic ones less Steve the visionary and more Larry the Liquidator a person with limited ambitions and a readiness to preside over the dismantling of an enterprise Unfortunately if you are such a CEO and your life were made into a movie the odds of which are low you will be played by Danny DeVito and not Ashton Kutcher but there is always a price for doing the right thing The debate about what Ms Mayer should or could have done at Yahoo is a subtext to the other great debate about buybacks at US companies and especially those at tech titans like IBM and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Rather than wringing our hands about how these buybacks are leading to less investment at these companies we should be relieved that the companies have moved past the denial phase and are dealing with the reality of aging If I were to offer advice to the board in keeping with the gambling theme created by betting the farm I would suggest that they listen to this Kenny Rogers tune It is time get past the denial and sell Yahoos operating business while there still is a business to sell To get the best possible price on the deal I would suggest the following Rather than talk about Yahoos businesses its search engine advertising which will draw the attention of potential buyers to the operating statistics which are a downer talk about the number of Yahoo users the billion that you have overall and the million who use Yahoo Mail Look for a buyer with an ambitious CEO ie with a Steve Jobs syndrome who wants to bet the farm and pay a premium price using shareholder money for stardom Taking a cue from the gambling business it is much better to be the taker of big bets than the maker of these bets The cash from that sale and perhaps even the rest of the cash balance should be returned to stockholders leaving Yahoo as a holding company with Yahoo Japan and Alibaba as its holdings The tax consequences of selling these holdings will be substantial and the board should remove the resulting market discount by announcing its intent to continue to run Yahoo as a holding company a closedend fund with two holdings As a stockholder in Yahoo I can live with that since I am getting Alibaba and Yahoo Japan at a significant discount on their traded value as can be seen below even assuming that Yahoo gives away its operating assets for nothing Towards the end of my post on Yahoo from last year I suggested that my returns on the stock would be inversely proportional to Ms Mayers ambitions and argued that my bestcase scenario would be one where she scaled the number of employees in the firm down to one herself and acquired two computer displays one of which would deliver realtime price quotes on Alibaba and the other the latest price of Yahoo Japan If the board acts to sell Yahoos operating assets we may be closer to that vision than I ever thought I would get If this is the end game I am thankful that while Ms Mayer did show flashes of ambition as revealed in her acquisitions with the Tumblr deal being the largest over the last three years she did not bet the farm on an outlandishly large acquisition or investment Perhaps I am giving her more credit than I should and the only reason she showed restraint is because she could not find a taxadvantaged way to get rid of Yahoos investments in Yahoo Japan and Alibaba If so this may be one of the few times that I am thankful to the IRS for not allowing the transaction to go through since on its completion Yahoo would have ended up with billion in cash and I shudder to think of how much damage a bet the farm CEO could have done with that
