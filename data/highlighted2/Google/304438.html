After Jeff Bezos went on a spending spree to build fulfillment houses investors got concerned However last year was an incredible year of the stock Amazon proved that their low margin business model was working and working well Today well talk about why Amazon climbed last year and why I believe we can expect to see further incredible gains on AMZN this year So lets get right to it Learn how to trade smarter today risk free Find winning trades in minutes In late investors began to give up on AMZN The reality is that the low margin business model the company was involved in hadnt yet proved to be profitable While Amazon was losing money Bezos was spending it However his spending has proved to pay off In the beginning of AMZN produced an earnings report that finally showed positive figures for earnings per share This started a frenzy of buying with regard to the stock driving the value up in a big way However that wasnt the end of the growth As the year passed more and more good news One big piece of this news was AWS During the same earnings release where Amazon proved to be profitable they also gave investors the first bit of information with regard to Amazon Web Services By that point the low cost cloud service had already grown to be a company that was worth billion This helped to excite investors further However thats not all In mid we started to hear more and more about Amazon Prime I will admit that when I first looked into Prime I couldnt for the life of me understand how the service was profitable Amazon Prime members pay per year for the service In exchange for their payment members receive free day shipping on many products in the online retailers catalog On top of free day shipping members have access to free streaming video and more So at first glance its hard to understand where the profitability is However surveys showed that a massive amount of Prime members spend at least per year on orders from Amazons website That is quite a bit of money considering the massive amount of Prime members that are out there Discover the secret to uncovering the most profitable stocks There are several reasons to be bullish on Amazon However I believe that there are main driving forces that will send AMZN over the top this year AWS Amazon Web Service continues to grow in popularity In fact Im using it my clients are using it even my cousin is using it Because of the massive growth in popularity we can expect to see strong revenue out of the service throughout the year Amazon Prime Amazon Prime continues to grow in a big way In fact it was recently estimated that Prime has around million users around the world and that the number is rising fast This is because of the revolving door that Prime creates Consumers sign up to get free shipping on products In turn businesses offer Prime products to attract the consumers looking for free shipping Because more Prime products become available more consumers sign up and the door spins round and round Ultimately Prime is a major driver for Amazon Infrastructure What Amazon has this year that it didnt have last year is infrastructure Due to the big spending AMZN was doing in late Amazon now has several fulfillment houses throughout the United States and around the world Because of this Amazon now ships faster than just about any other online retailer This will help the company to maintain its leadership role throughout the year and continue to grow Where do you think AMZN is headed moving forward and why Let us know your opinion in the comments below Buy AMZN Stock from Modest
