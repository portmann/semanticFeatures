music IoS software continues to be a differentiator with map likely to become the next catalyst Apple NASDAQ AAPL held its WWDC where the company announced updates on iOS Mac OS Apple Music Apple Watch Apple Pay and app store stats While the focus remains in enhancing the AAPL ecosystem there was nothing particularly new or compelling for me to believe that AAPL has a differentiated product vs the existing products on the markets People could argue that AAPLs ability to integrate all the services into a single device is the key differentiator that drives a sustained virtuous cycle but I remain skeptical to that fact due to the longterm commoditization of the hardware and the replication of software To make my point <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL can essentially compete headon against AAPL in terms of product Nexus hardware and service ie payment map mobile OS apps The only thing that keeps AAPL users engaged is its early mover advantage into the ecosystem concept an advantage that will likely diminish over time Things to focus on the iOS improvement on Siri and Proactive gives the iPhone a nearterm advantage in terms of user experience but I question the sustainability of this the improved map is another building block for AAPL to eventually roll out more maprelated services such as selfdriving cars locationbased advertising and OO Apple Music is interesting and shows how large technology companies can venture into businesses as they wish and compete headon against the incumbents Consensus believes that Apple Music has no edge over the rivals I differ in that I believe AAPLs edge is that its already has an install base that just needs a bit of incentive to adopt the program iOS improvement is a plus iOS improvement was reasonable on Siriproactive payment and maps Siri currently handles over a bn requests per week and AAPL aims to make this faster and accurate from the prior version Handsfree voice search will likely be the future as users can seamlessly request info from the personal assistant to get the more relevant answer Additionally Proactive is an interesting predictive feature that will learn the users behaviors over time Customization is a key differentiator for any service and I think AAPL has a nearterm advantage As for Siri GOOG Now has been improving at its own pace and as both a Nexus and iPhone user I can argue that GOOG often times exceeds that of AAPL However GOOG still needs to make its device more predictive an area that AAPL has an edge Besides Siri and Predictive analytics AAPLs continued focus will be important as it expands into onlinetooffline and locationbased transactions In my view the update to the Apple Map is further evidence that AAPL is laying the groundwork for maporiented businesses According AAPL Apple Map has x higher usage than the next leading map app and gets bn maps per week The updated map has better accuracy on public transit info such as optimal access to the train and departure time in each station Over time we could see additional features from the Coherent acquisition by improving the maps accuracy and venture into selfdriving cars that requires high precision GPS to navigate the roads The notion of AAPL introducing a car is controversial but AAPL is no stranger when it comes to disrupting the conventional industry As for the timing of an Apple Car it is contingent upon how much faith AAPL has in its own map software In the longterm AAPL could move into mobile advertising as the locationbased ad and OO trend catches on in North America The map usage disclosed by AAPL implies high engagement levels of its own map and it is a logical step for AAPL to allow small business owners to advertise via search results push notification locationbased advertising andor locationbased promotion As part of the transaction loop local merchants would advertise on Apple Maps regarding a promotion the user pays via Apple Pay and close the transaction with either a pickup or shipment to home AAPL at the end can generate both payment and ad revenue as a result Apple musics selling point of customization and specially curated music sounds interesting Many people within the investment community do not have any faith in AAPLs music and how it differentiates from Spotify and Pandora NYSE P but that is not the point The point is that AAPL once again proven that it can go into any business it wants While I agree that Apple Music lacks material differentiation the service already has an installment base via the iPhone thats waiting to be signed onto the service because Apple users want to integrate everything they have onto the iOS ecosystem I have often argued against AAPL in that the iPhone lacks material differentiation against the highend Android devices from Huawei Xiaomi LG and Samsung but iPhone sales remain strong and AAPL can continue to attract users with minor changes to the device ie larger display AAPLs capability of moving into any business is concerning Pandoras stock price drop in recent days reflects this market concern With a loyal iPhone user base AAPL could disrupt the conventional business such as wireless services similar to that of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Wireless Under that scenario AAPL could bundle music streaming with its wireless service to gain higher penetration more than that of GOOG This could further strengthen the iOS ecosystem as its hardware footprint contracts and this is exactly what AAPL needs because new sources of revenue will come from app and service sales AAPLs WWDC was a mixed bag While nothing materially new was introduced the building blocks that AAPL is launching could become critical to the
