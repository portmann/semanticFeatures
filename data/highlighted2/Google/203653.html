China shrink over time Current macroeconomic instability in China impacts lowend local vendors Market saturation expected to push Chinese consumers to seek premium devices for the next upgrades Over the last couple of years many new smartphone OEMs have come into our lives offering highend devices for low prices Manufacturers that were completely anonymous before like Huawei Xiaomi OnePlus and Meizu became wellknown brands and have competed fearlessly with Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Samsung OTCSSNLF In an article published in November I described how Xiaomi one of the rising stars of the Chinese OEMs is trying to challenge Apple in every segment of the consumer electronics market One of the main factors in Xiaomis success is its low operating costs which allow the company to run successfully with razorthin margins This strategy is of course not unique to Xiaomi and most of the other Chinese OEMs are trying to do the same generate fragile margins from every phone sold that is just enough for a small profit In large volumes when the economy grows this model can work perfectly fine however when the global macroeconomic stability is tested and the growth of the Chinese market slows down many of the Chinese OEMs may not survive Tier Largest vendors with exceptional market share or worldwide presence like Xiaomi Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY Huawei Asus HTC OTCHTCXF ZTE OTCPKZTCOF etc Tier Midlevel vendors that are available globally but dont have an exceptional market share like Meizu OnePlus CoolPad etc Tier Small unknown vendors mostly active in mainland China like THL Nanho Feipu Yestel etc As shown in chart below three vendors from tier have an exceptional worldwide market share and they are the principal players that can theoretically take market share from Apple and Samsung Xiaomi Huawei and Lenovo currently account for of the global smartphone market Assuming that at least of the others are Chinese vendors the Chinese OEMs account for around onethird of the market which is very close to the combined portion of Apple and Samsung However while Apples and Samsungs combined share constitutes only two vendors that each control a significant market share the Chinese OEMs share constitutes dozens of players from the three tiers The slowdown in China lowers the demand and consequently the volume of shipment in the local Chinese market If the global unrest continues the consumers outside of China will rethink about upgrading their current devices In a recent report Gartner presented a firsttime decline in smart phone sales in China assessing the drop at per year Gartner explains that decline China has reached saturation its phone market is essentially driven by replacement with fewer firsttime buyers Beyond the lowerend phone segment the appeal of premium smart phones will be key for vendors to attract upgrades and to maintain or grow their market share in China As the Chinese smart phone market has ended its massive growth and reached a plateau OEMs of premium devices such as Apple Samsung and the Chinese tier players will compete for the crown In the long run the total smart phone market is poised to slower growth as stated by IDC in its recent Q smart phone report The firm forecasts that the YoY growth in total smart phone shipments is going to decline from in to in which is a sharp drop from the in The share of the Chinese market also drops from in to in which reflects the decrease in demand by Chinese consumers for new smartphones as also described by Gartner These changes in the Chinese smartphone market and globally will have significant implications on all the players in the market As described in the reports above by IDC and Gartner demand for new smartphones in China reached a plateau and was expected to decline over time As most consumers already own their first phone it now becomes a game of upgrading and refreshing current devices In this battle premium vendors can attract customers by new highend most advanced phones while lowend vendors can offer attractive prices The Chinese tier players could also attract more customers to their premium devices The problems start at tier and tier players Tier vendors are all small and unknown mainly selling their products to the local market in China As the demand for new smartphones is about to decline over the next five years they are the first ones to experience real damage If the current decline in China continues most of these vendors will not be able to stand behind their lowcost model and will have to either merge or close down As many of the tier providers use whitelabel designs with tiny adjustments it is unlikely that they will merge together or be acquired by a tier vendor that has its own branded lowend devices Most tier vendors are likely to disappear in the long run leaving only a few to offer lowend and extremely lowcost phones Tier vendors are a different thing as these vendors are rising stars in the global smartphone market and are making their first steps in the big league It is very likely that these vendors will experience difficulties in the shortterm but will be able to stabilize in the long run As these vendors are in the middle of massive investments to go global they are significantly hurt by the current slowdown and the Chinese smartphone market trend As shown in chart below there are only two main foreign players in Chinas smartphone market Apple and Samsung Other leading brands like Sony NYSE SNE Nokia NYSE NOK Nexus by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL etc have a really small market share if any at all Apple and Samsung are the big winners of the smartphone market saturation and the current slowdown in China These two rivals cannot compete with the prices that tier players offer in the Chinese market even Samsung lowend devices are not comparable in price Their strengths emanate from highend premium offering and a strong international brand They can use this to their advantage over the tier companies when the smartphone market shifts to revolve around features and technology instead of price using leadingedge innovative technology to capture a larger share of the market As mentioned above in the short term the tier players will be impacted by the current slowdown in the Chinese economy and most of the vendors will probably disappear Even though Apple and Samsung do not compete with these OEMs directly they pressure the market down in terms of price and phone quality Once most of these players are out of the market coupled with the market saturation and decreased sales of new smartphones the game will shift into Apple and Samsungs playground of innovation and quality As most of the leading Chinese vendors have reached their maximum available share in the Chinese market they are looking to expand globally Meizu OnePlus ZTE Huawei Lenovo and Xiaomi are all working to strengthen their global presence and each has a different issue to cope with OEMs that will not be able to expand globally fast enough and survive the current macroeconomic situation in China will disappear and leave more room for Apple and Samsung to take over The worldwide smartphone market is experiencing a decline in growth mainly due to a saturation status in the Chinese market Forecasts estimate that the worldwide smartphone sales will grow slower than they used to and sales in the Chinese smartphone market are expected to decline over the years These changes in the smartphone market together with the current economic slowdown in China will impact most of the Chinese OEMs While some of these OEMs will not survive the shortterm difficulties and some may struggle to expand globally Apple and Samsung are not exposed to these risks As most of the Chinese firsttime phone buyers already purchased smartphones the Chinese market shifts to a game of features and technology to attract consumers to upgrade their devices When moving to compete over features and technology innovation Apple and Samsung have a distinct advantage on most of the Chinese OEMs This in my eyes makes Apple and Samsung very compelling investments
