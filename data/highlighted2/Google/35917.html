banned from the site Remember MySpace No You are not the only one apparently nobody else does even though it did sell for a token price to a greater fool Of course both of these social networks are dead and buried with Facebook gleefully dancing on their grave a Facebook or rather FB which went public on May A curious date we should note because as we showed on that very day the underwriters decided to go public just as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Trends showed interest in Facebook was at its very peak So where are we now It depends who you ask On one hand according to the company and the way it counts eyeballs pardon Monthly Active Users things have never been better with some billion MAUs of which million in just the US and Canada or more than the entire employed population in those two nations What about earnings Well there too it depends which accountant you ask one who believes that GAAP earnings matter and that sharebased compensation whose proceeds are all too real and allow employees to buy any number of GDPboosting products and services is actually an item that should be counted toward ones bottom line Or that they shouldnt But the reason one cant help but wonder just how much of FBs users are merely robotic autoclicks andor originate at various clickfarms somewhere in Asia is that taking the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Trends chart posted above and refreshing it as of today reveals something troubling That something is whether despite the companys loud protests to the contrary that Facebooks peak has come and gone and what remains is the MySpaceFriendster inevitable supernova as Facebooks easily distracted users go on to cooler newer venues Luckily there is an easy way to find out if the company folds and admits the growth cycle is finished and begins to repurchase its own shares courtesy of one of the few largely pristine balance sheets remaining then it may be time to log off for good Wed nope years ago if someone asked you to publicly post your personal pictures location interests and relations what would you have said FB is sooooo centrally planned Wed johngaltfla Lets see I quit Fraudbook when the ownership decided that tasting Obamas bunghole was more important than providing something necessary or relevant to the internet discussion If I want friends and to talk to them we meet at a bar and do it in person From afar we talk via telephone Fraudbook is the losers way of hyping up their lifestyles and opinions for family and friends to create phony likes and hunt the nation for other freaks like themselves Wed El Vaquero I havent logged into facefuck for probably years now Maybe It is BS And if you post anything publically it is fair game for the FBI and the local cops Wed Supernova Born Wed El Vaquero In the sense that even anything on here is fair game yes But at least they have to come up with some justification and lie to use it and you can use that to trip them up Wed crisrose Wed Squid Viscous good stuff but why would youjoin to begin with never got that self gratification I Have friends Yay look at me Wed drink or die Wed JenkinsLane Wed centerline Wed centerline So when things REALLY get tough for FB how bad are they going to screw thier customers by selling them up a river for the personal data they thought was private At the end of day all FB is about is ads and datamininglifestyle mapping Wed radiobomb Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Select Comfort Corp SCSS Q EPS USD vs Exp USD Graco Inc GGG Q EPS
