execution of their mobile platform had five specific steps to achieve their goal and bring about a strong revenue stream I believe GoPros execution of its media division looks a lot like Facebooks execution of mobile and thats a good thing This has worked out well for Facebook its income and subsequently its stock leading me to believe that this execution strategy can be effective If I had continued the title of this article I would have appended and thats good to the end of it Thats because I see similarities in a strategy that worked for Facebook NASDAQ FB and one that is being played out within GoPro NASDAQ GPRO This is important because Facebooks success could portend the same for GoPro if it is indeed following the same strategy in its media division Facebook was faced with a situation before and during its IPO They had generated no revenue from mobile to that point and it was contested that they would not have an easy time doing so What soon followed however was this concentrated effort to create revenue from their mobile platform There were a few steps Facebook took in doing this as it wasnt a flip of a switch and voila there was revenue As a matter of fact I see several key fundamental steps that carried the strategy to completion These steps were Strategic acquisitions to expand their footprint andor gain technology assets Putting the above steps together to work towards the goal of generating income This of course is a basic version of the execution model but it shows that there are notable steps involved with pushing for a vision a vision that can become a dominant source of revenue in a company something that Facebook has done very well with mobile It requires managements keen understanding of the situation the problem and requires methodical follow through on the execution With that said I am seeing a very similar execution model being played out within GoPro right now for their media division During and shortly after the IPO of the company last June management discussed its intentions of building into a media company Again just like Facebook critics and analysts said they would have a hard time doing this as they are a hardware only company Nick Woodman said this is a natural extension of the company and that this is where they are headed He identified the goal and began working towards it step one Step two fell into place not longer after these events GoPro announced in November of last year that they hired Zander Lurie to be the senior VP of media To further solidify this move Zander had this to say about his new role This company has grown its business significantly on its own and through distribution across YouTube and Facebook Im being brought on to continue that and to figure out ultimately a monetization strategy More recently we have the latest hire to the GoPro management team and that is former Hulu exec Charlotte Koh Koh is going to be leading the features and series team of GoPro This team will work closely with studios and networks to work on original content unscripted at first but scripted as a possibility down the road These two prominent hires dont even include any of the talent they have hired for the media division in order to fill the teams under these execs This is clearly a big check mark for GoPro with step two undeniably so by looking at their current job postings This is also something Ive used in the past to indicate the direction the company was headed Step three is managements vision for the long term prospects of their media outfit This has been apparent in their partnership with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and the VR content that they have been able to work on This vision is clearly as much forward thinking as it is presently in action This shows that management is focused on staying ahead of the new content types in order to always provide the latest content delivery technology while still pushing the current media technology Step four has been effectively managed through acquisitions such as Kolor which provides degree spherical video content Ill even throw the many partnerships that GoPro has established this year into this step as it has allowed them to spread their media through many different channels Some of which include their partnerships with the NHL ESPN Xbox Vislink for their live broadcasting of media Marriot Hotels NASDAQ MAR Virgin America NASDAQ VA Roku and Vessel All of these combine to support the notion of acquiring talent and technology and in the media sense a way of acquiring outlets for the business The final step as I outlined with Facebook is bringing these steps together to produce the result of revenue and income I believe this is where GoPro is right now With the vision well established and the talent and management of that talent in place this allows all the moving parts to sync up and work towards monetization of this division At this point GoPro needs to continue to execute the model and bring all of these mechanisms together All the tools are in place and the check boxes clearly marked off What remains is patience on the part of investors and diligence on the part of management I believe the only thing more important than the strategy itself are the results it produces If the results are not favorable then there is no use in enacting the strategy In Facebooks case however the results showed up on the top and bottom line and translated to a quadrupling of its stock price from its lows during mobile uncertainty to now where it is pushing the envelope even further To provide some color to this let me show you the following chart which outlines this time frame of the strategy in the form of growth I dont show this chart to say that GoPro will see the same exact results with the same amount of growth necessarily Could it happen Sure its plausible but the idea here is to compare the strategy and understand where it will bring the company For Facebook it translated very well into new products and a spike in revenue and income For GoPro it can take off into the same thing but it may take longer and it may be spread out over a stretch of time longer than Facebooks The point is that the execution strategy is successful and it produces favorable results Bringing it together GoPro finds itself in the situation Facebook found itself in not long ago where it formulated a strategy to create a new stream of profitability Not only did it bring Facebook to a new level but it opened up many other doors in its business and allowed revenues and products to expand Similarly GoPro is working through the same process and following the same execution model that Facebook successfully completed and continues to push GoPro is at the late stages of this strategy and they have all the pieces in place to emerge as a more diversified stronger company than they were just one year ago When the strategy reaches its final marks investors will reap the rewards in the form of revenue and income and will have ownership in an evolving company This food for though is great for formulating an investment theory as it compares two modern day companies one where it already implemented the strategy and is reaping the rewards while the other is on the same path with the same execution looking to reap similar rewards While each of the two companies produce different products in different fields the management of both companies have used the same strategy and one already has good results We wait to see what GoPros results will look like in this portion of their business but as Ive outlined it looks like a winning strategy is in place Source How GoPros Execution Looks Strangely Like Facebooks Disclosure I amwe are long GPRO
