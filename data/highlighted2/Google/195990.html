Reasons Im Avoiding Groupon Groupon Inc NASDAQGRPN Seeking Alpha Dave Dierking Get Smart Get Wealthy clicks While Groupon has been able to successfully grow revenue net income and margins remain essentially breakeven Groupon plans to expand its Groupon Goods and Groupon To Go food delivery services but these are already lower margin highly competitive spaces The company is in the midst of a corporate restructure that will result in jobs eliminated and a M charge associated with it Online deal maker Groupon NASDAQ GRPN has had a rough go of it almost since it IPOed in Since its peak that year the stock has dropped including a decline in alone What started out as a promising growth business has turned into a question of simply whether or not it will survive The daily deal business model was rapidly gaining popularity when the company went public but four years later the sector has lost its momentum and is no longer considered a rapid growth area With investors having taken such a beating its worth asking if the stock is one that should be avoided altogether or if theres still a chance for buylow investors to make some money Groupon I think is one of the few instances where you could make a compelling case for either side I fall more on the bear side of the argument but for those more optimistic about Groupon there is a case that could be made for buying at these levels The primary reason would be that for a company thats seen such a drop in its stock price the balance sheet doesnt look like its in all that bad shape Overall revenue hasnt been a problem for Groupon Since debuting publicly in the company has grown revenue from less than B to a projected B in Additionally expectations are for revenue growth of another in The composition of that revenue however has changed over time but Ill get to that in a little bit The company has no longterm debt to speak of on its balance sheet has consistently maintained at least B in cash on hand and has regularly generated somewhere between M and M in annual free cash flow From a pure financial point of view it appears that the company is in no imminent danger of disappearing but the overall state of the business is concerning Despite the relatively healthy balance sheet here are four reasons Im staying away from Groupon The composition of revenue is changing One of my biggest concerns is what exactly is driving revenue Groupon used to be a business driven by its daily deals Margins for those deals were high but that part of the business hasnt been demonstrating any real growth for some time now Groupon added its Goods line of business in order to add another revenue stream While that part of the business is showing some potential its margins are much lower making it that much more difficult to drive income to the bottom line My bigger worry with the Goods division is that sooner or later its going to run into the buzzsaw known as Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Amazon has been known to aggressively go after competitors it feels can get in its way Amazons decision to drop Apple NASDAQ AAPL TV and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Chromecast from its web store and the decision to launch Etsy NASDAQ ETSY competitor Homemade are just two examples Groupon isnt a real big competitor to Amazon but competing with the online giant in discounted retail goods generally doesnt end well What you end up with is a twopart business one with flatlining revenue and one that will likely end up getting crushed by Amazon Former CEO Andrew Mason said so himself earlier this year Hes been known to make bombastic comments but for this one I dont think hes off base At its core Groupon is a glorified coupon cutting business It offers discounts on a limited range of items and there is nothing really proprietary about the business There are a number of other similar business models out there right now including the aforementioned Amazon and the buzz that once surrounded the deep discount deal now seems to have largely faded away Unless Groupon can find some way to reinvent itself beyond what it currently is its difficult to see the company surviving over the long term Low margins and difficulty generating profit Despite revenue that continues to grow Groupon just hasnt been able to generate any type of margin or profit to go along with it Quarterly earnings have generally floated around the breakeven mark for much of the last three years Operating and profit margins are in roughly the same boat Last quarter was encouraging with the company posting a share profit although share of that came from the sale of Ticket Monster With the low margin business growing and the high margin business stagnating this is situation that Groupon could be in for a while Groupons corporate restructuring news has been well known for a while The company is eliminating around jobs and is shedding unprofitable assets particularly overseas to get things moving forward There will be a roughly M charge linked to the transaction to cover things like employee benefits and severance packages as well The problem here is that the company likely wont see any type of savings until next year and even then its not clear what type of return Groupon will see on these savings which it says will be reinvested back into the business Groupon plans on launching a food delivery service next but while that segment of the market is growing its also very crowded with businesses like Peapod GrubHub NYSE GRUB and not to sound like a broken record but Amazon already competing It feels like Groupon is one of those dotcom internet fads thats doomed to slowly die out The revenue growth story is encouraging however if the company is having difficulty generating a profit on that revenue growth and its chosen new growth markets are areas that are already heavily competitive Im just not feeling a sense of optimism for Groupons future I believe that Groupon is a company that may stick around for a while longer but wont have a significant presence in the marketplace going forward We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We
