what they hoped the tech media would notice Instead it was about taking a big bold and deliberate step into declaring itself a commerce platform by expanding the number of apps they can tax to just about anything as long as it comes with a subscription initiated from within the app itself This piece will give you important insight that hasnt been covered about Apples NASDAQ AAPL developer announcement last week So keep reading I promise it will be worth it But we have to get into the right frame of mind and for that we must first visit Sweden Stockholm is one of my favorite cities in the world and has become a real FinTech innovation hub Stockholm is the largest city in the small country of Sweden thats famous for a few other things too charming and beautiful people long dark winters short but amazing summers generous government and social benefits and having one of the most progressive tax systems in the world Swedens highest marginal tax rate is percent which most people actually pay since that rate applies to all income over times the average Swedish income In US dollars anyone earning more than a year would pay that top rate Theres a capital gains tax of percent too and a sales tax of percent Can you feel the Swedish Bern Given that a fair chunk of the million people living in Sweden turn over nearly percent of their paycheck to the government youd think that theyd feel much the same way about their taxing authority the Skatteverket as we in the US feel about the IRS pure and simple hatred But nothing could be further from the truth In fact the word skatte means treasure I wont mention what some have suggested the letters IRS stand for The reason that the Swedes actually do seem to treasure their taxing authority is because they are so very easy to do business with Anything that triggers an opportunity to levy a tax or track income that can be taxed they already know about and therefore make it easy to pay up And this is all according to the official site of Sweden that goes into great detail about how the Swedes have managed to pull off the ultimate confidence trick Having a baby it says When its born parents register it with the Skatteverket that issues a personal identity number Every move that little bundle of joy makes is now tracked for life The Skatteverket also gets to weigh in on the name of that new little munchkin too Ever wonder why youve never met a Swede named River Apple or North in Sweden Now you know When it comes time to get married they say that the Skatteverket will decide if you can eg you arent a deadbeat or owe any back taxes Moving They say that the friendly tax authority must need to know within a week At death the doctor who pronounces the dearly departed must file a form with the Skatteverket before a funeral or cremation can happen It seems that in Sweden taxes happen first and important life events second And if you think that you can sneak around and use cash to avoid those friendly tax collectors knowing all of your business surprise In Sweden cash is practically outlawed Its cash usage is among the lowest in the world because its truly inconvenient to get and to use And if you do manage to pay cash at a cash register well thats linked to guess who Now since the Skatteverket is totally and percent up to speed on whats happening with the Swedish citizens life in and outside of work when it comes to paying taxes they make that easy too sending a completed tax form ready for signature to its happy and well satisfied taxpaying customers Since most Swedish citizens cant avoid paying their fair share the Skatteverkets mission is to at least make them feel good about doing it by delivering the highest levels of customer service at every turn After all its hard to really begrudge someone whos taking almost all of your money when theyre just so darn nice and helpful while doing it Apple and its latest announcement related to developer fees for subscriptions has taken a page out of the Skatteverkets playbook All of the tech media just gushed last week that Apple has done the most amaaaaazzzzzzing thing ever theyve given developers a raise by giving up percent of their cut Instead of taking percent of their revenue on subscriptions effective this fall theyll take only percent after the recurring subscription has been in place for a year Apple says that it has expanded the ability for developers to offer subscriptions for any app category now In addition to subscriptions for digital content newspapers streaming music or other digital content any developer with any app can now enable a subscription program using one of the permutations of subscription price points and programs that Apple will permit under their rules Apples app categories are massive health education productivity travel food and drink and shopping The pot of gold at the end of that recurring subscription rainbow will be that developers get to take home percent of the take in the first year and percent every year that the subscription remains active after that Developers Apple acknowledges really have it tough Its hard to get the attention of consumers in an apps store that now has million apps to choose from Apple is working hard to help developers out to stand out in a store that has become incredibly popular Developers can now pay to be featured and apps will be easier to find Apple also acknowledges that most consumers only use a couple dozen apps regularly or semiregularly even if theyve downloaded more than on their home screens Subscriptions Apple says are a way for developers to make their apps sticky and banish the free trials that rarely lead to revenue and for those developer revenue engines to hum because they can market those services in the app store And in the face of slowing device sales to help close Apples revenue deficit Heres the real deal about what went down last week Apple says that details are forthcoming so no one knows how this will really shake out but reading the website straight up Apples announcement didnt seem to be only about making friends with developers even though perhaps just maybe thats what they hoped the tech media would notice Instead as I see it it was also and more importantly about taking a big bold and deliberate step into declaring itself a commerce platform by expanding the number of apps they can tax to just about anything from digital media to products to enterprise apps to you name it as long as it comes with a subscription initiated from within the app itself And about extending the tax to any app that happens to have a recurring subscription revenue stream By the way I really dont mean to be a smart aleck with the term tax but it sounds so good In fact Apple is charging developers a commission for marketing their stuff through their fabulous app store So feel free to replace commission with tax where you see it from now on or not Apple isnt hiding this either Right smack on the Apple Developer website they make it very clear that any and all app categories now can offer subscriptions inside the app any category If thats true then Dollar Shave Club The Honest Company BarkBox Birchbox Trunk Club Stitch Fix Weight Watchers Jenny Craig Blue Apron PetFlow and the slew of consumer apps in the apps store that now offer subscriptions this percent tax is for you for the first year if your consumers activate those subscriptions within the app Consumer research supports that fact that theres a percent churn every month on subscriptions and that most consumers cancel after three months Im quite sure that Apple has those data too otherwise theyd do like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL did and make the low cut available to subscriptions from Day But why give away percent when you can advertise that you will but not have to deliver much Its sort of like extending an invitation to your crazy Uncle to spend Fathers Day with you when you know hell never make the trip You still get the goodwill and family brownie points for making the offer Apple also implies when the new subscription program rolls out that existing subscriptions that have been in place for a year will also begin getting taxed at the low low postfirst year rate of percent One report that I saw suggested that anything in place as of June and renews would be eligible for this new percent tax All current subscriptions are eligible it says on the site So Dollar Shave Club The Honest Company BarkBox Birchbox Blue Apron PetFlow and the slew of apps in the apps store that have subscriptions initiated in the app and that have been active for a year if they are still active this fall this percent tax looks like it could also be for you And Im pretty sure when Apple says they are eligible they dont mean if you really want us to take percent we will it is more like the Skatteverket telling Swedes theyre eligible to pay a marginal tax rate But thats chump change when compared to where the real opportunity for Apple really lies the enterprise and SMB app subscription market Apples courtship of the enterprise market isnt just about devices its about getting developers to write apps for those devices Its partnership with IBM NYSE IBM in has already produced a bunch of them Its partnership with SAP NYSE SAP this past May is intended to do that same thing SAP has K customers and more than M SAAS subscribers worldwide according to an article in CIO and designed to reach the million developers who are part of SAPs developer community Tim Cook told reporters when the partnership was announced that percent of business transactions touch SAP systems On the SMB side there are apps galore intended to streamline and make more efficient the operations of a small business whether its basic sales and CRM management tools or more specific industry functionality Depending on how the subscription activations happen in app or on the web Apple might be able to back up that percent revenue truck to those enterprise SaaS apps since most of those apps that are part of business operations dont have the churn that consumer apps do and dump that revenue straight to Apples bottom line But all you developers that today enable subscriptions for your SaaSbased services and pay zero dont feel bad You will get paid Apple says when you didnt used to for all of the time and work it takes to keep those apps up to date Oh you kept those apps up to date anyway And didnt have to pay anything to Apple As long as youre in Apples app store thats all that really should matter to you now Apple will also make it as easy as the Swedish Skatteverket to pay your fair share Theyll just take it each time the subscription payment is made by the consumer or the business Apples rules so that they can collect the tax is that all of these subscriptions have to be run through iTunes You say that now you are able to ask the customer for their name and email address and have them attach their favorite method of payment to the subscription Starting this fall when this program rolls out if the program parameters work the way they do today in the digital content world apps with subscriptions activated inside of the app will have those subscriptions attached to an iTunes account Apple is in payments processing not because it wants to be or even likes being in payments but because it wants an easy and percent rock solid way of being paid the commissions on the apps that are in the apps store And so many of you laughed when I wrote the Apple Tax Man Cometh a few weeks ago But I think that this may be the first shot across that apps store tax bow As Ive written Apples bottom line needs some love The developer feeslashing love that was uncharacteristically announced in advance of WWDC is an interesting way to deflect what those experts in device features and functions say is the real news the release of the iPhone wont be all that exciting Analysts predict that total iPhone sales for will be down MingChi Kuo dubbed the most accurate Apple analyst out there projects iPhone sales to drop to between million and million in against shipments of million He doesnt think that iPhone will have many attractive selling features and wont do much to push consumers to upgrade the phone That means that Apple therefore has no choice but to find other ways to pay the bills and expanding the types of apps that are subject to the or split is one of those ways Subscription commerce is an interesting choice since as Ive mentioned its where the action is on both the consumer and enterprise side of the world Its tough to find accurate information on the size of the subscription economy but Zuoras CEO was quoted in that if only percent of the companies in the world shifted half of the revenues to subscriptions that subscription commerce would be a billion market he obviously believes that it is much more He also said in that there were million businesses using SaaSbased services at that time As the CEO of the largest player subscription commerce enabler out there hes in a good position to be reading and reporting on those tea leaves The bottom line is this at least as I read my own tea leaves Apple needs to prop up its revenue from sagging device sales Taking a cut of app sales has been part of Apples DNA since Day Announcing a cut to subscription fees while expanding what is subject to their fees is is step one to two big potential moves One expanding the scope of whats taxed to more apps maybe even all apps Apples announcement of subscription fees to all apps category if we take them at their word is a big big move that was blunted by reducing the take to percent but now on a much larger base Moving to tax all apps really wouldnt be much of a stretch or certain categories in the app store like transportation and the tax wouldnt have to be percent either Asking Uber Private UBER for a percent take each time a ride was booked via the app would be quite the payday And what choice would Uber have to pay given its dependence on the app store and the iPhone to support its business Two wresting control of payments by moving everyone to iTunes Want to know how Apple may be thinking of igniting Apple Pay By using the power of its app store and requiring the use of iTunes and Apple Pay for those consumers to conduct commerce We all did it willingly when we wanted to download music and later subscribe to Apple Music didnt we Hey listen Apple provides an amazing platform that has spawned commerce in ways that we might have never imagined But lets put Apples announcement in the proper context monetizing the app store Long live the mobile browser It may be to the iPhone and the app store what cash is in most countries except Sweden Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Technology Personal Computers </div></body></html>
