A second driving force has been the BYOD movement initiated by smartphones and the related choose your own device options.All this has been driven by the halo effect of the iOS devices.Statistics Brain reports that 75% of personal computers sold are to businesses, so expansion here is necessary if Mac sales are to continue to grow.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Gartner Research has just released Preliminary Worldwide PC Sales report which notes that overall sales fell 9.5%. (Uncertainty) </span>Apple is not listed in the top five globally.No figure for Mac sales is given, but it obviously must be below fifth place Acer Group's (OTC: ACEYY ) 4.558 million units.For U.S. sales, Gartner keeps Apple in fourth place, just behind Lenovo Group (OTCPK: LNVGY ), assigning 1.992 million to the Macs for a drop in U.S. sales of 2.5%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Competing research group IDC has similar numbers overall, but differs greatly in their Mac estimates. (Uncertainty) </span>They recently released the 2Q15 Worldwide Quarterly PC Tracker data.This puts them in the number four spot, edging out Acer by just over a full percentage point (7.8% to 6.6%) (with ASUSTeK (OTC: ASUUY ) at 6.5% considered a tie with Acer).Apple remains well behind Dell here, but has advanced significantly over the past year.Apple increased from a 5.9% share to 7.8%, while Dell has increased only slightly, from 14.0% to 14.5%.In the year ago Q2, Dell produced well over twice the number of units as did Apple (10.5 million vs. 4.4 million), but this year only 86% more (9.6 million vs. 5.1 million).In the U.S. market, IDC has Apple in third place, maintaining an edge over Lenovo for third place, 13.5% to 12.7% (2.21 to 2.08 million units).Of the major players, only Apple and Lenovo saw unit growth in the region.All others saw sales drop.Fortune's Philip Elmer-DeWitt compiled a list of Mac estimates for analysts, both professional and independent, 23 in all, and the composite estimate was 4.8 million units (range: 4.5 to 5.2).Note that this figure would make Apple number 4 on Gartner's list, ahead of both ASUS and Acer, just as for IDC.So which research firm is correct in its analysis?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Aside from being an Apple optimist, I believe there is good reason to think that IDC is closer to the truth of the situation for several reasons. (Uncertainty) </span>First however, an argument against IDC can be made that if a rising tide raises all boats, then a falling tide lowers all as well.Thus, why shouldn't Apple's sales also be shrinking as the PC market as a whole slows?The problem here is the reason for the current slump.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>IDC's press release is titled: PC Market Continues to Decline Ahead of Windows 10 Release If the market declines in anticipation of Windows 10, then it would only be the Windows PC market to decline. (Uncertainty) </span>It should not affect Mac sales at all.Second, the current trend for Apple is up, and historically, calendar Q2 has had higher sales than Q1.In fact, since 2002, there has been only one year (2013) when this has not been the case.Last year, the quarterly increase was 6.7%, and the year over year increase was 17.6%.This makes IDC's numbers look much more reasonable.(Note, calendar Q1 has always been down after the big holiday quarter.)The data shows that the trailing twelve months unit sales is constantly going up, an impressive 15.6% from CQ1-14 to CQ1-15.There is no reason to expect this to change anytime soon.In the near term we should have conflicting reports.While Mac numbers should continue to rise, it is expected that competitor numbers will surge even more with the release of Windows 10 by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ).Nevertheless, moving forward, we expect a healthy second half as inventory and purchase decisions pick up following the launch of Windows 10.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This will push Apple down in the rankings somewhat as other manufacturers gain some overall share and may lead to a quarter or two in which Mac sales growth lags the industry as a whole. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This assumes, of course, that Windows 10 is greeted favorably, and there are no major problems. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the other hand, given that Microsoft's new OS will be a free upgrade for consumers, the buying pressure may be less than otherwise would be expected. (Uncertainty) </span>In any case, after a couple of quarters, I think we will return to the trend of Apple growing faster than the overall PC market.We should see a return to Apple slowly, but inexorably, gaining market share.I see no real reason for a change in this anytime soon.There are several driving factors.First, the consumer base is increasing as several countries such as China and India are rapidly growing the middle class.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In these countries Apple products are regarded very favorably, sometimes as status symbols. (Uncertainty) </span>While many cannot afford anything other than low end Windows machines, many are moving into a position to afford them.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Today the differences between the two operating systems are less important. (Uncertainty) </span>So much work is done on the web which is OS agnostic.Many major apps are available for the Mac, from MS Office to AutoCAD, there is a lot more compatibility than before.For companies that must have Windows to run legacy systems, this can be done effectively on a Mac via Boot Camp or virtualization.This is particularly true for those who only need occasional access to these systems.With tools such as Casper Suite from JAMF Software, Macs are as easy to manage in an enterprise environment as are WinPCs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>JAMF writes : We help commercial, education and government organizations succeed with the Apple platformï¿½ By providing a simple, flexible and scalable framework to work within, the Casper Suite helps IT admins maintain, update and ensure their fleet of Apple devices are running at optimal performance. (Uncertainty) </span>The iPad is by far the most used tablet in business.Along with the iPhone, it is helping to overcome the resistance of older IT personnel who have long scorned anything Apple.Many millennials have grown up with Apple products and prefer them.They will bring them into the work environment or request them.5 - The IBM (NYSE: IBM ) partnership The partnership with IBM (see detailed analysis ) is aimed at mobile, but the Mac is there under the radar.I'm sure that IBM will be promoting Macs to some degree or other.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Eventually, it may move to officially represent the Macintosh line. (Uncertainty) </span>In a more ephemeral line, I think that the investor should not dismiss the importance of the credibility that IBM gives to Macs in the enterprise.Few companies are regarded with such respect as IBM, at least in major enterprise circles.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The fact that the salesforce for the MobileFirst initiative may be coming in with MacBooks will alone speak volumes to the executives. (Uncertainty) </span>In corporate IT there's a decades-long prejudice against anything Apple that's still held by many.The Mac was seriously viewed by some as a "not a real computer" and disparaged as "toy" by people who did not really know what a general purpose computer is (from a technical definition, at least).At 9.7% of revenue last quarter, Macs continue to lose their former dominance of Apple's revenue source to the iPhone.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That said, over $5 billion of revenue in a quarter is nothing to sneeze at and it is important for a company to not depend completely on one product. (Uncertainty) </span>Macs have another importance to Apple that will keep them around for a long time.The computer is the real anchor for the ecosystem.It is true that Apple mobile devices work with Windows computers, but Mac OSX is the one with which special features such as Handoff work exclusively.It is the best companion for iOS devices and the only computer OS-controlled by Apple.To begin with, we need to admit that Mac computers have higher price points than do other PCs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now if you try to compare two computers with similar hardware specifications, then you will find that the difference is usually less than many detractors argue. (Uncertainty) </span>You will not find a $300 Windows PC that meets the specs of a new MacBook Air at $899.Still, there are many millions of people in this world who can barely afford a used low end PC, and for them Mac prices are totally out of range.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>(It should be noted that in countries with a high value added tax, the cost difference is expanded significantly.) (Uncertainty) </span>Yet, as noted above, businesses account for 75% of computer sales and businesses are less price sensitive, especially if they can be convinced of long-term benefits such as longer life, lower support cost, lower maintenance and easier learning curve.I would argue that as time passes the Mac will be perceived as being more or less equivalent to a WinPC, as long as specialized legacy programs are not a dominant use.If this is the case, then the Mac becomes just another PC option, with the potential of being cheaper to support long term.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If this mind set takes hold, then Apple could conceivably move to the number two or even number one spot in the manufacturing list. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As we can see from IDC's chart, Apple picked up almost two percentage points, year over year. (Uncertainty) </span>(click to enlarge) If you look at trailing twelve month total Mac sales for CQ1-15 vs. CQ1-14 (20.0, 17.3) ( chart ) you see a 16% growth rate.If you project this out, in five years, the rate would be 40 million units per year, double what it is now.If worldwide sales were to be at 320 million units per year, then this would still only be 12.5% market share.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In fact, I think it is quite possible that the 16% growth may be conservative. (Uncertainty) </span>The factors listed above should drive continued market share growth.This is particularly true in the enterprise.Here, Apple can be considered entering a brand new market with very little current penetration.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Growth could be exponential. (Uncertainty) </span>At Hewlett Packard's (NYSE: HPQ ) share of 18%, Apple would be selling 58 million Macs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At this rate, and assuming a slight decrease in ASP from $1,231 to $1,150, this would give revenues of about $67 billion, three times what it is today. (Uncertainty) </span>Some people will object that this is ridiculous, but all of Apple revenue for 2004 was just $16 billion, who would have thought that today it would be the largest company in the world (by market cap).So one big take away is that it does not really matter what the exact number of Macs are sold for this quarter.Whether Apple hits 5.1 million or just the street average of 4.8 million, the strong growth trend is still holding, and this is encouraging for a real positive impact on future earnings.Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
