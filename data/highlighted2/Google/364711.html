#A9E2F3'>Google </span>is unlikely to be able to buy Yahoos business Economic efficiency concerns suggest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>should be allowed to buy Yahoo Ive mentioned here before that I think that the US has its position on antitrust antimonopoly law wrong and that this could use changing The current shopping around of Yahoos NASDAQ YHOO core business underlines this point For the people who would do most to improve the business in terms of economic efficiency <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL or have we all started calling them Alphabet yet are precisely the people that antitrust law is likely to ban from doing so This points up our conflict within this system of regulation we dont like monopoly because of the inefficiencies that result but here were not going to allow efficiency by not allowing monopoly We need to square this circle somehow The way to do that is by changing the antitrust rules Its a standard criticism of monopolies that they use that market power to gouge consumers Here in internet advertising the consumers are the people who are buying the ads of course a nice example of the Nobel Laureate Jean Tiroles work on dual sided markets that other side being the provision of the content which brings the eyeballs the advertisers are paying to show stuff to So if we allow that market of selling ads to become too concentrated we think that advertisers might get ripped off All of which is entirely fine but the issue here is a little more complex Because we can see that one likely bidder Verizon NYSE VZ would indeed be bringing economic efficiency to the table Any buyer including a private equity firm could cut about jobs on top of the Yahoo has pledged to eliminate by years end and reap savings that add about million to the cores value Peck said A company such as Verizon thats in the Internet and telecommunications business and already has staffing and infrastructure for functions such as management administration and sales could slash around percent of the workforce adding about billion in value to the core Peck said Being able to produce the same output with fewer people is exactly the very definition of economic efficiency And we like economic efficiency and so allow them to bid But what holds for Verizon holds even more strongly for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>The same could be true of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>which Bloomberg said is mulling a bid Imagine if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>took its substantial ad prowess and applied it to Yahoos content and audience eliminating a lesser rival in the process But for those precise reasons <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>would likely face stiff scrutiny from antitrust regulators who have eyed the company suspiciously in the past said Kimmelman Thats a huge antitrust issue he said There would be an enormous red flag And theres our problem We can see the combination of Yahoos internet properties with Googles advertising prowess would be hugely economically efficient Given that that is so we would also therefore expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>to be the highest bidder at least some of those efficiency gains would go to current Yahoo shareholders which we generally think to be a good thing But thats also the one bidder most likely to be blocked on those competition and antitrust grounds And the two companies have been barred from even cooperating before now let alone one owning the other All of which leads to the same point I made in that earlier article Which is that we should be changing our definitions of monopoly Currently we simply look at market shares If theyre high we shout monopoly and do something about it But we almost certainly shouldnt be doing that For what should concern us is not market share or position but the ability to exploit that That is we shouldnt be measuring the action or no action decision by market share but by how contestable said market share is That is not are there competitors today but would competitors arise if that market share that monopoly was being exploited The answer here is that in internet advertising theres more potential competition than anyone could shake a stick at If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>starts ripping off advertisers there will very soon be people stealing that advertising from them Theres no shortage of capital out there for new such businesses And theres no shortage of companies that would love to get their fangs into Googles hide Thus we should conclude and I certainly do that if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>were to try to exploit its market position then competition would arise That is whatever Googles position it is contestable And thus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>should be allowed to bid for Yahoo In terms of actually trading on this I doubt very much that my analysis is going to change US law Thus I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>to be barred to the point that they might not bother to bid at all leaving Verizon as my most likely candidate for the winner Good for Verizon stock and bad for Yahoo for I would expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>if it were allowed to bid to offer rather more simply because it would gain more economic efficiency Disclosure
