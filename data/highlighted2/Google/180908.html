their turf GoPros CEO explicitly stated that this talk is drama and that he is very happy working in San Mateo not Cupertino realizing the vision GoPro has Not only is GoPro not in talks with Apple or anyone for that matter but Nick Woodman believes that Apple is not even exploring or investing in GoPro like devices There has been much talk and fussing about GoPros NASDAQ GPRO relatively cheap valuation and how it makes it a prime target for acquisition But thats not all Wall Street analysts as well as investors have been using their loud outlets to say that Apple NASDAQ AAPL will or at least should buy GoPro Some say just cause Others say Apple will either acquire GoPro or destroy it by entering the market I was never under the impression or false hope for that matter that Apple would buy GoPro I was even much less under the impression that GoPro would actually want to be bought No I havent even thought that the company needs to be bought in order to save its stock price GoPro went public to raise capital to further develop their company and to acquire others Both of which they have accomplished and will continue to accomplish They dont need anyone to buy them to further their vision They are doing quite well on their own On Tuesday GoPro CEO Nick Woodman was interviewed by TechCrunch at their Disrupt conference and was asked these kinds of questions Moderator Matt Burns asked the questions that others read analysts were simply willing to answer themselves apparently But I dont get my facts from analysts latest soap opera I listen to the guy in charge When asked How would you feel about working out of an office in Cupertino Nick simply smiled paused and then answered You guys just love the drama When the interviewer continued and said that Apple is exploring building action cameras Nick quickly and assertively said I dont think Apple is exploring building GoProlike devices while also adding that the action camerais a subset of what GoPro does To directly answer the question about an Apple takeover Nick said Im very happy working in San Mateo realizing the vision weve got for GoPro Of course San Mateo being where GoPro is headquartered and Cupertino where Apple calls home I think I can take what Nick is saying with some weight because he has been in many meetings with Apple over the years according to him In fact he spoke directly to this point in a Forbes interview and says he has met with Tim Cook and said theres zero reason to believe those guys are developing a GoPro competitor The Disrupt chat continued to touch on this assertion from Nick that he really doesnt believe Apple is exploring or investing in GoProlike devices He knows that there is going to be talk about dream synergies with various companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Apple and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT But he believes that this allows these companies to bring different things to the table He went on to say that they all have their initiatives and focuses Those focuses are different for each company Apple making an action camera or better expressed as a life capture solution according to Nick is not something that I contend resonates with the Apple brand To be honest its about as resonating as a search engine making an eyeglass headset Further in Nick discussed the topic about how its not easy for a company to change direction or focus According to him and his knowledge of the major platform players its not easy to just jump into a different market even by way of an acquisition He equated these big businesses to big aircraft carriers they take a long time to move He continued by saying that each company is focused on their own core business and he is happy that Apple and GoPro are able to integrate their two ecosystems to help GoPro customers of course from his perspective So there you have it analysts Apple fans GPRO investors and whoever else may have been hoping or demanding an Apple takeover of GoPro It aint happening Sure you can dispute the exploring of GoProlike devices and say no one really knows Well good Then you dont either Stop saying it Following the logic that Apple could do anything means that any electronic consumer company is in trouble But they arent are they Just because Apple can make something doesnt mean they will and doesnt mean it will necessarily gain traction Does this make me popular among Apple investors and followers Probably not Heck it probably doesnt make me popular with some of the GoPro bulls looking for a takeover But let the reality speak for itself Apple and GoPro have partnered to provide an outlet to buy GoPro capture devices and for Apple to utilize the app on their watch and other accessories They are using each others brand and focus to stimulate their own respective marketing Hearing this interview with Nick puts a nail in the coffin of any takeovers of the company Im glad that we can move on from this as uncertainty and fantasy are not ways to invest This news should actually be good for the company and stock because it means they are strong enough and have enough organic resources to accomplish their vision on their own Talent doesnt seem to be an issue brand is not an issue and money is surely not as their top and bottom lines have skyrocketed Hoping for something and actually looking at the facts and words from management are two different things Invest with facts not the fantasy some would have you believe Not only that but use the facts in the way they are intended Dont attempt to make
