investors perception of the company by segregating the operating results of their Services segment from the hardware business Increased transparency will allow investors to appreciate and value the tremendous growth dynamics of this segment driven by AAPLs huge and captive installed base Potential increase in value of the share price resulting from such a financial segregation has already been evident in other tech companies GOOG Alphabet AMZN AWS MSFT New reporting segments Financial reorganization will allow this segment to be valued in line with peers unlocking the persistent undervaluation that AAPL currently trades at QCM believes that AAPL can achieve a share price in excess of per share by pursuing this move in combination with the capital return program and various growth catalysts QUARZ CAPITAL ISSUES OPEN LETTER TO TIM COOK CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF APPLE NASDAQ AAPL We applaud you and the entire Apple Inc the Company Apple or AAPL team for another year of record profitability It is truly remarkable that the installed base of Apple products currently exceeds million and continues to expand as Apple increases its market share in all of its key geographic markets With the launch of new products and entry into powerful new service categories we look forward to Apples strong sales momentum to sustain into As a long term shareholder of Apple we could not be more supportive of your leadership and the team at Apple We welcome the capital return program and also share your excitement that Apples best years lie ahead However we doubt that growth opportunities and capital return policy will be sufficient in fully unlocking the substantial discount that Apples stock currently trades at We view that the key reasons for the persistent undervaluation of Apples stock are that the investment community has a fundamentally misguided perception of Apple as purely a hardware business and Apple managements failure in effectively addressing this issue Most investors do not give enough credit and neglect the rapidly emerging Software Services SS business and the compelling ecosystem that Apple has been successfully building The main purpose of our letter is to urge and convince you and the board that now is the time that Apple takes the decisive step to positively reshape the investment communitys perception of the company by more clearly and in detail segregating the operating results of the Software Services segment from the rest of the business We view the current consolidated reporting approach of the financial results as the main cause of why Apple SS is continually valued as a hardware instead of a software business As the majority of the cost base in the consolidated financials is from the hardware segment it is nearly impossible to understand the financial details such as margin development costs and return on capital of the SS segment Discerning the health of this segment has also been a tedious and roundabout process with analysts scouring Apples press releases conference calls and events to put together different and often incomplete pieces of information on the segment Put together it is challenging if not impossible to accurately value this segment as a standalone entity in the current reporting structure The appropriate valuation of SS will be critical to valuing Apple in its entirety While a significant proportion of Apples profit is still contributed by the hardware segment we believe that Apples next leg of growth will be increasingly led and dominated by SS This is driven by The massive and growing installed base of Apple device users New product platforms and services and most importantly Hundreds of thousands of Apple App and Software developers globally who are pushing the boundaries of development and bringing their latest and greatest works to the Apple Ecosystem The impressive ramp up of Apple Music Pay and enterprise software further affirms our bullish view that AAPL SS is at the dawn of a multiyear growth cycle and that Apple has no shortage of growth opportunities to pursue in this segment With the split out of the operating results of SS from the hardware segment we view that investors will better appreciate and value the tremendous growth dynamics and rich margins of the different SS product lines such as iTunes App Store Apple Music Apple Pay enterprise offerings and future new service offerings The potential increase in value of the share price resulting from a more transparent financial reporting and reorganization has already been evident in tech companies such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG Alphabet Amazon NASDAQ AMZN AWS and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT New reporting segments when they undertook similar steps to provide clearer financial information on key revenue segments to their investors Our evaluation of the different product lines within the SS segment indicates a conservative valuation of billion or per share at a trading multiple of x PE E This is in line with trading valuations of similar size software and internet peers We would argue that AAPLs SS business deserves a much higher valuation multiple due to numerous growth catalysts and resilient revenue attributed to the captive and growing user installed base Together with the cash value of per share and per share for the hardware business at a valuation of x PE E in line with the SP we believe that Apples share is easily worth in excess of providing investors with an excellent upside potential in excess of after this move We view that the argument for not providing greater granularity of financial information to prevent competitive harm is without merit Firstly there are no comparable competitors as Apple designs and produces the product platforms which these SS are delivered over Secondly Apples strategy has always been to offer unparalleled and differentiated products and services that redefine the industry instead of through price competition We have shared with you our strong conviction of Apples future growth trajectory Most importantly we hope that we have impressed on you and the board the compelling need for Apple to clearly segregate the operating results of the Software and Services segment from the rest of its business We believe that Apple SS is at the onset of a multiyear structural growth cycle By reporting SS as just another segment within the broader scope of an investor perceived Hardware Company only serves to undermine the value of this business Splitting out the operating results of the Software Services segment combined with the various growth catalysts and a continued capital return program can potentially deliver an upside of to Apples share price yielding an attractive return to long term shareholders Apple Hardware We forecast revenue growth of resulting in a total revenue of billion in FY Revenue growth rate of individual product lines namely iPhone iPad Mac and Other Products are projected to be respectively We see Net Income for this segment to increase by in FY to billion The tremendous growth in Other Product category is driven by the full year consolidation of Apple Watch sales and the launch of Apple TV The faster growth rate of the bottom line in FY is attributed to our estimate that iPhone margins will improve in FY due to the S cycle We also expect iPad margins to improve slightly due to higher iPad Pros ASP and the continuing sale of existing iPad models Apple Software Services After modest growth of in FY we forecast strong revenue growth of to billion in FY We expect Net Income growth to trend higher at yielding a Net Income contribution of billion o App Store We estimate this unit to comprise of SSs sales in FY With the addition of new product platforms such as Apple Watch Apple TV iPad Pro and strong China sales we forecast revenue to grow at in FY exceeding FY growth rate of o Apple Music Apple Music currently has million subscribers since it was launched in EndJune We expect subscriber count to grow to an average of million in FY with an ASP of yearuser including family memberships We project revenue of billion from Apple Music in FY o Apple Pay We are bullish that Apple Pay will build its dominant market share versus other mobile payment alternatives due to critical security advantages of Apple devices With the systematic roll out of Apple Pay in both the US and internationally and increase in penetration rate of NFC enabled POS Point of Sales we project that Apple Pay will increase its share of retail transaction in the US and Europe to and respectively in FY We forecast a revenue of million for this unit in FY o iTunes Store We estimate iTunes to comprise of SSs sales in FY We forecast negative revenue growth of in FY as healthy sales growth in video content is offset by lower pay per download music sales Share buyback We forecast that Apple will execute billion of share buyback in FY at an average price of per share buying back million shares Average shares outstanding We estimate that Apples average diluted share count will be at billion in FY after factoring in the share buyback program Net Cash Flow We project that FY net cash flow to be billion in FY after the deduction of billion for Capex and billion for the share buyback program Net Cash We project net cash balance to be billion after applying to the entire cash balance to account for tax effect on international cash repatriation THIS LETTER CONTAINS OUR CURRENT VIEWS ON THE VALUE OF APPLE INCs
