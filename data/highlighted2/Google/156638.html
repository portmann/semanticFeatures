ET About Apple Inc AAPL By Jason Aycock SA News Editor Apple NASDAQ AAPL is adding to what looks to be a growing automatedcar expert team hiring away a senior engineer from Tesla Reuters notes in combing through LinkedIn profiles Jamie Carlsons profile shows hes left Tesla for an unnamed position in a special projects group at Apple Reuters says noting six others with a background in selfdriving technology have recently joined Apple Carlson is one of a number of Tesla hires described earlier this year as a poaching war This year Apple has hired former Volkswagen engineer Megan McClain as well as Vinay Palakkode graduate researcher at Carnegie Mellon a hub for automated driving research Last week The Guardian wrote that Apple has hundreds of engineers quietly working on autonomous technologies in California Other reports have Apple hiring people with related experience from several automakers including BMW Volkswagen Ford Fiat Chrysler and MercedesBenz as well as from suppliers such as Robert Bosch TRW and Delphi Automotive Apple should just pull the trigger and buy Tesla Stick to Chevy products you may know about them BUT buying thar dog Tesla would be a disaster That dog has never been in the black and maybe you should by the stock since you are one of us taxpayers that have been subsidizing Elon Musks folly Lol See above reply Lol denotes humor Funny stuff way for tesla to get to Apple evaluation Ha ha Anyhow taxpayers have subsidized many auto companies more GM Chrysler even ford took billion Old news Toyota took a billion loan too So not sure you have looked at the numbers Tax credits Every EV maker gets the credit Im sure there stock like all the highfliers will soon fall on hard times However I hope they dont self destruct What they are doing is inspiring and it really could be a decent start to great things It would be extremely sad if the electric car was killed again as its fairly viable at least at a certain price point The stock will go to about a share market cap of about billion then maybe Apple or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>will buy Tesla If Apple can pay billion for Dr Dre and beats And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>can buy Nest for billion Tesla is a steal at billion I think Apple buying TSLA would be mostly likely a Phoenix event with a lot of Teslarian ash in evidence during the rebirth they cant even sell a watch or come up with a tv or sell ipads let alone a car the only thing this company has is a marketing team that sells phones Thehash There is zero chance Apple is going to come out with a car AAPL has struggled on execution for relatively simple devices and services The day Apple launches an autonomous car is the day I sell all my shares There is literally no synergy with their existing product lines tons of liability to the brand and very poor margin potential However I suspect that they are not interested in building cars as much as they are interested in controlling the increasingly important infotainment system of the car which further strengthens their product ecosystem and provides additional revenue streams both from the automaker and then the end user Who knows if these secretive efforts will ever come to fruition There are dozens of nameless projects being pursued at Apple that will never see the light of day There is literally no synergy with their existing product lines tons of liability to the brand and very poor margin potential There is literally no truth to this assertion An autonomous car with Internet access is an ideal place to work and play with Apple products has tons of halo value for the brand and has very high margin potential for the company that gets it right Lots of people would like a chauffeur that never gets tired they are interested in controlling the increasingly important infotainment system of the car I agree with your middle paragraph However Apple has always tried to have a part of their product line cater to the luxury crowds with their high margins It wouldnt surprise me to see Apple team up with BMW to create a luxury car for the iWatch demographic A small line expensive sells out in every iteration That kind of thing I commute hours a day in a car If my car can drive me around Id probably be watching tv movies listening to music putting together documents or presentations I wonder if theres a company that would allow me to do all these things using one operating system Kush I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>will give you your wish within years But would not count on AAPL Just does not fit with AAPL IMHO Whoops forgot to quality I would want a quality self driving car Not a cheap Chinese car with android thrown in So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>would not be likely Glen with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>car one might be kidnapped by hackers and taken to the cleaners Not everybodys dream but hey for the budget adventurous consumers it is quite a match Glen Rivard it wont take years and there will most probably be more than one company offering their complete solution before Regarding autonomous driving this short video minutes httpbitlyUYKFvh sums up where things currently stand although it doesnt clearly show just how far ahead of the pack <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>really is To see how far ahead <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>is take a look at this minute video which is now more than a year old and still more impressive than what current car manufacturers are showing off or have someone start a company like UBER without the car part the person drives your car for hr you pay day or K pm for working days or K an year Not bad when compared to buying a K car with an apple logo that would look like a fruit cake on a car or help selling a lot of Teslas so Elon the snake oil salesman can move on to the tube and you will get what you want TSLA advise lowering buy stop on X short position taken at be lowerred to Also stay with put position bought at We are still the most profitable advisor on SEup I travel a lot and often drive rentals its not uncommon to receive a completely new car yet I still feel relived when I get in and find something as simple as an USBport Same goes for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>I dont think that their goal is to buildsell cars Rather license the techsoftware years ago I would never have guessed the car industry to be disrupted by companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Apple but today I think TSLA GOOGL and AAPL are absolutely perfect for the job and the future of transportation cant arrive fast enough but I dont expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>or Apple to start building their own GigaFactories it will be through a form of collaborations with other companies In Manhattan in the s a police officer stationed in a tower manually changed the traffic signal from green to red at busy intersections based on his observations If he saw a particularly important person on his way to work he might allow the light to stay green a little longer We forget that when cars were new it took a while to understand how to use them how to control them and how to drive them We cant help but be short sighted when we think about what it means to have a selfdriving car But almost all our assumptions will be wrong There will be this period where they share the road with normal cars like motor cars shared the road with horse drawn buggies and wagons in the teens and s and into the s in some parts of the country But eventually we will realize the full benefit of having autonomously mobile vehicles moving around Cargo will transport itself Parents will not have to drop the kids off at soccer practice Bus routes will comport to realtime demand The buses themselves will be electric and unmanned overseen by a supervisor at the depot This will reduce cost and usher in an era of practical and convenient mass transit Autonomous cabs will automatically pick up business travelers and take them to their meetings because our watches coordinate with the cabs where we are and where we want to be When we hear selfdriving car we look at the family car and imagine riding around without having to grab the wheel But it will be so much more than that What Apple brings to the selfdriving car project is the understanding that you have to tear down the notion of a car and start over Each element has to exist for a reason not because of some legacy design What Apple brings to the selfdriving car project is the understanding that you have to tear down the notion of a car and start over Tesla brings that too Reason from first principles is a stated principle of their corporate culture and comes from Elon Musk Can you really think of a car with an Apple Logo on the Front But with Beats they kept the Name They could come Up with Cars with a decent margin but it would somehow still be a political statement to push the Electric car movement the Environmental cause which can only be Environmentally friendly when electricity is Not coming from burning coal anymore I doubt an Apple car Not ever happening in our lives Insurance companies will never allow it due to liability Its just a way for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Apple to grab headlines and try to drive stock price If you believe its a good bet then I have a Pinto you can have People dont have any idea whats cool or innovative until someone comes and slaps the world in the face with it As far as the car AAPL has a giant cash horde and has to stay on the cutting edge of innovation The company knows how to make money Anymore if someone comes out with something and the success isnt instantaneous the product is deemed a failure but nothing ventured nothing gained I dont think were too far off from vehicles with an autonomous or self driving option Have too much at the pub hit home and avoid the ticketjail ETF Screener Search and
