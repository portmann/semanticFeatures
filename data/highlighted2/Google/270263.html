banned from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site This weekend the force was strong with thirty and forty and fifty yearolds wishing to awaken memories of their youthful days with an admirable redo of the first Star Wars movie first released nearly years ago But the force has never been stronger with Disney which is expected to rake in a recordbreaking million in opening weekend box office sales in the US and Canada and a nearrecord million overseas a grand total of well over half a billion around the globe That is just the beginning of an epic annuity created by Disney under director JJ Abrams As the WSJ notes Star Wars The Force Awakens isnt just a hit but the spark Disney needs for years of sequels toys videogames television series themepark attractions and more that it is planning or already producing Although it has been a decade since the last Star Wars movie Disney and Mr Abrams has to revive a franchise that has been largely dormant since the release of Return of the Jedi in A trio of prequelsproduced by thenindependent Lucasfilm between and and directed by George Lucasperformed well financially but were largely scorned by fans who considered them inferior to the original trilogy However with the new Star Wars Disney has a sure hit on its hands and the only question is just how far will it go The Star Wars sequel easily routed the prior record for a domestic movie opening of million set by Jurassic World in June and caps the Top of biggest weekend boxoffices all attained in recent years by fantasyfiction films ranging from Iron Man to the original Avengers and its Age of Ultron sequel The movie also set new opening weekend records in the UK Germany Australia Russia and other countries It wasnt a smash hit everywhere though and produced less than sensational ticket sales in countries such as Brazil Japan and Mexico while it underperformed in South Korea where a more popular local film also was released at the same time Still the only reason the Star Wars sequel may have failed to achieve the biggest international opening of all time is because it has yet to open in China the Chinese release is delayed to January next year as all quota slots for imported movies are taken for this year How did the watching public react to the movie According to Dow Jones there was little disappointment with US moviegoers giving it an average grade of A according to market research firm CinemaScore mirroring its very strong reviews and boding well for wordof mouth On Friday of the audience was male but by Saturday that percentage dropped to as the fanboydriven early crowds started to broaden said Dave Hollis executive vice president of distribution at Disneys movie studio Seeing the way younger audiences and women are responding bodes really well for the future of the franchise Mr Hollis said The Force Awakens was designed to emulate the original in style and substance It returned stars Harrison Ford Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill to their original roles and introduced a new cast of Jedi Knights storm troopers and imperial officers led by Daisy Ridley and John Boyega Coming out of a screening at the TCL Chinese Theater in Los Angeles stayathome mother Jessica Sisoer who had waited in line days with other hardcore fans said the new movie felt like going home because it reminded her so much of the original trilogy Among the factors that will determine if it rivals the alltime global boxoffice record of billion held by Avatar is whether strong wordofmouth draws infrequent moviegoers how many times fans return to theaters to watch again The biggest question mark however is how the movie will perform in China the worlds second biggest movie market where Star Wars isnt well known because the original trilogy was never released there As DJN adds the film which cost a little over million to produce is now poised to gross well over billion and could go much higher particularly with people expected to take time off from work during the holidays And yet despite the movie euphoria Disney stock tumbled on Friday closing down at the days lows following a surprising downgrade by BTIGs Rich Greenfield who downgraded DIS stock from Neutral to Sell on Friday lobbing a price target with the thesis that Disney management made a fundamental mistake by overpaying for sports rights based on overly aggressive multichannel video subscriber projections Not only did Disney overpay for individual sports rights packages they also acquired too many sports rights in an effort to prevent new competitors such as Fox Sports and NBC Sports from growing stronger As a result we believe Disneys cable network profitability will meaningfully underperform investor expectations with cable networks representing of Disneys segment operating income We are now estimating that Disneys FY cable network operating income will be DOWN yearoveryear with total Disney FY operating income flat Not even expectations of record global box office receipts by Star Wars were enough to appears Greenfield While we believe the strength of Star Wars Episode VII The Force Awakens estimated at bn in global box office will lead to Disney modestly exceeding consensus expectations for fiscal Sept earnings we now believe consensus earnings are too high for FY and far too high for FY We believe if Star Wars Episode VII does not exceed billion in worldwide box office revenue Disney will miss our FY and consensus earnings estimates as well Given that we now expect Disney EPS growth to slow dramatically and miss current Street consensus EPS expectations in both FY and FY we believe its current multiple is unwarranted We are now forecasting EPS growth of just in FY and in FY In turn we are reducing our rating on Disney to SELL from Neutral with a oneyear price target Our oneyear price target is based on a PE of x FY which also equates to x FY Disney is currently trading at x FY x FY and x FY based on our estimates In March with Disney shares at we downgraded the stock from Buy to Neutral link nearly five years after we put a Buy on the stock Our downgrade was based on the view that even though consensus EPS expectations still needed to move higher Disney shares were approaching full value Despite a temporary correction in August Disney shares have continued to climb higher since our March downgrade having notably outperformed their media industry peers over the past year and currently sitting just below their alltime peak of We believe Disneys outperformance has been driven by film slate excitement most notably Star Wars Episode VII The Force Awakens which opened last night despite increasing concerns facing Disneys cable network franchise The conclusion FadetheForce Downgrade to SELL with Price Target In other words not even world records may be enough for a stock priced beyond record perfection and a very forlorn looking Luke Skywalker better have something big up his sleeves for when the next sequel Episode VIII is due Sun Soul Glow Everybody spent their Christmas bonus money on a hour experience popcorn and D glasses and some rich asshole board members at Disney along with some rich asshole actors get a half billion dollars Sun Overfed Phantom Menace sucked noodles Attack of the Clones was OK The third one was so unremarkable that I cant even remember its exact title So why in the actual fuck would this Disney PC shit break records Sun NoDebt Disneys problem isnt the new Star Wars movie Its their cable operations Theyre a mess and account for about half of their revenues Sun J S Bach The hype and anticipation for entertainment as trite as this is befitting of our terminally imbecilic nation A humorous white nationalist review of this politicallycorrectsuretobeOscarwinningmasterpiece can be found here Sun TahoeBilly Poor old Walt spinning in his grave after the Tribetm stole his dream out from under him <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>it it will make you cry Sun TeamDepends Sun Proctologist Im ashamed to admit I took the family to see it because my son is a fan We only do the movies times a year Sun dobermangang The sports bubble will start to burst as more and more people cut cable ESPN has lost over million subscribers in the last years Its only going to get worse Pro teams are basically subsidized by cable viewers that dont even watch the games Expect the masses to continue to cut cable Sun ebworthen The new film is soso it breaks no ground a features a recycled plot A superweapon capable of destroying planets is operational and fired to blast a pesky rebel planet into dust Alerted and spooked the rebels realize their precious base is NEXT and dispatch fighters to blow up the planet the weapon is based on but wait it HAS SHIELDS and so before the ONE VULNERABLE TARGET that when hit will blow up the planet can be blown up a team must infiltrate and get those shields down Theres a Empire defector that wants to abandon the Rebel Cause but he comes backshades of Han Solo Theres a scene where TIE Fighters are evaded by flying through metal superstructure Theres a scene in a Cantina filled with all sorts of crazy aliens Theres a new droid projecting critical information that it has sequestered this time a map Theres the Rebel command breathlessly counting down the minutes until the new superweapon is charged hoping for a miracle hoping for the shield to fall AND THE ONE ENGINEERING FLAW to go all explodey before they are incinerated At no point are ships launched nonessential personnel flown off planet or vital equipment relocated Nope well just sit here and hope The new Sith Lord cant fight and loses to an untrained proto Jedi But we dont see his body so hell be back All in all its literally nothing youve not seen before when it was done better Audience response was tepid a few aborted attempts at applause and the end was a few claps and dead silence I call bullshit on all the metoo breathless reviews Sun David DeGerolamo You are correct No wonder Lucas was upset with the script Anyone could have taken the first movies script made a few changes and waited for the people to put their money down This would be a great movie IF it was not just a remake Save your money and watch the first one The only winner in this movie is Mark Hamill I wonder how much money he received to turn around and not have even one piece of dialogue Sun DirkDiggler Great review RafterManFJ you need to coin a gimmick like thumbs up rotten tomatoes or something in the spirit of ZH perhaps you could say you give this movie a rating of two hung bankers out of Sun Casey Jones This pablum is what people care about most Getting the next saccharine tablet Bread and circuses cubed Not enough of the populous knows any history to see that this is the hallmark characteristic of a final stages empire I like this quote just learned on another ZH thread Sun NoDebt Overfed there were others before the prequel movies you are referring to and they were all better than the prequels The Emprie Strikes Back second of the three was particularly well done almost certainly the pinnacle of the series Watch those then tell me what sucks and what doesnt The original Star Wars came out in I suspect most on this board hadnt been born yet It changed everything Compared to other movies of its era it was both jawdropping and refreshing Even more so than the first time I heard Van Halen after suffering through the Disco era You knew shit would never be the same after that Sun Jack Burton I was alive to see the first one Yesterday I downloaded all in HD to my Video File Cloud service So being off work I watched all six the three newest in order and then the three oldest in order The three newer ones all sucked to a degree The whole thing was about chase scenes and Lazer Sword fights But the original three offered some real story line and The Empire Stikes Back even had some humor in it Great for kids Great for basement dwelling adults who play those video warcraft things For thinking adults there is not much here Dont bother I think little of most movies though a few good ones slip in every year It is in television that good drama is now home based I like UK mini series And some UK movies Sun sleigher I grew up on Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back Return of the Jedi was just a sight of what was to eventually come with the prequels Call me what you want I am no basement dwelling adult thats for sure Episode VII was excellent I still love the Star Wars movies and story Not everything has to be a deep intellectual experience Some things can just be fun This movie had all the things that made the originals great Sometimes its fun to NOT think and just enjoy yourself Sun o r c k I can remember the audience reaction It was indeed something new People walked out of the theatre like they had been drugged in a good way Sun knukles Thats right This is now a decent holiday splurge for the average family not on EBT etc Im serious Its the New Normal miniVacation Sun Croesus Darth Bernanke tried using the Force to juice the economy screwed it up worse and passed off the work to Jabba the Yellen Sun Perimetr The Star Wars Im waiting for is when we fck with Putin one more time and all hell breaks loose Then LA can watch all sorts of Tridents being launched well unless a real star is born about a mile above downtown Sun Dominus Ludificatio That wold be hours of visual and sonic torture I have never been able to stomach more than minutes of the original one on several attemots Sun knukles Sun ShortTheUS Sun NoDebt I know when I take a bite of this steak the Matrix is telling me it is juicy and delicious Sun JPM Hater Emulate my assthey just rewrote the fucking script for Star War Episode Sun Automatic Choke oh cmon it was only a copy of there were different twists and they played the old characters pretty well pretty intense overall ticket costs about the same a drink in your favorite bar definitely worth the to see it especially to do so before some jerk spoils the surprises for you edit wow downvotes no upvotes you guys are not fun people and im not inviting you to join me to go to the movies Sun JLee Sun TheFutureIsThePast Rehashing movies is what Hollywood does best Coming up with original ideas is hard now how else will they get the zombies to spend their money Sun JLee Speaking of Zombies I liked the Maze Runner as it was original but they ruined the second with basically a cheap plot device Zombies really Come on trillion in debt personal debt through the roof Obumercare now foreigners can buy the best farm lands food inflation shrinking work participation rate on and on perhaps we should all be out on the streets to show this corrupt government that we have had enough of what is left of the middle class on the street would get their attention Oh sorry that you are off to wallyworld to spend on your EBT card Except its all Happy Happy Joy Joy fantastic family film for the holidays bread and circus drivel blah blah blah blah Itll be missed by the commoners interspersed with dog rescues skiing stories from the Sierras and degree global warming golf days in DC followed by the nightly news close slamming a Republican Ah the Joys of Mass Media Sun SuperRay Looks to me like the neoliberal asshole college administrators at Oberlin awakened the force in some Asian dykes who actually believe all the propaganda theyve been spoon fed It aint McDonalds but Im lovin it Btw the force is such a powerful meme because we all sense it George tapped a powerful element in the human psyche Too bad it just destroyed so early in life Sun knukles Sun Squid Viscous the first Star Wars was kind of fun when I was what fucking adult losers get off on this nonsense Huxley would be proud of you it is hoped for and rumoured that Disney may release to
