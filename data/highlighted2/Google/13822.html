double in Microsoft will implement various features from one app to the next in hopes of building a stickier application ecosystem While the strategy has been used before its nice to see Microsoft integrate the marketing function into its apps With Windows set to be released this summer expectations are high for the upcoming OS Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT biggest selling point to app developers is its new software development kit intended to simplify the process of designing applications for Windows across all devices This universal application store is going to be a huge differentiator which is why I anticipate Microsofts upcoming OS to appeal to both backend developers and frontend users Admittedly application developers have focused most of their attention and time on Android and iOS However Microsoft will get some love from the app development community as the number of developers committing resources and time to Windows based apps is expected to double in according to Millennial Media This corresponds with what Microsoft said about its universal app ecosystem as the software development kit makes it easy for developers to scale apps across various screens ranging from consoles laptops desktops tablets and even smartphone devices Clearly winning the software development crowd by offering them tools and a bigger market of devices is setting the stage for Microsoft to reclaim some momentum in the consumer side of their business Microsoft also is repositioning their marketing to be more effective as indicated by the companys CMO Chris Capossela who presented the above diagram at an Atlanta tech conference So my second transformation agenda item for Microsoft is this notion of using our amazing innovation engineering resource pool to actually build marketing into our products Now when I say that I dont mean cheesy offensive marketing I mean building the products so they work beautifully together so that when you use one of our products it naturally leads you to using another one of our products Heres a piece of research we did that I realize is hard to absorb because its detailed but let me walk you through it The size of a circle is how many consumers use the product in the US in a short period of time that we measured it The arrows that connect the circle tell you that if you use product A youre statistically more likely to also use product B than the rest of the population that does not use product A Gold is Apples ecosystem purple is Googles ecosystem blue is Microsofts ecosystem Microsoft is integrating various features from different applications into other applications and is hoping for this linkage in features to be a form of marketing Facebook NASDAQ FB does this pretty effectively even as theyre unbundling the various features into separate applications while leaving the HTML version a fully comprehensive app that spans Facebooks various services By introducing users to one application and leaving other parts of the app unavailable until a separate download is made Facebook has been able to transition users across an ecosystem of apps associated with its social networkingmessenger business Both Apple NASDAQ AAPL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL are notorious for using similar strategies to draw users from one service to the next And quite frankly Apple has used its own network of apps to create a fulcrum point in which its able to integrate users across various devices and accounts This has put a rather robust moat around the consumer electronics business which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>has to compete with by creating their own ecosystem of services that work seamlessly with each other Needless to say each of the major app ecosystems have killerapps and eventually consumers started to demand the various ecosystem to make their apps available onto other operating systems Hence you see the Office Suite on Mac OS X YouTube on Windows and iOS While these apps are made available theyre not as good as the ones that are designed specifically for Android For example I found that when I was using my YouTube app on a Samsung OTCSSNLF Galaxy over an iPhone I could use my phone as a remote while accessing YouTube from my smart TV That added level of functionality comes from Android and YouTube integration into TVs Thats something Apple countered with by creating a box for a TV a la Apple TV Microsoft used the Xbox One to counter both Android and iOS by having a gaming device double as a multimedia device Microsoft is trying to build a more comprehensive suite of software that interacts with each other Microsoft will therefore utilize Skype Bing and Office as a way to play its cards into the integration of software in hopes of creating new use cases This is going to be a tough battle for Microsoft to win but the people at Microsoft at least acknowledge some of the challenges they will face going forward Despite the uncertainty shrouding FY results for Microsoft I still think its a conservative play on tech giving investors a fairly solid cushion during periods of volatility FY might not be a recordsetting year in terms of sales and earnings However I anticipate OSlicensing to show signs of recovery in FY Source Windows A Meaningful Catalyst To Microsofts Consumer Division
