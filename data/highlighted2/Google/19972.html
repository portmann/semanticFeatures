class='textDiv'>Microsoft Browser Benefits And The Age Of Windows Microsoft Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Dont underestimate the importance of a good web browser Although they dont directly drive revenue they are essential supplemental ecosystem pieces Microsoft is making a great move ditching Internet Explorer It should improve user experience search engine market share and residually ad revenue A couple of days ago an article was published talking about the most popular US web browsers as identified by the US Federal Government It was noteworthy as finally being some clear objective data regarding web browsers In doing research on this over the last four months weve come upon some different metrics to ponder but one theme is recurring Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT is losing web browser share to Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Chrome and Apples NASDAQ AAPL Safari Internet Explorer has been around basically since the beginning of the mainstream internet and while it has gone through many version changes and mutations it hasnt been until just the last years that its market share has started to noticeably slip It comes at an interesting time for Microsoft Under the guide of Satya Nadella MSFT is now a company focused on its cloud offering through Azure and expanding its signature Office line to different platforms and all devices We think its appropriate that under Nadella Internet Explorer finally heads toward retirement We think this is a move thats going to continue to help Microsoft which we believe is already moving in the right direction We like Microsoft as a multiyear longterm hold in any dividend portfolio Here well explain why we think IEs retirement is timely and why we like Microsoft as an investment Why are browsers important To investors they may not seem meaningful at all theyre not profit drivers they dont appears as a line item on giant companies PL so why care Theyre free and they serve just one function Browsers actually do generate some income actually Browsers make their money from advertising as well as by search royalties and market penetration Search royalties are when a search engine will pay a browser to make their engine the default In other words <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>will pay a kickback to companies that set its search engine as their default browser This article shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>kicked back billion of the billion it made from being the default search engine on Safari to Apple Microsoft probably does this for Bing as well Market penetration is the much bigger opportunity By getting a branded browser into your software ecosystem you are far more to buyuse the same companies other software and tools when working on other projects Namely because they work better For instance those who use Chrome are more likely to search on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and use things like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>docs Those who use Safari for instance may be more likely to buy an iPhone to duplicate the same browsing experience across several devices This can be summed up from points in this Computer World piece which stresses the importance of the ecosystem Purchase an iPhone for example and youre buying into the entire Apple ecosystem including operating systems apps addons music movies books and more The big money isnt in your single purchase but in encouraging you to purchase only products and services that interact with each other and your wallet With BYOD on the rise and our personal and professional lives becoming increasingly intermixed an individuals choice to buy into one of these ecosystems affects her business use and vice versa And while many of us function in two or more of these ecosystems others increasingly depend on a single system for both personal and business needs And supplemented by this Digital Trends article which notes the obvious all items within one ecosystem simply work better than mixing There are many advantages to going with a single ecosystem for your desktop PC laptop PC mobile phone and tablet Even game system and television in some cases Devices within that ecosystem are designed to work well with each other They sync easily so that preferences and media can be effortlessly copied or shared with multiple devices Applications may be universal meaning they require a single purchase to work on multiple devices at the same time And the user interfaces are usually similar or identical across devices With Microsofts push to try and get Bing on as many systems as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>a new browser thats desirable will help with this race This should speak to investors The search engine and the software pair nicely together Using the right search engine is a direct derivative of browser market share More people using your search engine translates directly into more ad revenue Forbes points out that Bing is gaining ground on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Its already a part of our lexicon and at that point its hard to do anything about market dominance when you search for something online its called Googling and as a culture weve practically forgotten that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>isnt the only player in web search But as we head deeper into it looks like Bing the longtime runnerup in online search volume might finally be catching up to the unquestioned leader As you can see here from the above mentioned study Chrome now leads the way in browsers Even worse for Microsoft is that only about half of those people using IE are even using the most recent version A new browser could help solve both of these problems It hasnt been that long since we wrote an article about Microsoft suggesting that the company purchase Opera and also suggesting that Internet Explorer was part of the problem not part of the solution for the new Microsoft We talked about the importance of getting their browser house back in order This was the conclusion we drew in late If Microsoft really wanted to do something worthwhile with this relationship theyd be letting Opera in as the new default browser for Windows based PCs and tablets as well The company has a chance to stop their declining market share in the browser world by putting out a much higher quality product than IE and I think Opera would be well received It would also allow the Nokia browsing experience to gel with that of the users home computers Microsoft wants one platform to rule them all Its going to be tough to do when the first thing consumers do after buying a Windows product is switch their browser to a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>product Naturally were happy to see progress on this front by the company even though we didnt get our Opera wish This article from The Verge details the new Spartan project While Microsoft has dropped hints that the Internet Explorer brand is going away the software maker has now confirmed that it will use a new name for its upcoming browser successor codenamed Project Spartan Speaking at Microsoft Convergence yesterday Microsofts marketing chief Chris Capossela revealed that the company is currently working on a new name and brand Were now researching what the new brand or the new name for our browser should be in Windows said Capossela Well continue to have Internet Explorer but well also have a new browser called Project Spartan which is codenamed Project Spartan We have to name the thing This is all a part of the bigger evolution picture for Microsoft A new browser in a new operating system is a move in the right direction We cant wait to see Windows mostly just to get rid of Windows In an earlier piece we wrote about why Windows failed to impress consumers and how the tile format of the OS works best on tablets only We critiqued that the company should focus more on a Windows like environment for those using their desktops when they produce the next version of Windows which is now considered long overdue Its now looking like Windows will combine both Windows and elements with a fresh new browser Recent news regarding Windows was that Microsoft will be making Windows a free upgrade The quote from the OS Chief was we think of Windows as a service This decision making conveniently comes months after Apple made a similar move when it launched its Mavericks operating system to the public If this wasnt the right thing to do in our opinion wed be giving Microsoft grief for yet another copycat move However we think Nadella and team have made the right decision in giving away Windows and updating the browser Loyal Windows users who have endured Windows deserve it The company stated last month that Windows users will get it for free during its first year of availability and that phone users also will be eligible for the upgrade We think that Windows and its browser is one of the biggest issues that Microsoft an otherwise well run company needs to face up to We also think its worth paying attention to if youre a Microsoft stockholder While its not likely to make a monetary impact few things that are free do it could make a much broader impact in how Microsoft is viewed in the technologycomputing field A successful launch of Windows could do big things for those invested in Microsoft The synergy between Windows and Xbox could help create a better all around user experience for those with more than one Microsoft product in their lives Again we digress back to the importance of the ecosystem of which the new browser is going to play a part As an investment we like MSFT for a longterm hold in a dividend portfolio Compared to the last year Microsoft now trades at a discount At with a yield of annually well gladly hold MSFT How does something as simple as changing a browser relate to holding MSFT over the longterm as a dividend stock The companys new browser gets Windows users on the same page The companys new browser replaces the failed Internet Explorer name The companys new browser will have Bing built into it Ad revenue generated from all three of the above contribute revenue to the companys DC Other segment DC Other comprising Resale including Windows Store Xbox Live transactions and Windows Phone Store search advertising display advertising Office Consumer comprising Office Home and Office Personal Studios comprising firstparty video games Mojang nonMicrosoft products sold in our retail stores and certain other consumer products and services not included in the categories above DC Other has been a segment that hasnt grown over the last year but for a bump last quarter due to Xbox One services Residual positive affects from a better browser mean people are more likely to choose the Windows OS across platforms Ad revenue and a more sustained customer base allow for continued growth and padding of the top line via a product refresh that continues to now fall off with IE Once the expenses of creating a new browser are paid off the top line DC Other should see nominal growth as a result of all of these and the new browser spurring growth Refreshing the top line with basic operating expenses postbeta testing etc should be a small part of the puzzle that helps drive profit Continued profit in this segment assuming others also continue growth means the company will likely continue on its streak of increasing its dividend Its modest forward PE of x its in cash per share and its tidy balance sheet all make MSFT a buy and hold candidate here while they get their Windows house in order Analyst estimates put earnings at At a fair x PE ratio on this number we get a share price we think we could easily see for Microsoft during if Windows helps the company grow search engine browser and operating system market share With a yield of and continuing growth we believe Microsoft is a great stock for buyandhold investors If they get their new browser and Windows right it could be a move that again spurs growth for the company
