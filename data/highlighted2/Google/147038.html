impressive quarter beating on both the top and bottom lines With other names in the space struggling Facebook remains my preferred investment in social media In this article I raise my price target to and detail why the recent pullback could be a reason to buy In Q Facebook broke the billion revenue mark and actually grew its monthly active user base year over year faster than Twitter NYSE TWTR While Facebooks GAAP net income is down this year based on increased business investments the company still had a GAAP profit of billion in the first half of You wont find that with any other social media name NonGAAP net income was up more than in the first half of the year One of the key highlights I saw was the following comment from CFO Dave Wehner Wehner also stated Facebook is narrowing its GAAP costexpense growth guidance to from Also the capex budget has been cut by M to BB still up from B last year Back when this year started I discussed how earnings hopes for Facebook this year were low as the company was forecasting a significant expense year Just as investors have recently cheered Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL spending discipline I like how Facebook has reduced its spending forecast In fact in that linked article above I stated that If investors want to see this stock hit triple digits in I think Facebook really needs to top in nonGAAP EPS Given the recent quarterly result and new forecast weve seen analyst estimates rise to new highs for this year as seen in the table below Twitter continues to blow through hundreds of millions of dollars while Facebook has actual profits Facebook also reported free cash flow of more than billion in Q leaving the company with over billion in cash at the end of the quarter The companys strong balance sheet will allow the company to further invest in itself whether it be investments in current businesses or more acquisitions The company isnt just increasing its user base as it is also greatly increasing its user monetization As detailed on page of the recent Q filing average revenues per user were in Q up from in the year ago period This was led by strong growth in the US and Canada where ARPU increased from to If I were an advertiser currently Id be going to Facebook to get the most bang for my buck Twitter is struggling to grow its user base and needs to find a new CEO Facebook has roughly billion monthly active users while Twitter has just over million Facebook is expected to increase revenues by another next year and nonGAAP EPS are expected to jump to With Twitter still struggling and LinkedIn NYSE LNKD falling after soso guidance I just see more money flowing into Facebook currently With things looking better than expected Ive decided to revise my valuation model To do this lets look at the nonGAAP PEs for the social media names and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>currently based on analyst estimates for each Twitter and LinkedIn trade for giant premiums to Facebook despite each of them having some issues Because Facebook is so large some see it deserving a lower multiple because growth will be harder to come by If you average the future PEs of Twitter LinkedIn and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>you are a little over times nonGAAP EPS If Facebook can achieve that EPS figure next year currently expected by analysts I think that figure is very reasonable That equals a stock which is decent upside from current levels Facebook reported another solid quarter and like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>the company detailed some expense discipline this year With estimates rising to new highs Ive raised my price target to on the name based on strong earnings growth next year Given the fact that peers trade for higher multiples with worse businesses I think my valuation is quite reasonable As seen in the chart below Facebook shares have almost pulled back to their day moving average which
