Not Follow The Herd Sell McDonalds And Microsoft McDonalds Corporation NYSEMCD Seeking Alpha Oct AM ET About McDonalds Corporation MCD MSFT by Adam Hartung This week McDonalds NYSE MCD and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT both reported earnings that were higher than analysts expected After these surprise announcements the equities of both companies had big jumps But unfortunately both companies are in a Growth Stall and unlikely to sustain higher valuations McDonalds profits rose But revenues were down Leadership touted a higher same store sales number but that is completely misleading McDonalds leadership has undertaken a back to basics program This has been used to eliminate menu items and close underperforming stores With fewer stores loyal customers were forced to eat in nearby stores something not hard to do given the proliferation of McDonalds sites But some customers will go to competitors By cutting stores and products from the menu McDonalds may lower cost but it also lowers the available revenue capacity This means that stores open a year or longer could increase revenue even though total revenues are going down Profits can go up for a raft of reasons having nothing to do with longterm growth and sustainability Changing accounting for depreciation inventory real estate holdings revenue recognition new product launches product cancellations marketing investments the list is endless Further charges in a previous quarter or previous year could have brought forward costs into an earlier report making the comparative quarter look worse while making the current quarter look better Confusing Thats why accounting changes are often called financial machinations Lots of moving numbers around but not necessarily indicating the direction of the business McDonalds asked its core customers what they wanted and based on their responses began offering allday breakfast Interpretation because they cant attract new customers McDonalds wants to obtain more revenue from existing customers by selling them more of an existing product specifically breakfast items later in the day Sounds smart but in reality McDonalds is admitting it is not finding new ways to grow its customer base or sales The old products werent bringing in new customers and new products werent either As customer counts are declining leadership is trying to pull more money out of its declining core This can work shortterm but not longterm Longterm growth requires expanding the sales base with new products and new customers Perhaps there is future value in spinning off McDonalds real estate holdings in a REIT At best this would be a onetime value improvement for investors at the cost of another longterm revenue stream Sort of like Chicago selling all its future parking meter revenues for a onetime payment to bail out its bankrupt school system But if we look at the Sears Holdings REIT spinoff which ostensibly was going to create enormous value for investors we can see there were serious limits on the effectiveness of that tactic as well Microsoft also beat analysts quarterly earnings estimate But its profits were up a mere And revenues declined versus a year ago proving its Growth Stall continues as well Although leadership trumpeted an increase in cloudbased revenue that was only an improvement and obviously not enough to offset significant weakness in other markets Despite announcing layoffs previously another new layoffs were also announced It is a struggle to see the good news here Office revenues were up but they are cannibalizing traditional Office revenues and not fast enough to replace customers being lost to competitive products like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>OfficeSuite etc Azure sales were up but not fast enough to replace declining Windows sales Further Azure competes with Amazon AWS which had remarkable results in the latest quarter After adding new features AWS sales increased vs the previous quarter and vs the previous year Margins also increased from to over the last year Azure is in a growth market but it faces very stiff competition from market leader Amazon NASDAQ AMZN We build our companies jobs and lives around successful products and services We want these providers to succeed because it makes our lives much easier We dont like to hear about large market leaders losing their strength because it signals potentially difficult change We want these companies to improve and we will clutch at any sign of improvement As investors we behave similarly We were told large companies have vast customer bases strong asset bases wellknown brands high switching costs deep pockets all things Michael Porter told us in the s created moats protecting the business keeping it protected from market shifts that could hurt sales and profits As investors we want to believe that even though the giant company may slip it wont fall Time and size is on its side we choose to believe so we should simply hang on and ride it out In the future the company will do better and value will rise As a result we see that Growth Stall companies show a common valuation pattern After achieving high valuation their equity value stagnates Then hopes for a turnaround and recovery to new growth is stimulated by a few pieces of good news and the value jumps again Only after a few years the shortterm tactics are used up and the underlying business weakness is fully exposed Then value crumbles frequently faster than remaining investors anticipated McDonalds valuation rose from share in to reach record share highs in But valuation then stagnated It is only this last jump that has caused it to reach new highs But realize this is on a smaller number of stores fewer products and declining revenues These are not factors justifying sustainable value improvement Microsoft traded around share from March through November years When the CEO was changed value jumped to share by October After dipping now a year later Microsoft stock is again reaching that previous valuation share Microsoft is now valued where it was in December which is half its alltime high The jump in value of McDonalds and Microsoft happened on shortterm news regarding beating analysts earnings expectations for one quarter The underlying businesses however are still suffering declining revenue They remain in Growth Stalls and the
