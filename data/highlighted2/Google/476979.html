day versus usual postearnings moves of just or This marks a sentiment shift going into the iPhone launch and we make a case as to why Apple could be at alltimehighs within months With the serious change in sentiment we have seen regarding Apple NASDAQ AAPL stock after the company beat expectations on its last earnings report and among scattered first glances of the iPhone we think Apple could surprise the markets and move much higher by the end of this year We also think theres a commonsense road to Apple trading at all time highs within the next months We wrote about Apple a couple of weeks ago suggesting that we were at peak iPhone hatred and that it would probably be a good time to start considering AAPL stock after the iPhone launch Were amending that slightly and wanted to note why we think Apple may actually be a good buy going into the iPhone launch right now Our previous main argument was that everybody was already expecting the iPhone to be a heinous failure therefore all of the negative sentiment regarding the phone may have already been priced in We stated Expectations for the iPhone have been extraordinarily low and likely for good reason The announcement that Apple NASDAQ AAPL was not going to be making any mass of upgrades to the phone has already turned off consumers us included to the concept of upgrading The while not branded a flop yet because we dont yet have sales data is certainly being questioned by the media more than any other model weve seen Heres a taste of what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL has offered on the iPhone Querying the phone on its own shows many articles calling it into question Querying the phone with the word flop or asking whether its worth the upgrade from the iPhone produces a litany of results All we heard month after month day after day was that the was not the model to pay attention to and that the was going to be the dramatic redesign Analysts came out with negative comments and expectations were set low Heading into the earnings report sentiment was decidedly bearish Then something funny happened Apple beat its numbers and the stock took the first breath it has been able to take since trading around The stock roared after the July report On an earnings report that we believe would normally only send the stock up or Apple surged more than in daily trading on the companys better than expected results This surge we believe unlocked a new barrage of bullish sentiment on the company that had been locked away since the company failed to break Now for the first time in a while it is starting to feel as though Apple could move higher Fundamental analysts always had a case with the companys valuation Technical analysts may start to feel some bullish tingle as well for the first time in months We got a look at the iPhone from t his exclusive photo leak that was posted online by Business Insider While it does seem similar to the iPhone there appears to be a new feel to the operating system as you can see here These changes in and of themselves chip away at the cynical thesis that will be the exact same phone as the just without the headphone jack Aside from these obvious cosmetic upgrades users can expect a faster processor and an improved camera as well A lot has changed on the inside it is just that there are not that many visible changes on the outside Despite this the is definitely going to be an upgrade If consumers unexpectedly embrace this iPhone more than the Street has imagined it could be a real inflection point for Apple stock The Streets analyst estimates are so low and expectations have been set so low for this phone that any small glance of success or notion of beating estimates will likely send Apple stock back towards its highs around Apple stock has a bullish tailwind to it for the first time in months We firmly believe that with a seismic sentiment change and with the hype surrounding the iPhone going to be unbearable Apple could very well be sitting at alltime highs just short months from when we release this article The roadmap to all time highs looks like this The iPhone may not turn out to be as bad as everyone thinks Then we have a real media event brewing in the iPhone launch which the media is already covering and will cover exhaustively until launch Valuation as many know with Apple was never a problem impeding the bull cash Apple is a fundamentally firm company with hundreds of billions of dollars in the bank that generates an enormous sum of free cash every quarter AAPL Free Cash Flow NYSE TTM data by YCharts Despite being a cash machine Apple is valued as if it is a staple stock and not a technology company with a price to earnings ratio usually in the low xx region The possibility for multiple expansion on top of the company growing organically is almost unlimited AAPL PE Ratio Forward data by YCharts There is a simple case for the company trading or percent higher than what it is now simply based on it deserving a more aggressive multiple Microsoft trades at a forward PE of X After all this is a technology company not Procter Gamble Aside from returning cash to shareholders Apple has many ways to unlock this value for shareholders One of the most underexamined ways of unlocking value that we think may be prudent in Apples case would be spinning off some of its divisions Perhaps Beats can be turned around and again be made public These are all questions for Tim Cook not for us What we are confident in however is that the iPhone is likely to be better received than most on Wall Street think We think this surprise could make the second half of this year a lucrative time to be an Apple investor After that you have the excitement and the anticipation of the iPhone which is rumored to be the dramatic redesign that the analysts on Wall Street love to crow about before it is released We see nothing but blue skies ahead for Apple and we remain bullish on the company Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in AAPL over the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas
