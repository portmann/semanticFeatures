class='textDiv'>Facebook The Social Standard Initiating Coverage With A Price Target Facebook NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Facebook is experiencing incredible synergies with its prior acquisitions which will continue to fuel rapid growth Threeway network effects among users advertisers and Facebook are the strongest among any comparable social network due to the richness of user data Facebook possesses Mobile user metrics will continue to impress and Facebook is ahead of the crowd with regard to native mobile display ads People can and do remark that Facebooks NASDAQ FB trailing PE FY PE or any other market multiple is too elevated compared to the broad market and thus conclude that Facebook is overvalued On a low level this type of analysis might be applicable to a domestic manufacturing company late in the maturity cycle that grows per year but to utilize the same valuation methodologies for this hypergrowth technology company is nothing short of myopic and ignorant Facebook has grown both by acquisition and organically at a staggering rate since its inception Although these acquisitions were not immediately accretive the powerful synergies that are realized between all businesses have and will continue to enhance the value of Facebook immensely through multidimensional network effects The continued integration between all of Facebooks platforms and the way Facebook utilizes user data has been proven to enhance the targeting potential of optimized ads it increases user engagement and ultimately Facebook becomes a more important part of peoples daily lives One of the most important aspects of Facebooks growth is their improvement in targeting quality for optimized ads As the quality of targeting increases businesses will inherently place higher values on ad impressions Simply put the logic behind this lies within the idea that if less impressions have to be made to initiate an event purchase follow signup etc then the price charged per impression can increase In this report we will put the pieces of the puzzle together and explain how the combination of different performance metrics will continue to fuel Facebooks rapid growth into the foreseeable future Through our analysis we will deconstruct our reasoning for a buy rating and price target based on a year DCF As well we will ultimately present a case for why Facebook is worth more than the sum of its parts and why it is the Social Standard Facebook reported Q revenues of billion vs billion est representing growth of YY and FY revenues of billion vs billion est showing growth of YY Historical quarterly revenue is shown in the figure below Q NonGAAP EPS was inline with our estimates at sh Facebooks Q Average Revenue Per User ARPU calculated using average Monthly Active Users MAU also surprised at vs est primarily driven by strengthening metrics in the US Canada Brazil and India Over the past few years Facebooks growth and profitability metrics have demonstrated extreme yet steady improvements Ad quality and ultimately revenue growth have been driven by users switch to mobile which is highlighted by Facebook mobile MAUs representing of total Facebook MAUs in December During that time Facebook MAUs grew YY and mobile MAUs grew YY Another metric to observe is the Mobile DAUTotal DAU which stood at We believe that the Mobile MAUtotal MAU and Mobile DAUtotal DAU metrics are at levels that if sustained will allow Facebook to grow into our expectations Moving forward the key numbers to focus on in the mobile area is the growth of Mobile DAUMAU which in December indicated the highest value ever recorded at Both metrics historical values since Q are shown in the figures below Another important metric combining revenue and user metrics is ARPU Average Revenue Per User and it indicates the monetizability of the Facebook user base In Q Facebook posted total ARPU of vs our est The figure below shows historical total ARPU broken down by geography As noted earlier it is obvious mobile metrics are extremely important to Facebooks growth story In Q Facebook noted that mobile ad revenues were approximately billion up YY and currently represents of total ad revenue For comparison Facebook mobile ad revenues were approximately million in Q and contributed to of revenues The figure below visualizes the shift from displaybased to mobilebased ad revenues With regards to Facebooks other platforms all have shown robust growth over the past year as these complementary products are further developed to provide the user with a valuable experience In Instagram users ended at approximately million up YY Messenger users were approximately million currently over million up YY and WhatsApp ended with approximately billion users up YY By this point most people are aware that Facebook monetizes its business through selling and displaying ads to users based on the types of ads that advertisers bid for The business model is simple on the outside but it has many inner workings that enable the model to be constantly improved Facebook utilizes their users data that they collect through post interaction common tendencies message contents demographics etc to predict within a reasonable probability range which users will be most receptive to certain ads based on delivery type content time of day and many other factors that we will discuss In the following sections we present Facebooks products both developer and userbased that we believe are instrumental in improving the targeting and optimization processes Facebook itself is the central product that allows the rest of the products that Facebook has created or acquired to work in tandem to realize synergies With billion people using Facebook every month and an average time spent on Facebook per day of minutes the amount of user data that Facebook has access to is beyond comprehension Facebook has access to data across all of its platforms including messages sent between people in Messenger and interaction with Instagram posts WhatsApp data collection potential was questioned following the acquisition due to the fact that WhatsApp users only needed their phone number to create an account and use the service thus making it difficult for Facebook to connect user data to unique properties of each WhatsApp user Many current Facebook users have noticed that their phone number was requested for security reasons in the past however this call for data by Facebook serves a double purpose When Facebook users add unique identifiers such as phone numbers or emails to their profile their account gained another very valuable identifier tag for Facebook This allows users to be more easily matched with an advertisers customer lists to build potential target pools for their ads This process as well as Facebooks SSO which is covered separately heavily aids the audience creation process and expands the valuegenerating potential of tools that Facebook offers to developers and marketers Messenger Where Facebook users contact each other in real time the messenger service was separated from the Facebook app itself presumably to boost mobile engagement across Facebook apps The separation was initially greeted with resistance but since then with constant additions and modifications of the messenger service this segment has experienced robust growth and now has over million MAUs and grew by over million in As presented at F Facebooks developer conference Messenger will attempt to be the single place for people to engage with businesses through AI Upon successful widespread integration of this AI feature we believe Facebook will have a robust platform for payments and other related revenues WhatsApp Facebook acquired WhatsApp to gain a sizeable position in the primarily European social media space Currently WhatsApp has approximately Billion MAUs Facebook announced on the last quarterly call that the subscription fee would be removed for WhatsApp year for users after the year trial in a proactive effort to maintain engagement with the app WhatsApp itself is very popular among nonNorth Americans and it will prove integral to Facebooks monetization efforts outside North America The percentage of the mobile internet users in select countries who use WhatsApp are shown in the following figure Instagram Facebooks primary media platform for photos and short videos Instagram has over Million MAUs and grew by approximately in Instagram and Facebook are the monetization centers of Facebook and thus will be monitored the closest of any segment As Facebook continuously updates Instagram and the average time individuals spend on the platform increases small businesses will see a growing opportunity to advertise on the platform that experiences the highest content engagement A large advantage we see from Instagram ads is that the ads are native and flow seamlessly with the apps content We briefly cover the importance of mobile native advertising later in the report We believe that Facebooks social login does not receive enough attention relative to the information it provides Facebook for monetization Social logins are options that users and potential users have when prompted to create a profile to access a website or an app These options to log in using a certain sites precreated profile such as a Facebook profile are common among many sites and apps today Although social logins are not an extremely new feature that users can utilize the adoption rates and preferences for social logins have increased dramatically over the past few years as people are increasingly bombarded with different apps and user registration forms According to a LoginRadius research report user preferences for their identity while signing up for new sites is skewed at a massive for social profile vs email signup The simple reason that explains this large difference in preferences is that people dont want to and sometimes cant remember multiple passwords of social login users and the social login method saves them time of social login users A JanRain research report cites that of consumers are aware of social logins utilize them and of the report having a positive experience On the websites side the benefit they derive from utilizing social logins is lower form abandonment rates people who leave the site during signup due to lengthyseemingly unnecessary forms and proven higher conversion rates between higher In fact according to the JanRain research of users who are given the social login option state that they read more articles on sites that offer social logins The same findings were reported where of customers responded that they would purchase more from a company if SSO eased login processes In addition to this statistic of people who utilize social logins report making or more of their purchases online through mobile access It shouldnt be a surprise that Facebook dominates the global social login scene According to the LoginRadius report of people use Facebook as their main choice of social login profile followed by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>at and Twitter at As for the websites preference regarding which social logins to offer Facebook tops the list by an extremely large margin Of the websites that offer social logins include Facebook in their list followed by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Twitter and LinkedIn All others contribute from of social login options on sites that use them After all of this what benefit does Facebook derive from allowing these sites to use their database of profiles to streamline profile creation The answer as indicated in the previous section revolves around data collection and utilization Cookies do not work reliably or at all to track data on many mobile devices As well the cookies that are utilized are not crossplatform compatible it is difficult to combine mobile web traffic and desktop web traffic for the same user As a result companies realized that the way to track users without cookies were to use social logins which allow these companies to track user data and usage within the site or apps that users engage with Because people utilize social logins both mobile and desktop unique user data can be combined and analyzed with ease With Facebook dominating the global SSO space they continue to have a position of superior data collection versus other social media advertising companies We believe that Facebooks SSO plays a valuable role in providing quality insights through Facebook Analytics for Apps as well as data production for all aspects of Facebooks targeting efforts Facebook Analytics for Apps allows app owners and developers to dive into data surrounding their users who they are based on descriptive characteristics how they interact with the app and also the changes in usage patterns and behavioral changes as a result of certain events that occur A large value adding aspect to Facebook Analytics for Apps is the integration of Facebook App Events where data is collected regarding what happens to usage at certain points in the app when actions such as installs app launches purchases etc occur This free tool provides developers and app owners with valuable insights that allow them to change or modify their app in an effort to maximize certain favorable events Segments are A group of people A segment can be defined by the device they use their age their gender or other demographic information or the events that they have generated in your app Segments are generally utilized for analyzing demographics although the developers can modify which attributes to display Funnels are A set of steps that someone performs in your app Each step in the funnel must be logged with an App Event You build a funnel in Facebooks analytics UI based on the set of events that your app logs For developers different events can be logged such as purchases addtocarts or in the case of games where there may be level bottlenecks or bugs With this data users movement within the app can be tracked and provides valuable insights into the apps UI and where positive changes can be made Cohorts are A group of people who took the same action in the same time period Cohorts can help you understand how users respond to changes you make in the app or how behavior of your users changes based on when they started using the app This feature allows developers to see which changes or events have the most impact on user engagement within their app With an idea of how these people react to certain changes or modifications the developer has a better idea of how their user base will react Overall with these three broad types of insights developers are able to filter certain characteristics at each level to develop preferred target user profiles and audiences to which they can cater to Facebook can benefit at the very minimum in one way from this and in addition they have the potential to monetize their relationships with these developers Acting as a high draw product developers could realize the value that is held in the creation of custom and lookalike audiences through Facebooks marketing API and eventually advertise on Facebooks platforms or through their audience network As stated earlier Facebook benefits regardless of whether or not they acquire a developer as a new marketer because the data that they receive in tandem with the developer provides such valuable insights into users that Facebook can use to help other marketers achieve campaign goals Using all of the user data that Facebook has acquired over every platform developers business owners page owners and all the like can benefit from Facebooks Audience Management Facebook creates audiences or sets of people that would be most likely to respond and engage with ads that the marketers provide Facebook has four main types of audiences that can be created Custom audiences are sets of people that a marketer has already established a relationship with on or off of Facebook Custom audiences allow marketers to choose a list variable such as phone numbers emails app user IDs etc that the marketer has previously acquired Alternatively different characteristics such as date of birth location or other user data can be used to tailor ads with greater precision Lookalike audiences are sets of people that Facebook deems comparable to a current set of customers that a marketer has The difference between custom audiences and lookalike audiences is that custom audiences are used to target people who are already aware of a marketers offerings and have interacted with them whereas lookalike audiences are algorithm generated user sets that are likely to engage with the marketer in a similar way that their high valued customers interact with them Lookalike audiences filter users by characteristics such as existing custom audiences campaign conversion rate similarities and also data collected through pixels Mobile app custom audiences are created using what was discussed earlier the funnels and cohorts that are selected and analyzed to determine who would create the most favorable events based on the marketers needs Pixel Website custom audiences are similar to mobile app custom audiences however a tool called a pixel is used to track a users movement through a website that was accessed through Facebook Similar to the way that mobile app custom audiences are created Facebook determines who would be the best to market to based on their similarity to people who activated an event that the marketer values ie purchases or signups Website custom audiences have three main marketing objectives making sure that a customer who doesnt require marketing material to make purchases isnt shown an ad unnecessarily using lookalike audiences based on prior recorded pixel data and also remarket to customers who expressed interest in a product or website but did not follow through with the marketers desired event action Pixels also offer a valuable resource which is true conversion tracking from customers that were redirected to the site as a result from engaging with an ad on Facebook We noted earlier that cookies are not a reliable way to measure reach and effectiveness of a marketing campaign and with Pixels accuracy of conversion tracking it is clear Facebook is taking steps to move away from dominantly cookiebased ad performance reporting and strives to deliver accurate campaign performance insights to marketers Atlas is a company that Facebook acquired in from Microsoft and was a platform that was initially intended to provide existing advertisers with insights to their offsite nonFacebook integrated ads that were more accurate than cookies reporting On Atlas website they note People today are more connected than ever Despite this cookiebased ads are still the norm They dont work on mobile and they cant measure real results Because of the extremely fast switch to mobile advertisers need a way of measuring ad effectiveness across platforms for situations where a user may be exposed to an ad on one platform and initiate an event on another Atlas will use Facebooks user data and create custom audiences to measure impressions and this effort will further be aided by their social login which is dominant over all other social logins Atlas will be supporting measurement for all forms of advertising including mobile display native and video ads which are said to have strong potential in mobile and video due to LiveRail and Facebooks already strong mobile performance The way in which Atlas worked originally is laid out in the figure below Carolyn Everson remarked at the rd Annual UBS Global Media and Telecommunications Conference Atlas right now is being tested and used by a number of marketers We are pleased with the progress Its still early days The industry has been using cookiebased measurement for over years And its going to take time to shift to be about peoplebased and about businessoutcome based So we think its incredibly important The shift towards a higher knowledge of where ad campaign money is going and a greater demand for performance insights puts Atlas in a favorable position due to the scale of Facebook and the user data that it generates on so many levels Audience network allows app developers and mobile web owners to earn advertising revenue through targeted ad placement When utilizing the Audience Network the app or mobile website owner may choose between types of ads x Banners appearing at the top or bottom of an appsite Fullscreen interstitials that appear before or after an event occurs Native ads that are customized for the app or website so as to continue a broad theme or design that is utilized in the app or website already Three examples from Facebook are as follows Audience network allows advertisers to reach a greater audience with more precise targeting versus when only NewsFeed ads are utilized Adding on to this we put a special emphasis on native ads where they are curated to flow with the app or website design and are more likely to retain visitoruser engagement with the app or site content According to The Next Ad Majority of mobile app install advertisers that utilized audience network saw cost per installs equal to or better than News Feed and Audience Network provided incremental scale for Facebook campaigns additional unique users more outcomes Although Facebook publishes limited performance metrics for Audience Network releasing data that in Q ad runrate reached billion we can shine some light on the importance of developing Audience Network further As stated previously native ads are important to the development of the Audience Network According to an IHS study released in March and summarized by Yoav Arnstein The researchers do note however that the inapp native first party ads such as Facebook News Feed ads and Instagram will continue to dominate the native ad market but third party mobile display ads such as the ones that are presented through the Audience network will represent billion of the mobile display ad market by Yoav also states that the percentage of apps on the audience network using native ad formats has increased tenfold to since Q and currently make up of Facebooks entire network As is shown inapp native third party will grow the fastest compared to any other electronic advertising means Although this is a high growth segment we do realize that the actual expected share is relatively small at of which Facebook is very well positioned to have a significant share in through the Audience Network Using everything that was laid out in the above writing we can present a simple logic for how Facebook creates value for users advertisers and Facebook itself To begin we use Liebowitz and Margolis definition of a network effect to demonstrate our basic thinking a change in the benefit or surplus that an agent derives from a good when the number of other agents consuming the same kind of good changes We outline how of the main network participants realize network effects through Facebook The user When people join a community where they can interact and communicate with other users it is clear and obvious that an increase in the number of other users boosts the value of the experience for the user just because they have more people to engage with in one place Drawing from the research posted earlier in this report surrounding social logins we believe that similarly to users reluctance to create a form and remember passwords for different sites users do not want to switch between too many independent platforms to interact with each other as this would reduce the value of each separate network unless they were integrated On a lower more questionable level when the number of advertisers increases the set of ads that would be relevant to a given user increases in quality From this we could hypothesize that a user gains utility through product or service discovery versus a scenario where the users ad exposure had remained the same Advertisers As the number of users increases the targeting quality of Facebooks algorithms increases We have seen that through different methods of targeting optimization and ad delivery the true value of targeting to an advertiser increases in tandem On the other side we could also make an argument for advertisers gaining value through an increased number of other advertisers utilizing Facebooks ad space The logic behind this is also enhanced targeting where users interact with other ads and create the ability to make quality custom or lookalike audiences for current users To counter this positive network effect supply and demand play a role in any auctionbased system where all else equal an increase in the demand for ad space will increase the price charged per ad Despite this relationship we have to look at what drives demand for ad space Given a finite inventory for ads optimization and targeting would be the best external driver of demand and thus better quality ad targeting will drive up the perceived value of each ad This value discovery is unlocked in Facebooks bidding process which is a VickreyClarkeGroves Auction where in short the price an advertiser is charged for an ad is a function of the amount they understate the value of an impression versus other bidders The optimization and targeting for ads is exemplified by Facebooks historical YY growth of ad impressions vs the average price charged and the resulting overall growth of ad revenue shown in the following figure Facebook It is no question that Facebooks value is a function of the number of users and advertisers that participate within their entire network On the user side continued growth of Facebooks SSO the Audience Network Atlas and tracking tags such as Facebook Pixel among other things will allow Facebook to gather more quality data and dive deeper into its users As is stated many times in this report Any incremental user data that is gathered enables Facebook to create more accurate targeting for advertisements As well with any incremental increase in the number of users on any given platform that integrates Facebooks marketing tools will increase Facebooks ad inventory The loop feeds itself with more users resulting in higher quality targeting thus commanding a higher price per impression as well as a larger potential audience for these ads In the most recent quarter Facebook demonstrated this principle with both the number of ad impressions and price per impression increasing for the first time since Q It may seem as though Facebook faces heavy competition but we assert that Facebooks competitive position is unthreatened The social aspect and the depth of data that Facebook can collect from users is unparalleled and it does not seem as if any other competition can even come close to obtaining data of comparable quality Below are summaries of who we believe are Facebooks biggest competitors Everyone knows Twitter as the pioneer of microblogging however Twitter is fighting an uphill battle against Facebook Twitter lacks the UI and capacity for engagement between people and content Because of this lack of engagement potential Twitters growth is slowing rapidly Q MAUs were million and increased YY Despite this YY increase sequentially the growth in Twitters user base was stagnant Ad pricing and impressions overall growth is also slowing at a rapid pace as shown in the following figure What we take away from this figure is that the cost per ad is falling drastically and may be a signal that advertisers have found better outlets that offer more accurate targeting As well as the cost per ad falls we can infer that Twitter may be increasing its ad inventory per user YY increase in ad engagementsimpressions yet only a YY increase in MAUs and thus impairing the experience that the user has while on Twitter When these platforms that offer better targeting are utilized a higher return on an advertisers ad spend will be realized If we compare the overall ad revenue growth with Facebook we notice a slightly positive correlation between Twitter and Facebooks overall growth changes ie the growth of the growth that has spikes of negatively correlated periods Recently this correlation has gradually shifted to become negative in favor of Facebooks overall growth After visualizing overall growth in this manner and combining it with just a lowlevel analysis of each business we confirm that Twitter is not a threat to Facebooks advertising market share Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Alphabet is seen as a major threat to Facebook in the advertising space we do not believe that their main segments and delivery methods will collide except in video Googles cookiebased DSA and measurement platform has been adopted by many marketers and could be the main barrier to entry into thirdparty crossplatform measurement and ad serving This is a threat to Atlas Facebooks DSA and peoplebased measurement platform and the barrier to entry into a thirdparty demandside market is made higher when we consider that YouTube or any <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>product will not be compatible with Atlas in the near future In the long term however we believe that Googles subpar targeting and mistargeting coupled with forced ads on YouTube will lead to either the adoption of Atlas and peoplebased advertising or an effort to create another social network in an attempt to gain deeper data We do not believe it will be the latter after the failed launch of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Plus As the advertising space changes and the shift to native mobile display furthers we see Facebook maintaining its dominant position in the mobile ad display space With Facebook having of its advertising revenue come from mobile ads they are ahead of the curve with regards to developing mobile ad solutions that are the industry standard Snapchat boasts over million users and reports that users watch billion videos per day This seems to be on par with Facebooks reported billion however the method by which video views are recorded on Snapchat is much worse and misleading than if the industry standard were employed The industry standard for recording a video view online is seconds Facebook uses seconds as the threshold and Snapchat uses the moment a video is rendered on a users screen even if the video is open for a fraction of a second This recording methodology paired with recent developments in Snapchats UI leads us to point out the likelihood of metric inflation Recently Snapchat updated the app so that a users story would roll meaning that once someone watches another users story the story of the user that posted their story earlier in the sequence is automatically loaded and played This video view even if it is not intentional effectively forces a user to watch another story and as a result Snapchat logs another video view In our view there could be two different motives for the aspect of this update and the method by which video views are calculated by Snapchat Forced monetization not providing users the option to leave another users story unwatched could be a signal that Snapchat plans to place ads inbetween a users story and have users leave an impression on the ads that they are served This theory does seem far fetched due to the fact that users will most likely respond very negatively to such an approach to monetization If Snapchat decides to use this method we believe that the motive is illintentioned because of the inflated engagement metrics that Snapchat would report to advertisers and the inherent lack of quality impressions they would provide due to poor targeting capabilities Gaining advertiser commitments building on the last point typically heightened engagement metrics will attract advertisers to advertise on that platform Because Snapchat has limited user data without an API to gain a deeper understanding of their users and target them they would be shooting fish in a barrel with their advertisements without the use of an external API To possibly remedy the above illmannered tactics we believe that Snapchat will have to resort to either a solicitation of a sale to a company ie Facebook that has the capacity to target efficiently in a crossplatform manner or engage in a partnership with a DSA such as Atlas due to Snapchats mobileonly characteristic We do not believe that Snapchat will IPO in the near future due to the dampened IPO market as of late Facebook acquired Oculus a Virtual reality software and hardware company in for approximately billion consisting of million in cash and million Facebook shares Oculus develops physical headsets and peripheral accessories in addition to providing a platform for which developers can integrate Oculus Virtual Reality technology into their products Recent commentary indicates VR will first be introduced as a new way to play video games and will eventually move into broader categories where enhanced visuals are able to add value to a product or service and will also be used as a connectivity medium As VR is a segment where no widespread adoption has ever been present we can only guess what VR technology will be applied to but at the moment it seems like its potential applications are extremely wide reaching On January th Oculus opened preorders of the Oculus Rift VR headset and the opening demand was extremely high Buyers were given estimated shipping dates with their orders that spanned out to June due to the higher than expected influx Shown below is a graph visualizing unique and total US monthly visits to Oculuscom since September Growing visits throughout the development stage indicate outside consumer interest in the product and during December and January visits indicate potential and actual buying customers for the preorders This web traffic tapered off in February and recovered to January levels in March We expect flatdown metrics through Q and expansion in late Q through the holiday season Website metrics were sourced from Sentieo and the data is pulled from competecom In addition to positive traffic data I note that according to Easycounter shopoculuscom accounts for the highest proportion of total page visits when compared to any subdomain on the site In combination with Mark Zuckerbergs optimistic words regarding the launch success using estimated order number data it would not be unrealistic to assume that Oculus has received approximately million preorders for Oculus Rift with approximately shipping through the end of March At a static price point of USD revenue realized in Q will be in the range of million and deferred revenue will increase by approximately million For FY I expect Million units to be sold and revenue earned will be in the range of million It is worth adding that in addition to the shopoculuscom subdomain popularity the developer site holds the second most popularity with regard to page views at of all website traffic We base our estimates primarily on user growth and increasing ARPU based on increased mobile usage and growing DAUMAU metrics Using our projected DAU and MAU we regress regional DAUMAU to the LN of regional ARPU for each quarter to account for the seasonality that exists in Facebooks revenue Using the DAUMAU as the dependent variable we are left with the LN of the ARPU for that region With the resulting regional ARPU we use the associated MAU and determine the revenue excluding Oculus that would make the ARPU equal to our estimate In creating pro forma financial statements we typically used historical percent of a relevant benchmark where the volatility of the metric is historically low On the income statement we created adjusted line items for various operating expenses that when deconstructed show evidence that Facebooks operations are extremely scalable For all operating expenses Facebook allocates sharebased compensation across them depending on which area of their business the sharebased compensation is applicable We removed sharebased compensation for all accounts to generate a raw baseline for a growth for each item and its resulting beta vs sales growth For cost of revenue depreciation and amortization are included to reflect the usage of server equipment that must be invested in to support higher user levels across all platforms We used of sales and maintenance and growth capex to determine whether the resulting depreciation would be similar When raw cost of revenue was regressed against sales we noted that cost of revenue exhibited a favorable relationship vs sales since it increased at a slower rate than sales increased Interest expenseincome is noted to be immaterial as Facebooks line of credit is not drawn down and only the administration fees are included These fees will be offset primarily by cash yield For our valuation we used a year DCF and a perpetuity growth method We chose a year over a year to avoid having a large jump from FY growth rates in to a longterm perpetuity growth of We understand that forecasting is less accurate the farther out the forecast however if we use a year DCF and apply a heightened perpetuity growth rate of we arrive at a similar valuation For cost of equity we used the year treasury as a benchmark for the riskfree rate and for ERP The Beta we decided to use was an average of the year year and year weekly betas for Facebook Since Facebook has no interestbearing longterm debt their WACC is equal to their cost of equity which we figured was We used a conservative terminal growth rate of to reflect expected levels of target inflation The figure below shows the sensitivities to our valuation Through this report we outline what we believed were fundamentally key facets of Facebooks business that will enable further rapid growth in monetization Through every platform that is used by either advertisers or users Facebook allows threeway network effects to be realized that are unparalleled by any other social network due to the richness of data that Facebook poses These threeway network effects are what we believe to be the largest synergies that have been realized from prior acquisitions and thus had these acquisitions not been made or integrated into Facebook the growth potential of Facebook would almost certainly not be where it is currently Through a year DCF we conclude that Facebook is undervalued and initiate coverage with a price target Some opponents to a year DCF should realize that a year DCF with heightened perpetuity growth assumptions yield a similar result albeit the range of valuations becomes larger under a year model This article was written in collaboration with Alex Preobrazenski an Altum Research contributor Disclosure Iwe
