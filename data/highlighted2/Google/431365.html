Questions Apple Investors Must Ask Themselves Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Notably AAPL has traded at consolidation after rebounding from its postearnings dip However the fact that AAPL is trading at consolidation should trigger some AAPL longs to consider the opportunity costs involved in holding AAPL In my last article on Apple NASDAQ AAPL I recommended AAPL longs supplement their income by selling OTM monthly puts roughly below the current price This strategy would have paid off in May and so far in June as well But how long will this strategy pay off in other words how long should we be bullish on Apple Notably AAPL has traded at consolidation after rebounding from its postearnings dip The latter is to be expected as popular stocks experiencing negative earnings drawdown tend to revert to the mean In other words AAPL rebounding after the earnings surprise should be no surprise However the fact that AAPL is trading at consolidation should trigger some AAPL longs to consider the opportunity costs involved in holding AAPL My options strategy in addition to AAPLs yield should provide some income while you wait for AAPL to return to supra prices But the possibility that AAPLs glory days are over should not be ignored Heres my simple stance on AAPL Investors should ignore the hype and instead focus on two simple aspects In short these aspects are These two will determine the movement of AAPL more than anything besides general market movements The second actually drives the first And the first drives the stock The driver of AAPLs price to its alltime highs was like for most stocks earnings growth Hype surrounding Apples new products only drove discussions not investments When it comes down to money most investors want to ensure that the company is producing ROI That said AAPL is no longer producing the growth it once did I still support my statement that AAPL should be treated as a value stock not a growth stock With steady but not amazing earnings growth AAPL is more like a Paypal than a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>As I wrote before Apple is slowly becoming a value stock Their attempts at innovation have been less than appealing Nevertheless Apple is still Apple meaning that they can still shake up an entire industry and essentially capture the majority of the flow of money from that industrys consumer With all of the speculation of Apples upcoming developments how will we know when a bullish Apple position should be taken or added to Well the easiest answer is wait until new products are released as AAPL rises with the revenue gained from new successful products But the key word here successful must be considered What makes Apples products successful The monstrous growth of Apple can only be attributed to products that disrupted entire industries Macbooks and Apple Watches are not the catalysts for EPS growth here Apples main advantage in any market is its brand name The Apple brand effectively shuts down all barriers to entry No marketing efforts were needed to move from the iPod to the iPhone from the iPhone to the iPad from the iPad to the Apple Watch Apple can ditch all marketing costs associated with a new project effectively allowing the company to enter any market it pleases like a ghost passing through the traditional barriers to entry The question is whether Apple is optimally using this power The entry to the timepiece industry was not an optimal use of Apples free barrier pass for example Why When Apple entered the music industry it changed functionality but nothing else In other words the mechanism for buying music was changed but the music itself was not The iPhone changed the mechanism of digital phones which were already being used for internet browsing and text communication The iPod changed the mechanism of listening to music The iPad changed the mechanism of portable computing In every one of these cases Apple understood the underlying motivation for consumer actions and gave the consumer more power in obtaining their goals The reason the Apple Watch is an important example of a waste of resources is that the company ignored the underlying motivation for time pieces Status Removing your Rolex for an Apple Watch gives you more functionality but it drops your status Apple chose to enter an industry to compete for wrist real estate which most people use for showing status conspicuous consumption or image Only in the image category could Apple make any progress and that is by targeting those who already want to be affiliated with Apple or tech in general You cannot shake up an industry with functionality if the purpose of that industry is not functionality This is why Apple investors moving forward should keep careful watch over Apples announcements and investments We should be asking ourselves whether Apple is targeting the right industries in its expansion plans If so investments are warranted if not Apple is likely diverting its cash flow to lowROI projects and therefore underperforming This is also why becoming emotionally involved in your investment in AAPL will hurt you Seeing all upcoming products with rosecolored glasses ignores the EPSprice connection Although a certain segment of the population will buy anything and everything from Apple to the point of ditching their Rolexes for Apple Watches or shooting their dogs burying them in the backyard and replacing them with Apple Dogs the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>dog needs a competitor this group cannot make up for diminished EPS reports Consider Apples investment in Didi Chuxing Apple now owns of Didi Chuxing Chinas largest ridesharing company that is the equivalent of the Mandarin version of Uber Private UBER Surely Apple could have created its own ridehailing app and entered the market for under B Many have said that this investment was meaningless but they are missing the point The question investors should ask in a situation such as this is What is the motivation for ridesharing and can Apple change the mechanism We can safely bet that Apple will not do something as mundane as invest in a ridehailing app just for exposure to that market A much more likely reason for this investment is a longterm innovative project Just as Apple has shaken up the music industry the phone industry and the tablet industry it is likely aiming to shake up the ridehailing industry Talk about Apple Car and Project Titan stem from Steve Jobss interest in just this type of project And the Guardian reports documents that show a driverless car is underway If Apple is planning on creating the first driverless taxi service we do not buy AAPL on this information Instead we ask whether Apples borderless entry to this market will allow for significant EPS growth after the fact Can the company really profit from changing the mechanism of ridehailing in this case removing the driver This article is not to speculate but to push you toward the right questions Buying AAPL for any reason other than products that can expedite EPS growth is meaningless That said let me know your answer to whether Apple can disrupt the ridehailing industry in the comments section below My Exploiting Earnings premium subscription is now live here on Seeking Alpha In this newsletter we employ both fundamental and
