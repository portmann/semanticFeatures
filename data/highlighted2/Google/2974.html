it comes to market manipulation I thought I would just provide a concrete example of the kind of funny business that goes on every day in financial Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from

paid infomercialcumpublicity stunt to roll out the latest new revolutionary wearable smartwatch confirmed by the media mentions chart below Michelle Coffey m_cof March a just released ReutersIPSOS poll shows that the vast majority of Americans are greeting the new Apple watch with nothing but iYawns The poll reveals that of Americans are they are not interested in buying the gadget with responding not at all interested Ipsos surveyed Americans online between March and March The data was weighted to reflect the US population and has a credibility interval of plus or minus percentage points Only responded they are somewhat interested and a further are very interested And most troubling for Apple is that perhaps with the memory of the just as revolutionary <span

watch is expected to come primarily from existing iPhone users but its wider success is seen depending on whether developers create enticing apps tailored to the device socalled killer apps Apple is among several large tech companies looking to jumpstart a new market for wearable electronic devices Samsung Electronics Sony Corp and LG Electronics have all released their own smartwatches many of them powered by software developed by Internet company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Inc But consumers have yet to cotton to the notion of wearable devices <span

smartwatches were sold globally in according to research firm Strategy Analytics a fraction of the more than billion smartphones sold worldwide The graphic below shows just how massive the smartwatch field has become and how initial buzz is so critical to determine any one watch that could become the standout This is troubling as more than half of respondents or disagreed that they are more interestin purchasing an Apple Watch than some other kind of smartwatch If even Apple and its infamous marketing savvy and loyal fans is unable to determine the clear winner then suddenly the case for the much needed ecosystem boost that has proppeled the stock massively over the past months mostly on the back of Apples own debtfunded stock repurchases is looking very shaky As Reuters further adds some percent of respondents said that the Apple Watch had a cool factor But only percent said they were more interested in purchasing an Apple Watch than another brand of smartwatch Analysts expect that Apple will sell between million and million watches in If the initial disappointing feedback is anything to go by the final number will be substantially less Which means back to the drawing board for the company which deals as much in fads hype and aspirational buzz as in actual products which will be that much more challenged to provide the next iteration of a must have smartphone not so much due to decline of inherent evolutionary features but simply due to battery life and chemistry limitations You have to be a real gadget freak to get a smart watch Now with autoselfie technology that automagically takes a selfie of you every time you glance at your watch Fri nope Bluetooth will only work if iPhone in proximity so the watch needs the phone close by for full operational capacity Thats a good thing because of course the phone doesnt tell time lol Ill tell you who will like the watches Dentists Working with your hands you can glance at your wrist to see who texted or called Other than that this thing is late to the party Friend has the FitBit and that thing rocks Fri negative rates The only way to make it worth anything is to make it of gold then in months melt gold down to buy another watch rinse and repete to stardom Fri MeelionDollerBogus It used to be fancy to have a databank watch were talking pre that could store phone numbers and the battery would last for years In Apple thinks a watch that costs x what that old one did and the battery might last for a day is advanced Fri Winston Churchill Fri Parrotile I never forget a colleague just had to buy an IPad a few years back whilst I was quite content with a Nexus unwanted gift from EBay Within ONE week his power switch no longer functioned so up to the Apple Shop in Sydney he lives in Wollongong hours south of The Big City for a replacement What he got was a Works Remanufactured replacement full warranty but a Seconds remanufactured product nevertheless for the New Product price FOUR hours round trip for a reconditioned Apple product for FULL list price Take it or leave it attitude pretty common in Sydney I seem to remember Fri tgatliff Maybe the reason for the low numbers has something to do with the watch only working with people who have iPhones Wouldnt a better poll be one that asks only iPhone users if they are interested Otherwise the data is meaningless I am not saying I like the Apple watch but iPhone users are only of the cell phone market so if of total users not being interested in theory that means that ie million which are all iPhone users are interested In that context it could potentially be a very successful product However any reasonable person would expect a sell off in AAPL after the watch release This is inevitable considing how fast it has gone up recently Fri Two Theives and Fri czarangelus Yes but are the percentage of morons who are interested the same dwindling percentage of Americans who can afford such a I hesitate to call it luxury Ostentatious display of idiocy Fri davidalan Fuck Apple and all the idiots that pack their stores and buy their sheeeeitfucking Iwatch just give me a Timex with big numberslol Fri City_Of_Champyinz This iwatch crap might be the most useless product ever invented I know that I only require my timepiece to have a battery life of hours What a joke Fri scatha It is sick Millions Americans worry about food shelter and how to pay gas and electric bill and those SV lunatics are daydreaming about iWatch or next useless iGadget disrupting their naps Fri Berspankme One of the girls that works for me has one garnishment says she cant wait to get one minutes after paycheck every week shes broke I told her it was useless and showed her my flip phone She laughed at it I have my house paid for pay cash for my cars and figures in savings and PMs and apparently Im the dummy Fri Pheonyte I have to agree on both counts Same story with the iPad Everyone trashed it when it was rolled out and said it had no
