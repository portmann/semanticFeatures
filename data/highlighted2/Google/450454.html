class='textDiv'>What WalMart Shipping Pass Means To Amazon Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha WalMart is behind Amazon Prime but it is working to catch up WalMart is offering a free day trial to gain subscribers If WalMart has some success it can force Amazon Prime to unbundle in order to directly compete with ShippingPass WalMart NYSE WMT began beta testing the ShippingPass yearly subscription last year It was priced at per year for free unlimited day shipping for about million of the million items on the website It then switched to charging per year and dropped the shipping length to days The items not available for day shipping have free shipping of days Last week WalMart started giving a free day trial to really beef up the number of new users trying it out We dont have any data from WalMart on how great the sales have been but as you can see the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Trends search data shows an in improvement of late However if you plot it against traffic for Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Prime the line doesnt even show up because its so little in comparison to Prime Amazon may have up to million American Prime subscribers and million worldwide so WalMart is starting at a disadvantage WalMarts online sales growth has been decelerating as last years holiday season saw growth compared to growth in the year earlier Even now the ShippingPass is still in its pilot phase ShippingPass is important because of online carts are abandoned because of shipping costs The only way for WalMart to compete with Amazon is to have this ShippingPass compete successfully with Prime The benefit of Shipping Pass over Prime is it is half the price Another advantage WalMart has is its physical stores across the country where consumers can return items they dont like without the wait The benefit of Prime over ShippingPass is that only million items are available for day shipping on ShippingPass compared to about million for Prime However ShippingPass will likely be extended This may be the reason behind why its still in pilot mode There has to be some improvements WalMart is working on to get it to full launch and I think speed and the amount of products which can ship quickly are the two likely improvements which will be made The interesting part about this comparison is that Amazon also has its music movies cloud storage and Kindle lending program included in Prime This begs to question all things being equal if these extra products are worth the extra per year In terms of value they may be worth it but they would probably have had trouble competing alone with firms like Netflix and Spotify if free shipping wasnt a part of the Prime deal As you can see from the Twitter poll below unsurprisingly the best part of Prime is the free shipping This creates a problem for Amazon because WalMart is competing by offering only what consumers actually want in the subscription By giving the customers what they want WalMart can steal some of them away from Amazon My point is not to say that Amazon Prime will lose out to WalMart My point is that Amazon may have to unbundle its services in order to properly compete against it If an unbundling occurs it would hurt the library of services and content that Amazon worked so hard to create These products will have to survive on their own We are already seeing a possible movement towards this with Amazon set to unveil its own streaming service which will have more songs than what Prime offers and will cost per month outside of the Prime bundle This unbundling of products could be good for Amazon if it succeeds but does offer them up to more competition Amazon music as a part of Prime does not directly compete with Spotify Amazon streaming does directly compete with Spotify which makes the chances of success much lower The key value in having a Prime customer is not the subscription fee It is the fact that it locks in a customer Once a subscriber is locked in for a year it makes little sense to go to another website where shipping may not be free Prime subscribers order much more goods from Amazon and grow over time Subscribers want to get their moneys worth so it makes sense they would order more from the website According to Weinstein in nonPrime members spent under Prime members who joined in January spent in and those who joined in January spent in Prime members increase their spending by per year Paying for this subscription is perfect for Amazon because if Amazon just offered the service for free and found a way to raise prices across the board the subscribers wouldnt be locked in Any unbundling that Amazon has to do could disrupt the business model is a great price because consumers are able to rationalize their subscription after a few purchases It is similar to a season pass at a theme park which makes economic sense if you visit twice If WalMart forces Amazon to lower prices or unbundle the Prime subscription it could begin to make sense for consumers to subscribe to multiple free shipping services which eliminates Amazons virtual monopoly on Prime subscribers online purchases A lower subscription may change the psychology of the consumer and make them less worried about making sure they get their moneys worth on the subscription WalMart is way behind Amazon in online subscriptions for free day shipping In fact WalMart hasnt even ended the ShippingPass pilot program and launched it fully However WalMart is showing it is serious about the program by dropping the day shipping plan to days and offering a free day trial WalMart will likely never come out with any type of services such like Amazon has with video and music This allows it to charge a lower price This along with having physical stores to return items to gives it an edge in competing with Amazon when it expands the amount of products which have free day shipping If WalMart can perfect this deal so that it begins to steal customers from Amazon it could cause Amazon to unbundle the Prime service in order to compete on a level playing field This is a potential negative for Amazon because those other services will have to compete on their own and because it may begin to make sense to purchase multiple yearly subscriptions which would end Amazon Primes dominance I wrote this article myself and it
