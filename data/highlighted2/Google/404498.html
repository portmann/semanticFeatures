increasing maturity Despite current growth problems I remain confident in the companys executive team premium strategy and product pipeline Apples NASDAQ AAPL Q FY earnings results and revenue guidance for the June quarter marks the end of an era The company has reported the first yearoveryear sales drop in iPhones history and forecasts another decline in sales Even if we avoid the tough iPhone comparisons from and look at yearovertwoyears sales growth my iPhone Q FY unit estimate based on Apples guidance would still show one of the slowest iPhone growth rates on record Management refers to economy and currency headwinds yet at the same time sticking with the Q FY comparison Apple now benefits from having new iPhone models including larger form factors a new lower price point with the iPhone SE and extended distribution reach in developing countries There is more to iPhone demand than just the macroeconomic factors and tough comparisons The growth trend clearly reveals the increasing level of iPhones maturity and suggests it will be more and more difficult to achieve further growth for Apples most important product The very fact that the current talking point regarding iPhones growth has centered on India shows just how much the product has matured over time We are now at a stage where iPhone has POS SKUs different price points and features so advanced that they increasingly over serve its user base All of this is set in a mature smartphone environment where most of the growth in developed markets has been extracted the Chinese economy is slowing down Apple went from sales growth in the yearago quarter to an decline in Q FY and there are questions whether future growth in markets like India can even offset declines elsewhere Adding up to bad news sales of the iPad and Mac are declining the Apple Watch is only being established in the very young wearables market and the healthy and growing services business doesnt quite fit AAPLs hardware narrative on Wall Street Carl Icahns exit from the stock then only underlines the current situation Despite current problems with growth I have confidence in Apples leadership strategy and product pipeline I understand it is unnerving when a corporation hits a bump and tempting to call for an immediate solution and suggest actions like changing the leadership andor strategy engaging in large MAs or being more like Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL or Facebook NASDAQ FB which seemingly introduce new products on a monthly basis However such thinking conveniently ignores several important facts It has been Tim Cooks executive team and its focused premium product approach that have led Apple to record sales and profits year after year The context of the companys current problems points to product maturity not issues within Apple Apples new products and services like Apple Watch Apple Pay and Apple Music are very successful in their respective categories and in absolute terms but viewed as lackluster when compared to the blockbuster success of the iPhone the most successful and profitable technology product of all time The more experimental broader and open product development approach of the likes of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and Amazon is attractive from the medias point of view however such a strategy often results in highprofile failures like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Glass or Amazon Fire Phone This would not be sustainable for Apples premium brand and its key component customer trust At the end of the day Apples narrow product portfolio generates more profit than all FANG companies combined Companys big rampup in RD hiring talent from the automotive industry recent large real estate transactions as well as various leaks strongly hint that Apple is working on a connected electric vehicle As far as new product categories go I dont think it can get any better than that Apples culture and focused product strategy is better suited for smaller acquisitions targeting talent and technology that fit into the existing product plans I dont think that Apple needs a significant change in leadership and strategy Apples capital return program may give investors the best hint about the future of the company Apple has again expanded the program adding B to the total program size of B and extending the timeframe to March The CRP consists of dividends and share repurchases with the majority of the program allocated for the stock buyback I understand that as management having high confidence in the sustainability of the current product portfolio and in the prospects of the future product lineup Dividends Apple has again increased its dividend by and as per CFO Luca Maestri plans for further annual increases going forward Despite current revenue growth problems the company is still a big cash flow machine having generated B of profit in the last quarter alone The iPhone business may be maturing however the smartphone remains the most important computing category with much room left for innovation The iPhone business is very likely to remain relevant for many more years and will continue to generate strong cash flows for the company fueling investments in future products and the CRP Stock Repurchase Program Apple continues buying back its stock having now completed B of the B share repurchase authorization This suggests and Luca Maestri confirms as much that the company is highly confident in its future product lineup and the value of its stock Apple plans to enter a brand new category with its rumored connected vehicle and its potential is not yet reflected in the share price Apple has hit a sales growth bump but this has to do more with the maturity of its key products rather than with fundamental flaws in the companys leadership and product strategy Apple has a bright future and the companys capital return program may be its best summary continuing strong cash flows from existing products and an exciting future in new product categories namely in reimagining personal transportation Authors Note If you have enjoyed reading my
