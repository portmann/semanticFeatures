Apple Music The Next Maps Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Blogger Jim Dalrymple has complained about losing his music library as a result of Apple Music Some are likening the failure of Apple Music to the Apple Maps fiasco The negative PR may depress Apple shares in the month of August but this should turn around due to new products in the December quarter Last week long time Apple NASDAQ AAPL bloggers Jim Dalrymple and John Gruber went online to complain about Apple Music Dalrymple complained that an entire library of over songs had been wiped out by Apple Music Gruber chimed in iCloud Photos gets right everything that Apple Music gets wrong While the problems with Apple Music may not be as serious as claimed they add to the upswell of negative Apple sentiment following its June quarter earnings report Dalrymples account of his Music experience appears in loopinsightcom and has already been reported and elaborated on as in this Business Insider article Dalrymple is no Applehater yet his frustration with Music is palpable I had high hopes for Apple Music I really wanted it to work and become my default music streaming service but after the problems Ive experienced over the last couple of weeks Im disabling it altogether While Apple Music Radio and Playlists worked well adding music to my library is nothing short of a mindblowing exercise in frustration The Business Insider article is typical of the kind of gloating condemnation we can expect in the tech media BI quoted Anil Dash described as a blogger and entrepreneur If someone as expert as Dalrymple is this flummoxed that puts Apple Music on par with Apple Maps as a failure of user experience In fact Maps is not the failure that has been portrayed in numerous articles in the business media As made clear at this years WWDC Maps is now used times more frequently by iOS users than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Maps But the quote shows how this is going to be spun A couple of days ago Forbes published Frustration And Anger As Apples Reputation Tumbles recounting the various problems Apple has had in the past year such as WiFi issues in OS X on up to the post by Dalrymple Dalrymple subsequently reported that he had gotten most of the lost music back but it took a visit to Apple headquarters to do that and hes still missing a few hundred songs Gruber quotes iOS developer Marco Arments view of Apple Music iTunes is designed by the Junk Drawer Method I have plenty of plausible theories on why iTunes didnt get the iCloud Photos treatment why Apple Music was bolted onto this ancient crufty legacy app instead of discontinuing iTunes dropping its obsolete functions and starting fresh with a new app and a CloudKitbased service Engineering resources time to market iPods Windows and people with slow internet connections A quick perusal of Apples support pages seems to confirm the diagnosis of Arment and Gruber iOS device users got a unique standalone Apple Music app while Mac and Windows users got Apple Music integrated into a new version of iTunes There are problems across the board with Music but Mac and Windows users seems to be having the most problems Clearly the decision to integrate with iTunes was marketing driven Apple could use its existing iTunes customer base to promulgate Apple Music more widely than just the iOS device world The clean sheet approach would have yielded a better app but it would have been an app that many iTunes users would have ignored As undesirable as integration with iTunes might have been that isnt where the real failure lies Apples software deployments such as its major OS upgrades increasingly betray a lack of testing Software testing is increasingly important as operating systems become embedded in larger service ecosystems Developers dont like to do testing Wed rather develop cool new features The kind of thorough ringing out that good testing performs seems almost destructively sacrilegious Thats why major software companies maintain separate organizations whos sole purpose is testing otherwise known as software quality assurance Testing is necessary because the developers are such lousy testers Everything a developer produces has bugs Always Software QA seems to be getting short shrift these days at Apple Probably its a growth thing But if Apple cant perform adequate testing then they need to do what competitors such as Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT are doing Microsoft has been holding a protracted beta for Windows letting volunteer Windows Insiders do the testing for them Apple has been doing something similar for the upcoming iOS and OS X El Capitan releases Beta testing works Why didnt Apple release Music as a beta Apparently whoever was in charge thought Music was good to go I hope that wasnt Iovine It shouldnt have been his call Hes not a software guy Increasingly Apple seems to be in a hurry when theres no discernible reason Perhaps its to counteract the appearance of a lack of agility that goes with being so big Whatever the reason Apples premature release of products whether Maps or Music is only premature not failure Software can always be fixed It may not be pretty under the hood It may not be the clean sheet that Gruber would want But iTunes Music can be made to work and Im sure it will eventually The real problem here is not the impact to Apples customers Probably all the problems and frustrations reported by bloggers and visible on the support forums is just a small fraction of the overall experience people are having The real problem is that the media run with this as confirmation of the Apple Is In Decline view Its hard to quantify the impact of such missteps but Im sure there is one How better to explain the markets reaction to the recent earnings reports of Apple and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN As Philip ElmerDeWitt has pointed out Apple grew faster and had much more profit than Amazon in the June quarter yet Apple tanked after its earnings release while Amazon soared Apple is viewed as much more vulnerable to its own judgment Apples success is viewed as dependent on its judgment about the products and services it provides If Apple makes a mistake if Apple doesnt design the next hit product its viewed as potentially catastrophic Apple isnt really as vulnerable as that but there is a heavy dependence on iPhone which makes people nervous Apples attempts at diversification have been a mixed bag Apple Pay has been impressively free of stumbles Apple Watch seems very hurried in retrospect with not enough product available from the beginning Apple Music also seems to have been very rushed Apples image will suffer as a result of Music in the short term Probably this will keep the stock depressed through the month of August Every time Apple stumbles its always the same story how the mighty are fallen Long term Apple investors have learned to weather such storms but those with a shorter investment horizon will probably bail out of Apple further depressing the stock Once again I regard any such fluctuations as a buying opportunity This Fall is shaping up to be a particularly good one for Apple Apple Watch will be everywhere in the US as Best Buy starts to offer it The new iPhone S will be available There will probably be a new Apple TV as well as a new larger screen iPad Pro iOS and Mac OS X El Capitan will arrive probably with resolutions for most problems with Apple Music The product pipeline for Apple going into the December quarter looks fuller than it has in years Investors who weather the
