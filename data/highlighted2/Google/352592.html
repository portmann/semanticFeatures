class='textDiv'>The Fitbit SellOff Is A Great Buying Opportunity Fitbit Inc NYSEFIT Seeking Alpha We bought in after the recent selloff that sent shares down Millennials dedication to fitness and technology is the perfect mix for the company to profit from With no new Apple Watch announced last week we feel consumers which were holding out with head to Fitbit now The companys diverse product assortment gives it an edge and we expect to see strong sales figures this year We expect Fitbit NYSE FIT sales to pick up in the next couple of quarters making the recent selloff that dragged the share price down an incredible buying opportunity in our opinion We expect a health and wellness boom rises in disposable income and millennial dedication to technology to be the catalysts for this We have been holding off buying a Fitbit for a little while now because we were hopeful of a new Apple Watch being released by Apple NASDAQ AAPL The Apple Watch is a great piece of technology that we are really fond of and superior to anything in the market in our opinion but having not bought one on release we are somewhat reluctant to buy one now lest it become outdated by a new release later this year or next We fall in the camp of consumers that dont need all its many features and are mainly interested in fitness and health tracking When Apple announced a drop in the price of the Apple Watch it wasnt what we were hoping for so we headed out to the shops to get a Fitbit Were just not that interested in buying the latest Apple Watch model but will gladly look at buying the new version when it does eventually get released We dont think we are alone in this Health and wellness has been on an incredible rise around the world as people begin to really take care of themselves You only need to look at the success of companies such as Lululemon NASDAQ LULU Nike NYSE NKE and Under Armour NYSE UA to see how those in the space are benefiting We expect many of those who wish to track their health and fitness will opt for one of Fitbits many offerings from now on until the new Apple Watch arrives Analysts are expecting revenue to come in at million for the current quarter which ends in a couple of days While we feel there could be a surprise in this quarter we are more bullish on the next quarter We think this would be the quarter where the company can start to win those consumers like ourselves which have been sitting on the sidelines waiting to see what is going to be released The key here is the weather The spring equinox has just been and this now means we are heading toward the warmer months in the northern hemisphere In our experience it is about this time of the year when people start thinking about losing those extra holiday pounds and getting in shape for summer We believe that consumers are very interested in tracking their fitness When you see the progress you are making it can be a real encouragement As Fitbit covers price points from entrylevel all the way up to premium we feel they are positioned well to benefit The Fitbit Alta is a great starting point for consumers looking at getting started This new release is priced at is aesthetically pleasing tracks fitness and sleep and even gives you text and call alerts We purchased a Fitbit Alta and have been very pleased with it We think that with disposable income levels rising this sort of purchase is an easy one to make The muchdocumented love of fitness and technology that millennials have could prove to be massive boost to the future prospects of Fitbit When the new Apple Watch does come out it could cause a drop in sales for a little while Thankfully though we see the varied price points as a great tool to potentially combat this What we might find is that sales drop off at the premium end of Fitbits range for a little while but the entrylevel should hopefully remain strong As you can see above <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>Trends shows an increase in search for Fitbit since the back end of It has trended down recently but if March bounces up partial data shown then it could be a sign that there is still strong demand from consumers As you can see on the chart above the company has lost over half of its market value yeartodate We believe that the most recent selloff has created a great buying opportunity that investors should snap up We value the stock at times sales This is a much lower level that the times sales that the stock has traded at on average in the past but we feel it is best to be conservative with Fitbit considering the negative market sentiment that seems to envelop the company For fiscal we forecast Fitbit to produce revenue of billion At times sales and with an estimated million shares outstanding this gives us a target price of The stock last traded at which means this is upside of Overall we are confident that the company is positioned well to benefit from the factors mentioned above Times may have been hard for shareholders recently but we feel the selloff was overdone and there should be plenty of upside up ahead for investors I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not
