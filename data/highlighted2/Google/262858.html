the past years Yahoo YHOO has lost nearly of its peak value and this is taking into account its utterly and completely lucky gains from Alibaba During those fifteen years and lets remember on the day ofYahoos price peak Mark Zuckerberg was a yearold high school student Yahoo has struggled mightily to recapture its lost glory only to fail again and again in spite of a series of blonde female CEOs whose principal difference appears to be whether they use profanities in public or not As a person who has been online since literally I have a strong sense as to whats good and what isnt so good and Ive always thought Yahoo sucked out loud Its astonishing to me that they are ever still around And in a way they are not because their enterprise value was recently calculated as negativethirteen billion dollars Now the fact that Marissa Mayer has made her vast fortune by being really really lucky first as an early <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>employee with a key qualification being outlined in this link and later as a PR stunt as the pretty new face of Yahoo is something thats been covered repeatedly in the hallowed halls of Slope However I saw something earlier this week that just made me roll my eyes again as the world proved once again how Mayer gets a pass on the Yahoo debacle by being consistently fertile and yes these are seriously the news headlines for the company I have no problem with people getting fantastically rich by creating value The tens of billions that Elon Musk Mark Zuckerberg Larry Paige Sergey Brin and Jeff Bezoshave made God bless em But Yahoo stumbled onto a good investment with Alibaba long before Mayer showed up and because the world happened to go crazy about Chinese internet stocks at just the right time it saved Yahoo from bankruptcy And even with this huge advantage heres thekindof performance Yahoo has seen lately led by everyones favorite narcissist I think the reason she gets a free pass is because people are afraid of appearing sexist I dismiss this notion based on two important facts first that any CEO who had stumbled so badly and become so rich doing so deserves scorn whether they are male female or Caitlyn Jenner And second if anyone on this planet could be accused of using Marissa Mayers sexuality with respect to her career I think one need look no farther than the woman herself Sat cbaba Investors need something good about the company so that they can put their money in Its a PR business but I believe there are billions of stupid money slushing around which can be put into Yahoo stocks just because its COE is a sexy woman Sat RonArgent Sat the grateful un fantasy gambling is a game changer i notice some state DAs have gone after Fan Duel but no one has gone after Yahoo this is bigger than legalized pot economically Bezos is probably trying to get in on their business Sat BarkingCat I have used Yahoo as my main Portal is that word still even used since the mid s My main go to for stock market was Yahoo Finance Now the only use I have for the is email I think they suck in a major way and will force myself to migrate my email to another vendor I was going to choose one in the EU but now I think I will go for one in Russia Reason is simple If they all read your email then I dont give a shit if the Russians do I dont live in their sphere of influence Sat besnook rather harsh yhoo is an unfortunate debacle that tried to cling too long to the old internetone of the original do no evil internet companies still alive in zh not quite as bad as aol and sun microsystems and others they are still a cash cow and their way out of their self imposed morass can now only be saved by the alibaba shares that is about as genius as cute little mayer gets i am disappointed there are no tight ass pictures Sat Tim Knight from Just to show the power of highend makeup hair stylists and Photoshop heres a bit more of an authentic picture Sat brown_hornet Do NOT
