presentation despite your very busy schedule We would like to start the presentation of the business results of Q of FY We will have the Internet broadcasting and also we will have the ondemand broadcasting as well I would like to introduce the representatives from Yahoo We have CEO President Mr Manabu Miyasaka and we have CFO Mr Toshiki Oya First of all Mr Miyasaka will give a presentation then we will open the floor for QA We plan to end this session at oclock Now Mr Miyasaka please Good afternoon everybody I would like to give you the business results of FY Q Please take a look at our highlight Revenuewise it was JPY billion yearonyear growth of Comparatively speaking in terms of operating income we had to invest in ecommerce and big data and also credit card We have already I mentioned and that that we will be investing in new businesses therefore we made much investment and therefore we only increased by in terms of the operating income And in terms of the quarterly it was minus because in terms of our last year we had the Japan Net Bank acquisition gains but this quarter we did not have the gains of that nature therefore we have a difference And in terms of the advertisementrelated revenue we increased by and in terms of paid search advertisements we had a growth of singledigit negative regime and we were able to control our situation accordingly On the other hand display advertisement did well and we were able to grow by yearonyear So in the current situation we grew dramatically Ecommerce did well and we grew by And this is the highlight for Q Firstly in terms of page view smartphone registered more than and we celebrated that mark and DAV is more like unique users and we were able to grow by But in terms of page view which is quantitative figure smartphone exceeded PC and for the first time in our history we were able to increase smartphone in May which exceeded the page view of PC We are shifting to smartphone and one point was whether we can increase our advertisement business especially display In May we released Yahoo Japans startup page in full timeline view format and we are growing very dramatically in terms of the advertisement and display did very well and so the smartphone display gave the momentum of the growth in advertisement and we can grow page view more and not only the page search but we will be able to grow the display in smartphones as well and that is a very historical moment for our business And in terms of domestic ecommerce we grew by Auction grew by and as compared to the fourth quarter we did very well and especially we grew in the shopping business and the shopping grew by and this is a dramatic growth as compared to the previous quarter This is the monthly page view Last May was and year before was and now we did more than And so in the past it was PC which gave the growth of smartphones but now the situation is reversed and now we are centered around our smartphone business This is the trend of monthly page views and red one is the smartphone usage and the green portion is PC And PC is doing well as well and smartphone has been growing very dramatically and we have been focusing on that but then that does not mean that we are not doing well in PC I think we are growing our share in PC There are different survey and research data and some research data mentions that Yahoos PCs share is declining and but based on our research data that we use we are very strong in PC and on top of that we are growing our share in smartphones In terms of the revenue yearonyear we grew by In terms of operating income net increased by recording JPY billion and in terms of the net income it was negative yearonyear recording JPY billion But last quarter meaning yearonyear last Q we had a Net Bank impact and that was about JPY billion and so if we exclude that portion of the gain which we recorded in Q of we did relatively well in this quarter as well And out of JPY billion our quarterly revenue the largest is the marketing solution which is centered around advertisement and display advertising very well So we grew by and another pillar is consumer business Auction did very well as well and so this contributed to the revenue Shoppingwise I will talk about the details later But we are still in the stage of investment and therefore shopping we do not focus on the revenue but rather we are in the investment stage so consumerwise we did growth yearonyear and other businesswise we have YJ Card Incorporated Therefore yearonyear we were able to grow by This shows the quarterly margin In terms of the operating margin YJ Card is consolidated and we have a different impact of the consolidated entities and so we have different business models In terms of Yahoo we had a very high operating margin and by consolidating different group companies the operating margin might decline momentarily But in terms of the ratio of net income attributable to owners of the parent it is on par with the previous quarters and it is about and we will be able to maintain this level Now lets go into details of different KPIs In the past three years we wanted to convert ourselves from PC to smartphone companies and that was the main topic that we pursued And in terms of DUB we were able to become number one in smartphone and in terms of page view in May we were able to have a higher number in smartphone as compared to PC So I guess we were able to reach the goal that we have upheld three years ago And now not only growing in smartphones and generically speaking we want to increase the usage of applications via smartphone and we want to be growing in that arena And so we will have the ECE revolution and we would like to further expand the transaction value and that will be the next threeyear challenge that we will be working at Now in terms of DUB in Q of we were able to do above in terms of smartphones and now it is DUBwise smartphone actually registers about PC and smartphones and tablets will be different devices that we will be catering to and there will be different user packed in and so we believe that ID is very important and we have to understand the customers and fully leverage on the big data that we have And so we want to increase the number of ID users as a multidevice parameters pertaining to the users must be understood via ID And so in terms of active user IDs we did more than million and this is a major milestone that we are enjoying So after this is over and now we would like to come to the companies with the more application usage by the users So that for example the weather and the news and navigations these are the specific areas on the users will be checking on a daily basis we might call it daily habit Daily habit applications when we look at this ranking and this is just we have the overwhelmingly strong area in these daily habits areas But now that we have to cover and there is a smartphone business also and on a smartphone if we have the strong in areas and then PC this is the basic ideas so that when it comes to daily habits so this is the ranking of daily ranking that is shown here on this slide but basically they will be in the top three in terms of the usage of these applications just like shown here on this slide So there are solidified at the foundation of this application business So the other application is not included in here and the ecommerce and the gain or also we would like to push up then also that the other types of applications on the top ranking And when it comes to ecommerce total domestic transaction values is now JPY billion So now we have achieved that double digit growth and particularly the shopping is very favorable just like here on this slide this red line represents that the transaction values grows yearonyear basis for the Yahoo shopping and Q in and then we have about last minutes a demand immediate before that is raising the consumption tax and now in the next year we have some directional fall after that but these are the two peaks and the bottoms of all this extraordinary factors But after we implemented that ecommerce revolutions and announcements of the revolutions after Q in now we are making a turnaround from the declining trend of the ecommerce and the Yahoo shopping and now we have achieved more than of growth And then also the latest figure is very favorable so I think that we have now beyond the steady growth growing trend And also for that is they need before that this the evolutions and we have some kind of a few years in a row where we experienced some kind of minus the growth but now similar to it we have in the turnaround and now we have over the to the of growth is now available just like this also for the auction And the last time we went through that and I mentioned that and we would like to and a shifting from the first aboard type of the businesses and growth but also I would like to make some kind of a upfront investment for some of the selected and promising businesses So thats why we have classified into Core Businesses and InvestmentStage Businesses And the core businesses remained at advertising auctions and the membership services and these added all and the core businesses which are now generating basic profits and for this we would like to try to push out that profits as much as possible and after having this profit we would like to take advantage of the profits for making that the upfront and proactive investments for the next future businesses so the shopping in credit card So and also these are the settlement business are classified as the InvestmentStage Businesses So let me explain about each of these business and Core Businesses and InvestmentStage Businesses one by one First of all for first one first of the Core Businesses is the Advertising Business Advertising Business compared yearonyear basis now we have a growth So now the paid search and we the control with us after the growth would be with the end of minus growth This is the way we have controlled So now the display ad have grown substantially and also the infeed space advertising has been very favorable And next slide represents that about the quarterly advertisingrelated revenue trends for both this display advertising and paid search And the paid search when we look at the size of the that revenue is still the largest business but still now we are shifting from the PC to the smartphone and those are the quality over the quarter has changed Thats why the margin has declined like this and again for this a minus plus minus but this is just about within the control of a plan to control range of this a specific margin of this business And growth of that business like this and on the other hand we would like to grow farther for this display advertising particularly how we can grow this display advertising business in smartphone is a key and extending from that two previous quarters it had a starting to and a surging and now we have an annual growth of close to the like this So what has pushed up this business and again I mentioned earlier the smartphone as the primary reason which pushed up our business growth of this advertising So now we have a closer to in that advertising revenue ratio from smartphone But particularly is the renewal of the Yahoo top page have contributed a lot no describable business trend and then we would like to we had invited the customers to the Yahoo the top page and encouraged users to find out their own specific services by themselves but now the renewal after making this we have a not just encouraging customers to find out that information but the best information is trying to find out that it is best suited to customers This is the major change After shifting this the top page now also we are making substantial investment for the big data analysis so thats taking advantage of the analysis of the big data where we try to recommend the best suited informations And now we have fully compared it and migrated to this new topup page So this is the major change thats the paradigm shift the ones we are sort of worried about and some we are worried about that we have the dramatic decline of access because the user could not catch up with that is kind of a major change over the top page and we would have utmost support this new renewal when indiscernible going to customer service but now we can successfully do soft land on this new top page And we have been successful so far The other thing is thats the major change in thats in infeed advertising is there is a new format we have introduced for advertising in this new format and also for this infeed advertising have been the favorable So and allinall and now we have a very successful period for the advertising When you look at the page view and in total as a now we will have just infeed advertising is very difficult to place in the ecommerce But when we look at the media rather than the pages I think that we still have a leeway to timing this infeed type advertisings So thats why we want to just expand this similar type of format into the other media service So this is the historical illustrations of the changing of advertising business since its foundations and advertising business has been the core business and pillar business since the foundation of Yahoo Japan But now the core products have changed year by year In the past few years YDN have been the most substantial pillar of our business And so without all this YDN we use timeline and then also premium DSP and are the new technology to render services we think that is going to support this business So thats all about advertising business Next let me talk about the auction business When it comes to auction business it has been also growing on a steady base steady level with the So once we have the auction has experienced a bit of minus growth but now we have a very steady growth of just about a those in a lower end to the middle of this single digit growth But still we have to improve the growth of these auctions So now were in a dominant positions of the Auction Business But how we can further improve our business So this is a major challenge for the Auction Business and what we have to do is that we need to redefine the market So far the Yahoo auction Yahoo was offered a price for to ask for exchange in the selling of the product which are not used in the households but when we look at this it leaves us a market for the household goods is at JPY trillion Its only that but when it comes to used car it has JPY trillion for the real estates Now it has the JPY trillion of the market so then we have the not there is a of much of this JPY trillion but we have to break into that new domain and the total of these used products and real estate and old mobile markets in total we have JPY trillion and we like to expand the business based on this When it comes to real estate I had announced that now were working together with these real estates so that we can provide and we like to offer the platform in which there is also real estates and the transactions will be activated together with the real estates And in terms of used cars Carview has a long history and knowhow and also networking of the industry so Carview and Yahoo will work together to further accelerate and invigorate the used car market And that is all about Yahoo And then and the third core business is membership services Yahoo Japan has been providing services to the premium members and we have been only talking about a premium membership business but from this quarter we will talk about monthly paid membership including Yahoo Premium Members as well So other than premium members we do have different monthly paid membership as well Therefore we will be growing advertisement and ecommerce and on top of that that we would like to focus on a stable business segment which is the monthly paid membership So in order to show that direction of our company we would like to talk about the membership services including the monthly paid membership ID so that you will be able to understand what we are doing If you provide you with cumulative number it is about million IDs on a monthly basis who are paying fees for the membership services and in terms of million IDs how can we further grow the membership We would like to focus on two major segments Firstly say monthly fee might be JPY JPY or JPY but we have to come up with attractive services and contents that people will be willing to pay that monthly fee And also we would like to diversify our distribution channel So there are two points We will develop new content and services and secondly expand our distribution channel Say we have entertainment pack and for the premium members they can get more points the loyalty points and a video monthly flat fee might be another services and also news might be another area that we can grow as a monthly stable income So we will be focusing on those types of services Regarding the distribution channel we will focus our energy as well Entrance of a premium members Yahoo is the only channel that we use to expand our premium membership but by leveraging other channels we were able to grow further more In the past two years we used SoftBank channel and we grew and so learning lessons from that we would like to develop new solutions and services and try to serve the members who we can capture through other distribution channels as well So that is all about our core business From here onward I would like to talk about the investment stage businesses namely shopping and credit card businesses Firstly shopping no matter which KPI you look at we are showing a very favorable trend In terms of the store IDs we were able to have more than an increase of times monthly yearonyear and in terms of the number of items we increased by on a monthly yearonyear basis And we have more than million items And also the convergent rate went up as well And the number of buyers grew by doubledigit In the past the conversion rate did not go up dramatically So we tried to have traffic going into our shopping site but by increasing our conversion rate we were able to really leverage on the traffic that we have And so we have the mechanism to lead the traffic to the shopping site And as we are trying to leverage on the point mechanism And in terms of the average number of purchases per user we are seeing an increase as well And by increasing the convergent rate we can actually lead the traffic to our shopping site and once that person buys one the very person will purchase again So we are seeing a very virtuous good cycle and we were able to increase by this quarter yearonyear We had an ecosystem in October we announced the ecommerce strategy and Ive mentioned about the shopping strategy that we will be leveraging so all the transaction value must be increased because the new strategy will increase the number of buyers and transactions by new and the more items there are more shoppers will be there and the more items will be listed on the shops so this is a very good cycle that we would like to run and operate And grey was the color that we used to show the status growth but now the red portion is increasing You see more shoppers and more buyers and more items and more sellers so we hope that more buyers as well as the larger transaction value portion can be read in the end of the day In terms of the advertisingrelated revenue part of the rise it is showing a favorable trend but we need more time to turn it to red and so we have to change the number of buyers and we want this circle to be totally red in the future How can we actually increase more buyers There are three user segments that we are addressing so that they can be solicited to do their shopping at our site Namely Yahoo premium members and YJ Card holders and SoftBank subscribers are the segments that were addressing In terms of the premium members they are the Yahoo premium members but when they shop they go to other ecommerce sites And I think that is such a pitiful case So for Yahoo premium members we have a potential pointer system specifically speaking they will get fivefold points and also if you use the application they can get three fold or and total you will be able to enjoy fold points So these are the preferential measures that are being taken And so premium members will be enticed to do their shopping at our site Another segment is the SoftBank subscribers they have about million subscribers all together on a line basis and many of them are not experienced in ecommerce Shopping is a universal service and I believe that should be the case So whether you have high literacy or low literacy whether you are young or old you should be able to enjoy shopping Having said that we developed a new technology with SoftBank and in a minute or rather in a matter of ten seconds you can complete a purchase And we are creating such a flow and this will be released in October according to our plan So in the past you have to enter your ID you have to enter your personal information and address and using smartphone it was so cumbersome But if you use Yahoo Shopping site you will be able to instantaneously do the shopping and SoftBank has many subscribers So I hope that we will be able to cater to their needs Another endeavor we want cater to about million people living here in Japan but not only that but we want to expand our scope abroad as well We will be collaborating with Alibaba Group and so in terms of the stores opened here in Japan site we want the nonJapanese to leverage on it as well Tmall has about million people So instead of million we would like to address million people who exist as potential shoppers in China And we will start this in full Now I would like to explain about the credit card or the paymentssettlement business We started the credit card business and in terms of the valid cardholders we exceeded million And in FY in Q we believe that we can increase this to million to million or rather million to million In terms of issuing cards it is a costly proposition and so we will not just blindly issue cards but we have the premium members and ecommerce users and people who do shopping on the Internet Those will be the main segment that we will be investing in So we will try to efficiently acquire new users So now we have about million as the total numbers and for focusing on that these members so that we will have to put emphasis on this the utilizations we would like to have more active users And this year were going to have a continuous growth at the same time we make that the upfront investment for that this and credit card and settlement and businesses and the ecommerce But I would like to continue our efforts in country we are doing A Unidentified Company Representative Lets open the floor to questions If you have a question would you please raise your hand we are going to pass the microphone to you and would you please mention your name and the company the name of your company please And if you have any you have multiple questions would you please make question one by one one for each Okay Is there anyone who has a question Okay One and the one wearing the grey jacket and sitting in the second row from the front please Thank you very much Im Sugiyama from Goldman Sachs I have two questions My first question is that now an impact of the timeline format introductions the page view and the staying hours and the staying minutes and also whats the impact on the YDN and actually the percentage or the actual values or what have the impact on the revenues if you can disclose please Okay With the introducing the timeline format the number of clicks have substantially increased and also CBC also units advertising the price for the click also have grown and this is infeed type of advertising so they were included in the top page and advertising would be embedded in that infeed space but we are going to have more advertising positions but on the other hand without click it doesnt make any sense So in this sense but clicks weights is really favorable and also unit price is very steady So both the quality and quantity have been favorable for growth This is our conclusions And when we count the percentage of the total advertising business is that when we made the announcement in April and when we conducted this meeting we I mentioned about is the growth of this YDN advertising growth and we cannot find out what would be the percentage due to this the timeline format but now this Q now we have YDN the growth was so it seems like about was pushed up with this the new format of advertising we suppose Okay thank you very much My next question is growth of the YDN and after the May and now we are using that this new format again and have contributed only one and half months since youve started this format but now after July we expected about the months was of the impact and also the branded panel and added down to YDN So based on the launching that kind of different format of advertising and after July what do you expect about the mobile and display advertising growth after July What do you expect Yes And now we have a little bit more on that basis of the so the organic growth would decline but we will expect that we have a positive impact of this timeline format So also in the first half we expect about again the of growth on YDN and when it comes to video advertising currently still we couldnt see any its too early to find out the specific impacts all of the video advertising So we do not incorporate that Thank you I am Yoneshima of Barclays Securities I joined you after you already started your presentation so maybe you have already mentioned about it and my question is a followon You have a timeline format at different sites and I want to know what sites you have a timeline format and as President Miyasaka said you can further expand that format And my question is quite qualitative but what are the pages and sites I can leverage on the timeline format and how much would that booster the advertising revenue Can you give me a ballpark figure I am Yasava in charge of media We have top page and news which use a feedin advertisement and for other media as well we will try to see whether there is any affinity with feedin sports news you tend to read a content as I guess it has a high affinity with infeed advertisement But then there are some media that does not really suit the timeline format So we are not going to force that media to use the feedin format And so we will always think about the user experience this and whether it is a good affinity or not We have Yahoo partners as well and we will be aggressively assisting in making the partners sign into feedin so with the news agencies we will try to collaborate so that infeed advertisement format again be conducted and we can convert their site into the timeline format May I then As a potential so within Yahoo Japan we can further expand our services and also we will expand to the partners site as well in terms of leveraging on the new timeline format And in terms of the advertisers we are talking to a limited segment but in the future we will further broaden our scope and also in terms of personalization and that uses big data by improving the accuracy and CPC might improve further more So its very difficult to quantitatively explain to you the impact But Im sure that there will be a broader impact of timeline format I see that your timeline infeed advertisement is trending favorably and in terms of the advertisement revenue you will further increase it in the singledigit area But do you think you might be able to reach the twodigit increase do you tangibly feel any positive impact We gave a forecast for Q and at that time in terms of the advertisement revenue we mentioned that the growth will be the higher end of the single digit and in reality we ended up an increase of And so there were several points increase that has been enhanced And therefore after Q and onward I believe that we will be able to grow the advertising revenue in the higher half of the single digit Thank you I have another question My last question You mentioned about the ecosystem of shopping and the red portion is increasing and I believe that in the end of the day the advertisement will boost the revenue of the shopping you have more sellers and more buyers and what would be did trigger for the sellers or the shops to have the advertisement do you think will be the transaction value that will trigger more advertisers to have advertisement or what is the triggering event that will boost more advertisement In terms of the transaction value I think we are trending very favorably and so as an ecosystem ie as a site I think the sellers are being attracted to our site And in terms of the advertisement on top of display we have a PR option and we are providing more choices For example in Q the marketing service is not that large yet we were able to increase it to billion and we are seeing a favorable trend for the increase and in terms of total transaction value of FY we will be aiming at a high growth and take gradewise we will like to be focus on that parameter as well but in FY we will be more or less focusing on the investment So in terms of the advertisement or contribution to the total revenue it will happen sometime after Thank you Im Iwasa from Mizuho Securities I have three questions My first question is that its concerning question of the previous persons but in what we call infeed advertising and you answered about the infeed advertising but it seems like thats your the forecast of the advertising based on the infeed advertising should be higher than the current forecast but now you mentioned that about billion would be thats the growth of the infeed advertising so it account for about Over the total advertising revenues in this Q this is only about one and half months so if we have about fully contribution of the three months contributions and when we think about also the more clicks by the users we expect about expected the values and the contribution of the this over the total advertising revenues in this Q this is only about one and half months So if we have about fully contribution of the three months contributions and when we think about also the more clicks by the users we expect about expected the values and the contribution of the advertising will be more substantial and within any of the specific problem you can expect the double digits growth as advertising as a whole and then also it would be a very profitable business So it would have pushed up all of that in the profitability and margin of the business annually So are you just little bit conservative of this kind of a forecast Okay First of all when it comes to advertising the other factor is that sponsored search let me talk about sponsored search In this Q about minus is that growth yearonyear this Q So I mentioned earlier and it has been as we expected it was a minus And the major factor is that declining PC have been stabilized a bit so the advertising distribution to the partner sites to the smartphone have declined This is the other factor and this trend will continue for the time being And when it comes to Q this page search will be thats about a little of the of indiscernible So for annually we have business forecast and we were going to have the same trend in annually so when it comes to sponsors such as like this it seems like thats a in the Q it seems like thats the margin of decline of the paid search would be larger than we expected But when you go advertising for the partner site on the smartphone and it is not so much profitable so the impact on the profitability is a little bit limited So compared to that that should decline in revenues and the contribution to that the profit is not that much And when it comes to the other factors we dont include is thats the video advertising was not included in the forecast So it seems like a little bit conservative as you have mentioned but anyway thats and the higher single digits to that close to the doubledigit growth we expect Okay thank you very much My second question is about you also mentioned to that the share of the portal side is increasing But the other media reported that the share and the other player have the indiscernible as now they have the lower market share with another major player but it was reported in the media so what would be the difference in that this of the survey or the analysis or the what makes the difference with your estimates and the other medias investigations Yes actually I supposed that this question will come out so that I have Id like to show you some one of the informations a lot of research companies are implementing conducting surveys with a lot of different users So this is based on research and for example Nielsen this is based on Nielsen and then also and when it comes to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>actually this is the patterns of the market share between Yahoo Japan and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>left hand side this is indiscernible visitors on PC and also is shown on the right hand side And there is no any major dramatic change in the market share or just like this on the trend So based on our own data and Nielsen it is shown like this So there is no any major change in the share just like that This is our perspective Okay thank you very much And last of all now when it comes to indiscernible had become the Chairman and the change of central management so it will be just a little bit change in the positioning of the Board of Directors and in this circumstance indiscernible For example and for the best indiscernible cash and so now you are concerned like investment in overseas market and you are going about think about how to do with and send relationship with indiscernible So it doesnt change on the central management is there any change and we expect in the future and the business as a whole I would like to know about it And now we have Chairman indiscernible there is no any major change and also came to Japan and Japan we have some kind of cost discussions and when shall I we dont have about any the lower final level of the discussion of what we should do with the type of is not that but we will like to have a more that and high level discussions but what happens the Internet and years ahead futures and kind of longterm and high level discussions with the chairman And so and its really informative we have that kind of discussion with the chairman so its not that for example But we dont think that kind of any short term change MA in the next year but whether then we like to have more longterm perspective and then we have imports and so I think that for example how we can be proactive enough to a grab that in the future trend of Internet So in the sense thats its a good informative and yes thats really impact I think I am Nagao of Nomura Securities I have three questions So one at a time firstly it is about advertisement You mentioned about customers who might be using infeed advertisement And so do you think you will be able to grow in the future of holistically speaking Do you have any take on this subject Okay indiscernible of marketing solution company In terms of SS customers conducting crosssell The answer is no We are approaching in the advertisers who will be a good fit for infeed and we have very limited channel of approach and of course we will further expanded So using online and we will try to approach advertisers and also intend of headsets are users we will systematically but then there is a future now yet Thank you Second question it is about net flex over all country Japan this for and did that do you think the strategy or change and net flex will we have charge distribution give advertisement and in terms of it will be either initial portal to lead the traffic and so I want to know what is the future of strategy of so that you can further grow the business We did not talk much about beta today we would like to further grow business and that is one of our core businesses You mentioned net flex and I am sure that them coming to Japan will change the total landscape in Japan and we thinking about different strategy but then the time is not right for us to talk about in details yet Anyhow we will focus on especially on certain around other than UGC and we would like to be the dominant player and we do not have any intention to get that position away In terms of being Q was you did very well and in July you had a very good start and in terms of the transaction value what will be the total amount in July Regarding July we have in the close the month yet So this will be about part figure Yearoveryear we will be going about And Q customer based will further increase so for the fiscal year we in growing by and we definitely want to secure that number Thank you Indiscernible I have a two questions first one is that now what panel has been struggling so a you have to start again for working together with distributors and also when you mentioned that front panel and PC is it seems like it can be the problem that how are we going to reconstruct the channel and how do we think that rebuild this business of this front panel Do you have any idea Okay Yes you are right and I just pointed out now we have some kind of weakness here in this area so that which advertisement and old video advertisement should be fully utilized and also the front panel Two we would like to just emphasis more in front panel And now we have started discussions with let say to the major ad agency and so that we can rebuild this business strategy So I think Im sure that we can able to build it Okay my next question is that your business with indiscernible revenue share was SGA or now it would be excluded so and its included in SGA what is the specific generator we have to look at Im Tomimatsu of Merrill Lynch I have a question for indiscernible advertisement For major its that android proceeded IOS in terms of AMP advertisement Not Yahoo application but news applicationwise it seems that there was a time lag and in terms of the growth for Q do you think there is more leeway for further growth And based on that assumption in terms of Q I believe that will be a major driver of growth and in terms of Q you did not provide guidance figure but I guess they will be at the singledigit and negative operating income and in terms of the second quarter can you give us some guideline and if you do have any intention to disclose that number can you tell me what is your take for Q So one question at a time please Okay So in terms of the application in browser and iOS your question is we gradually increase the distribution Well we just conducted a test in bits and pieces So whenever you access I guess you happen to see some test And after May we are converted to timeline And so in Q its fullfledged endeavor IMES our media company after May we officially started timeline and in terms of application we are conducting tests and if the tests are actually accepted by the audience or not there is a difference and so depending on the test schedule iOS and Android had different schedule but from here onward for all the web and applications we will have timeline and infeed advertisement Regarding news we just started the distribution and we did not go fullfledged because of the test schedule So in terms of our news applications users you are increasing and in terms of news application you do not have infeed in the Q timeframe but you will have in Q So that will be a major impact right Yes it is true because I guess we will see some impact because we will have infeed and timeline in news applications Regarding forecast in Q at the very beginning we mentioned that we will have a singledigit negative increase of profit but in the end of the day we were able to turn positive because we did pretty well And in Q what will be the forecast of course there will be ups and downs but I guess our initial forecast will not change In terms of revenue it will be about growth and in terms of profit I think we will be about the same as that of Q level As I have mentioned in the presentation we will grow our revenue but at the same time we will be aggressive in conducting investment in the area that we want to grow So when you look at the profit and loss in Q the total scheme will not change I want to confirm regarding SS there will be a decline so that will be a negative factor and you changed the contract with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>and in terms of the negative factor of SS I believe that it will not dramatically impact your profit So SS minus one might be minus rather but it seems that you have this profit scheme that will not dramatically impact your profit am I correct in the understanding of the SS impact and so if my understanding is correct I do not think that reduction of SS will not dramatically negatively impact your profit In terms of the new contract with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Google </span>in terms of sponsored search revenue increase the revenue will decrease by to and now we are in the negative regime and the negative number will further increased by two to three points Having said that in terms of smartphones upon the site decline the impact of that on our profit is not that large therefore that portions decline will not dramatically impact our overall profit In terms of Tpoint I know that you are leveraging on Tpoints scheme especially in shopping When you think about YDN and potential I believe that you will be using Tpoint data and maybe you can use that for targeting your advertisement and so anybody who use the indiscernible or one who went to a certain kind of store you will be able to mix and match different information and so online and offline can be merged together to come up with more targeted advertisement So as a Tpoint scheme do you think that you can really maximize usage and are you really going through that project and if you can come up with more targeted advertisement based on Tpoint information when will that kind of advertisement be launched I believe that there will be a major change and may I answer the previous question We would like to increase the number of pages that can be converted to timeline format And we will do that quantitatively speaking in both Yahoo as well as nonYahoo sites And just visually making a timeline will not to be suffice but we need to have the big databased advertisement as well as article So its very important to use the big data behind the scene and I mentioned about credit card and shopping as the investments that were making because its very visible But we are making CapEx in the area of big data So more than shopping credit card we are making much investment in a continuous manner in big data and we will be in doing that and the more we do the infeed advertisement the more we will be investing in big data So we will have upperhand in the competitive landscape And as a company we have a multibig data we have commerce data and we have search data and we have article browsing data and we have such abundant data We have multiple big data but are we really maximizing on the treasure that we have Well we cannot say yes in totality And so we have much big data from diverse sources so we have DS a data and science headquarters has been established and this entity is going through the ways to leverage on big data And so we will be able to pursue both a quantitative and qualitative goal We do have big data and we havent really maximized on the data and data and science headquarters department is putting their very best effort to go through that And the rest of all in the new formation of the board of directors you have dramatically changed the board of directors organization so that there are a lot of perspective from the governance but when it comes for the President Mr Miyasaka is the only person who is actually executing the businesses because only one Mr Miyasaka is the only one if we can actually be getting bolder in the execution of all these businesses and this seems like a little bit strange and what happens for the future and I had difficulty in thinking about what happens in the future but this new formation and the new organization of all board of directors and executives come out there with the other person has to stay there in the board of directors What did you change like this Board of Directors organizations and would you please explain the background of this change Yes well so lets see and they would be get separated thats the management and executions So now there is no problem they can for many kinds of benefits for the shareholders I think and a decent and new formation of the Board of Directors is very very strong formation for the business And so far Mr Son was Chairman and also Yahoo Inc providing the advice for having some very good informative discussions now we have a new Chairman and indiscernible and this is he is really that legal expert of that international global Internet business so that we can have now we are in that environment we can have that kind of they believe informative inputs from these two giants in the global Internet business so that they serve a good environment for us On a longterm basis Im convinced that there will be that the comments will change and looking at this new formation from the shortterm and the longterm perspective but I personally think that from the longterm basis and longterm perspective I think that this is a wonderful formation and we have informed the shareholders I think Okay So occasionally and what happens with that say the stocks and share owned by the Yahoo Inc So now when I look at this Board of Directors organization what happens with the decisions made by this new Board of Directors because now you have more officials from Yahoo Inc also you have more directors from SoftBank so that when it comes to basic standing point of the Board of Directors is there any change about this for example and how to handle that kind of for example stocks owned by the Yahoo Inc or something like that Yes And so this is that Board of Directors at Yahoo Japan have to act for the maximization of benefit of Yahoo Japans shareholders there isnt any difference any change And whatever the formations or whatever the compositions of this Board of Directors there is not any change Do you have any other question Okay thats all the procedures and agenda for todays meeting Thank you very
