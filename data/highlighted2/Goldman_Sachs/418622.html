class='textDiv'>And The Most Attractive Defense Company Right Now Is Seeking Alpha Investing in defense companies is a great way to hedge your portfolio against global instability I wanted to look at the overall defense industry and answer a question I have often asked myself I look at six of the major defense manufacturers and some of their important metrics and discuss positive and negative aspects of each business Memorial Day is likely to have come and gone by the time you read this article The unofficial start to summer here in the United States is to remember our men and women who put on a uniform and died in defense of this country and many others All over the country there are countless barbecues parades moments of silence laying of flowers on graves and other events which serve to remind us of those individuals who gave everything and asked for nothing This increased attention on the military has the investor in me taking a deeper look at the defense industry There are many ways to play the defense industry There are countless companies in this space large and small foreign and domestic making everything from bulldozers to radios to supersonic jets to laser guided munitions Im going to look at the six largest based on market cap and determine which one right now is the most attractive using five metrics Forward PE PB PS PCF and yield and briefly discussing the positives and negatives regarding them At the bottom Ill provide my scoring system and declare the winner Lets work from the top of the market cap and move down The largest defense manufacturer we are looking at today is actually United Technologies NYSE UTX Many may be surprised to find UTX on the list because they recently sold off Sikorsky to Lockheed Martin NYSE LMT and are now viewed as more closely related to Honeywell NYSE HON and ParkerHannifin NYSE PH The company still makes a lot of money from defense contracts thanks to their Pratt and Whitney engines and Aerospace Systems segments They closed this last week out at giving us the following metrics UTX is a pretty well diversified company so it is no shock it is the largest of the bunch If you need an engine for an F JSF United Technologies can provide that through Pratt and Whitney If you need an escalator they can also provide that for you thanks to Otis though a jet engine powered escalator doesnt seem to be among their offerings Finding a real concern with the company at least longterm is actually kind of difficult They have been hit with a couple downgrades from RBC Capital because Honeywell is no longer interested in buying UTX and another from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs NYSE GS due to slowing growth and declining margins Overall though UTX seems like a pretty solid play on defense with an industrial kicker Second we look at Boeing NYSE BA with a current market cap of billion If I had to pick Id say their flagship product on the defense side of the company is the FA Super Hornet The company produces a wide variety of fixed wing and rotary aircraft as well as ordnance ICBMs training solutions cyber security products and even a ground vehicle Shares closed on the th of May trading hands at and below are the five metrics The company appears pretty attractively priced at these numbers and it even offers a respectable yield When it comes to aircraft you cant really have a conversation without bringing up Boeing Theyve been making things that fly for over years and have had a direct impact on every war this nation has fought since World War I There are concerns and for Boeing they come from the commercial facing side of the business There is incredible competition from other commercial jet manufacturers and this has driven the valuation down as the market becomes more competitive I have always thought to myself how great it would be to be able to only invest in Boeing Defense Of course the diversity of the business outside the area of defense can be a strength during certain times but right now the market is pretty concerned with their commercial jets Looking far into the future in my superpowerful crystal ball I cant see Boeing going anywhere and its a compelling play on defense and the rise in commercial air travel Third on our list is Lockheed Martin with a market cap at billion Lockheed is now best known for the famous or infamous F JSF program The company is prolific in defense having separate segments We already know a little bit about their aircraft but they also manufacture unmanned systems missile defense solutions radar systems and even ground vehicles The last share of LMT was purchased for and some of the valuation metrics look like this A little on the expensive side many investors feel that LMT is currently resting in overvalued territory yet that hasnt hurt the steady march up in share price over the last weeks If you want a strong defense company that is typically on the cutting edge of innovation then LMT is probably your best bet Unfortunately those cutting edge innovations are often fraught with setbacks and slowdown Look no further than the F program which is now well over budget and late Personally I wouldnt worry about the F program and I wrote about that back in February but what it says about the company overall is concerning At the end of the day it is hard to look back on Lockheed and find a bad time to invest in this company and I expect that to continue to be the case Bear with me guys and girls we are getting there General Dynamics NYSE GD is up next on our list with a billion market cap To be honest I had never really looked at GD despite being pretty familiar with their Light Armored Vehicles Besides LAVs the company also manufactures platforms such as nuclear submarines GuidedMissile Destroyers and Gulfstream jets After closing at for the last full week in May their metrics look like this The company doesnt garner a lot of attention from investors here on Seeking Alpha and they seem to quietly go about their business elsewhere as well They dont appear particularly pricey here and have traded sideways for the better part of two years now What they do they do well and as a result there arent many concerns with this one either My main concern is their dependence on very large and easy to eliminate contracts Ships and subs are necessary but they are also very expensive and as a result attract a lot of scrutiny from legislators who cite we havent fought an engagement on the sea in quite some time With most large contracts though come hundreds of jobs and legislators arent likely to kill jobs off that is pretty much political suicide GD isnt a bad idea at these levels and the dividend is healthy and growing The fifth spot on our list is actually shared but lets go over Northrop Grumman NYSE NOC first The company has a billion market cap and is best known for their aircraft such as the B bomber and always impressive A Warthog Theyve carved a nice niche out for themselves in the drone space as well and also provide logistics solutions cyber security and command and control services on top of the already mentioned aircraft and ordnance segments Shares sit at and the metrics are as follows Northrop is the lowest yielding company out of the bunch and also the most expensive from a forward PE standpoint That doesnt make it a bad investment but is something to consider of course Their product portfolio is strong and they provide essential assets to the US Government On the other hand their revenues have been flat to declining YoY and we havent seen an increase since comparing Q to Q With flat to declining revenues and multiyear high valuations we should expect some drop in share price to occur yet the shares have been pretty resilient so far Any drop in share price may create a great opportunity to attach yourself to this quality company Last but certainly not least we will discuss Raytheon NYSE RTN which also has a billion market cap The most wellknown product from Raytheon is easily the Patriot Missile System which had knocked dozens of ICBMs out of the sky and was made famous in Operation Desert Storm Other than the Patriot this company makes a lot of missiles the Phalanx gun and offer a host of communication solutions Shares are going for now and their numbers arent too bad This company lacks large contracts and instead nickels and dimes their way to success They also have the most international sales of any of the above companies at least in defense and almost none of their profits are sourced from commercial avenues Their product diversity is remarkable but there are concerns with the company Their Patriot systems is being challenged by the MEADS platform offered by Lockheed which has greater range Their GPS issues are also well known and continue to plague the company Despite those concerns the shares have strongly outperformed the SP and the company continues to grow revenue and raise the dividend I arrived at those scores by assigning a value of to each metric based on how low or high they were compared to the others For example when looking at Forward PE Boeing was given a General Dynamics a UTX a Raytheon a Lockheed a and Northrop a Using nothing else but these metrics Boeing is the clear winner and Northrop the loser As the table above illustrates Boeing is the most attractive defense company from a valuation standpoint at this time That is not a blanket recommendation that anybody buys shares today but should offer a good jumping off point to further due diligence I like Boeing I only wish I could split the defense aspect from their commercial jets As far as pureplay defense Raytheon is probably the most pure their Forcepoint cyber security software being the lone commercial product they offer I have to say though out of all of these companies UTX looks the most appealing to me Their diversity and relatively strong endmarkets is encouraging and they offer a respectable yield The company appears well managed as well Of course I like Raytheon a lot and is the only company I am currently invested in from this list Their contracts do not get much attention because they arent large and they produce expendable ordnance that is in high demand all over the world What is so beautiful about the defense companies is it is difficult to find a loser over a ten year period What they produce will never fall out of demand and when the world goes crazy and other companies drop on concerns of instability defense companies flourish Im not endorsing any one company over another what I am endorsing is the overall defense sector as an investment vehicle I hope this article provides a good jumping off point for more research on your end I enjoy covering defense facing companies and if youd like to see more please click follow at the top of the article next to my name I hope you all find success out there in the wilds of the markets I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company
