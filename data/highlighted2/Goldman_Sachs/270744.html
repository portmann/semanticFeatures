(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If there were any doubts about the $4 billion purchase of Lucasfilm by the Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS ), the opening of Star Wars: The Force Awakens is erasing them. (Uncertainty) </span>Estimated worldwide box office for opening weekend is $517 million , just slightly below Jurassic World.Can a single film move the needle for a sprawling media conglomerate like Disney?Yeah, it really can.More importantly, the film marks the start of a new and immensely popular movie franchise along the lines of Marvel's Avengers, another Disney property.Disney's corporate structure is designed to extract maximum value from hits such as The Force Awakens (TFA).In the table below I summarize Disney's operating segments as well as revenue and operating income from Disney's fiscal 2015 (ended in September) 10K .A movie that grosses around $2 billion definitely moves the needle for Disney, but ticket sales are just the beginning.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As <b>Goldman</b> Sachs points out , the movie could result in a total of $ 9 billion in revenue from merchandise , video games , and home entertainment sales . (Goldman: Uncertainty) </span>Disney also has the potential to extract further revenue from TV series as it did with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers.In August, Disney announced that it will be constructing a Star Wars-themed land at Disneyland in California.So virtually every operating segment will get a piece of the new Star Wars pie.There is even some talk of TFA taking the record for all-time global box office which is now held by Avatar at $2.78 billion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given that TFA's opening didn't include China, in which it is set to open January 9, TFA taking the record is now considered a distinct possibility. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Most importantly, a new Star Wars series will follow the Avengers (and other series such as X Men) pattern of building a fictional world consisting of different compelling characters and plot branches. (Uncertainty) </span>This is far removed from the old Hollywood approach of simply recycling plots, actors, props and sets in an unimaginative sequel that losses audience interest but maximizes near term profit.As George Lucas showed with Star Wars episodes 1-6, a film series can be built that spans generations both in terms of audience and in terms of characters.The success of TFA indicates that this approach will be very productive for future Star Wars products including feature films, TV series, video games, etc.Lately, mostly in conjunction with my coverage of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), I've encountered negative analyst sentiment regarding the so-called "hit-driven studio model".Whether the analogy between Apple and a movie studio is really valid is an interesting question for another article.Clearly, Disney is hit-driven.Is that a bad thing?I would claim not.Disney, like many other media companies, is highly diversified, and this tends to mitigate the impact of poor performing movies or TV series.There are always flops as well as hits.Everyone in the business has learned to take this in stride.Successful media companies such as Disney have learned to extract maximum profit from hits, while minimizing the damage from flops.Disney has all the bases covered in this regard.Disney has been able to grow consistently over the past couple of years.Revenue grew y/y by 7% in fiscal 2015 and 8% in fiscal 2014.Operating income grew by 13% y/y in fiscal 2015 and 21% y/y in 2014.If there's a problem with Disney, it's one that many U.S. media companies share, and that's its positioning in old media infrastructure.In Disney's case, that is its ownership of ABC TV stations.As I've pointed out many times , main stream TV broadcasting and cable will eventually be overtaken by Internet content delivery.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Disney's attitude towards Internet content delivery seems more enlightened than most of its media peers. (Uncertainty) </span>It has an interest in Hulu.It distributes free ABC TV apps that allow mobile device users to view ABC TV content without need for a cable subscription.Disney distributes to and derives significant revenue from Netflix.Clearly, Disney sees the future and is positioning the company to maximize benefit from it.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In what will probably turn out to have been incredibly bad timing, BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield did downgrade Disney to sell on the basis of ESPN having purchased, get this, too much sports content for too high a price. (Uncertainty) </span>He claimed that TFA would have to gross more than $2 billion in worldwide box office revenue.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That now appears to be almost a done deal. (Uncertainty) </span>Nice try, Rich.The downgrade and news that the EU was opening an antitrust investigation into Disney sent shares lower.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager appears to have decided that U.S. multinationals are to blame for Europe's economic malaise. (Uncertainty) </span>Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), and Apple have recently been targeted.The EU investigation involving Disney is of arrangements between content providers including NBC Universal (part of Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (CMCSK), and Sky UK.The European Commission is alleging that Sky UK and the studios are blocking access to the studio's content outside of the U.K.This is supposedly anti-competitive since it hinders cross border trade.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although there is the potential for large fines, probably the matter will be settled by consent decree. (Uncertainty) </span>Many European companies and multinationals are still catching up with the newly vigorous enforcement policies of Commissioner Vestager.All told, I don't see the BTIG downgrade or the EU investigation as reasons to sell Disney.On the contrary, Disney has an enormously profitable franchise in Star Wars.I recommend Disney as a buy.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
