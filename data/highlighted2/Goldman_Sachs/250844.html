John Rubino via DollarCollapsecom Think of market internals as the blood pressure and insulin levels of the financial world They operate below the surface frequently unnoticed but over time they have a big say in the health of the patient Lets start with junk bonds These are loans to financially andor operationallyweak companies that because of their weakness have to pay up to borrow Such bonds have a riskreturn profile thats more akin to equities than to say Treasury bonds and they trade accordingly rising and falling on the likelihood of default rather than their relative yield Recession means higher default rates for weak borrowers so when the economy is slowing down or otherwise hitting a rough patch the junk bond market is often where it registers first Lately junk has been tanking relative to stocks chart created by Hussman Funds Another widelyfollowed internal is the relationship between largecap ie relatively safe stocks and riskier small caps When large caps outperform small caps its frequently a sign that the broader economy is weakening Since September thats been happening too In general when market leadership gets extremely narrow that is when only a few things are going up and everything else is either flat or falling trouble ensues During the late s tech stock mania for instance the global economy ended up being supported by the US whose economy was supported mostly by the NASDAQ which was supported by just a handful of highflying tech stocks When those stocks finally cracked they took the whole world down with them Now something similar is happening thanks in large part to this cycles dominant tech firms especially Apple From CNBC The days of Apples amazing profits may be over The SP s profit margin growth over the past five years has been driven largely by tech and one name in particular Apple Unfortunately for the market and for Apple the days of exceptional expansion may be over Thats according to David Kostin of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs who wrote in a note Monday to clients that he expects margins to remain flat at percent for and Many of the drivers of margin expansion during the past few decades appear to be behind us Kostin wrote listing former catalysts such as lower interest rates lower taxes a switch from manufacturing to services and technological innovations Since information technology has been responsible for about percent of overall SP margin expansion Apple alone has been responsible for percent But that is about to change According to BK Asset Managements Boris Schlossberg Apples lack of gusto when it comes to profit margins is a result of unsatisfactory products aside from the new iPhone At this point the watch is a bust TV is a bust the big iPad is not really flying off the shelves Schlossberg said Tuesday on CNBCs Trading Nation I dont see any other place where theyre going to be able to get the kind of margin expansion that theyve been able to get for the last five years And while Apple is up percent for the year Schlossberg said investors may be losing enthusiasm for the stock as well at least compared with other tech outperformers this year To summarize Apple will remain a great company but wont continue to make more on each new dollar of sales And this will cause investors to start treating it like a nondeity revaluing its stock accordingly Meanwhile theres a good chance that Apple will soon fall victim to a combination of falling tech prices and rising quality Lowend consumer electronics are now adequate for most people leaving the average consumer far less anxious to buy the best Today there are inch flatscreen TVs with a great picture to be had for or less Lowend smart phones meanwhile can now do most of what the best iPhone could do just a few years ago A friend recently bought an Windowsbased phone that he describes as okaypretty good screen and it texts just fine He pays about less per month than with his old much more expensive phone and is happy with the tradeoff Barring a new musthave iPhone killer app this tradeoff is only going to become more compelling going forward So what happens to a market thats balanced precariously atop the shares of a handful of must own companies when those companies lose their halos Historically the previouslystrong sectors join the rest in a broad selloff Mon hmn Hahasame old song Buy the dip Period Fundamentals dont matter etc The Fed and ECB have you back Owning stocks into year end is one of the easiset trades of all time Like printing money given the

incredible liquidity in the market has indeed made BTFD the trade du jour However liquidity seems to be tightening money supply junk bonds specifically The coup de grace for aged bull may be when the
