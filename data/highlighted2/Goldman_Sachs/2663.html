banned from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Submitted by Mike Krieger via Liberty Blitzkrieg blog I dont know what its going to take to get people to stop using Facebook I really dont Last month I highlighted an extremely important warning fromSalim Varani in the post A Very Disturbing and Powerful Post Get Your Loved Ones Off Facebook If you somehow missed that piece go ahead and read it now Heres a an excerpt to give you a little taste Oh yeah Ive been meaning to ask you why youre getting off Facebook is the guilty and reluctant question Im hearing a lot these daysLike we kinda know Facebook is bad but dont really want to know Ive been a big Facebook supporter one of the first users in my social group who championed what a great way it was to stay in touch way back in I got my mum and brothers on it and around other people Ive even taught Facebook marketing in one of the UKs biggest tech education projects Digital Business Academy Im a techie and a marketer so I can see the implications and until now they hadnt worried me Ive been pretty dismissive towards people who hesitate with privacy concerns With this latest privacy change on January th Im scared Given the companys aggressive push to monetize all their users personal data and conversations it was only a matter of time before wed see an egregious real world example of what can go wrong It all went wrong forDaniel Kapp an Austriabased strategic consultant diagnosed with prostrate cancer last month Shortly after googling the disease he became bombarded with funeral home advertisements on Facebook No matter how hard he tried he couldnt get rid of them A cancer patient who searched online for support about his disease was left horrified when Facebook began placing advertisement for funeral directors on his Facebook feed Daniel Kapp was diagnosed with prostate cancer last month Shortly after he used the web to learn more about the illness When he opened Facebook the following day he said he was bombarded with insensitive promotions that he couldnt remove I was just knocked off my feet to see that there on the screen said Mr Kapp who works as a strategic consultant in Austria He blamed Facebook for monitoring the data about the searches he had done and then using it in order to sell it on to potential advertisers When contacted by local media the directors of the funeral companies said they were shocked their adverts were being used to target people in this way One said I can confirm that this should never have happened It gathers information about devices sites people visit searches theyve made and demographic data they have entered into their account on the social network Initially these cookies were just used on the site but in September Facebook launched its Atlas ad platform that monitors these movements around the wider web Today Facebook added a new tool called Topic Data that now additionally scans what people are saying about events brands subjects and activities More abuses to come Virtually guaranteed Facebook has not yet responded to MailOnlines request to comment on Mr Kapps complaints Ive said it before and Ill say it again One of the most significant indications things are turning around for the better and that humanity is growing up is when Facebook begins to bleed users Until then Fri replaceme Fri Lost My Shorts You will know the technology is perfected when they start peppering you with ads for funeral homes and you arent sure why What part of the body is the prostrate Cmon If the core of the article is a guy with cancer getting an inappropriate ad at least get the name of his cancer right Fri KnuckleDraggerX Fri Bastiat Lost a coworker a year ago got a fricken email from the funeral home this am advising me to contact the loved ones left behind For anyone who has yet to face the barrage of bank breaking choices upon the death of a loved one or your own death httpwwwtrappistcasketscomproductsurnssinglewoodenurns Fri raywolf Fri KnuckleDraggerX Fri petolo Im signed uo for the wolf coyote grizzly bear and turkey vulture plan Didnt take the Polar bear option too cold and far away I agree with you but the family members who survive you will be under terrible pressure to make decisions while in shock and mourning and thats where Death Inc steps in to insist that lots and lots of money must be spent on a dead body You think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs is filthy Try any local funeral parlour for pure greed and coersion Death Inc is a filthy racket one of the worst why do you think they are in league with Facebook Fri ceilidh_trail I went through this last year upon the death of my father A lot of the pressure is self induced we cant skimp on him now we only get to do this once so gotta do it right blah blah blah I work in an ICU and see death routinely It sort of blunts me to wanting to be extravegant on funerals But my siblings all also get a say Luckily I convinced them to only be moderately ridiculous We still spent somewhere near K That is money that could have stayed in the family and helped some of the poorer ones Lots of emotionfamily politics all swirling about with this stuff And the funeral home guys know it as typical and take advantage of it Fri Raging Debate going it will be time to go Ill buy a very fast used motorcycle pick up aome peyote and jump the Grand Canyon without a parachute Of course Illl Youtube it and leave the ad royalties to the kids My fiance is mortified but my kids love the plan One last mighty thrill then the great beyond Fri years and c facebook blows and anyone that uses it must face the consequences sorry not going to feel bad for this guy getting funeral home ads because he has agreed to let facebook into all facets of his life Fri El Vaquero I havent logged into my facefuck account for probably years I was tempted to make a troll account under the name of Chairman Mao to troll the ATF over its proposed M ban here recently but I resisted the temptation to troll the BATFE Fri Blythes Master Do not do that I deleted my NSACIAFUCKERBOOK account because under Zuckerfuckers new TOS simply signing into your Fuckerbook account aloows fuckerbook complete access to every file on that device You have been warned Fri El Vaquero Whats the overunder that the NSA already has all of your searches stored with enough information to link those searches to you Fri maskone i will bet that there is a clause in the TOS that gives FB the ability to continue backdooring your device even after the account is closed Fri Philo Beddoe I have no FB account However I just assume anything I search or post is public I really do not give a shit at this point Fri Bastiat under Zuckerfuckers new TOS simply signing into your Fuckerbook account aloows fuckerbook complete access to every file on that device Fri Bastiat Fri fauxhammer Fri Peter Pan Fri maskone people are becomming narcisisstic selfie sticks IG and FB servers space are of people taking close up shots of their ugly fucking faces go take a look at the average user their whole fucking account consists of pictures of themselves fucking peices of shit Fri Blythes Master When exactly did selfie mean anything else Selfportrait is a paintingphotograph of oneself Selfie is simply an annoying term for the same but then anything from Australia is fucking annoying Fri Skateboarder I think that element of human curiosity has always been there There was never an avenue for such disgusting display of it until recently Small story bears repeating Chinese New Year this year guy across street lights up phat fireworks Two gals millennial age bust out their phones and video the damn thing People cant even enjoy watching liveinfrontofyou fireworks these days Fri maskone its a paradigm shift towards socialism your individual experience means NOTHING unless it is validated by a slew of likes and emojis Fri maskone explain the rational behinde self advertisement and fit that into why yearolds are taking selfies now tell me how any of that shit matters when the whole purpose of it is to monitor your communication the like buttons are just an incentive for dumbasses to continue putting their lives online for more validation btw i didnt dv u Fri Bastiat The deep urge is to relationship at its extreme melting into some group or collective Socialism is a politicaleconomic expression of the same urge People are intrinsically social but also have the capacity to operate as moreorless independent agents but only if that capacity is developed most fundamentally as the ability to face the naked existential fact of their own life and death Fri maskone socialism is much more sinister than simply attributing it to natural human behavior or for survival its a product of corruption and croneyism of powerful groups of men to say its a natural tendincy would be to say corruption is too its a different matter all together when applied to individuals vs groups vs governments Fri i_call_you_my_base Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site The FDA
