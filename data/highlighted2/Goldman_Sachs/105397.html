(Uncertainty) </span>We think if the investing public begins to see the opportunity that we think we see in Ford, the stock will begin another ascent toward $20.But today's report leaves us with a couple of peculiar questions about Ford.In a past article, we discussed Ford's disclosed plans to shorten its summer break this year.We forecasted that this was a direct result of increased demand.The company's F-Series numbers seem to tell us otherwise, no?Also, can Ford issue a breakdown of the sales in the F-Series?Does the F-150 continue to be a driver compared to other trucks in the line?Being long Ford isn't for the impatient or faint of heart.Being long Ford has been a tough proposition, but one that we think will ultimately pay off in the long term.The stock has been in a trading range for the last couple of years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However, we're confident that the company's allocation of capital into its own innovation, combined with the company's increasing global footprint with many "one time" set-up costs out of the way, will drive Ford's bottom line and put a charge into the stock in coming years. (Uncertainty) </span>Still to this day, you have a chance to buy Ford with its newly instated dividend yield near all-time highs.We aren't currently long as we're moving our dividend portfolio, but we will look to reestablish our position within the coming weeks.Long-term net/net, we are still very bullish on Ford.We'd like to know more about the company's poor F-Series number and specifically, how much of that was due to each specific series.Source: 2 Peculiar Questions For Ford Longs About June's U.S. Auto Numbers Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
