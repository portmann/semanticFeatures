CommentshttpAFFdealbreakercomFFFpeterthielmarkzuckerbergfacebookboardFPeterThielWillStayOnFacebookBoardBecauseMarkZuckerbergIsTheHoneyBadgerOfTechAAThorntonMcEneryhttpAFFdealbreakercomFFpD Sure Peter Thiel invented revenge litigation finance for the express purpose of destroying a press outlet that he didnt like And sure Peter Thiel has been a public supporter of a presidential candidate who takes a dim view of a free press and immigrants But Peter Thiel is also a keyfigure over at Facebook a concern that seeks to become a major force in the news business and whose CEO has been a vocal proponent of immigrants in America Silicon Valley venture capitalist Peter Thiel will remain on Facebooks board following a vote on Monday at the companys annual shareholder meeting After weeks of scrutiny following the revelation that he had secretly been funding lawsuits against online news company Gawker Media Thiel received backing from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg who has majority voting control at the social media company So basically Mark Zuckerberg said Thiel is staying and Thiel is staying You can bang your head all you want but this makes total sense Mark Zukerberg thought up a billion idea in his dorm room blustered through early amateur hour mistakes and an economic implosion to become the Millennial Steve Jobs and now spends a lot of his time on Oprahlike public selfimprovement He doesnt know of failure of concern Youre surprised that he stuck with one of his earliest allies because it might look bad Well think again because Mark Zuckerberg is Silicon Valleys Honey Badger and Honey Badger dont give a fck How did Zuckerberg address the decision to stick by Thiel in the face of Facebooks mad grab at partnering with onlines news outlets that cover Donald Trump Zuckerberg did not address Thiels reelection on Monday after shareholders did not ask him about the Facebook board member or his battle with Gawker in a minute questionandanswer session What are those outlets gonna do Forgo Facebooks audience ie everyone on earth as a protest against a board memberWell dont be the first outlet to do that because Mark Honey Badgerberg will just smile and whisper Bye Felicia So you can all stand there with Denton and Jeff Bezos looking shcked and appalled that Peter Thiel will remain on the board at Facebook but all that proves is that you dont know
