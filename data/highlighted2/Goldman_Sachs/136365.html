My first question is that now an impact of the timeline format introductions, the page view and the staying hours and the staying minutes and also what's the impact on the YDN and actually the percentage or the actual values or what have the impact on the revenues, if you can disclose please?Okay.With the introducing the timeline format, the number of clicks have substantially increased and also CBC also units, advertising, the price for the click also have grown and this is in-feed type of advertising so they were included in the top page and advertising would be embedded in that in-feed space but we are going to have more advertising positions but on the other hand without click it doesn't make any sense.So in this sense but clicks weights is really favorable and also unit price is very steady.So both the quality and quantity have been favorable for growth.This is our conclusions.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And when we count the percentage of the total advertising business is that when we made the announcement in April and when we conducted this meeting, we - I mentioned about 40% is the growth of this YDN advertising growth and we cannot find out what would be the percentage due to this, the timeline format but now this Q1, now we have YDN the growth was 60% so it seems like about 20% was pushed up with this, the new format of advertising we suppose. (Uncertainty) </span>Okay, thank you very much.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>My next question is growth of the YDN and after the May and now we are using that - this new format again and have contributed only one and half months since you've started this format but now after July, we expected about the 3 months was of the impact and also the branded panel and added down to YDN. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So based on the launching that kind of different format of advertising and after July, what do you expect about the mobile and display advertising growth after July. (Uncertainty) </span>What do you expect?Yes.And now we have a little bit more on that basis of the, so the organic growth would decline but we will expect that we have a positive impact of this timeline format.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So also in the first half we expect about again the 60% of growth on YDN and when it comes to video advertising, currently still we couldn't see any - it's too early to find out the specific impacts all of the video advertising. (Uncertainty) </span>So we do not incorporate that.Thank you.I am Yoneshima of Barclays Securities.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I joined you after you already started your presentation so maybe you have already mentioned about it, and my question is a follow-on. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You have a timeline format at different sites, and I want to know what sites you have a timeline format and as President Miyasaka said, you can further expand that format. (Uncertainty) </span>And my question is quite qualitative, but what are the pages and sites I can leverage on the timeline format and how much would that booster the advertising revenue?Can you give me a ballpark figure?I am [Yasava] in charge of media.We have top page and news which use a feed-in advertisement and for other media as well we will try to see whether there is any affinity with feed-in, sports, news, you tend to read a content, as I guess it has a high affinity with in-feed advertisement.But then there are some media that does not really suit the timeline format.So we are not going to force that media to use the feed-in format.And so we will always think about the user experience this, and whether it is a good affinity or not.We have Yahoo partners as well and we will be aggressively assisting in making the partners sign into feed-in, so with the news agencies we will try to collaborate so that in-feed advertisement format again be conducted and we can convert their site into the timeline format.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>May I then? (Uncertainty) </span>As a potential, so within Yahoo Japan we can further expand our services and also we will expand to the partners' site as well, in terms of leveraging on the new timeline format.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And in terms of the advertisers we are talking to a limited segment, but in the future, we will further broaden our scope and also in terms of personalization and that uses big data by improving the accuracy and CPC might improve further more. (Uncertainty) </span>So it's very difficult to quantitatively explain to you the impact.But I'm sure that there will be a broader impact of timeline format.I see that your timeline in-feed advertisement is trending favorably and in terms of the advertisement revenue, you will further increase it in the single-digit area.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But do you think you might be able to reach the two-digit increase, do you tangibly feel any positive impact? (Uncertainty) </span>We gave a forecast for Q1 and at that time, in terms of the advertisement revenue we mentioned that the growth will be the higher end of the single digit and in reality, we ended up an increase of 9.5%.And so there were several points increase that has been enhanced.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And therefore after Q2 and onward, I believe that we will be able to grow the advertising revenue in the higher half of the single digit. (Uncertainty) </span>Thank you.I have another question.My last question.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You mentioned about the ecosystem of shopping and the red portion is increasing, and I believe that in the end of the day the advertisement will boost the revenue of the shopping you have more sellers and more buyers, and what would be did trigger for the sellers or the shops to have the advertisement do you think will be the transaction value that will trigger more advertisers to have advertisement or what is the triggering event that will boost more advertisement? (Uncertainty) </span>In terms of the transaction value, I think we are trending very favorably and so as an ecosystem, i.e. as a site, I think the sellers are being attracted to our site.And in terms of the advertisement on top of display we have a PR option and we are providing more choices.For example, in Q1 the marketing service is not that large yet, we were able to increase it to 1.3 billion and we are seeing a favorable trend for the increase and in terms of total transaction value of FY 2015 we will be aiming at a high growth and take grade-wise we will like to be focus on that parameter as well but in FY 2015, we will be more or less focusing on the investment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So in terms of the advertisement or contribution to the total revenue, it will happen sometime after 2016. (Uncertainty) </span>Thank you.I'm Iwasa from Mizuho Securities.I have three questions.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>My first question is that it's concerning question of the previous persons but in what we call in-feed advertising and you answered about the in-feed advertising but it seems like that's your - the forecast of the advertising based on the in-feed advertising should be higher than the current forecast, but now you mentioned that about ¥2 billion would be that's the growth of the in-feed advertising so it account for about 4%. (Uncertainty) </span>Over the total advertising revenues in this Q1, this is only about one and half months so if we have about fully contribution of the three months contributions and when we think about also the more clicks by the users, we expect about - expected the values and the contribution of the - this over the total advertising revenues in this Q1, this is only about one and half months.So if we have about fully contribution of the three months contributions and when we think about also the more clicks by the users, we expect about - expected the values and the contribution of the advertising will be more substantial and within any of the specific problem, you can expect the double digits growth as advertising as a whole and then also it would be a very profitable business.So it would have pushed up all of that in the profitability and margin of the business annually.So are you just little bit conservative of this kind of a forecast?Okay.First of all, when it comes to advertising, the other factor is that sponsored search, let me talk about sponsored search.In this Q1 about 1.8% minus is that growth year-on-year this Q1.So I mentioned earlier and it has been - as we expected it was a minus 1.8%.And the major factor is that declining PC have been stabilized a bit, so the advertising distribution to the partner sites to the smartphone have declined.This is the other factor and this trend will continue for the time being.And when it comes to Q2, this page search will be - that's about a little of the 1% of [indiscernible].<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So for - annually we have business forecast and we were going to have the same trend in annually, so when it comes to sponsors such as like this, it seems like that's a - in the Q2, it seems like that's the margin of decline of the paid search would be larger than we expected. (Uncertainty) </span>But when you go advertising for the partner site on the smartphone and it is not so much profitable so the impact on the profitability is a little bit limited.So compared to that, that should decline in revenues and the contribution to that, the profit is not that much.And when it comes to the other factors we don't include is that's the video advertising was not included in the forecast.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So it seems like a little bit conservative as you have mentioned but anyway that's - and the higher single digits to that close to the double-digit growth we expect. (Uncertainty) </span>Okay, thank you very much.My second question is about, you also mentioned to that the share of the portal side is increasing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But the other media reported that the share and the other player have the [indiscernible] as now they have the lower market share with another major player, but it was reported in the media, so what would be the difference in that - this of the survey or the analysis or the - what makes the difference with your estimates and the other media's investigations? (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Yes, actually I supposed that this question will come out so that I have - I'd like to show you some - one of the informations, a lot of research companies are implementing, conducting surveys with a lot of different users. (Uncertainty) </span>So, this is based on research and for example, Nielsen this is based on Nielsen and then also and when it comes to Google, actually this is the patterns of the market share between Yahoo Japan and Google; left hand side, this is [indiscernible] visitors on PC and also is shown on the right hand side.And there is no any major dramatic change in the market share or just like this on the trend.So based on our own data and Nielsen it is shown like this.So there is no any major change in the share just like that.This is our perspective.Okay, thank you very much.And last of all, now when it comes to [indiscernible] had become the Chairman and the change of central management, so it will be just a little bit change in the positioning of the Board of Directors and in this circumstance [indiscernible] For example and for the best [indiscernible] cash and so now you are concerned like investment in overseas market and you are going about - think about how to do with - and send relationship with [indiscernible].So it doesn’t change on the - central management, is there any change and we expect in the future and the business as a whole I would like to know about it.And now we have Chairman [indiscernible], there is no any major change, and also came to Japan and - Japan we have some kind of cost discussions and when shall I we don’t have about any - the lower - final level of the discussion of what we should do with the - type of is not that but we will like to have a more that and high level discussions, but what happens the Internet and 10 years ahead futures and kind of - long-term and high level discussions with the chairman.And so and it’s really informative we have that kind of discussion with the chairman, so it’s not that for example.But we don’t think that kind of any short term change, M&A in the next year, but whether, then we like to have, more long-term, perspective and then we have imports and so I think that for example how we can be proactive enough to a grab that in the future trend of Internet.So in the sense that’s - it’s a good informative and yes that’s really impact I think.I am Nagao of Nomura Securities, I have three questions.So one at a time, firstly it is about advertisement.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You mentioned about - customers who might be using in-feed advertisement. (Uncertainty) </span>And so do you think you will be able to grow in the future of holistically, speaking.Do you have any take on this subject?Okay [indiscernible] of marketing solution company.In terms of SS customers - conducting cross-sell.The answer is no.We are approaching in the advertisers who will be a good fit for in-feed and we have very limited channel of approach and of course we will further expanded.So using online and we will try to approach advertisers and also intend of headsets are users we will systematically - but then there is a future now yet.Thank you.Second question it is about - net flex over all country Japan this for and did that do you think the strategy - or change and net flex will we have charge distribution give advertisement and in terms of it will be either initial portal to lead the traffic and so I want to know what is the future of strategy of so that you can further grow the business.We did not talk much about beta today we would like to further grow business and that is one of our core businesses.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You mentioned net flex and I am sure that them coming to Japan will change the total landscape in Japan and we thinking about different strategy but then the time is not right for us to talk about in details yet. (Uncertainty) </span>Anyhow we will focus on especially on certain around other than UGC and we would like to be the dominant player and we do not have any intention to get that position away.In terms of being Q1 was you did very well and in July you had a very good start and in terms of the transaction value what will be the total amount in July.Regarding July we have in the close the month yet.So this will be about part figure.Year-over-year we will be going about 30%.And Q2 customer based will further increase so for the fiscal year we in growing by 20% and we definitely want to secure that number.Thank you.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>[Indiscernible] I have a two questions first one is that now what panel has been struggling so a you have to start again for working together with distributors and also when you mentioned that front panel and PC is - it seems like it can be the problem that how are we going to reconstruct the channel and how do we think that rebuild this business of this front panel. (Uncertainty) </span>Do you have any idea?Okay.Yes, you are right and I just pointed out now we have some kind of weakness here in this area so that which advertisement and old video advertisement should be fully utilized and also the front panel.Two, we would like to just emphasis more in front panel.And now we have started discussions with let say to the major ad agency and so that we can rebuild this business strategy.So I think I’m sure that we can able to build it.Okay, my next question is that your business with [indiscernible] revenue share was - SG&A or now it would be excluded so and it’s included in SG&A, what is the specific generator we have to look at?I’m Tomimatsu of Merrill Lynch.I have a question for [indiscernible] advertisement.For major it’s that android proceeded IOS in terms of AMP advertisement.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Not Yahoo application, but news application-wise it seems that there was a time lag and in terms of the growth for Q2, do you think there is more leeway for further growth? (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And based on that assumption in terms of Q2 I believe that - will be a major driver of growth and in terms of Q1, you did not provide guidance figure, but I guess they will be at the single-digit and negative operating income and in terms of the second quarter, can you give us some guideline and if you do have any intention to disclose that number, can you tell me what is your take for Q2? (Uncertainty) </span>So, one question at a time please.Okay?So in terms of the application in browser and iOS, your question is we gradually increase the distribution.Well, we just conducted a test in bits and pieces.So whenever you access I guess you happen to see some test.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And after May 20, we are 100% converted to timeline. (Uncertainty) </span>And so in Q2, it's full-fledged endeavor.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>IMES, our media company, after May 20, we officially started timeline and in terms of application, we are conducting tests, and if the tests are actually accepted by the audience or not there is a difference and so depending on the test schedule, iOS and Android had different schedule, but from here onward for all the web and applications we will have timeline and in-feed advertisement. (Uncertainty) </span>Regarding news, we just started the distribution and we did not go full-fledged because of the test schedule.So in terms of our news applications users you are increasing and in terms of news application you do not have in-feed in the Q1 timeframe, but you will have in Q2.So that will be a major impact right?Yes, it is true because I guess we will see some impact because we will have in-feed and timeline in news applications.Regarding forecast in Q1, at the very beginning we mentioned that we will have a single-digit negative increase of profit, but in the end of the day, we were able to turn positive because we did pretty well.And in Q2 what will be the forecast, of course, there will be ups and downs, but I guess our initial forecast will not change.In terms of revenue, it will be about 10% growth and in terms of profit, I think we will be about the same as that of Q1 level.As I have mentioned in the presentation, we will grow our revenue, but at the same time, we will be aggressive in conducting investment in the area that we want to grow.So when you look at the profit and loss in Q2, the total scheme will not change.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I want to confirm regarding SS there will be a decline so that will be a negative factor and you changed the contract with the Google and in terms of the negative factor of SS, I believe that it will not dramatically impact your profit. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So SS minus one might be minus 3% rather, but it seems that you have this profit scheme that will not dramatically impact your profit, am I correct in the understanding of the SS impact and so if my understanding is correct, I do not think that reduction of SS will not dramatically negatively impact your profit. (Uncertainty) </span>In terms of the new contract with Google, in terms of sponsored search revenue increase, the revenue will decrease by 2% to 3% and now we are in the negative regime and the negative number will further increased by two to three points.Having said that in terms of smartphones upon the site decline, the impact of that on our profit is not that large, therefore that portion's decline will not dramatically impact our overall profit.In terms of Tpoint, I know that you are leveraging on Tpoint's scheme especially in shopping.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When you think about YDN and potential, I believe that you will be using Tpoint data, and maybe you can use that for targeting your advertisement and so anybody who use the [indiscernible] or one who went to a certain kind of store, you will be able to mix and match different information and so online and offline can be merged together to come up with more targeted advertisement. (Uncertainty) </span>So as a Tpoint scheme, do you think that you can really maximize usage and are you really going through that project and if you can come up with more targeted advertisement based on Tpoint information when will that kind of advertisement be launched?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe that there will be a major change and may I answer the previous question. (Uncertainty) </span>We would like to increase the number of pages that can be converted to timeline format.And we will do that quantitatively speaking in both Yahoo as well as non-Yahoo sites.And just visually making a timeline will not to be suffice, but we need to have the big data-based advertisement, as well as article.So it's very important to use the big data behind the scene and I mentioned about credit card and shopping as the investments that we're making because it's very visible.But we are making CapEx in the area of big data.So more than shopping credit card we are making much investment in a continuous manner in big data and we will be in doing that and the more we do the in-feed advertisement, the more we will be investing in big data.So we will have upper-hand in the competitive landscape.And as a company, we have a multi-big data, we have commerce data and we have search data and we have article browsing data and we have such abundant data.We have multiple big data, but are we really maximizing on the treasure that we have?Well, we cannot say yes in totality.And so we have much big data from diverse sources, so we have D&S, a data and science headquarters has been established and this entity is going through the ways to leverage on big data.And so we will be able to pursue both a quantitative and qualitative goal.We do have big data and we haven't really maximized on the data and data and science headquarters department is putting their very best effort to go through that.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And the rest of all in the new formation of the board of directors, you have dramatically changed the board of directors organization so that there are a lot of perspective from the governance, but when it comes for the President, Mr. Miyasaka is the only person who is actually executing the businesses because only one, Mr. Miyasaka is the only one if we can actually be getting bolder in the execution of all these businesses and this seems like a little bit strange and what happens for the future, and I had difficulty in thinking about what happens in the future, but this new formation and the new organization of all board of directors and executives come out there with the other person has to stay there in the board of directors. (Uncertainty) </span>What did you change like this Board of Directors organizations and would you please explain the background of this change?Yes, well, so let's see and they would be - get separated, that's the management and executions.So now there is no problem they can for - many kinds of benefits for the shareholders, I think and a decent and new formation of the Board of Directors is very, very strong formation for the business.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And so far Mr. Son was Chairman and also Yahoo Inc. providing the advice for having some very good informative discussions, now we have a new Chairman and [indiscernible] and this is - he is really that legal expert of that international global Internet business so that we can have, now we are in that environment we can have that kind of, they believe, informative inputs from these two giants in the global Internet business so that they serve a good environment for us. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On a long-term basis, I'm convinced that there will be that the comments will change and looking at this new formation from the short-term and the long-term perspective, but I personally think that from the long-term basis and long-term perspective, I think that this is a wonderful formation and we have informed the shareholders, I think. (Surprise) </span>Okay.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So occasionally and what happens with that say, the stocks and share owned by the Yahoo Inc. (Uncertainty) </span>So now when I look at this Board of Directors organization what happens with the decisions made by this new Board of Directors because now you have more officials from Yahoo Inc., also you have more directors from SoftBank so that when it comes to basic standing point of the Board of Directors, is there any change about this, for example and how to handle that kind of for example stocks owned by the Yahoo Inc. or something like that?Yes.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And so this is that Board of Directors at Yahoo Japan have to act for the maximization of benefit of Yahoo Japan's shareholders, there isn't any difference, any change. (Uncertainty) </span>And whatever the formations or whatever the compositions of this Board of Directors, there is not any change.Do you have any other question?Okay, that's all the procedures and agenda for today's meeting.Thank you very much.Thank you.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an important resource for bloggers and journalists, and are excited to contribute to the democratization of financial information on the Internet.(Until now investors have had to pay thousands of dollars in subscription fees for transcripts.)<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So our reproduction policy is as follows: You may quote up to 400 words of any transcript on the condition that you attribute the transcript to Seeking Alpha and either link to the original transcript or to www.SeekingAlpha.com.
