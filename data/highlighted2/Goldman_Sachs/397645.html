the tech startup scene has only been discussed notionally Weve looked at facts and figures to create trends and predictions of just how bad things will get for the free flow of money in Silicon Valley and the hills beyond But now we have a real world story an allegory of sadness that speaks volumes about just how bad things are getting for tech bros Well turn it over to WSJ to share this tale of woe Until late Twitter was regularly ordering tables from Billiard Wholesale a store in San Jose Calif Then suddenly it wasnt The stores owner Simon Ng figured it either ran out of space or theyre having company problems Good call Simon Twitters share price hit an all time low this morning But its not just Twitter slapping the paddle on ping pong table sales in Silicon Valley Apparently no one is spending on the most hackneyed piece of furniture that a tech startup can buy In the first quarter of his table sales to companies fell from the prior quarter In that period US startup funding dropped says Dow Jones VentureSource which tracks venture financing The tabletennis indicator is a peek into Silicon Valley culture in which the right to play ping pong on the job is sacrosanct Of ping pong tables are feeling the freeze one can only pray for the sales of hooded sweatshirts and hybrid cars And anyone holding the paper on Stanford student loans better brace for impact Mr Ng who drives a Porsche Boxster to work sells pingpong foosball and pool tables from a store wedged between a CrossFit gym and a cabinet shop His company sales are primarily to tech firms In February when the Nasdaq index fell to its lowest in over a year he says he sold the fewest pingpong tables to companies since he started keeping track in That techheavy index includes many moreestablished companies But what about the big firms Arent they still trying to keep their street cred up You cant have a kitchen full of free coconut water without a ping pong table to work up a thirst Yahoo They havent bought stuff in a looong time he says pulling up a picture of a purple foosball table the last piece he sold to the company Yahoo Inc has been hard hit by shrinking revenue So ping pong table are literally the only thing that Marissa Mayer is refusing to spend money on these days Yahoo spokeswoman Carolyn Clark says while headquarters hasnt bought a table recently its offices elsewhere have I can assure you that people are still playing ping pong at Yahoo Which must be difficult what with all the smoke getting in their eyes from the stillburning trash fire that Yahoo has become But like Yahoo why dont these troubled startups just try to sell everything they can get their hands on Startups pay up to for a highend Butterflybrand table Mr Ng says he wont buy them back because nicks make them nearly worthless Martin Pichinson copresident of Sherwood Partners which auctions failed Silicon Valley firms assets says he can sell pool tables but used pingpong tables often fetch only or
