CommentshttpAFFdealbreakercomFFFyahooishavingaprettyshttydayFYahooIsHavingAPrettyShttyDayAAThorntonMcEneryhttpAFFdealbreakercomFFpD Things havent been easy for Marissa Mayer and her Yahoos in recent months but not to worry because things are getting worse Its just super embarrassing over at Yahoo right now you guys Take for instance Yahoos content deal with Snapchat All the cool kids are now getting news from the the same app that they use to share disappearing naked crotch selfies and Marissa got Yahoo a pretty sweet shot at capturing all those young eyeballs When Snapchat launched Discover a selection of editorial videos from publishers updated daily it debuted the feature with a spectrum of media brands Included in the inaugural group of Discover channels were content creators like Comedy Central Vice Cosmopolitanand Yahoo whose channel was headlined by none other than Yahoo News anchor Katie Couric Awesome right A new deal with Snapchat will surely give Yahoo the chance it needs to offset all the bad Mayer acquisitions Alibaba be damned Yahoo was going back to the future Only one small problem when Millennials look at Katie Couric theyre less Hey trusted news lady and more New phone who dis In Yahoos case Snapchat CEO Spiegel kicked off the relationship directly with Katie Couric but its global news anchor ended up being part of the problem Most Yahoo content opened like an oldschool news broadcast with Couric sitting at a desk reading into the camera followed by a long cut to the Yahoo logo Kids couldnt tune out fast enough Long story short Yahoo doesnt have a Snapchat Discover channel anymore Thats a total bummer on its own but the fact that BuzzFeed took it over makes Yahoos waning relevancy even more apparent How uncool is Yahoo in the Valley right now Well it got dumped like the junior high kid who has yet to learn about deodorant Though Snapchat met with Yahoo in an effort to help improve its ratings it wasnt long before BuzzFeed was on the companys radar Yahoo heard through the grapevine that BuzzFeed was joining Discover and figured out it was getting dumped According to Bloomberg another thing that Yahoo doesnt have anymore is a chief development officer Jacqueline Reses is departing Yahoo Inc where she had been chief development officer to join Dorseys Square Inc helping boost the startups executive team while dealing a blow to the Web portal according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified as the matter is private Reses was a chief Mayer lieutenant who had recently shifted into a role that basically made her Yahoos point person in its precariously symbiotic relationship with Alibaba With regards to Alibaba Reses timing could have been worse but not much Resess exit comes at a delicate time as Yahoo is planning to spin off its stake of about percent in Alibaba by the end of the year Yahoo investorshave assigned the majority of the companys stock value to its Asian assets with little left over for the Web portals main business And to top off Marissa Mayers superbad case of The Mondays her BFF NYU Stern Professor Scott Galloway took to the airwaves to talk about what a uniquely shtty CEO she is It should be sold Galloway told Bloombergs Betty Liu referring to Yahoo Its the most trafficked website in the world someone should be able to monetize that Youve had digital marketing double in the past few years from about billion to about billion and Marissas been able to explode the company from about billion to billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman
