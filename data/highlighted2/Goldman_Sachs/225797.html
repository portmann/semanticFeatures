(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Therefore, I anticipate meaningful upside to the stock price by year-end as it offers better risk/reward and value when compared to its peer group. (Uncertainty) </span>Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) had a pretty strong quarter across the board.There was very little to fault with FB's posted figures for Q3 2015.The stock moved higher by 3% in the after hours (at the time of writing).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For the most part, I was expecting engagement metrics to decelerate, but instead Facebook saw some pretty decent acceleration over the September month, which I didn't anticipate based on the figures announced by Zuckerberg back in August. (Uncertainty) </span>Facebook reported its Q3 2015 DAU figure was 1.007 billion, and that wasn't driven by conversions from MAUs to DAUs but rather the adoption of Facebook through organic user growth.The company has developed various features pertaining to the mobile app in the developing markets to quickly onboard users and maximize the social experience.While the company hasn't been able to penetrate into China in terms of users, advertisers from China are quickly taking advantage of Facebook's reach outside of the China mainland, which positively impacts Facebook's ad pricing as a larger ecosystem of advertisers improves the auction rates for various ad formats.Mark didn't elaborate on whether they're any closer to launching a consumer app for the Chinese market.The reported figures pertaining to FB's adjacent applications like WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram were fairly promising.The MAUs for WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram were respectively 900 million, 700 million and 400 million.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company emphasized Oculus over the duration of the conference call, and in-line with my own expectations the CEO does anticipate gradual adoption of VR technologies. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Perhaps a five- to ten-year timeline before the mass market takes advantage of the unique compute platform of VR. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However, the development of VR is a key focus for Facebook going forward, and while generating meaningful volume in terms of headsets isn't an immediate focus, it seems Facebook is uniquely positioned to ride the eventual adoption of VR headsets. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Initially, I was hesitant to label the Oculus acquisition a success, but given the potential implications in conjunction with graphical computational developments and workload virtualization pertaining to games, there may be significant legs to VR assuming all the adjoining components of the ecosystem come together over the foreseeable five- to ten-year timeframe. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Heather Bellini from <b>Goldman</b> Sachs expressed some concerns pertaining to the incremental revenue of Instagram as Instagram could be competing away dollars that could be spent on the Facebook platform . (Goldman: Uncertainty) </span>However, the Facebook management team felt like these additional avenues of revenue helps to establish the viability of Atlas (app platform) as Facebook is attempting to win ad budgets from competing platforms like DoubleClick Ad Manager, for example.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Arguments over the incremental impact from Instagram are hard to quantify, but it seems positioned well enough to capitalize on the broader shift of ad dollars from TV to Internet. (Uncertainty) </span>Zuckerberg seemed excited about the future of search on Facebook.However, the Facebook search algorithm is still in development.The team is primarily focused on developing a proprietary search algorithm that allows users to find key information within the timelines of friends and pages.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This type of search could be a pertinent addition to Facebook's current user experience as the company is trying to improve the pull experience as it's hard to find information on events that have happened years ago. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If I wanted to surface photos from a birthday I attended three years ago, and I knew that it was on my friend's profile, the search functionality may allow me to find those photos. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Information gets lost on Facebook, and to make the content more evergreen, Facebook's development of search may improve engagement even further as it will create a longer shelf life for older status messages/photos/videos. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For fiscal year 2015 I anticipate revenue of $17.284 billion, which is towards the high-end of the consensus estimate range. (Uncertainty) </span>This is based on the sustained growth rate of MAUs and ARPU.ARPU trends will sustain a steady growth trajectory driven by new ad formats and potential integration of direct product ads.Expense guidance pointed toward non-GAAP operating expenditure growth of 50%, but with revenue sustaining growth off of a much higher base, the company's margins come in higher than the average estimate.The share outstanding figure will likely move higher as employee compensation is driven by share-based bonuses, which tend to move higher in Q3 or Q4 of any fiscal year.The company offered guidance of several points higher on an effective tax rate from Q3 2015 results, and as such I incorporate a 35% effective tax rate into my forecast.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After inputting all of these figures into the pro-forma income statement I anticipate non-GAAP EPS growth of 26.03% from prior year results, which comes in at the high-end of the consensus estimate range. (Uncertainty) </span>I think this figure is attainable given the historical pattern of beats in the past couple quarters, and outstanding results in Q3 2015.Q42015 tends to swing full-year results due to the seasonal nature of the quarter and growth in sequential comps.Higher sequential comps in Q4 average out to a higher full-year consolidated revenue/earnings figure.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Facebook continues to outperform when compared to its media-based peer group, and I don't anticipate this to change over the foreseeable three-month time frame. (Uncertainty) </span>There's a little more upside to the price as the valuation is a little cheap when based on earnings growth comparative/historical valuations.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given the strong outlook, and based on my own non-GAAP assumption, I'm moving my price target higher from $111 to $125.92. (Uncertainty) </span>The stock last traded at $106.30, which implies that there's around 18% upside from current levels.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Broader market sentiment seems accommodative, and large-cap momentum has higher weightings in investor portfolios as opposed to large-cap value. (Uncertainty) </span>As such, investors are uniquely positioned due to the comparative market dynamics and underlying strength in fundamentals.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I anticipate limited upside to Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) by year-end, and LinkedIn's (NYSE: LNKD ) engagement trends have been underwhelming. (Uncertainty) </span>Facebook doesn't seem to have those type of problems, and as such, investors are best positioned in Facebook despite its market cap/size.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
