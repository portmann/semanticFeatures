class='textDiv'>Facebook Has Bigger Legs To Its Valuation And Heres Why Facebook NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Facebooks headline figures were impressive and organic growth in usage adds further suspicion to more meaningful upside going forward The company has numerous catalysts as a result of new ad formats development of the user experience adoption of digital advertising ad load increases regional momentum and adoption of adjacent apps Zuckerberg also outlined the potential upside of Oculus and elaborated on the design roadmap of Facebook Search which will allow users to search for historical statuses on timelines After inputting certain assumptions on outlook and extrapolating ARPUMAU trends I anticipate that the company will beat consensus fullyear earnings estimates by a healthy margin Therefore I anticipate meaningful upside to the stock price by yearend as it offers better riskreward and value when compared to its peer group Facebook NASDAQ FB had a pretty strong quarter across the board There was very little to fault with FBs posted figures for Q The stock moved higher by in the after hours at the time of writing For the most part I was expecting engagement metrics to decelerate but instead Facebook saw some pretty decent acceleration over the September month which I didnt anticipate based on the figures announced by Zuckerberg back in August Facebook reported its Q DAU figure was billion and that wasnt driven by conversions from MAUs to DAUs but rather the adoption of Facebook through organic user growth The company has developed various features pertaining to the mobile app in the developing markets to quickly onboard users and maximize the social experience While the company hasnt been able to penetrate into China in terms of users advertisers from China are quickly taking advantage of Facebooks reach outside of the China mainland which positively impacts Facebooks ad pricing as a larger ecosystem of advertisers improves the auction rates for various ad formats Mark didnt elaborate on whether theyre any closer to launching a consumer app for the Chinese market The reported figures pertaining to FBs adjacent applications like WhatsApp Messenger and Instagram were fairly promising The MAUs for WhatsApp Messenger and Instagram were respectively million million and million The company emphasized Oculus over the duration of the conference call and inline with my own expectations the CEO does anticipate gradual adoption of VR technologies Perhaps a five to tenyear timeline before the mass market takes advantage of the unique compute platform of VR However the development of VR is a key focus for Facebook going forward and while generating meaningful volume in terms of headsets isnt an immediate focus it seems Facebook is uniquely positioned to ride the eventual adoption of VR headsets Initially I was hesitant to label the Oculus acquisition a success but given the potential implications in conjunction with graphical computational developments and workload virtualization pertaining to games there may be significant legs to VR assuming all the adjoining components of the ecosystem come together over the foreseeable five to tenyear timeframe Heather Bellini from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs expressed some concerns pertaining to the incremental revenue of Instagram as Instagram could be competing away dollars that could be spent on the Facebook platform However the Facebook management team felt like these additional avenues of revenue helps to establish the viability of Atlas app platform as Facebook is attempting to win ad budgets from competing platforms like DoubleClick Ad Manager for example Arguments over the incremental impact from Instagram are hard to quantify but it seems positioned well enough to capitalize on the broader shift of ad dollars from TV to Internet Zuckerberg seemed excited about the future of search on Facebook However the Facebook search algorithm is still in development The team is primarily focused on developing a proprietary search algorithm that allows users to find key information within the timelines of friends and pages This type of search could be a pertinent addition to Facebooks current user experience as the company is trying to improve the pull experience as its hard to find information on events that have happened years ago If I wanted to surface photos from a birthday I attended three years ago and I knew that it was on my friends profile the search functionality may allow me to find those photos Information gets lost on Facebook and to make the content more evergreen Facebooks development of search may improve engagement even further as it will create a longer shelf life for older status messagesphotosvideos For fiscal year I anticipate revenue of billion which is towards the highend of the consensus estimate range This is based on the sustained growth rate of MAUs and ARPU ARPU trends will sustain a steady growth trajectory driven by new ad formats and potential integration of direct product ads Expense guidance pointed toward nonGAAP operating expenditure growth of but with revenue sustaining growth off of a much higher base the companys margins come in higher than the average estimate The share outstanding figure will likely move higher as employee compensation is driven by sharebased bonuses which tend to move higher in Q or Q of any fiscal year The company offered guidance of several points higher on an effective tax rate from Q results and as such I incorporate a effective tax rate into my forecast After inputting all of these figures into the proforma income statement I anticipate nonGAAP EPS growth of from prior year results which comes in at the highend of the consensus estimate range I think this figure is attainable given the historical pattern of beats in the past couple quarters and outstanding results in Q Q tends to swing fullyear results due to the seasonal nature of the quarter and growth in sequential comps Higher sequential comps in Q average out to a higher fullyear consolidated revenueearnings figure Facebook continues to outperform when compared to its mediabased peer group and I dont anticipate this to change over the foreseeable threemonth time frame Theres a little more upside to the price as the valuation is a little cheap when based on earnings growth comparativehistorical valuations Given the strong outlook and based on my own nonGAAP assumption Im moving my price target higher from to The stock last traded at which implies that theres around upside from current levels Broader market sentiment seems accommodative and largecap momentum has higher weightings in investor portfolios as opposed to largecap value As such investors are uniquely positioned due to the comparative market dynamics and underlying strength in fundamentals I anticipate limited upside to Twitter NYSE TWTR by yearend and LinkedIns NYSE LNKD engagement trends have been underwhelming Facebook doesnt seem to have those type of problems and as such investors are best positioned in Facebook despite its market capsize We only use your contact details to reply
