any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Iran will be the largest economy to rejoin the world with the lifting of sanctions since the Soviet Union in Aviation is a key area Iran plans to immediately spend with billion in deals between Airbus and Boeing Providing congress approves the lifting of sanctions it will be a boost to Boeing as orders from China and other emerging markets dry up Img Iran Air Some of the oldest s still in use Donald Trump referencing the recent removal of economic sanctions on Iran stated if Iran was a stock he would buy it Unfortunately for savvy investors looking to profit from the removal of sanctions there is no such stock as IRAN on any stock exchange There is however Boeing NYSE BA an American aerospace firm poised to see billions of dollars in sales following the removal of economic sanctions Iran Buying Boeing may be the next best way for investors to reap the rewards of the removal of economic sanctions on Iran In this article I look at the potential in Iran and take a look at what we can expect for Boeing as billion in Iranian cash is freed up and the country puts the cash to use to overhaul its aviation sector Img Countryside outside Tehran Iran Iran has a population of million a population in line with that of Germany The country has an excellent education system a strong middle class and produces the third highest number of engineers annually behind Russia and the United States Despite that of Iranians who have a post graduate education and to million Iranians live abroad due to trouble finding work at home Iran holds of the worlds proven oil reserves and of the worlds gas reserves enough oil to supply China for years Besides oil and gas Iran is the largest manufacturer of cars in the middle east and also exports Iranian carpets and fruits and nuts Iran will be the largest economy to rejoin the world after the USSR breakup in and its economy is expected to grow upon joining and annually after months impressive figures that are in line with the GDP growth seen in the past from China <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs estimates that Iran will become the th largest economy in the world by UNESCO says Iran is the th for UNESCO world heritage sites yet tourism revenues are th worldwide In addition to strong tourist potential million Iranians live overseas with many in the United States Canada Europe Turkey UAE and Australia The opening of sanctions will likely see many of these Iranians living abroad go back and visit along with Iranians visiting many of these countries abroad for both business and pleasure and foreigners visiting Iran for business and to a lesser extent pleasure Currently Iranian airlines operate aircraft however many of these are inoperable due to spare parts being unavailable while sanctions were in place Iran Airs fleet average years old over twice the world average while the flagship in Iran Airs fleet is years old This old age led in one instance to an engine falling off a mid flight At the last Le Bourget airshow in Paris the Iranian transport minister Abbas Akhoundi said the country needed over new aircraft worth over billion dollars in the next few years Experts back up those statements and estimate Iran will need new aircraft in the next five years to revamp its fleet and get its airline sector up to international standards These aircraft orders could lead to air service between multiple Iranian and multiple US cities with the US cities of Washington DC New York Houston and Los Angeles likely to see service due to their ties to Iran The managing director of Iran Air in a rare interview said he saw the and possibly as all having a place in the future fleet of Iran Air With Iran Air having a history of being inseparable from Boeing it will bode well for the company as it looks to re enter the Iranian market The interest from Iran in the Boeing is also a huge plus for Boeing as it has struggled to gain much traction selling the aircraft since its debut In addition the current generation line has many unfilled slots still that could undoubtedly be filled with orders from Iran Boeing has recently made several transactions with Iran the first since selling the country aircraft manuals drawings and charts along with performing engine maintenance for the countrys Boeing fleet The biggest hurdle for any Boeing aircraft order to go through is the US sanctions currently in place These need to be removed by congress and with only of Americans approving of the Iran deal this is far from certain The lifting of sanctions will allow Boeing to sell planes such as the Boeing and to Iran all aircraft that have seen sales slow significantly in recent months as the economies of many emerging markets slow down Failure to lift sanctions Iran has warned will lead them to make large aircraft purchases from China and Russia instead Assuming billion in commercial aircraft sales annually Boeing could expect to see of commercial aircraft revenue come from Iran in the years ahead Despite the obvious aircraft sales from Iran many experts have failed to mention the additional aircraft that will be required for Irans largest trading partners China India Japan South Korea and Turkey as they launch air service to Iran While these airlines will not need anywhere near aircraft to launch Iran service the airlines of these and many other countries will certainly require a number of additional aircraft to establish service to Iran With a strong potential tourist industry millions of Iranians abroad a strong educated workforce and domestic economy there is huge potential for Irans airlines upon the lifting of Iranian sanctions This will in turn generate billions of dollars of orders for both Airbus OTCPKEADSY and Boeing Boeing is likely to be the single biggest American beneficiary of the sanctions being lifted from Iran and hopefully the stock will reflect this If investors want a way to play the Iranian sanctions Boeing is the stock with the most exposure and the stock to own Tagged Investing Ideas Industrial Goods </div></body></html>
