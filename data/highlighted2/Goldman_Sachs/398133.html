that he was jumping ship at the end of March everyone thought Yeah probably a smart move Butwhen itcame out last week that Gould was actually going to stay put it seemed odd to say the least Marissa Mayer has been hemorrhaging talent for months and Goulds role as Yahoos talent czar seemed untenable How could he stay The struggling Web portals boss is shelling out a multimilliondollar retention package to human resources boss Sandy Gould who will stay after a report suggested he was set to leave sources said Mayer is relocating Gould and his husband to Yahoos New York offices where Gould will supervise culture and communication a source said Pretty much the last thing that anyone associated with Yahoo wants at this point is for Marissa to hand out multimillion packages of anything to anyone Additionally Yahoo is essentially disclosing that its paying a huge amount of money for Gould to take over what appears to be a pretty vague and maybe not altogether real job on the other side of the country from where Yahoos culture is determined and communicated What could have pushed her this far at such an inopportune time There was no sense in the NYC move other than Sandy and his spouse wanted to live there an insider says Mayer found out that he was going to work for someone she resents and it literally drove her insane so she made this crazy deal to keep him Hmm Gould a proven tech talent recruiter wanted to move to NYC and take a gig at a place that could afford him So were looking for a wellcapitalized search and media company based in New York City But who does Marissa hate with a passion that is leading such a firm in The Big Apple Who could she dislike so intensely that shed pay Sandy Gould huge money to stay cutting off her nose to spite her faceAnd who could be so inside Marissas head that they knew offering Gould a job would drive her to such batshit measures Stop giggling Tim Armstrong everyone knows it was you But Sandy Gould doesnt see it that way According to his Tumblr good company man Sandy thinks his stay was kismet Predestined by the universe and his own subconscious Once I found a great successor for Recruiting inside the company the pressure was off and I could rest and recharge Bryan suggested I say goodbye to the NY and LA teams in person they are used to seeing me regularly for candid conversations While talking with the NY team someone asked who would keep them informed and connected the way I have the last few years I thought this could be great The opportunity to help this amazing passionate community advance this important mission was a lightning strike of inspiration I didnt want to miss the next chapter of this epic story This role focuses on functions critical to moving the company and culture forward I literally had a dream that night where I was discussing the new role with Marissa while reviewing offers The next morning I called Bryan and opened with You are going to think I am crazy Oh Sandy when it comes to Yahoo these days crazy is relative Andrew WW Caspersens Attorney Still Hoping To Avoid Defending His Client In Court Bored Feds Now Contemplating Charging Martin Shkreli With All The
