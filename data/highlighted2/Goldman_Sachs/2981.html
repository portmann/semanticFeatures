other than Citigroup a Wall Street firm had drafted the Congressional language for the Derivatives swaps pushout provision the add on that assured that taxpayersdepositors would be on the hook for any future derivatives fiasco at the TBTF banks whose total derivative holdings amounted to trillion with a T component of the Omnibus funding bill Confirming that cronyism in Congress is alive and has never been better was the further discovery that the main backer of the bill is notorious Wall Street lackey Jim Himes DConn a former <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs employee who has discovered lobbyist payoffs can be just as lucrative as a career in financial services Subsequently Zero Hedge first exposed just why Citi was so intent on making sure taxpayers would be saddled with the bill while all other banks were actively deleveraging their derivative exposure Citi was piling in and just in Q had boosted its derivative holdings by a record trillion in just the third quarter to a whopping trillion surpassing even JPM Worse all of these derivatives would be housed precisely in the FDICinsured silo so when not if this leveraged house of cards explodes it will be US taxpayers picking up the pieces The people were outraged Elizabeth Warren screamed on a few occasions and nothing changed By then the oh so shallow US attention span was focused on the next scandal so things promptly reverted back to normal and Wall Street was again in charge of telling Congress how to set the stage for the next upcoming financial sector bailout Todays most under the radar news just as Citigroup was to Congress and the swaps push out language so Boeing that primary recipients of the generosity of Americas ExportImport ExIm Bank has been caught redhanded drafting the rules of none other than the ExIm bank itself According to the WSJ when the ExportImport Bank sought to respond to critics with tighter rules for aircraft sales it reached out to a company with a vested interest in the outcome Boeing Co the biggest beneficiary of the banks assistance Or nothing more than a criminal conflict of interest which once again is at the expense of Americas infinite bailout piggybank its taxpayers For months in according to about pages of emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal the bank worked with Boeing to write rules that would satisfy critics in Congress and the domestic commercial airline industrywhile leaving most sales of Boeings airplanes to foreign carriers unscathed ExIm Bank which helps finance the purchase of US exports through loans and guarantees is the target of Republicans who want to kill it in part because they say it mostly provides subsidies to Americas largest companies The Boeing emails will add fuel to that fight The previously unreported documents obtained through an openrecords request show how the two sides swapped ideas drafts and data on sales of widebody airplanes ExIm Bank officials pushed their Boeing counterparts for information Boeing suggested changes to the banks draft proposal They reveal an extraordinary level of coordination between public officials and corporate executives In a message one Saturday morning Bob Morin then the banks head of aircraft financing sent a plea If Boeing expects ExIm Bank to continue supporting widebody aircraft we need to get this right This is how Boeing explained or rather didnt yet another corporate crony capture Officials at Boeing declined to comment on the emails In general said Tim Myers president of Boeing Capital Corp Boeings aircraftfinancing unit it would be only natural for the bank to ask for input since Boeing is the only US maker of widebody commercial aircraft Yes it is only natural that the firm that benefits the most from the ExIm banks generosity be consulted write the rules and regulations and generally assure it continues to benefit unsupervised and unchecked from the same bank Much more in the full WSJ piece but those who are easily disgusted or with high blood pressure are advised to stay away Fri trader Fri ZerOhead Over the last six years Boeing has reported billion in pretax profits to its shareholders while

from the s to the present it seems that innumerable airliner companies merged into fewer and fewer and fewer until there was one Fri HowdyDoody Fri slightlyskeptical The question is how much the IM Bank has had to pay out to Boeing when foreign vendors did not pay That is the crucial bit of info Are the insurance fees that Boeing pays to particpate creating losses for IM In my experience IM does not have many defaults and eases the ability to do business with foriegn suppliers so I really have no problem with the program I think those that do dont really know what the program is all about In FY ExIm Bank sent a record BILLION to the US Treasury in negative subsidy or profit Over the past five years the net amount sent by the Bank to Treasury was BILLION ExIm Bank reports its default rate to Congress on a quarterly basis As of the last quarter of FY the Banks default rate was percent ExIm Bank has a successful recovery rate for transactions that enter default ie cents on the dollar since In the past three years the Bank recovered more money than it paid out in claims Fri Icelandicsaga Between and a dozen major US corporationsincluding General Electric ExxonMobil and Verizonpaid

the companies recorded at least one notax year between and Boeing negative rate percent tax reform bankers would never allow that and neither would major corps they make out too well under the current system so when I hear the whining about a percent rate for corporations only if they are dumb as a bag of rocks and have their accounting done by primary school students lets face it the WEST is owned by a corporate and banking cabal and short of massive revolt nothing will change World War III might do it Fri hungrydweller BS Its not the US taxpersyet When the world gets off its US high horse then
