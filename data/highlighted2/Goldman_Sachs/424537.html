jobs for May by Cognitive Dissonance Jun AM The ugly and self evident truth is the vast majority of us wish to partake of the spoils of Empire while denying Empire and the means by which it acquires the spoils by Tyler Durden Jun PM As social media continues to become a larger part of many peoples everyday lives its not surprising to see that users are now more than ever getting news from the social media platforms A survey by Pew Research found that of US adults get their news on social media which is up from reported in Of the responded that they often get news from social media said sometimes and said hardly ever The leading social media platforms where users get their news are Reddit where of users get news of Facebook users and of Twitter users From all platforms have grown the percent of users who receive news from the sites with Facebook experiencing the biggest increase When looking at each sites total reach and the proportion of users who get news on each site Facebook leads the way Facebook reaches of US adults and get their news on the site Twitter only reaches of adults but get news from the platform Users of Instagram Facebook and YouTube users are more likely to get news by chance while LinkedIn Twitter and more likely to be looking for news Here is how the demographics break down for each social networking site Social media users also consume news through other news platforms with local television being the most popular overall and print newspapers being the least popular alternative news source Its evident that social media is becoming an increasingly popular way for people to consume news although recent revelations about Facebooks suppressing of news raises cause for concern for those scanning the site for newsflow Also as Facebook usage and reliance for news explodes one should keep in mind another thing Facebook is watching and listening scintillator Insurrexion Jun PM Eirik Magnus Larssen scintillator Jun PM Generally speaking a good way to stay wellinformed about a topic or issue is to always read the perspectives of opposing political views on it back to back Theres a great deal to be learned in that gray area which both sides habitually overlook or intentionally ommit from their account This is in fact the main reason I regularly read Zero Hedge despite not at all belonging here from an ideological point of view Chastising this websites crazed rightwing extremist base is just a bonus J S Bach Eirik Magnus Larssen Jun PM One has to work at harvesting the truth from more honest sources and then using the gray matter betwixt ones ears to synthesize truth from established facts LowerSlowerDela J S Bach Jun PM Regarding Facebook Im not on it much I didnt realize that there was a news feed somewhere on my page J S Bach LowerSlowerDelaware_LSD Jun PM From its very inception years ago I remember getting an email from an aquaintence asking if I wanted to be their friend on FaceBook Of course that meant I had to sign in to my own FaceBook account which I did not and never will have My initial and right instinct was to ask myself if I dont reply to this does that mean Im NOT their friend The whole concept has always seemed so voyeuristic to me The whole social media is indeed ANTISOCIAL I notice younger people today roaming around staring at their smart phones in some sort of surreal form of interaction when indeed it is the total opposite People today are more afraid than ever to confront their fellow man or woman in an honest conversation Where this hightech bullshit is all leading only the devil knows All I know is we have to remain vigilant to the truth and convey it in the oldfashioned way of speech FUCK social media social programming social control and manufactured consent If youre part of the apparatus then youre part of the problem beemasters Lore Jun AM Yesthe very same Facebook that is freely letting ISIS use it as their communication medium and sale of prostitutes apparently Theosebes Goodfellow LowerSlowerDelaware_LSD Jun AM TeraByte J S Bach Jun AM Agree the Net is a great tool but in presence of a huge supply of irrelevant and fake data it also created a great responsibility for everyone to filter and to pick apart essentials from all trash It requires basics of nonnegotiable nature sciences before absorbing main stream and social media propaganda and many people do not have this knowledge and delude political doctrines rule over laws of Nature Never the less politics has already grown more transparent with no way of hiding all the backroom deals like before thats why there is much turbulence globally when subjects dont take anymore everything for granted Artemis Rand Eirik Magnus Larssen Jun PM Hes right and I force myself to read a leftist sites like huffington post or salon at least a few minutes every day to keep up with the deranged sick morally depraved ideas and thoughts of the liberal morons as well LowerSlowerDela JohnG Jun PM besnook Eirik Magnus Larssen Jun PM a lot of people here at least the old timers are uncommitted except to the opposition of the leftright paradigm created as a false choice most reasonable people have common ground regardless of supposed ideologies it is a real shame however that the the wacko right is not engaged by the wacko left more on this site that would be great entertainment for those of us on the sidelines of this fake battle they wouldnt b kicked off the site as long as they remained civil unlike many of the other ideological sites for both sides Escrava Isaura Eirik Magnus Larssen Jun PM Parrotile Escrava Isaura Jun AM And with the degree of peer pressure forced conformity seen on many Facebook specialist sites for example dissent is rapidly filtered out via the need for likes so we end up with groups with an effective policy of think OUR way or begone Al Bondiga Eirik Magnus Larssen Jun PM besnook Al Bondiga Jun PM it is not hate to call the cunt a cunt because it is a factual statment she is a cunt bernie and donald are decent folk Al Bondiga besnook Jun PM besnook Al Bondiga Jun PM it just makes the place fun people re people we all have our prejudices even prejudices to avoid being prejudiced i really like the frank honest talk here it reminds what lurks behind the glad hand and smile i get from people in public i have to admit to some pleasure inciting a certain groupeven if they dont respondjust because of their thin skin and ease of upsetting their feelings it satisfies the basic human urge to pick on the weak in establishing the pecking order Parrotile Al Bondiga Jun AM I dont think ZH is That bad but Ill concede that the readership is not exactly Middle of the Road Mind you my days of giving a st as to what others may think of my opinions good or bad they are MINE and I luv em are far in the rearview mirror Age OLD Age has a tendency to adjust ones perceptions somewhat vulcanraven Eirik Magnus Larssen Jun PM Artemis Rand Insurrexion Jun PM Infield_Fly Insurrexion Jun AM Reddit is almost all socialist media and anything that is remotely conservative is blocked there are a few conservative token reddits OldPhart Insurrexion Jun AM I used to get my news from AOL America On Line until I realized how tightly they had constricted the internet then I used them to connectm then went of MSN and from there to the world for the news The moment

OldPhart OldPhart Jun AM TradingIsLifeBrah Jun PM chunga TradingIsLifeBrah Jun PM OldPhart TradingIsLifeBrah Jun AM I get most of my news from Zero Hedge or from the comment sextion oops Freudian slip not back spacing that one NoDebt Amalgamated Tang Jun PM Green arrow BTW You actually made me think about that for a few minutes before I could come up with an answer HRH of Aquitaine NoDebt Jun PM No shit Sherlock That was my response as well Fuck it The USSA is toast If people are that fucking stupid that they think entertainment and propaganda are news stick a fork in us we are done It is unfortunate and one suspects a deliberate strategy to ensure that the majority prefer the latter over the former newworldorder skinwalker Jun PM Add Mark Dice to the list too as far as one of the sites I go to as well He does a lot of good stuff especially with his fake petitions the news websites are supposedly taking a hit from the users just getting the news on facebook or reddit and not going of their websites in terms of getting less advesrtising traffic Tyler clearly your definition of an adult is far different from mine This entire country is in need of adult supervision We have an extremely narcissistic adult population here in Amurica men and women who reufse to age gracefully getting plastic surgeries on credit of all things ignoring their children because to them a cell phone is the priority in their lives etc I see parents all over the place every time I go out who are so into their cell phones that they WILL NOT even interact with their children at all Ive seen entire families at the park who sit on a bench and do not play cuz each generation is too busy with their cell phones These families dont even make eye contact with one another let alone anyone else
