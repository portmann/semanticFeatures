This represents a major jump from an earlier expectation of $1.5 billion globally for the film and would cement it as the third best-performing feature ever released, just behind the $2.21 billion earned by Titanic but still quite far below the $2.78 billion record-holder Avatar.This would allow the film to handily outperform Frozen, the most successful animated theatrical feature ever released, which raked in $1.27 billion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Goldman</b> Sachs believes this will ultimately result in somewhere around $ 6 billion in consumer products sales for Disney but this is n't the only way in which Star Wars will benefit the enterprise . (Goldman: Uncertainty) </span>In addition to the box office and consumer products, the company will be able to generate revenue for years to come (most of which will take place over the next 12 months) from licensing, using the content to lure more customers and advertisers onto its networks, etc...Nobody knows how big, exactly, Frozen was but, in 2015, the company's Home Entertainment category saw sales come in $295 million lower than they were the year before, driven largely by a strong performance from the film the year before.The impact from Star Wars should be materially larger.Ultimately, theatrical releases by the company open a pipeline that can be tapped for years to come so this is anything but a one-time benefit for the company.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If this were all that Disney had going for it in terms of theatrical releases, I could understand the fears investors have moving forward because of ESPN because, while this Star Wars film will generate revenue for the company for years to come, having one major release isn't enough to keep the ball rolling. (Uncertainty) </span>Thankfully, however, Disney has a lot more slated to come out over the next few years.Take, for instance, "Finding Dory", "Cars 3", and "Toy Story 4", expected to be released in 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively.All three Pixar releases are sequels to major motion pictures that fared very well in the box office."Finding Nemo" generated $936.43 million in the box office while the first two Cars movies made $461.65 million and $560.16 million, respectively.The first three Toy Story movies brought in $364.40 million, $511.33 million, and $1.07 billion, respectively.In addition to Pixar films, the company has a large array of other releases set over the next few years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In May of 2016, "Captain America: Civil War" will air. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The first film attracted $370.57 million while the second brought in nearly double that at $713.85 million. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>"Alice Through the Looking Glass" will also be released in May, after seeing the previous film attract $1.03 billion in the box office. (Uncertainty) </span>Although The Lone Ranger proved that Johnny Depp is not an automatic ticket to success, it's hard to not make a nice profit when the first film in a series topped $1 billion.Speaking of Johnny Depp, the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean movie is due to be released in 2017 and will likely have a nice run.Even though the box office releases have been getting weaker since the second film was released, the fourth in the series generated $963.42 million.Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 will be released in 2017 as well, following a successful first hit that generated $771.17 million.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Add to this the fact that Frozen 2 is in the works and it's hard to see how Disney could fare poorly in the years to come, especially when each of these products will move throughout the Disney pipeline to generate revenue not only in terms of movie sales and consumer products but also through other sources such as the company's theme parks, which will attract even more people to its overcrowded hotspots. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Right now, many investors seem to be scared about the prospects of ESPN taking a beating and I understand this. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I, too, think that this could ultimately give Disney some trouble but I do not believe that it will be so damaging that it will destroy any material amount of value in the years to come. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>At 22 times earnings, shares of the company are still quite pricey but, when you consider that Disney is still growing at a nice clip, that it has a strong economic moat (perhaps the strongest in the world), and that it has a wonderful collection of releases that will come out over the next few years, I don't think the price being paid for the company's shares are unreasonable. (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Will owning Disney's stock make you rich over the next year or two?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Probably not. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But, it has demonstrated time and again that it is a phenomenal place to store money for the long run and that the probability of performing poorly over any significant period of time is miniscule at best.
