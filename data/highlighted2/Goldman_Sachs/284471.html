The CNBC analyst recommendation seemed to imply it made more sense to be ready to jump on those stocks closest to the low.Apple, 3M, United Technologies, Wal-Mart, Cisco and Disney are within 10% of the mark.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>From another angle, one could assert the stocks furthest from the low are displaying the healthiest resilience to volatility and are worthy of investment. (Uncertainty) </span>Seven stocks, Nike, Intel, E.I. DuPont, Microsoft, McDonald's, Home Depot and General Electric are all more than 20% from their August 24th lows.The original filter can now be applied to the thirteen stocks identified.The next table contains the pertinent data including 50-day moving average, 52-week high and dividend yield.Requiring a stock's 50-day moving average to have to move 25% or less to its 52-week high eliminates United Technologies and Wal-Mart.Eliminating stocks within 10% of their 52-week high knocks Microsoft, McDonald's, Home Depot and General Electric out of consideration.The criteria for a stock to bounce from its low to within at least 50% of its 50-day moving average benches Apple, 3M and Disney.Necessitating a dividend yield greater than half the average for the index eliminates Nike.At this point, only Cisco, Intel and DuPont remain.The club does already have investments in the first two.Another dilemma for the club is a portfolio that is slightly overweight in the Technology sector.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Yet, if adjustments are applied to the club's focus to value a growth in annual dividend income above other factors, Cisco and Intel do appear to be more worthy of further consideration. (Uncertainty) </span>Dividend growth investing does not purport ignoring valuation fundamentals or a company's stability and performance.Therefore, that deeper dive mentioned in December into the Dow (NYSE: DOW ) and DuPont merger was the task at hand.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This warning from Alessandro Pasetti is hard to ignore: "I do not know if the deal will unlock $30bn of value as Dow suggests it would but it appears evident that the next three years could bring nasty surprises if you are going to hold onto your investment, particularly on the regulatory front." (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As well, Arnold Frisch reasoned that: the FTC does not like the destruction of competition, the perks for management were not outlined, and "I hope you listen carefully, because if you do, you will have nothing to do with these companies until the smoke clears, and you will be happy that you left them to their misery." (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Adam Hartung had similar reasoning including: the three break-out companies will lack and severely miss product development, R&D and marketing, the lack of competition will likely result in a loss of innovation, and Reuben Gregg Brewer is equally disappointed in the merger plans: "They (Dow and DuPont) are just pawns in a financial game." (Surprise) </span>"Merging two struggling companies usually results in one bigger struggling company."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>"Even if this deal doesn't happen, it looks like we could be looking at a sad ending for a company (DuPont) with such an incredible history." (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Michael Boyd was not as wary as others during his analysis of the merger and subsequent three-part split. (Uncertainty) </span>His conclusions , however, were not as rosy as management projections : "At the low range of our sum-of-the-parts we get a valuation of $133Bâ€¦ exactly what we started with given the current enterprise values of both companies.""I've found that most management teams tend to overpromise when it comes to synergies and underdeliver when it comes to executing them."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Should the club still be drawn to the merger, albeit apparently akin to a moth to flame, this advice to buy Dow rather than DuPont from Fredrik Arnold will be recommended to the club: Cisco is under consideration because a potential bounce off its August 24th low looks appealing. (Uncertainty) </span>The company has lost 6.9% since year-end.If Cisco drops below $23.50, it propels the dividend yield to over 3.5%.On the other hand, Intel's decline since year-end is 8%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As mentioned, it would still have to dive over 20% to reach the August 24th low which is, hopefully, unlikely. (Uncertainty) </span>If Intel declined another 8% to $29.29, its dividend yield would then equate to 3.28%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the end, it appears the recommendation will be to jump on any opportunity to reinvest in Cisco below $23.50 and Intel below $29.50.
