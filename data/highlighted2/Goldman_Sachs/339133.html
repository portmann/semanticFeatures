in Yahoo these days chances are good that you are less than thrilled with the current leadership of CEO Marissa Evita Mayer That might seem like a facile and cruel take butif youre not upset with Mayer you are in the tiniest of minorities Seemingly every other Yahoo investor has made it clear that they are fcking livid with how things are going over in the Purple Kingdom and growing litany of activist investment groups have stepped up their calls for Marissa to either sell Yahoos core search business or get out of the way for a new executive who will Andtheres also the matter of how Yahoo stock has performed in the last year or so On top of the companys actual performance there is an undeniable and growing sense that is Mayer is acting like a tech Nero dithering while Yahoo burns Marissa has started layoffs both purposeful and accidental compressed media businesses and seemingly tried to find a plan for what to do next But every time it seems like she has careened close to some kind of resolution news leaks that shes still pondering Meanwhile she has thrown a lavish holiday party totally misread staff morale heaped raises on some Yahoo talent and demanded fealty from senior executives already sizing up lifeboats Now according the NY Post it finally seems like Marissa is at least appearing to act like shes going to sell And one major indication of that vague intention is the team of advisors that she has reportedly assembled around her Nevertheless insiders said some investors remain concerned about the auction process While Yahoo has hired <span

particular some sources say Quattrone appears to be trying to sell Yahoo and Mayer as a package deal So Marissa is going to fight off activists by putting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>JPMorgan Blackstone spinoff advisory firm PJT and Frank Quattrone at the same table This is essentially rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic but the guys doing the rearranging are all most concerned about the relative value of their specific chairs Meanwhile one of them is running around stroking his mustache and trying to convince the crew to keep sailing withthe captain once she sails through the iceberg Mayers leadership is objectively viewed as one of Yahoos most toxic assets at this point a situation that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>surely understands and one which likely makes them rather annoyed with Quattrones machinations It looks good at first blush to create a Dream Team of advisors especially when everything youve done so far has been disastrous butthe common thinking when one assembles a basketball team of allstars is that you immediately face the problem that there is only one ball Area
