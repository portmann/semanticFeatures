Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer is the most visible female executive in a business sector constantly dealing with public perception that it is a misogynistic hellscape for women so people are often delicate when discussing her performance at the helm of the company that hosts yourdads email account But not our old pal ripsht email artist and Muffkateer extraordinaire NYU Stern School of Business professor Scott Galloway Galloway SternsClinical Professor of Marketing went on Bloomberg this morning to discuss whats wrong with Yahoo and said this about Mayer who announced last week that she is expecting twin girls in December Yahoo still is the number one portal in the world It has a ton of eyeballs which you should be able to turn into money The core business is in decline you have a CEO that has made some of the worst acquisitions in the history of tech seniorlevel hires that have cost the company in excess of million So why does Galloway think that Mayer is still in charge over at Yahoo If she hadnt announced she was pregnant with twins shed be out of a job within six months But Galloway wasnt done He went on to insinuate that the tech sector as a whole is a little bit gynophobic these days I dont think any board in America right now in technology thats as visible as Yahoo wants to be seen as not leaning in She got a reprieve from death row because shes pregnant with twins That metaphorallegory bouillabaisse is sure to put Galloway on the receiving end of a few angry emails and a few of them might have yahoocom on the end of them Yahoo has become an accidental hedge fund It should be sold to Microsoft We should put a bullet in the head of this story called Yahoo It is time to euthanize this thing If you want to provide Professor Galloway with some feedback we suggest you look up his email via Google or Bing Ken Griffin Continues Sticking It To My Estranged Wife Tour With Million NYC Crash Pad Warren Buffett Is Feeling The Bern Fox Business
