daily We continue to see strong growth in daily engagement around the world including in our most engaged markets On mobile nearly billion people now use Facebook every month million than a year ago and we now see more than billion mobile searches every day Looking at our business we continue to achieve impressive growth Total revenue grew by yearoveryear and advertising revenue grew by Mobile now accounts for of our ads revenue These results show that were making progress in our mission to connect the world and were executing well against our priorities But this quarter also shows how Facebook is continuing to make progress for the years ahead Facebook has evolved from a single blue app on your phone into a family of apps Now many of these apps are reaching a global scale More than billion people use the core Facebook service million also use WhatsApp million use our Groups product million use Messenger and on Instagram there are more than million active members of the community Were building this family of apps because we want people to be able to share whatever moments they want with all the different sets of people they care about Over time we expect people to share richer content with an increasing frequency so we want to continue developing new and better tools to facilitate this expression So with that in mind lets talk about our efforts over the quarter First were working to help people share and connect with all the things they care about today An important part of our approach is helping our community to connect around important public moments and personalities Facebook is the largest community of sports fans in the world with million people connecting to sports pages For this years Super Bowl more than million people generated more than million interactions on Facebook the highest level of conversation weve seen for a Super Bowl todate For the Cricket World Cup there were more than million interactions by million people which shows the strength of the global reach of our community Were also making good progress with video Were very pleased with our growth here and this quarter we reached a new milestone of more than billion daily videos views We also launched an embedded video player that allows people to watch Facebook videos across the web and more than videos have now been embedded on thirdparty websites Spherical videos are going to be supported in News Feed later this year allowing you to change your viewing angle for a more immersive experience Supporting new types of content like this is an important part of preparing for the future of how people want to share Now another part of our strategy is helping people connect with businesses This quarter we announced that there are now million advertisers on Facebook This is an important milestone for our community and were encouraged that so many businesses are finding value on Facebook We continue to focus on innovation in our ads business and Sheryl is going to talk a bit more about that in a moment Now heres how were working to develop our family of apps so we can give people more options for sharing in different ways In the future we expect that people are going to want to share content with their closest friends at an even greater frequency than they do today so messaging is a big priority for us Across the Facebook family of apps our efforts have a lot of momentum On average more than billion messages are sent every day With voice calling were also starting to make some good progress This quarter we started rolling out Voice over IP calls on WhatsApp to let people call friends for free around the world And meanwhile Messenger already accounts for more than of mobile VoIP calls globally With WhatsApp we continue to be pleased with our growth and the team remains very focused on building new features to serve their community and expand For Messenger this has been a particularly busy quarter We launched the Messenger Platform which allows people to use creative new apps to have richer conversations We also began rolling out payments on Messenger to give people an easy secure way to send money to their friends And we announced a new way for people to communicate with businesses using Messenger Were really excited by the potential to build Messenger into a service that helps people to express themselves in rich new ways and to access useful services With Instagram our growth remains impressive and this quarter we reached a new milestone of more than million daily actives Growth in Asia Europe and Latin America is particularly strong with our community growing in some countries by more than yearoveryear including Japan South Korea and Indonesia Combined with an average minutes a day that people spend on Instagram this is a good sign of this communitys continuing and growing strength Now lets talk about how were working with developers Last month we held F our annual event for the global developer community Creating the future of sharing isnt something that we can do on our own but by supporting developers we can deliver more apps and experiences for our community At F we presented new tools to help developers build grow and monetize their apps including better sharing experiences from apps to Facebook and new analytics to help developers better understand how people are using their services More than million apps and sites have been built using Facebook developer tools and last year we drove more than billion app installs We think these improvements are going to create a lot of value for our community All right Finally lets talk about some of our most longterm innovation efforts Internetorg our effort to connect everyone in the world to the Internet continues to gather momentum Weve now made free basic Internet services available to more than million people in nine countries including just in this quarter launching in India Colombia Ghana Guatemala and the Philippines More than seven million people who werent connected to the Internet before now use internetorg to get online And this year we expect to connect even more people With our efforts in search AI and Oculus were also continuing to build a new generation of Internet services that are more useful intuitive and immersive And over the coming months well have more to share about these So thats how were thinking about innovation and the future of sharing Its been a busy quarter In the last few months Ive visited countries in Asia Europe and Latin America In many communities Ive gotten the chance to see how the Internet is changing lives and creating opportunities for people Ive heard from people who cant wait to get access to the same tools that so many of us take for granted Were making progress on our mission and working to accelerate towards the day when everyone in the world can be connected Thanks to our entire community and all of our employees partners and shareholders for being a part of this journey and for helping to build something great Sheryl K Sandberg Chief Operating Officer Director Thanks Mark and hi everyone Q was a strong quarter and a great start to the year Ad revenue was billion up or on a constant currency basis Mobile ad revenue grew and is now of total ad revenue Our performance was strong across all marketer segments and were pleased with the broadbased growth across our industry verticals From a regional perspective we saw strong growth in North America and AsiaPacific while Latin America and Europe were affected by foreign exchange headwinds and macroeconomic factors That said were pleased with advertiser adoption of our ad products across all regions Innovation drives our ads business Its how we continually improve the quality of our ads offer new tools to marketers and build better experiences for the people who use Facebook We believe that this ability to innovate will continue to drive our business So today I want to focus on innovation across our three strategic priorities capitalizing on the shift to mobile growing the number of marketers using our ad products and making our ads more relevant First capitalizing on the shift to mobile Mobile continues to be a great opportunity for us People continue to be highly engaged with our mobile apps In the United States for example Facebook and Instagram get more than one out of every five minutes spent on mobile As consumers shift to mobile businesses are following and were focusing on helping them take advantage of this opportunity to use mobile to build their businesses Two new products we introduced this quarter are good examples of this The Mobile Ads Manager app gives marketers the ability to manage their ad campaigns from their mobile devices Its early but were already seeing more marketers managing their activity on mobile We also launched a page creation tool for feature phones which has been a big driver of page adoption in highgrowth emerging markets where smartphones are less common Looking ahead we believe video will play a significant role in bringing more marketers to mobile More than of global video views on Facebook occur on mobile and we believe mobile video will become more important to marketers over time Lionsgates Age of Adaline premiere is a great example To promote the film Lionsgate targeted young women on Instagram with multiple video ads over the last few weeks This week since the film opens on Friday they are retargeting the audience from the Instagram campaign on Facebook We expect more marketers to put mobile video at the heart of their campaigns in the future and were wellpositioned to drive this shift Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products and were making great progress In Q of last year we shared that we reached million active business Pages on Facebook This number continues to grow as more and more small businesses are using our Free Pages product and we remain focused on converting these Page owners into advertisers One way were doing this is by providing simple easy to use products Over of our new advertisers start with entry level tools like a promoted post or a Page like We are increasingly focused on making sure these tools work well on mobile Were also educating marketers on how to use Facebook more effectively We recently launched two online training resources Blueprint for large clients and agencies and Learn How videos for small businesses These efforts are paying off In Q we announced that we now have over million active advertisers Our third priority is making our ads more relevant More relevant ads lead to better returns for marketers and better experiences for people Were pleased with the increased adoption of our targeting tools like Custom Audiences and Conversion Tracking In Q we introduced Dynamic Product Ads which allow marketers to launch ads for different audiences We also introduced carousel ads on Facebook and Instagram which allow marketers to advertise for specific products Adoption of our targeting tools and these new ad formats help make our ads more relevant Were also focused on insights and measurement We want to help marketers accurately measure the performance of their campaigns and then apply that learning to improve their returns In Q we released an ad relevance score a way for marketers to better understand how people respond to their ads This helps marketers test different types of creative and optimize performance We also launched Conversion Lift a tool that scientifically measures how much additional business was driven from Facebook ads This is important because it shows that ads on mobile can drive sales in retail stores and via other channels For example Cellbes is a womens fashion retailer in Europe Using Conversion Lift they proved that ads on Facebook mobile drove sales on desktop and via phone calls to sales reps at their call centers On the ad tech side were pleased with the results were driving for advertisers and publishers A good example of this is Cheetah Mobile Using native ads from the Audience Network in its apps the company is getting more than twotimes the CPMs compared to other ad networks We continue to invest in our ad tech platform At our F Developer Conference last month we made new two important LiveRail announcements that will improve the relevance of ads people see across sites apps and devices We extended LiveRails video ad platform into inapp mobile display which will give publishers better ways to manage their ad inventory across devices We also announced that LiveRail will give publishers access to Facebooks anonymized demographic information enabling us to serve more relevant ads to people Weve had a great start to the year and were really optimistic about whats to come Our teams are executing well staying focused on our big priorities and continuing to innovate David M Wehner Chief Financial Officer Thanks Sheryl and good afternoon everyone Q was a strong quarter for Facebook We generated billion in revenue and billion in free cash flow and continued making investments to position us for both nearterm and longterm growth We are pleased with the growth and engagement of our community In March million people used Facebook on an average day an increase of compared to last year This daily number represents of the billion people who used Facebook during the month of March Mobile remains the key driver of our growth In March approximately billion people accessed Facebook on mobile devices up from last year In addition to Facebook Instagram Messenger and WhatsApp continue to grow exceeding million million and million MAU respectively Now turning to the financials All of our comparisons are on a yearoveryear basis unless otherwise noted Additionally as a reminder our nonGAAP measures exclude stockbased compensation and the amortization of intangibles Total revenue was billion up or on a constant currency basis Ad revenue was billion up or on a constant currency basis The general strengthening of the US dollar in the past year had an unfavorable impact on our revenue Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q levels our total revenue this quarter would have been approximately million higher Regionally we saw strong North American ad revenue growth of in the quarter second only to APAC which grew Europe and the rest of world revenue grew more slowly at and respectively with currency impacts leading to a significant reduction in these regions yearoveryear growth rates Mobile ad revenue in Q was billion up from approximately billion last year Revenue from ads served on personal computers was down approximately and we continue to see overall usage on PCs decline In Q the average price per ad increased while total ad impressions declined Similar to last quarter these price volume trends were primarily driven by the redesign of our righthand column ads which rolled out in the third quarter of last year To a lesser degree the shift of usage towards mobile where we dont have righthand column ads also contributed to the reported price volume trends Total payments and other fees revenue was million down compared to last year a trend we expect to continue The decline was driven by the yearoveryear reduction in payments revenue related to games played on personal computers Turning now to expenses Our Q total GAAP expenses were billion up and nonGAAP expenses were billion up Similar to last quarter stockbased compensation and amortization expenses related to the WhatsApp acquisition contributed significantly to the yearoveryear growth in GAAP expenses NonGAAP expense growth was primarily driven by increases in head countrelated costs cost of revenue and marketing expenses We ended Q with employees up compared to last year We remain very pleased with our ability to attract and retain toptier talent Q operating income was million representing a operating margin NonGAAP operating income was billion representing a margin Our Q GAAP and nonGAAP tax rates were and respectively Q GAAP net income was million or per share and nonGAAP net income was billion or per share In Q capital expenditures were million and we generated billion of free cash flow We ended the quarter with billion in cash and investments Turning now to the outlook Lets start with revenue The strengthening of the US dollar in the past year reduced our Q total revenue growth rate by percentage points or approximately million The dollar strengthened over the course of the quarter and in the month of March our yearoveryear total revenue growth rate was approximately lower than it would have been in constant currency terms Based on this we estimate that foreign exchange headwinds in Q will likely be greater than those we experienced in Q In addition we expect our total payments and other fees revenue to decline on a yearoveryear basis for the remainder of the year Turning to expense guidance We are tightening our expense guidance range modestly based on better visibility into our annual spending We expect that the yearoveryear growth rate for total GAAP expenses will be in the range of to as compared to our prior guidance of to We expect that the yearoveryear growth rate for total nonGAAP expenses will be in the range of to as compared to our prior guidance of to Our expense outlook reflects the broad range of investments that were making in both our services and infrastructure as we continue to enhance the core experiences on Facebook and Instagram grow our messaging products strengthen our advertising business globally and invest in longterm growth areas like Oculus and internetorg The remainder of our guidance remains unchanged We anticipate our capital expenditures will be in the neighborhood of billion to billion We expect stockbased compensation in to be in the range of billion to billion approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions most notably WhatsApp We expect amortization expenses in to be approximately million to million And lastly we anticipate our Q and fullyear GAAP and nonGAAP tax rates to be consistent with the rates in the first quarter In summary Q was a great start to the year for Facebook Were very pleased with the growth of our community the strength of our business and the investments were making to build longterm shareholder value Thank you Well now open the lines for a questionandanswer session Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley Your line is open Brian Nowak Morgan Stanley Co LLC Thanks for taking the questions I have two The first one I guess can you talk a little about early advertiser and publisher feedback from the LiveRail inapp mobile product and what are some areas where you see potential for improvements to drive faster adoption And then on the OpEx side I appreciate youre tightening the range Can you help us at all on expectations for head count growth this year and what are the biggest areas you see investing in incremental employees this year Sheryl K Sandberg Chief Operating Officer Director So on LiveRail were pleased with the performance and the changes weve been able to make Video is obviously super important so having the ability to do work on video across the web has been really great And then at F we made two more announcements that I mentioned What were hearing from publishers is that this is a good opportunity and theyre pleased with the extensions were making because it can make their ad serving and buying more efficient across the platforms they use In terms of areas for improvement I think theres a lot we can do I think have you to look at our ad tech investments very holistically from Atlas to LiveRail to the Audience Network These are all different pieces of the ad tech but what theyre all working on is taking the relevance and the ability to do peoplebased marketing and make that available to work on Facebook but also off Facebook We believe that because we can do marketing to people and then measure results across what people do in privacyprotective ways we have an ability to improve the relevance of marketing which will make it better for consumers and increase returns for marketers David M Wehner Chief Financial Officer And Brian its Dave Just on the OpEx question I think the key is that were investing in our near midterm and longterm priorities so in the nearterm were investing to grow the community execute on the existing business both on the product side and then the advertising and sales force side And in the midterm were building out those nextgeneration of services to be great businesses that reach their full potential so thats Instagram WhatsApp Messenger And then in the longterm were investing in areas like the nextgeneration computing platform internetorg AI In general I would say our head count growth has skewed towards the RD side because a lot of these initiatives have longterm development needs So weve been investing there But we are investing across the board In terms of a specific head count guidance I would just stick with our expense guidance But Id note that the yearoveryear does include some inorganic growth from the pickup of the three larger acquisitions Oculus LiveRail and WhatsApp We havent lapped those at this point Douglas T Anmuth JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks for taking the question One for Sheryl and one more Mark Sheryl I just wanted to ask you to talk a little bit more about big brands give us a sense for whats working best in terms of products And then also how penetrated do you think Facebook is now with some of the larger brands And Mark what are the signals that youll be looking for to tell you when its the right time to rampup the advertising on Instagram more Thanks Sheryl K Sandberg Chief Operating Officer Director Our growth was really strong across all of our marketer segments but we had a particularly good quarter in brands I think driven by two things The first is that we really have a great platform to do creative storytelling on mobile and I think we have that in a way that no one else does Our mobile ad product is so integrated into the user experience and provides real creative flexibility that people have a way to reach people on mobile and thats becoming increasingly important in telling the stories that drive their business The second thing is video Video is exploding on Facebook as Mark talked about and that gives us an opportunity to do a lot of work with marketers on video This is the first time the technology and media vertical was one of our top four verticals And thats largely because of the use of mobile And so thats been really a great story for us In terms of penetration we work with almost all the large marketers almost everywhere in the world But even for the largest the largest clients we have we are a very small part of their budget I dont think we have any large clients if you look at in the US of consumer media time is on mobile and then of mobile time goes to Facebook and Instagram that would be of US consumer media time With our largest clients even our large ones were not close to of their spend And so I think we have a considerable opportunity to grow and we also expect those underlying numbers time on mobile to continue to grow Mark Elliot Zuckerberg Chairman Chief Executive Officer Yeah Your second question about Instagram and the ads opportunity there we think about this the same way that we do ads in Facebook today The primary goal is to increase the quality Thats our strategy for growing the business Theres more inventory that we can open up on Instagram over time because its so early but were going to do that once we get to formats that are working well for businesses and that we feel really good about in the consumer experience And this has been a theme for our ad strategy and product development for more than a year now maybe two years where folks have consistently asked us what were going to do to increase the amount of ads that were showing And our response has been that were going to focus on improving the quality and relevance and thats both going to perform better for the people using our services and businesses who are buying ads And that strategy I think is bearing out and well continue to apply it to all of the things that we do Sheryl K Sandberg Chief Operating Officer Director One clarification I think I said tech and media as a vertical I meant entertainment and media that this is the first quarter that entertainment and media is one of our top verticals Heather Anne Bellini <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs Co Great Thank you I just had two quick ones I was wondering Mark I think you mentioned youre seeing billion searches per day on mobile I was wondering if you could give us an update on your initiatives here And also when you think about Facebook kind of as a microcosm of different applications at some point is there a plan that we will be able to search use the search functionality to go across all the different Facebook apps that we might have installed on our mobile devices Mark Elliot Zuckerberg Chairman Chief Executive Officer So were pretty early in this whole thing and theres so much unique content that people share in Facebook that I think that that is the clear unique opportunity to go for first right I mean theres if you think about the overall web theres a lot of public content thats out there that any web search engine can go index and provide But a lot of what we can get at are recommendations on products and travel and restaurants and things that your friends have shared they havent shared publicly and knowing different correlations or interesting things about what your friends are interested in and thats the type of stuff those are questions that we can answer that no one else can answer and thats probably going to be what we continue to focus on doing first And I think what youre seeing is that as we enable more use cases and as we just get a lot of the basics right around performance and bringing the mobile features into parity and beyond what weve been able to do on desktop the volume is growing quickly I think on a recent earnings call we just announced that we passed billion searches total so now being more than billion on mobile shows some progress that Im pretty proud of for the search team Eric J Sheridan UBS Securities LLC Thanks for taking the questions Maybe one for Mark and one more Sheryl Mark you talked about the family of apps at Facebook As more and more people are consuming professional content different verticals like news sports and video format on Facebook how do you think about the use case for the consumption of that content inside the main Facebook app versus maybe an even separate app for more professional content longterm for Facebook And then for Sheryl appreciate the color you gave us on the evolution of targeting on Facebook Wanted to know either qualitatively or quantitatively if you could talk a little bit about the way those ads are performing as you continue to evolve the product set around targeting on Facebook and off in particular around Dynamic Product Ads and what that might mean for closing the loop longer term Thanks so much guys Mark Elliot Zuckerberg Chairman Chief Executive Officer Yeah So in terms of news and different kinds of content I know this has traditionally been something that weve delivered a really good experience for in terms of people being able to share the content that they want being able to get access to the content that they want different recommendations from friends and weve a lot more coming there so Im excited about that And we definitely do see in this family of app strategy that theres so many new ways that people want to share content and so many different types of sets of people that people want to share with right ranging from one person at a time and that would be messaging or small group sharing or sharing with interestbased communities or sharing with all your friends at once or sharing with public There are just a lot of different experience that needs to get built And a lot of what were trying to do is enable a number of those things through Facebook while also building unique worldclass services to enable people to share all the things they care about with all the different sets of people that they care about So were going to keep on doing more there But were happy with where we are now We have a number of services that are reaching pretty good scale and I think well keep on pushing that Sheryl K Sandberg Chief Operating Officer Director To your question on targeting and closing the loop these are two really important pieces for what we want to do Our goal when we work with marketers is to drive their business and that means their products off the shelves their services into the hands of people and so in order to do that well we need to work on targeting and we need to work on measurement So with targeting a more relevant ad is just better its better experience for consumers because they see something they like in their News Feed and it has a higher return for marketers And so were very focused on getting more people to use our targeting tools from Custom Audiences which lets people target ads differently to their current customers or people who theyd like to be their customers to look like audiences which enables us to identify the kind of characteristics of your current customers and then find other people on Facebook who share those characteristics so again the ad is well targeted I think our targeting abilities are really second to none and Ill share a recent example XFINITY put out a voice guide for visual disabilities and they did this they did this by doing an Oscar commercial with a girl who is blind imagining what Wizard of Oz characters looked like Now by doing that at the Oscars thats obviously TV and its a very broad ad and thats because they were both showing a product but also working on their brand On Facebook they took that ad and showed it to movie fans Wizard of Oz fans and also people connected to accessibility causes Thats actually pretty specific targeting that lets them hit exactly the right audience and amplify what they were doing on TV and I think thats the kind of thing that only we can do at scale and it shows how important targeting is When you think about closing the loop you then have to add in the measurement piece because if we can connect people seeing ads on Facebook to what they buy in stores or in other ways thats how you close the loop and thats why we put so much investment and hopefully so much innovation behind measurement So conversion tracking is increasingly used and we work with our marketers to use it even more and were also really excited about conversion list because thats the first product weve had which scientifically measures the additional business you get from Facebook ads It compares test groups that see ads with control groups that dont So whatever youre measuring in terms of conversions whether its sales or website clicks or registrations we can A B test and see exactly what the impact Facebook has I think were still at the beginning of this I think there is so much more we can do to make ads more relevant on Facebook and so much more we can do to measure results and I think our future growth will depend on executing on that very well Youssef H Squali Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Thank you very much A question for Dave and then maybe one for Mark or Sheryl FX adjusted ARPU growth this past quarter it was about which is by our math about half of what it was last year and within mobile it was about thats about a third of what it was last year Other than tough comps what else is driving that decline Is it just Q seasonality getting more pronounced Is there anything else we would have thought maybe video advertising would have had actually the opposite effect And then whats your maybe Mark or Sheryl whats your experience so far with Voice over IP What is the strategy I guess over time Is that something that you can start charging for or either through maybe a subscription or is there another way of monetizing it Thanks guys David M Wehner Chief Financial Officer Youssef its Dave So on the FX adjusted ARPU growth I would just really point to the overall revenue growth rate thats whats driving it So youre coming up against a bigger business last year than we had in the past So youre seeing declining rate on that basis So I dont think theres anything specific to ARPU its just a reflection of what were seeing on the revenue front as we scale and its sort of as expected there So were really pleased with the performance that were seeing on the revenue front certainly on the FX adjusted basis Were seeing strong growth in the face of really a tough currency environment So were really pleased with that We think weve got the best mobile ad product out there in the market and its just getting better So were really pleased with what were doing on the revenue front Mark Elliot Zuckerberg Chairman Chief Executive Officer Yeah and in terms of voice calling no were not going to charge for it just like were not going to charge for messaging What were focused on doing is providing more higher quality services for free than what you could otherwise get in paying for them And one thing that you may not know about voice calling is that by using the Internet for calling rather than the relatively low bit rate voice networks you can actually get higher quality calls using VoIP So one of our theories in this is that its one of the reasons why voice calling has been a little slower to catch on is because you need the large established network of people who you know will have access to be able to receive a voice call before it before that behavior can really take on in a big global community But now between Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp which are two very broad communication networks were pretty confident that because of the higher quality of calling that you can get through the services that were providing that this is going to continue growing very quickly I mean a lot of people still were just very early in rolling out and promoting it Even in Facebook Messenger its been out for a little while and were already more than of the global VoIP market And I think that thats just going to continue growing and Im really looking forward to getting the first stats on WhatsApp VoIP as well soon Your next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets Your line is open Mark S Mahaney RBC Capital Markets LLC Thanks One question for Mark one for Sheryl Mark theres just this explosion in these messaging platforms worldwide you obviously bought into one The growth has been greater than we would have expected and perhaps you too Do you have you has your thinking changed on the opportunity or maybe the need but really the opportunity to integrate WhatsApp and Facebook over the next couple of years because of the growth of WhatsApp todate And then Sheryl you mentioned some verticals that are doing well I was just wondering if I could ask about automotive and insurance just a couple of verticals that have always been skewed very heavily towards TV advertising and the question is whether theyve really skewed up more now on Facebook given the auto play video ad format Thank you Mark Elliot Zuckerberg Chairman Chief Executive Officer I mean on the messaging question yeah were pretty happy with how its all going I think if were going to pay billion for a company we should have pretty high expectations for how its going to do So I do feel good about how were doing but it needs to do a lot more obviously and were very excited about the roadmap of things that we have ahead In terms of integrating them no were not going to do that One of the things that had been interesting while we were watching these different services grow was just how quickly multiple different messaging and communication services were growing at the same time and it seemed a little bit counterintuitive at first because it seemed like there should have been more overlap than it actually now in retrospect looking back seems like there is So you can look at countries where both services WhatsApp and Messenger are growing very quickly like Brazil for example And what youll see is that basically people use them a little bit differently I mean WhatsApp is more of a clear text messaging replacement Facebook Messenger people use to connect with people that they know on Facebook primarily And then there are differences in the feature sets where WhatsApp is extremely utilitarian and focused on texting and now voice calling whereas Messenger is very focused on expression and the whole set of things that fit into the tools around the Messenger platform that we rolled out at F communicating with businesses now richer tools to communicate in different ways So I think that these are just going to keep on growing is my expectation and hope and were excited to kind of pursue both different products to serve the different communities Sheryl K Sandberg Chief Operating Officer Director On the auto and insurance verticals theyre both still small which makes them good opportunities to grow Were seeing good progress on both of them and interestingly insurance companies have been pretty active both on Facebook and Instagram so were optimistic about that Great Thanks Two questions One for Mark and one for Dave I guess Mark just going back to the video question again real quick Im wondering given all the noise around overthetop and long form content and given your push in video Im just sort of curious as to whether or not you think Facebook can or should be a player in more studio content professionallydriven content And then Dave I guess for you just in terms of CapEx you gave guidance for this year but again given sort of the rampup in video in search how should we think about CapEx longer term relative to either in absolute terms or maybe relative to revenue growth Thanks David M Wehner Chief Financial Officer I can go first So on the CapEx growth for this year Paul yeah we are ramping CapEx obviously to support the initiatives that we have is a big investment year for us both in CapEx and OpEx Its a little bit early to be talking about how thats going to scale going forward But clearly weve got a lot of areas that were investing in including video including the various other services on top of Facebook So were going to be investing to deliver the best quality services that we can for our users so well continue to invest heavily on the datacenter and infrastructure side going forward But is a big investment year for us across the board Mark Elliot Zuckerberg Chairman Chief Executive Officer Yeah and on video were excited about people sharing all different kinds of content on Facebook Right now a lot of what people are sharing are their social videos and content There a lot of public figures who have pages often with millions or tens of millions of followers producing unique and really highquality content that theyre pushing out to all their fans on the network today So yeah well continue looking at ways to grow that and its the product experience that we have right now is growing quite well so we feel good about it Great Thanks Two questions One more on video So with the explosive ramp in video views over the last six months could you discuss the video advertising ramp this year And then maybe talk about the video versus static ads within the News Feed And then the other question would be you reference Facebook hitting million active advertisers in the first quarter and with over million company pages how should we think about the advertiser TAM for Facebook next year and over time Thank you Sheryl K Sandberg Chief Operating Officer Director So to the first question video is a big opportunity for us Mark talked about how we have billion video views on Facebook everyday and weve always believed that the format of our ads should follow the format of what consumers are doing on Facebook So many years ago when the homepage ticker was in vogue we never did that And so the fact that theres so much consumer video that gives us the opportunity to do more marketing video as well Its still early days and were very focused on quality and its worth noting that not all of the revenue from video is incremental because the video ads take the place of other ads that we would have served into News Feed That said were really excited about the opportunity I talked about increasing the entertainment and media vertical and brand marketers particularly But I think all marketers have the opportunity to do video and thats pretty exciting including SMBs who would never be able to hire a film crew and buy a TV ad Were seeing those put videos in Over million SMBs have posted videos and done really small ad buys around them And thats pretty cool because I dont think there are probably million advertisers who have bought TV ads in that same period of time When you think about our marketer growth I think we have an ability to grow both the number of advertisers who use our platform but also the percentage of their business that we get So million small business pages continuing to grow We have an opportunity to turn those businesses into advertisers and marketers and thats what weve done successfully and were going to continue to focus on that And we do that by building very simple ad products And then when you think about the percentage of spend we have what I said before on this call which is we only have a small percentage of even our large customers thats true of our small customers too Now there are some who spend a large portion of their budget on Facebook but thats actually very unusual For most people even when they start spending with us were a small portion of their budget And when you look at the consumer time we get we are not getting the equivalent amount of time or resources from our marketers really of any size and therein lies our opportunity to grow Your next question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch Your line is open Justin Post Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thank you Dave maybe you could help us breakdown the ad revenue growth a little bit Between usage kind of are you increasing ad loads at all Maybe you talk about the formats or is Instagram helping at all just a little granularity on that or maybe its just a format shift but just help us understand what the key drivers are and how much room you still have to go on each of these things Thank you David M Wehner Chief Financial Officer Yeah Justin So in terms of the revenue growth obviously its mobile News Feed is whats driving it from a fundamental point of view In terms of what the opportunity there is to drive it its really about increasing the relevance and quality of the ads Thats been a key part of what weve been doing and that will just continue to be the big driver in the near and mediumterm And were doing that on a number of different fronts Part of its about finding the right format so its getting the video units there for the people for whom video ads are going to make sense Its getting the dynamic products ads in front of people for people who are going to find those ads interesting and engaging And its really just continuing to learn more and more about the people who are using Facebook and what types of ads they interact with and the like And so thats part of what were trying to do across the board And then at the same time were bringing more and more advertisers into the system and thats giving us a better selection of the ads that we can serve to the people using Facebook and that again improves the quality and the relevance So the main thing that were seeing drive this is just improving the quality and the relevance of the ads experience for the people using Facebook and I think thats going to continue to be the story I think the specific ads will be part of how we do that but it wont be the only way It will also be the targeting that we have and the targeting capabilities that were doing with things like Custom Audiences and getting better and better at that So theres a lot of different fronts that were working on Its hard to tease out every individual component of it But all in all were really pleased with the revenue growth that were seeing And also thats coupled with good engagement growth so were doing a nice balance of having an experience thats working well for our advertisers but its also working really well for the people who are using Facebook Ross Sandler Deutsche Bank Securities Inc Great Just two quick questions First on the News Feed organic reach and then Mark one on Apple Watch and wearables So on the News Feed you guys recently made tweak to kind of alter the algorithm in favor of friendoriented content And then on the other hand youre also moving towards like hosting publisher content from New York Times and BuzzFeed and folks like that So how are you balancing out organic reach between these algorithm changes and then whether or not professional content is hosted inside of Facebook versus coming from a thirdparty website And then the second question is Mark how do you view the shift to wearables with smaller screens and shorter interactions So it looks like you guys have gotten most of the apps on the Apple Watch Just wondering what youre doing to kind of adapt to these new smaller screens Thanks Mark Elliot Zuckerberg Chairman Chief Executive Officer Sure So I can speak to both of those For the News Feed question the North Star for us in News Feed is that we want to produce the best experience for everyone who is using the app and loading News Feed to see what is going on in the world around them right So when it comes to there are lots of businesses on Facebook there are professional content producers our main interest here is the people in the community who are using News Feed not those guys right So of course we want to build tools to enable them to share their content and all of that but were constantly refining the algorithms in order to make it so the experience is the best for you when you open up your phone and look at Facebook and there are a bunch of things that are going on we want to make sure that were getting what you care about the most And we go to a lot of lengths to make sure that were getting signals from people in our community to make sure that were doing this correctly in addition to the different signals that we would get from seeing people use the products We also do a lot of qualitative surveys to see what people what makes what people write in that they want to see from us what people tell us is the most important thing that they saw in Facebook today or saw anywhere in the world today and what they wouldve wanted to have seen on Facebook And our goal is to just constantly refine this and make it better and were going to keep on doing that because we think theres a lot of upside and theres a lot more that we can do Now at the same time in order to make this experience good there also needs to be good content in the system right so we need to make sure that people have the tools to able to share the moments that they care about But if youre a professional publisher you need to have the ability to share a version of the content that youre producing that youre proud of that can load quickly that can be as rich as the tools enable people to see and were working on a lot of different tools for that And you can imagine that as the tools for any of this content get better people taking photos newspapers writing news articles advertisers putting out ads for content that they want to sell the better that content gets the more people are excited to see it and then that informs the ranking in what the community qualitatively tells us that they want to see from us over time as well So its just a constant cycle on that What was the other question Mark Elliot Zuckerberg Chairman Chief Executive Officer You know I havent actually spent that much time with this so far so I mean I mostly just want to congratulate Apple on shipping something that seems like a pretty amazing piece of technology and work and were proud to be supporting And I know that we have a bunch of apps and its a space thats going to be really interesting and were going watch closely and build what our community wants us to Thank you Two more quick questions on video Roughly what percentage of videos are currently monetized via ads and where do you see it headed over time And as you look at the early video ads on the platform how is pricing comparing to other ad formats Thanks David M Wehner Chief Financial Officer I can take this I mean in terms of in terms of what percentage of videos or ads were not breaking that out I think what we said was that were really pleased with the consumer adoption were seeing Thats kind of the fundamental table stakes that need to be there and thats the most important thing and were really pleased with the billion video views daily that were getting We know that marketers love videos so theres a great opportunity here Its still early Its worth pointing out that as Sheryl mentioned video does displace other ads in News Feed And let me just kind of speak to how that plays into pricing as well Video is just a format thats bid into the auction So video is effectively winning in the auction if its higher priced So if somebodys willing to pay more for a video its going to get served before another type of format ad But theres not really a price differential youre paying for a video its just what are you willing to pay into the system So theres not differential pricing by product its just what are you willing to bid for the format that you want to show to the people that you want to show it to and thats how the system works Ben Schachter Macquarie Capital USA Inc Mark does the OpEx guide assume an Oculus product for consumers this calendar year And will the initial products focus on gaming or more on some of the experiences that you showed at F around nongaming like that Saturday Night Live demo And then separately beyond searching within Facebook should we expect to see Facebook leverage its million advertiser relationships against thirdparty search queries For example when a user searches on say Yahoo or maybe some Apple device Facebook might tap it to advertisers to provide relevant sponsored results Thanks David M Wehner Chief Financial Officer Ben let me take the OpEx guidance question So we have not announced any specific plans for shipment volumes in related to Oculus I just know that Oculus is very much in the development stage so its early to be talking about large shipment volumes and our expense guidance reflects any volumes that we might do in Sheryl K Sandberg Chief Operating Officer Director Your next question is from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities Your line is open Peter C Stabler Wells Fargo Securities LLC Good afternoon Thanks Dave I just wanted to return to I think Justins question about the drivers behind ad growth You mentioned gains made in relevance and quality and format Wondering if you could provide any quantitative color around ad engagement trends clicks shares likes or anything like that And then secondly one quickly for Sheryl In your SMB discussions wondering if youre ever asked to help facilitate transactions in that space Or thats an area of small business that youre interested in Thank you David M Wehner Chief Financial Officer Yeah So Peter just on the on ads engagement thats an area that weve obviously been very focused on and were really pleased with the results that were seeing there in terms of driving better engagement per ad and thats really the focus of a lot of our quality and relevance efforts How do we find those ads that are going to be more engaging theyre going to get more clicks that theyre going to get more views that are going to get more installs Were working on focusing on all of those on optimizing the relevance of the ads for all of those different potential actions that happen downstream and were pleased with what were doing there and the trends that were seeing there And again thats a big part of what were trying to do to drive the overall ads growth story as well as providing a good experience for users with the ads that theyre seeing Sheryl K Sandberg Chief Operating Officer Director On SMBs we have a very small test in the US We started last quarter for buyon Facebook and that enables people to buy products from merchants with a buy button on Pages and it is a product that is used and aimed at SMBs Were also very focused on helping SMBs have a presence especially a mobile presence of SMBs in the United States which is probably ahead of most other countries dont have a web presence at all and an even smaller percentage of SMBs have a mobile web presence or any kind of mobile presence that works And so Pages are a good and free and easy way to have a mobile presence and thats something were very focused on growing Deborah Crawford DirectorInvestor Relations Certainly Your final question is from Mark May with Citi Your line is open Mark A May Citigroup Global Markets Inc Broker Thanks a lot I had two Youve recently announced plans to enable longer form video content as well as to allow those videos to be syndicated or distributed on thirdparty publishers What if any initiatives do you have to help with this content contributors and the publishers to generate revenue from those videos And then secondly on public content what if anything are you doing to try to secure more unique public content content thats potentially unique to Facebook from personalities and other sources Thanks Sheryl K Sandberg Chief Operating Officer Director On the video question were basically focused primarily on video on our own site and service and video tends to be pretty short form content right now on Facebook because its playing in News Feed We do see some pretty cool examples of people using it well So for example in the election you saw Hillary Clinton announce her candidacy very recently obviously and that video got million views Ted Cruz and others have done the same and theyve gotten large numbers of video views So we think its a very attractive platform for people to reach people with video messages Deborah Crawford DirectorInvestor Relations Great
