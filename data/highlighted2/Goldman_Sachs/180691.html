sales Last week Apple NASDAQ AAPL stated that initial iPhone sales were on pace to top last years first weekend sales record With the phone being available this Friday investors and analysts will be listening next Monday to see how the opening weekend went I dont believe we should read too much into any figures Apple releases as this years period is much different than last years Today Ill provide some reasons why Im ignoring any opening weekend sales data This truly is an apples to oranges comparison Last years preorder period went from September th to September th while this years preorder period goes from the th to the th Additionally the iPhone is available for preorder and delivery on day one in China where last year that country had to wait about a month for the phone Chinese sales may be pulled forward a bit so unless Apple releases information on how that countrys sales compared to the similar October period data may be completely useless Also Apple is embarking on a slightly different strategy in certain US states this year In states without a sales tax of which there are five but Montana doesnt have any Apple stores customers must have a reservation to buy an iPhone on launch day Apple is changing its strategy to reduce the impact of sharks or phone brokers who buy unlocked phones and ship them to global locations where the phones are in short supply to make a profit In US states with no sales tax these phones are obviously cheaper so the sharks can make more of a profit Apple is trying to eliminate this practice but it might result in a slight reduction of opening weekend sales There has been a lot of attention on Pope Francis visit to the US In recent days there has been a large discussion about his visit impacting iPhone sales Some couriers such as UPS NYSE UPS are warning customers about impacted deliveries in New York and Philadelphia later this week due to very tight security This could mean that people who preordered the phone may not get it on day one However the larger impact may be for those looking to buy the phone on Friday and Saturday If couriers like UPS cant make their deliveries some of Apples retail stores may not get as much supply as hoped which would limit potential sales this weekend Also road closures and other traffic nightmares might keep consumers from heading out to Apple or other retail stores It might be a lot easier to wait until next week than to fight massive traffic delays just to get the phone a few days earlier One item that seems to be lost in all of this discussion is Apples fiscal calendar The companys fiscal Q period ends this Saturday September th That means that any sales that come on Sunday would be in the holiday fiscal Q period not during fiscal Q So while Apple may release sales through the opening weekend part of that weekend isnt a factor in the quarter to be reported in October When combined with the apples to oranges comparison to last year any data we might get from Apple wont be tremendously valid Preorders may be up substantially given the longer period and availability in China Also last year had the phone available in stores for more than a week during fiscal Q while this year has just a couple of days One of the reasons why Apple shares have been hit hard recently is the fears over slowing growth in China which is Apples fastest growing region Interestingly enough this years launch will create an interesting dynamic since a few million iPhone sales should be pulled forward into fiscal Q In last years fiscal Q period Apple reported billion in Greater China revenues up just over the prior year period In the next three fiscal quarters the company would report massive and yearoveryear sales growth for Greater China By pulling iPhone sales forward Apples October earnings report should show another big jump for China Thus fiscal Q will have a harder base point for China and wont contain a launch period for the new iPhone Thus when we get results in January dont be surprised if the China growth number is not very impressive Overall the China situation and opening weekend sales represent the shortterm view over Apple In the grand scheme of things how important are a few days of sales Apple could announce somewhere around million iPhone sales for instance but this is a company that is getting close to selling million phones annually In the end the opening weekend is only likely to represent or of yearly sales so keep that in perspective Back in June I detailed how improvement for iOS would be the key to Apples developer conference Apple needed to make the operating system more efficient provide a more stabile platform and help with battery life It appears that Apple has done well as Apple has recently announced that iOS is off to a tremendous start with more than of devices already being upgraded A better operating system combined with big upgrades to memory the cameras and the addition of Force Touch are the real keys to the longterm success of the S and S Plus Early reviews rolling in are quite positive including Walt Mossberg saying that the pressure sensitive screen looks like a game changer Apple significantly upgraded the hardware of the iPhone this year and made a big jump with its mobile operating system Plus you now have the iPhone available at a discounted price with its preferred larger screen A number of analysts think Street estimates for the iPhone are way too low as the overall consensus is that iPhone revenues for fiscal will be flat On Tuesday <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs issued a positive note on Apple calling for iPhone revenue growth The analyst pointed out that the iPhone installed base is up yearoveryear and the model shows a correlation between the growth in the installed base and growth in upgrades The analyst assumed coverage with a price target based on potential upside in the iPhone and iPad With the Street being flat on the iPhone for fiscal any growth could lead to decent upside for shares I recently detailed how analyst estimates for the period seemed to imply almost no earnings growth The iPhone is a very high margin product especially with Apple pushing users to the more expensive higher storage capacity models If the company can get iPhone growth in the low to mid single digits percentage wise I think blowing past in EPS will happen leading to upside for this undervalued stock Some of these issues may seem rather small on their own but pieced together may provide just enough of an impact to be meaningful Currently Apple analysts expect billion in fiscal Q revenues just below the top end of the companys guidance range With estimates this high even the smallest sales disruption could be the difference between making and missing estimates Plus if Mondays data appears positive at first blush and analysts rush to raise their numbers expectations could be way too high going into the earnings report When you also factor in the end of the fiscal quarter I dont think any data we get from Apple will be that meaningful unless Apple breaks down the numbers in large detail Given how management has been very tightlipped about certain numbers in the past I dont expect this to be the case There are just too many differences between last years launch and this years
