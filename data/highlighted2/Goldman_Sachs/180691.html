The analyst pointed out that the iPhone installed base is up 32% year-over-year, and the model shows a 90% correlation between the growth in the installed base and growth in upgrades.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The analyst assumed coverage with a $163 price target based on potential upside in the iPhone and iPad. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With the Street being flat on the iPhone for fiscal 2016, any growth could lead to decent upside for shares. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I recently detailed how analyst estimates for the period seemed to imply almost no earnings growth. (Uncertainty) </span>The iPhone is a very high margin product, especially with Apple pushing users to the more expensive, higher storage capacity models.If the company can get iPhone growth in the low to mid single digits, percentage wise, I think blowing past $10 in EPS will happen, leading to upside for this undervalued stock.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some of these issues may seem rather small on their own, but pieced together may provide just enough of an impact to be meaningful. (Uncertainty) </span>Currently, Apple analysts expect $50.95 billion in fiscal Q4 revenues, just below the top end of the company's guidance range.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With estimates this high, even the smallest sales disruption could be the difference between making and missing estimates. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Plus, if Monday's data appears positive at first blush and analysts rush to raise their numbers, expectations could be way too high going into the earnings report. (Uncertainty) </span>When you also factor in the end of the fiscal quarter, I don't think any data we get from Apple will be that meaningful unless Apple breaks down the numbers in large detail.Given how management has been very tight-lipped about certain numbers in the past, I don't expect this to be the case.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are just too many differences between last year's launch and this year's, which is why I'm going to ignore any data we get from Apple next week.
