Yahoo continues to ratchet up or not it is still very unclear what Marissa Evita Breadsticks Mayers purple kingdom is actually worth Or even what it is at this point We know that theres the Alibaba stock but thats not in the mix and then theres the search and email business and the newsentertainment division destroyed by Kim Kardashians butt But there are a few smaller things from which Yahoo makes a buck or two and some of them are tangled and strange but worth some pretty nice money In Yahoo struck a deal with Softbank to launch Yahoo Japan together taking a minority stake in the joint venture According to BI SunTrust analyst Robert Peck has done some digging ad figured out that Yahoo Japan is a sweet little piece for anyone looking to buy what they think Yahoo is And there a some key reasons why But as part of the deal Yahoo also signed a royalty agreementto collect of Yahoo Japans gross profit every year That royalty payment was worth about million last year alone Nice How does Yahoo Japan throw of that kind of coin Yahoo has no role in running Yahoo Japan whatsoever Ah okay How well are things going over at Yahoo Japan without meddling from Marissa and whats left of her team The best part about the Yahoo Japan royalties is that its almost pure cash and it doesnt cost anything for Yahoo other than providing the rights to use its brand in Japan There was some technical support involved initially but thats mostly gone Peck says Yahoo Japans main search engine for example now licenses Googles search technology instead On top of that Yahoo Japan continues to grow As its gross profit grows the royalty payments will only expand Last year Yahoo Japan generated billion in revenue up from the previous year and the same size of revenue Yahoo US expects to hit this year It also saw an impressive operating margin marking the th straight year of recordhigh revenue and profit according to its annual report It forecast another high singledigit growth across the board for this fiscal year Wow With those numbers its almost shocking to see the word Yahoo anywhere nearby But if SoftBank is the one making this thing hum why dont they just go and buy Yahoo Japan Theres not much Softbank could do to get out of this deal unless it buys back the stake Yahoo US holds in Yahoo Japan But SunTrusts Peck noted that the royalty itself could be sold separately and in that case Softbank would be first in line to make a bid Weve heard that Softbank would be interested in the Yahoo Japan shares as well as this royalty right but I dont think theyre interested in running Yahoocom Peck said Now weve given Marissa her fair share of guff in the last few months but even weve got to tip our hats to this bargaining position If you want your Yahoo Japan business back without having to pay me an annual fee for the privilege of using our useless name youre going to have to drop about billion to buy all of the other things weve set fire to and ruined in the past few years Yahoos bidding price could get a big boost because of a business it has nothing to do with BI <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs Ditching Travel Expenses Employees In
