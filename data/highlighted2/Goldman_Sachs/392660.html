could recieve which should lead to renewed interest The Delta order is unlikley to be very profitable for Bombardier however any losses incurred are likely the best marketing spend on the CSeries to date Bombardier will need to use the validation and momentum from the Delta order to secure further profitable orders but this will likely require a production increase Img rendering of a Delta CSeries Todays announcement and confirmation that Delta Air Lines NYSE DAL will order Bombardier OTCQXBDRBF CSeries plus options is incredibly positive for the program and a major savior As I outlined in my article here CSeries Order A WinWin For Bombardier And Delta the Delta order will give this aircraft the highest validation it could ever receive This is part one and for many other airlines on the sidelines a smooth entry into service with Swiss would be part two and should undoubtedly reignite serious interest once again in the program The Delta order now leaves the CSeries basically sold out until and in a situation with more orders prior to launch than the highly successful A had when it launched in With the CSeries order today both the CSeries and Bombardier are here to stay It is hard to stress enough how significant the Delta order is today and it absolutely makes Bombardier stock a buy and a very compelling turnaround play for investors at this point Despite the positives I outlined above and in my previous article the Delta order will not come cheap at all for Bombardier Due to pressure from Boeing and Airbus the order is in fact likely either breakeven or possibly being sold at a loss for Bombardier The key from the first mention of the CSeries by Delta executives in January this year was it was compelling but at the right price These losses however may be the best marketing spend Bombardier has given the CSeries since its inception and will certainly benefit it over the long run but the focus should now become profits at the CSeries program for Bombardier investors A look into the recent United Boeing order by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs concluded that Boeing likely sold United aircraft at million a piece below list price and most likely at a loss The pricing Boeing would have offered Delta an airline with even more clout is likely to be at least as low as this putting immense pressure on Bombardiers CSeries pricing The difficulty for Bombardier now is that the Delta order has basically sold out much of the production line for the next years through with orders that are likely breakeven or loss making For Bombardier to really win from the momentum that this Delta order delivers it will really need to expand production to allow for profitable orders to be produced alongside the breakevenloss leader orders from Delta Expanded production is going to require additional investment on Bombardiers end For Bombardier there are a number of things standing in the way of profits One is as mentioned above the lack of production scale to A accommodate profitable orders and B develop economies of scale while the second is the large development costs The total cost to develop the CSeries program now stands at billion a number that while large is substantially less than the billion Boeing ended up spending on the launch For Boeing the margin of a that has its development costs paid off and is being produced at a large scale is So for Bombardier potential annual profits could look something like this assuming an average selling price at off its million list price Table Potential Bombardier CSeries Profits The current target of to CSeries delivered by the end of would lead to a production rate of around aircraft per month compared to per month for the Boeing At this rate and with a profit margin of the program would take almost years to break even making a production increase necessary if the CSeries is to be financially viable long term This does not take into account the fact that the Delta order that makes up a large percentage of these aircraft may be sold at breakeven or a loss reducing the overall margin A CS would be very positive for Bombardier in driving profits in that it would likely be able to sell for a premium despite costing only incrementally more to produce An additional benefit would be the economies of scale the CSeries program could attain from a CS and the greater pricing power this would give Bombardier For instance Boeing has brought down the cost of its jet in recent years from large increases in production The fixed costs for Boeing rise at an incremental rate from increased production while these fixed costs become spread over many more aircraft The same scenario playing out across Boeing suppliers enables across the board cost savings and greater pricing power Img Projected Aircraft Demand By Size Demand for the CS and CS while potentially strong is much more of a niche market compared to the CS market As the graph above shows projected demand for an aircraft the size of the CS is units from over double the market size of the CS and CS market The CS would therefore enable a much larger ramp up in production than Bombardier would be able to do with the CS and CS making all models more competitive on price Despite the potential positives from a CS as I outlined in my article here such an offering has a lot of hurdles and uncertainties before it can become a reality The Delta order is a major validation for the CSeries that will undoubtedly lead to renewed interest in the program A successful launch with Swiss airlines later this year would likely be the key to give airlines the confidence they need in the CSeries to seriously consider it Beyond this the next step in the CSeries program will be making it financially viable longer term The Delta orders are unlikely to be profitable so the key will be for Bombardier to take advantage of todays Delta order to secure additional profitable orders The launch of a CS along with an increased production rate of the existing CS and CS would be steps that would allow for profitable orders in the near term and are further positives for the program that investors should
