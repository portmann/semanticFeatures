Dan Daniel J McCarthy President Chief Executive Officer Director Good morning and thank you for joining Frontiers Fourth Quarter Earnings Call Today Im going to discuss highlights of our fourth quarter review our accomplishments in introduce our video strategy which will be a key focus going forward and update you on our execution plans for the acquisition of Verizons wireline operations in California Texas and Florida We continued our track record of solid execution in operating our existing business in the fourth quarter and throughout the year even while committing substantial time and resources to preparing for the California Texas and Florida acquisition The fourth quarter represented our th consecutive quarter of strong broadband net additions with net additions of sic This extends our continuing trend of very strong progress in broadband with cumulative net additions totaling nearly since the beginning of Our progress continues to be broadbased across our footprint In the fourth quarter we once again increased our residential broadband penetration in over of the markets we serve We maintained good momentum in our business segment as well This was our eighth consecutive quarter of roughly stable sequential results in SME excluding Connecticut was a year of very substantial accomplishments for Frontier We executed a smooth successful CEO transition as well as the separation of the CEO and chairman roles This will culminate on April in the appointment of an independent nonexecutive chairman Pam Reeve moving us to the governance structure preferred by many shareholders In the second and third quarters we raised all the equity and debt funding required to close the California Texas and Florida transaction We completed the regulatory approval process with the final step being the receipt of the California PUC approval in December We also are nearly complete with our integration activities and are looking forward to closing in less than days In we completed the integration of our Connecticut property This included stabilizing the residential customer base after a number of customers migrated to new pricing early in the year We have invested heavily and continue to improve the network in Connecticut and are focused on introducing higher speeds and video availability to more communities in the state Finally we have transitioned to a normalized rhythm of acquisition pricing and marketbased video pricing which will improve ARPC and margins over time Last year we fulfilled our commitments under the FCCs CAFI program and embarked upon the CAFII program in order to improve our broadband availability to unserved households John will address this further but let me say that our plan is to connect or upgrade over households utilizing CAFII funding this year We also continue to improve broadband capability elsewhere within our footprint For example in Connecticut and other markets we are in the process of introducing speeds in excess of megabits over copper fed by our fibertothenode infrastructure We had been investing to transform our operating support systems our customer selfservice capabilities and our provisioning platforms We believe these investments will position us well to lower operating expenses from our existing business as we deploy these enhancements and customers begin to adopt the new functionality In reviewing there are areas we have identified where we can do better in the future We have efforts underway to improve our performance One significant ongoing pressure we have in our business is the decline of voice particularly in residential In fact this was the reason our customer revenue is slightly short of our expectations in the fourth quarter While this secular headwind will continue the relative impact on total revenue will decline We estimate our residential voice revenue run rate will be approaching of revenue pro forma for California Texas and Florida acquisition In Connecticut we began to experience the benefit of the expiration of promotions introduced in the fall of The benefit was limited in Q as the expirations occurred only partway through the period We anticipate a more significant benefit in the first and second quarters And as we migrate this cohort of customers offpromotional pricing we havent experienced a resulting significant increase in churn As you know we are in the process of reshaping our business to offer customers enhancements to the broadband products that have become such important parts of their lives Additional broadband market share growth remains a key initiative for the company Currently our percentage of residential broadband penetration is only in the mids Approximately of broadband activity in Q was above the basic speed tier up from nearly in Q We have an opportunity to drive this higher encouraging a more rapid shift to the higherspeed capabilities offered by our network And as we open new markets with the CAFII funds we will introduce broadband to areas that have been waiting for this product Another key strategic initiative for Frontier is the introduction of video service in a number of our existing markets with a minimal capital outlay This will leverage our fibertothenode architecture that has become a viable opportunity to advances in technology regarding video compression and server architecture This represents an exciting revenue opportunity for Frontier that takes advantage of our increasing scale and the substantial investments that weve already made in our broadband network We will be growing a new stream of revenue from our existing investments in the network while leveraging our enhanced operational support and billing support systems and our IPTV delivery platform We believe that offering video service opens the door to attracting new customers to our broadband service while introducing new tools to improve retaining existing customers We began this process as soon as we introduced our video service in Durham North Carolina first on a trial basis in the fourth quarter and now commercially Our plans are to introduce video service to more than markets representing approximately three million households over a three to fouryear period Once complete video service will be available to about of the million households in Frontiers existing footprint not counting the pending Verizon acquisition Including California Texas and Florida properties we would be able to provide our video service to more than seven million households and we anticipate additional opportunities as we upgrade select copper markets in the acquired states This initiative is a direct result of the experience in technology we have gained from Connecticut and the pending California Texas and Florida acquisition This video offering will essentially be a product extension running on our already robust network infrastructure We will utilize existing content relationships and we already have the rights in place to offer video across our footprint And these rights provide us the flexibility to introduce a variety of bundles and packages that will appeal to a wide spectrum of customer preferences This endeavor is extremely capitalefficient for two key reasons First we are leveraging the substantial broadband infrastructure investment we have made in our network over the last halfdozen years And second our IPTV applications employ the latest very advanced compression technology Our HD television channel will require approximately megabits of capacity meaning a household with four HDTVs active at once will only require megabits of capacity into the home leaving the remainder available for data usage The capabilities of the latest technology combined with our increasing scale make it extremely compelling for Frontier to undertake this initiative now To enable million households to receive video over our existing broadband infrastructure will require total capital spending of less than million spread over several years That means we can undertake this project within our existing capital budget and current forecast The rate of our deployment can be varied depending on success As a result this is a lowrisk undertaking If the take rates arent in line with our expectations we can adjust our plan accordingly In addition to the direct revenue benefits to Frontier also consider the scale benefits With the closing of California Texas and Florida acquisition we will have approximately million video subscribers excluding satellite Consider how much larger our video scale could become as we proceed with this initiative and increase our penetration across the three million additional households For all the reasons I have discussed I hope you can see why this is such a strategically significant initiative for Frontier And now lets discuss our California Texas and Florida transaction Were in the final phases of preparing for the closing of the acquisition which is scheduled for April The integration teams from both sides have been extremely diligent in planning a detailed cutover with the mutual objective of minimal customer disruption As we have previously discussed our plan is to maintain the existing service plans and gotomarket approach that currently exist in the Verizon markets We have already adopted them within our systems in our existing FiOS markets Were in the final stages of our conversion plans The system conversions are on track and we are seeing conversion metrics at or above our expectations for this point in the conversion process We are executing our training plans including a segment of the incoming work force All indications are very positive with less than days until the cutover The entire Frontier organization is focused on having a smooth cutover and a great experience for our new customers We are excited about the opportunities in our new markets and as we continue to learn more about these markets and the employees who will be joining us we believe we will be in a strong position to drive significant benefits for our customers and our stakeholders As we have moved closer to cutover we have developed a better insight into our cost structure At that time I can say with full confidence that we will be in excess of million in day one cost synergies and we are continuing to refine our day one cost structure We will provide an update on our cost structure and initial synergy attainment on our Q earnings call Deceleration of synergies supports our ability to deliver the leverage free cash flow accretion we forecasted for this transaction In summary I am extremely excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for Frontier We are on the cusp of closing the longanticipated California Texas and Florida acquisition to which our entire team has devoted so much time energy and effort and we have a compelling lowrisk plan to broaden our capabilities across our legacy markets through the video initiative while leveraging the significant investments made for the Verizon integration and our IT platforms to improve our cost structure over time We appreciate the investment communitys ongoing patience and confidence as we execute this transformative acquisition which is a significant leap forward for Frontier I will now hand the call over to our CFO John Jureller who will go into more details on our financial performance Frontier reported a loss for common share of in the fourth quarter after dividends on our preferred stock compared to a loss for common share of in the third quarter of and income of per common share in the fourth quarter of Adjusting for dividends on the preferred stock acquisitionrelated interest expense acquisition and integration cost severance cos and certain tax items our nonGAAP adjusted net income was per share in the fourth quarter of compared to per share in the third quarter of and per share in the fourth quarter of On February the board declared a common dividend of per share for the first quarter of payable March in line with the dividend rate of the four quarters of We also will be paying the regularly scheduled dividend on our preferred shares on March Fourth quarter revenue was billion as compared to billion in the third quarter Total legacy revenue declined by million with a decline in voice revenues partially offset by an increased in video and regulatory revenues Revenue in Connecticut was million a sequential decline of about million primarily due to declines in voice revenue Customer revenue of billion was down million sequentially or negative We experienced a slight increase in the headwind from voice revenue relative to the expectation we had outlined for Q revenue Total residential customer revenue of million was down million as compared to Q We did experience an improvement in Connecticut as we began to migrate customers off the oneyear promotions that were introduced in the fourth quarter But this benefit was offset by a decline in voice revenue We should see more of the benefit in this migration in the first quarter Business customer revenue of million was down only million sequentially Total data and Internet services revenue was stable sequentially with increases in our residential and business broadband services and carrier revenues offsetting the declines in wireless backhaul revenue Voice revenue declined slightly more than anticipated reflecting customer migration to different price plans Regulatory revenue for the quarter was million up million sequentially Our regulatory revenue was reduced by approximately million in the fourth quarter versus expectations because in the process of verifying the CAFII household count provided by the FCC we found a slightly lower number This will reduce our CAFII revenue by about million per quarter going forward In the fourth quarter we recognized the full year impact of this change which was approximately million Residential average revenue per customer or ARPC was for the fourth quarter of a decline of sequentially Lower voice revenue both standalone and within product bundles was a contributing factor partially offset by improvements in data and video Business ARPC was up sequentially The adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter was which was up basis points from the third quarter level as a result of lower cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter and the increase in CAFII revenue recognized in the period Cash operating expenses of million were slightly lower than the target range we had outlined for Q in November We do anticipate an increase in operating expense in Q driven by seasonal factors such as the usual first quarter increase in payroll tax and some additional head count Capital expenditures were million in the fourth quarter and we spent an additional million in CapEx related to integration activities Frontiers cash flow remains very healthy Our adjusted free cash flow was million in the fourth quarter Our dividend payout ratio adjusted to exclude the incremental dividends and interest expense on the capital raise for our pending transaction with Verizon was in the fourth quarter as compared to in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter of We believe that the adjusted dividend payout ratio that excludes the incremental capital cost is appropriate until such time as we complete our transaction as we dont yet have the operating cash flow associated with this capital Our leverage ratio at the end of Q was times Frontiers liquidity remains robust Excluding the restricted cash earmarked for our California Texas and Florida acquisition we ended the quarter with approximately billion in cash and credit availability Our debt maturities are wellladdered and at the present time we dont see a need to access the public capital markets for the next couple of years As we move forward its important to reiterate Frontiers capital allocation framework investing appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations supporting our current dividend and utilizing excess cash generated to reduce indebtedness and our leverage ratio As Dan outlined earlier within our capital spending plan we have the flexibility to shift funds to invest in the deployment of video services and to meet the CAFII obligations We are comfortable with the leverage level of approximately four times that we project after the closing of the Verizon transaction We are committed to maintaining our liquidity and reducing our leverage over time We know that there has been substantial interest in getting an update on the results of the California Texas and Florida assets we are acquiring So let me give you a snapshot on a few things The pro forma adjusted revenues for California Texas and Florida were approximately billion in Q Verizon has not yet finalized the full year audited financial statements of that business but has advised us that based upon preliminary information it is anticipated that the pro forma adjusted revenues for the fourth quarter were slightly ahead of Q This is a directional indication and we await final confirmation when Verizon delivers to us the audited financial statements for the California Texas and Florida business FiOS data connections increased by approximately in Q and in Q Similar to the historical trends which Verizon has reported as anticipated DSL data connections declined by approximately in Q and in Q FiOS video connections declined by about in Q and Q These metrics are consistent with Verizons total results and what we expected We anticipate providing full year audited results in accordance with our reporting requirements I will review our guidance on slide eight Our current plan is to provide full year guidance for the combined operations in May during our Q earnings call following the closing of the California Texas and Florida acquisition We are not providing complete guidance for the full year particularly given how our business will be changing in about six short weeks However there are a few things for which we can provide some direction For Q we anticipate regulatory revenue to decline by about million reflecting the ongoing CAFII revenue run rate partially offset by other items Regarding cash operating expenses we have already discussed our expectation that the first quarter cash operating expenses will increase sequentially from Q We anticipate the increase to be in the range of million to million This increase primarily reflects the impact of a stepup in payroll taxes which begins to reverse in Q and cost related to head count that supports our thirdparty Internet helpdesk revenue Looking forward the combined Q cash operating expenses will include the benefit of the day one cost synergies which as Dan described will be in excess of million Capital expenditures for Q inclusive of CAFII spending are anticipated to be a slight increase over Q We will provide the full year guidance on CapEx in May A full year guidance item that we are providing at this time is with respect to cash and income taxes We estimate the full year cash taxes in a range of million to million This includes the impact of California Texas and Florida acquisition reflects the incremental interest expense for the year the substantial benefits from the asset basis stepup that is part of the Verizon transaction and the benefit of bonus depreciation extension Further given the funded position of our pension plan we estimate cash pension contributions for in the million to million range inclusive of the California Texas and Florida acquisition As a reminder the pension liabilities for the transferring employees will be fully funded by Verizon as part of this transaction We estimate interest expense of slightly more than billion This includes the cost of the term loan A that will be drawn at quarter end to fund the closing of the California Texas and Florida acquisition as well as interest related to the debt that we will be assuming from Verizon at the closing Only about of our debt will be floating rate debt following the closing of this transaction so we continue to have an immaterial exposure to changes in interest rates In summary Frontiers Q operating results our preparations for the California Texas and Florida acquisition our prudent capital investments and expense management all provide a strong cash flow base and a solid financial platform for supporting and investing in our business We have ample capital to invest in and enhance our competitive infrastructure service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend and maintain the dividend payout ratio superior to others in the telecom sector Thank you And well pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions Well go first to Batya Levi with UBS Great Thank you A couple of questions First thanks for the color on Verizons Q numbers I have to ask about EBITDA Should we think about EBITDA in line with the revenue reduction that we saw on a sequential basis from Q to Q Is that in that ballpark And just color for first quarter for Frontier You mentioned that CAF will be lower about million Can you give a little bit of color on the core customer side Do you still continue to expect pressure on the voice to be largely offset by customers coming off promo and data stability And I have one more question afterwards John M Jureller Chief Financial Officer Executive Vice President Let me first start Batya on the Verizon EBITDA Were not calling out specifically the Verizon EBITDA But weve seen their direct expenses remain pretty much in line with what they have been historically And recall that a good portion of their expense base which is allocated cost just goes away entirely on the closing of the transaction and is replaced by our cost structure So we feel very comfortable that the direct expenses are pretty much in line with what we anticipated But yet as Dan called out were now in excess of million in terms of cost reduction or synergy benefits on day one Daniel J McCarthy President Chief Executive Officer Director And then just Batya on the color on Q Were experiencing similar trends to what we saw in Q We do anticipate that the promo migrations that will occur across the quarter will provide some additional support especially in Connecticut And the one thing to add probably is a little bit of a headwind in the quarter is that were right in the middle of the training and rolling out new functionality for the integration So its consuming a lot of time in our contact centers So I think youll probably see our results on units strong but perhaps not as strong as Q Okay Got it One followup on the synergy The day one million suggest that the overall synergies could be higher as well or are you just seeing more allocated expense on the Verizon side John M Jureller Chief Financial Officer Executive Vice President Yeah At this point Batya were seeing more allocated expense and we were as Ive said were trying to pull as much of the million of synergy in as quickly as possible Were also finetuning our cost structure and well be able to give better guidance on the total day one as well as any increase in synergy possibilities on the Q call Well go next to Dave Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch David William Barden Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hey guys Thanks for taking my questions I guess first question would be just with respect to the I think some turbulence around the early integration exercise with Frontier in Connecticut Could you compare and contrast what we should be expecting with respect to the kind of April flash cut of the Verizon properties to Frontier and get us comfortable that that this is going to go well And I guess the second part is kind of looking past to that presumably with the incremental cash flow generation youll have in front of you there seems to be an awful lot of opportunities in the capital structure looking at some of the early maturity bonds in the s or some of the highly discounted bonds looking further out even some of your convertible preferreds Is it your intention after the deal to kind of start going after the capital structure and taking advantage of some of those discounts in the market with your incremental free cash flow Thanks Daniel J McCarthy President Chief Executive Officer Director David Ill take the first and then John will probably take the second part Let me contrast the two conversions to give you and others a lot more comfort I think on the Verizon transaction On Connecticut one of the key issues was that we actually changed some of our pricing structures and gotomarket plans to be more Frontierlike in Connecticut on day one In this instance weve gone just the opposite Weve adopted the Verizon bundles products including all of the bundles that are introduced as of yesterday into the product family So there really is no chance that therell be a sudden migration of customers to a different bundle structure which had the significant ARPC impact On the operational side weve taken great pains and steps to stage the cutover so that we dont have as much happening that first night In fact the Verizon video cutover will take place over a number of days so that we minimize the potential impact and we can back out of any step at any point So that was probably the biggest single issue that happened on the Connecticut integration that ultimately led to some of the problems day one and in the first month or so So combining those two and I could go through a number of different other additional impacts but those are the two biggest sale impacts that will be very very different between the Verizon transaction and Connecticut And as we execute on the Verizon I think youll see a very smooth transition and no impact like we saw in Connecticut John M Jureller Chief Financial Officer Executive Vice President Dave with respect to the second question that you had in terms of how do we look at the debt capital structure I think implicit in that I just want to reinforce is our notion that we want to reduce our leverage over time and how we do that where in the capital structure that we attack that I think well look at it at that particular point in time I think youre right to point out that a lot of our bonds are trading at discounts There could be some interesting opportunities but well refine our strategies as we get to that point in time But again I just want to reinforce that our intent is to reduce our leverage Great Thanks for taking my questions Can you guys talk a little bit about the residential ARPC a lot of puts and takes you mentioned with the voice bundling downwards but then youve got the Connecticut promotion sort of anniversarying Does that imply maybe not in this first quarter but second quarter and the balance of the year that we could see yearoveryear increases And as it relates to residential ARPC I know its a very small portion of your base but youll be taking on some more FiOS customers and I assume youre taking the custom TV packages And just trying to get a sense of the climate in this TV world Do you anticipate or see any meaningful adoption of the cord shaving or these custom TV packages Thanks John M Jureller Chief Financial Officer Executive Vice President Hey Greg Let me take the first part of your question with respect to residential ARPC What we saw in the beginning of late Q and Q was the usual trends in our business We have a product that for example on the voice side that we call our Stay Connected product which allows snowbirds for example those in the north that may vacation or go to their winter homes in the south to maintain their service but at a substantially reduced rate that we keep their port open for broadband So we maintain them as customers but at a lower ARPC for those periods of time We see that and that happens every season so late Q call it right through mid Q And what well see is that ARPC returning in the late Q to early Q timeframe So thats a seasonal thing that we see for us and I think some customers too have put themselves into different bundles just given how theyre using their landline versus their mobile service So its not a loss of customers as compared to our expectations It was more of a pricing migration which is in many ways seasonal in nature We expect that to return back As you rightly pointed out we saw some increase in ARPC from the video migrations pricing migration that Dan outlined Recall that we had brought existing customers in at new customer acquisition pricing beginning late last year and that was only for a oneyear period They are now coming off that pricing and a greater cohort comes off that pricing in Q and then finally in Q So we will see lift for example on the video side or on our double and triple play customers in Connecticut with respect to that migration So we see some good opportunity in residential ARPC as we transition throughout the course of this year Daniel J McCarthy President Chief Executive Officer Director And as we look at the FiOS space that were acquiring they have been selling their skinny bundles And there is a small segment of the base that were inheriting that has that It appears to us that the individuals that were taking those scaleddown bundles are really a segment whether you call them cord shavers or just people that are looking for a unique product thats a minority in the market In fact our research indicates that the propensity for customers to take the full bundle is much higher in these markets even than the national average So as we look at it we will have the bundles that are available for the cord shavers It will not be our focus initially as we enter the markets and begin operating the business Well support all the customers that are on it today And then as we gain more intimacy in the market I think youll see us target different segments with those bundles where it makes sense but still offer pretty attractive featurerich linear video bundle Hey Good morning guys Good quarter and thanks for taking my questions I guess first off I want to back up and talk about the video product that youre extending Can you give us a little bit more color on how many additional markets in the pace that you expect for and then maybe a little bit about the margin profile of those video customers in new markets And then just my second question revolves around the Verizon transaction Great to hear that were going to get an update on the guidance in cost synergies when you report Im just wondering when you actually closed the acquisition do you plan on reporting some of those subscriber numbers and households passed on that day Thanks Daniel J McCarthy President Chief Executive Officer Director Sure Barry Ill take the video question to start We see the opportunity to add about markets on our existing base As I had mentioned we opened up Durham and were in the process of opening up two additional markets right now Weve scaled back the initiative because really the focus for everyone in the organization whether youre in the engineering department the IT department the technology department is really about the integration over the next days or so So once we get through that youll see us start to ramp but it probably wont be till the back half of the year But you will see that well have probably three markets open for sale by that point and then well start accelerating We feel very good about the margin profile We would not sell obviously a standalone video product So its really designed to be bundled product But it gives us the ability to be a disruptive force in the different markets and to really change the conversation with customers and to offer them a unique product and service that integrates a great linear video experience but also social media and overthetop that might come with different partnerships with providers John M Jureller Chief Financial Officer Executive Vice President Barry with respect to the subscriber metrics the Verizon subscriber metrics I dont think we will have those on the closing date We will get those from Verizon shortly thereafter and I think what well certainly do is with our Q earnings well reaffirm what those metrics are if not beforehand Brett Joseph Feldman <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs Co Thanks Just a few quick questions here You made a note that youre not experiencing meaningful uptick in churn in Connecticut as the promos roll off although you also noted that across your base voice is still under a little bit of pressure Im curious if youre finding that those Connecticut customers when their prices rerate higher sort of create their own savings by switching away from voice And then just as a followup on the tax guidance to what extent is that low number a result of the extension of bonus depreciation And I know its a little hard to look multiple years out but should we expect cash taxes to remain substantially low like that into or will there be a little bit of reset higher next year Thanks Daniel J McCarthy President Chief Executive Officer Director Brett I think on the Connecticut customers we really went through really two months of the transition at the end of During that time period we didnt see a significant transition away from the voice product as part of the upsell In fact if you compare our pricing strategy to what the former owners were actually providing we think a very compelling value for our customer for the two or threeyear price lock that theyve contracted with us So we havent seen that yet It doesnt mean it wouldnt happen Its a fairly sophisticated base But our VoIP platform is well integrated into the video experience and provides a unified messaging platform as well So a lot of customers take advantage of that John M Jureller Chief Financial Officer Executive Vice President Yeah And let me just add Brett too with respect to churn and we really look at churn across all our base our residential churn in the fourth quarter was the best of all of our quarters in So we continue to make improvements in customer retention Regarding your question on tax our tax guidance really benefits from a couple of different things but two substantial things One was certainly the extension of bonus depreciation But almost even more so was the asset basis stepup that we negotiated as part of this transaction Now both the benefit of that basis stepup as well as bonus depreciation certainly continue on to We are not providing guidance at this point in time but its fair to say that we will see a good benefit in just as we looked at for Simon Flannery Morgan Stanley Co LLC Great Thank you very much Can you talk a little bit you talked about synergy estimates But as we think about integration costs after March how are you thinking about the quantum there in terms of getting this deal put to bed and how that fades out over time Any more color around that would be great And then you talked about having launched video in Durham Perhaps you could just give us a few of those early learnings and in terms of take rates and what customers have liked what it has done to churn if youve got anything you can share at this point Thanks Daniel J McCarthy President Chief Executive Officer Director Sure Simon So first off on the cost integration we had a heavy lift in the fourth quarter associated with capital specifically around standing up a super core network around the country as well as expanding our capability for TV Everywhere and videoondemand which are new platforms that well be able to leverage across all of our video base So I think youll see Q less heavy from a CapEx perspective more about OpEx We do anticipate therell be some costs postclose but were expecting to get those out of the business fairly quickly So I wouldnt expect to see a longterm impact from the integration costs And then as far as Durham goes some of the initial learnings are that we were locked out in many cases of securing longterm contracts with some of the apartments and condominium owners in the market because we didnt have a video product other than a mini headend that was using satellite which was not the preferred solution So in the first several weeks of introducing the product weve already secured new contracts that would be substantial units right out of the gate Our doortodoor sales process has been very successful so far But were in the early days Its only been really about a month or so So Ill be able to give you more color on our success and learnings as we get into the Q call Well go next to Frank Louthan with Raymond James Frank G Louthan Raymond James Associates Inc Great Thank you When you closed the ATT deal there were some revenue line items I think some deferred revenue from some installations and the way that you book bad debt versus the way ATT did that had a little bit of a negative impact on the trends versus what T was reporting in their numbers Is there anything like that we should be aware of on the Verizon property and if so could you quantify that delta John M Jureller Chief Financial Officer Executive Vice President Sure Frank and good morning Thanks for the question The adjusted EBITDA or the adjusted revenue numbers for example or the pro forma revenue numbers that you saw in our Q and Q filings for the Verizon properties that pro forma adjusted how Verizon records their uncollectible reserve as compared to how we did We treat it as a contrarevenue item Verizon treats it as an expense item So in the pro formas that we filed as part of our capital raise youd see that The numbers that at a high level that I quoted you also include that adjustment So we adjust out certainly any revenue that doesnt transfer over but where we place our uncollectible reserve which is against revenue as compared to expense So we try to be consistent in that perspective Frank G Louthan Raymond James Associates Inc Okay So the reported numbers that you put in the filings are exactly the way that youre going to report them once you own those properties John M Jureller Chief Financial Officer Executive Vice President Yes Look at where it has the adjusted pro forma numbers so that pro forma column does just that Frank G Louthan Raymond James Associates Inc Got it Okay And as you deploy the video in the other states can you give us an idea of the number of business locations that you may be able to pass as well and what sort of potential upside is for other commercial applications for deploying higher bandwidth in the network Daniel J McCarthy President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah I think thats a great point Frank We will be and we had plans already to upgrade the infrastructure as far as taking speeds up in those markets So I think the commercial and the highend certainly benefits from that having more lengths and rings around the different markets I do think that there is a significant opportunity on the small business side that is more around the traditional waiting rooms hospitality that we would go after Weve seen good success on that in Connecticut with this video product and well be enhancing it and developing specialized applications and products for those verticals So I think its good but weve been talking about it principally on the residential side but I think thats a knockon effect on the commercial James G Moorman DA Davidson Co Thanks Just first a clarification on one of the things you said earlier In terms of the new video markets you talked about over the top So I guess you see it more as an opportunity longer term and initially you see a lot of demand and not people kind of looking more for an overthetop and are looking for a traditional video And then also if you could just talk on the CAFII markets that youre rolling out I mean how long can we look before we might start seeing an impact Is it a year or two out before you start seeing maybe some revenue impact from those markets Thanks Daniel J McCarthy President Chief Executive Officer Director I think on the video side what weve done for market research indicates that the markets that were going to expand to have aboveaverage national propensity to take the larger bundles However there is a segment and several subsegments that would be looking for the smaller bundles as well as an overthetop solution But our focus right now is on the larger bundles well also have And since its a greenfield opportunity for us there really is no potential impact on migration or potential revenue downside to offering these scaled bundles So well have the full meal deal as we go into each market And then well look at whether or not we want to put together a specialized application for someone who may just want local channels and sports with an extra emphasis on overthetop going forward John M Jureller Chief Financial Officer Executive Vice President Jim on the CAF II revenue realization I think well begin to see that later this year as we ramp up Were spending a lot of time making sure that our backbone is set for what we need But the actual customer revenue I think will be more of a function of later on this year Daniel J McCarthy President Chief Executive Officer Director Philip A Cusick JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey guys Thanks Sorry I wonder if you could go through your speeds by sort of tier of customers Whos going to get this megs how widely spread will that be And then at what speed will you be able to sell the video product into Whats the sort of minimum home speed that you could sell that Thanks Daniel J McCarthy President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah The meg is something that were working with the various equipment manufacturers to do upgrades on Its over a bonded and a subvectored product set that is very applicable in Connecticut as well as where weve put in nextgeneration dplans which over the last five to six years is really what weve deployed virtually everywhere as weve done our expansion So each one of them takes different steps to move in that direction I think youll see us leading and testing more in Connecticut but then quickly following it in the different markets and itll become the standard that we offer as we go into the copper markets in the California Texas and Florida opportunities John M Jureller Chief Financial Officer Executive Vice President And just in terms of the speed here into which we can sell video I think as Dan pointed out I think thats probably around megs And Dan why dont you sort of pick that up Daniel J McCarthy President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah Well its to megs We can vary the bandwidth available for a data product based on the HDTVs So we dont have to lock the number of streams down as much as some other providers of the service do So were very flexible We think a good video product would be about a meg video product But well have the opportunity depending upon loop lengths and applications to take it up to similar to what were doing in Connecticut which is four HD streams with plus meg of capability So itll just vary depending upon what the loop lengths are But the minimum would be that to Philip John M Jureller Chief Financial Officer Executive Vice President Phil just to add too we finished the fourth quarter with greater than meg capability in over of our footprint as well Daniel J McCarthy President Chief Executive Officer Director Okay Thank you operator In closing we had very solid results this quarter and we have made tremendous progress in planning for the acquisition of California Texas and Florida markets As you saw even with the pending acquisition we arent standing still in our existing markets as we have had aggressive plans to expand through the introduction of video services The
