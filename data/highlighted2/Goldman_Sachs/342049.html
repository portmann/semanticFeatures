class='textDiv'>Yahoo Is A Buy As It Progresses Toward Becoming A Holding Company Yahoo Inc NASDAQYHOO Seeking Alpha Yahoo sells additional assets in parallel to the core business bidding Activist hedge fund Starboard receives a number of seats on the companys board After a long period of uncertainty Yahoos NASDAQ YHOO future is becoming clearer as the company progresses in its efforts to offload unprofitable or noncore activities toward a lean enterprise structure In the last year since Yahoo attempted to spin off its Alibaba NYSE BABA stake into a newly publicly listed company a nontrivial question occupied the minds of the companys stakeholders and investors what is Yahoos core business At first glance this question has a very simple answer Yahoos core business is its internet services business However when asking different stakeholders in Yahoo one sees that the answer is not very decisive For years Yahoo has been trying to turn the company around by investing further in its content and advertising businesses in a belief that strengthening the companys traditional core will improve its financial status and drive future growth To execute its turnaround plan Yahoo acquired a number of companies restructured its content channels introduced new initiatives and cancelled other initiatives However as shown in the chart below Yahoos revenues in the last five years grew by only each quarter which is an extremely low pace for a company striving to lead the internet sector While Yahoos management tried to turn the company around through strengthening its internet services business the companys stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan OTCPKYAHOY attracted most of the interest from investors In a widespread sumofparts analysis the total value of Yahoos holdings and cash exceeds the current value of the company which means that according to this analysis Yahoos internet business is a huge burden on the company that destroys the companys value Combining the disappointing revenue growth and the core business burden can explain why investors like Starboard Value find that Yahoo will spin off its internet business and remain in a narrow and lean holding firm structure After Yahoos plans to split the Alibaba stake in a taxfree spinoff had been cooled down by the IRS the company pursued a different path and adopted investors points of view to dismantle Yahoo as we know it The first stage of breaking down Yahoo takes place these days when the number of companies participate in a bidding war over Yahoos core business Media companies such as Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA Verizon NYSE V and ATT NYSE T as well as PE firms such as Bain Capital TPG and KKR are all interested in acquiring Yahoos Internet business and each interested entity has its reasons This move to offload a companys core business might seem weird at first However with no other option to revive the company under the current management and business model it requires a fundamental change Offloading the core business and injecting a significant amount of cash into the company fits investors preferences and its the first step toward becoming a holding company Last week Yahoos CFO Ken <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>told the crowd at Morgan Stanleys Technology Media and Telecom Conference that Yahoo is looking to sell between B and B in patents property and other noncore assets This is a continuation of the patent selling process Yahoo started three years ago which has already yielded more than M for the company Offloading additional assets before the core business sale is finalized could maximize shareholders value from the companys assets and bring it one step closer toward the end goal of a narrow and lean holding company While Yahoos sumofparts valuation reflects a share price between and well above the current price Yahoos current efforts to sell more noncore assets in the core business sale help the company to start closing the gap between the market and valuation prices Yahoo is currently trading solely based on the fundamental change the company is going through When the company and investors are committed to monetizing on the companys assets for the benefit of its shareholders this is a strong indication to buy the stock As I mentioned above Yahoo is currently trading well below its sumofparts valuation which reflects a deep discount due to the high execution risk investors apply to Yahoos chances to complete the core business transaction The high spinoff execution risk is well established based on the companys previous experience with the Aabaco spinoff and amount of time it took Yahoo to execute other strategic moves in the past However these days activist hedge fund Starboard Value is negotiating with the company on how many seats the fund will receive on Yahoos board As Starboard is one of the most vocal supporters of the core business sale having a number of seats on the companys board reduces the execution risk of the spinoff tremendously With Starboard on its board strong management commitment and full shareholder support there is almost nothing that could prevent Yahoo from
