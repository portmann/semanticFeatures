class='textDiv'>With Days To Earnings Should You Bet On Facebook Chat Bots Facebook NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Few companies have the technical skills and budgets to develop a chat bot First experiences with the chat bots are not very promising Since Facebooks NASDAQ FB F developer conference the companys new chat bots have been stealing headlines The new feature will allow any institution to offer services through messenger including alerts searches support and booking services The catch You better have some serious programming knowledge or development budgets The complexity of developing a good chat bot increases quickly which will create substantial growth and monetization issues for Facebook a fact largely ignored by most analysts As a company that specializes in designing natural language processing NLP algorithms we understand the complexity and development efforts that go into such endeavors The market largely underestimates the difficulty of Facebook building such an NLP bot which creates a serious entry barrier for any smaller player interested in capitalizing on this new feature In Facebook experienced a rather large failure in bringing ecommerce into the platform yes Facebook stores actually exist Analysts reasoned that since users are spending time on Facebook with friends and are not interested in shopping on the site the two models have little synergy However most marketing experts argue that this notion is false They believe that companies who already reach their client on Facebook would much rather send the traffic directly to their website where their conversion is much stronger rather than to their Facebook storepagechat The current notion that Facebook will be able to monetize eshops via chat bots doesnt bode well with past experience To simplify an app developer is more than happy to take his or her product say a game and sell it to as many people as possible on a rd party distribution platform The variable costs are generally little to none and thus the developer is willing to pay the Apple App store or Android Play store a hefty commission for hosting processing sales and managing integration into users phones Unlike the App developer who has no variable cost or distribution platform current sellers on Facebook likely have very tight margins and optimized web platforms thus adding another agent to their sales chain are fundamentally against their interests Niche sellers and small businesses are perhaps best positioned to take full advantage of Facebooks bot service For example a user asking a small comics store do you currently have comics name in stock In this case Facebook offers the comics store a strong secondary platform to communicate with established customers Unfortunately For small businesses building and maintaining a chat bot let alone a checkout process is an extremely complex process Unless Facebook offers the complete solution not an API their chance of attracting people are little to none CNN or Flowers NASDAQ FLWS which already has a very strong online presence dont have a strong reason to increase their Facebook social presence I wanted to amplify this by demonstrating just how complex it would be to take a classical checkoutform and convert it to a bot managed one How long would a company like Flowers keep spilling resources into chat bots They are not a tech firm and it shows which is this applications biggest obstacle Below you can see an attempt to order from Flowers via Facebook It was chosen because it was one of the original companies to go live with the feature and as you can see the attempt didnt get too far The first question is your address rather than a humanized Hello Daniel thank you for choosing typical botlike thinking I liked however that my address input returned a clear confirmation Next is the flower selection where you better hope you fall in love with the first bouquet you see or else good luck squinting through hundreds of tiny images If you survived this get ready for the onslaught of questions with no reference to where you are what question comes next or how close you are to finishing your checkout At this point I decided to stop as the lack of added value given here by Facebook to was clear As you can see the only input offered here by the service to the retailer was my name In order to make it attractive and profitable for firms to use chatbots and pay the commission fees Facebook will have to streamline the checkout process for vendors in a similar manner the app stores do for Apple and Android retailers While it still does not solve Flowers problem of browsing the product FB having the users address phone email and credit card on file would allow any vendor to create a simple oneclick checkout process User Do you have the Avengers comic book in stock Bot Yes here it is below with image below Would you like to use Facebook one click checkout to order it Here one can sense the added value of Facebook The comic book purchaser might be willing to sacrifice his brick and mortar buying experience for the time saved and conveniencesecurity of the Facebook purchase On the other hand at this time the flower purchaser receives absolutely no added value by purchasing through Facebook messenger and might as well go directly to Flowers and fill out the forms in a more userinterface friendly manner But bots can do a lot more than sell you stuff What about noncheckout bots Well from what we hear they are seriously lacking in personality The one attempt at achieving a nonrobotic conversation was by Poncho the weather bot However just hours after launch Ponchos CEO Sam Mandel already admits that there are unanticipated problems He noted that Facebook needs to add more natural language processing and thats what were working on right now Further he notes that tolerance for a mediocre bot is much less than for a mediocre app Below is a short conversation with Poncho and you can see it might be funny for a bit but thats about it With all the chatter about Facebook bots is it a good time to invest The company is scheduled to report its Q results on April and the anticipation has many analysts speculating on the companys success Shares of the social media giant already declined about during the first week of April The company is currently facing some problems which undoubtedly plays a role in certain bearish outlooks for the stock Some negative indicators include delayed shipping of Oculus Rift VR a report claiming Facebook users are sharing less on the platform a report showing that Facebook publishers had recorded traffic declines of a whopping from January through March and finally a warning by Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Sandler who claims Facebooks Q revenue is probably going to come in far below the high set expectations In light of this recent dip in market price and less than positive news sidelined investors may be curious to know if this provides an opportunity for longterm buyers The most bearish outlook for the stock from an analyst is held by Societe Generale analyst Simon Baker who has a Sell rating on Facebook with an alarming price target of the stock is currently trading at According to Baker the stock faced serious risk from new applications competing for user time He further explained We reiterate our Sell rating on Facebook and preference for Alphabet in this space UBS analyst Eric Sheridan has also given some input on this issue On April the analyst reiterated a Buy rating for the stock with a price target of He states Given the scale of Messenger mm MAUs key advantages vs other forms of customer servicecommunication instantaneous personal scalable etc we believe Messenger can play a disruptive role in the worlds of eCommerce local commerce in particular effectively serving as an app store for BC interaction Youssef Squali from Cantor Fitzgerald has also reiterated a Buy rating on Facebook with a price target on April In spite of this rating Squali has expressed some concern regarding Messenger He commented on the app explaining If successful Messenger has the potential of becoming a material third leg of the monetization stool for Facebook a potential not reflected in our estimates currently He adds however concern that lines may get blurry between Facebook and Messenger and there may very well be some cannibalization between the two platforms since both are competing for our time It seems as though even analysts offering bullish outlooks on the stock have some prevailing concerns regarding the ultimate longterm success of the company Another example is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs analyst Heather Bellini who maintained a Buy rating for Facebook with a price target of on April Bellini notes however that although revenue is expected to beat consensus the company will most likely be witnessing a year on year decline in its next earnings report Analysts will rarely dare speak negatively about the big tech players however between the lines and amongst bloggers we can detect a reasonable doubt in Facebook being able to justify its PE ratio Hedge fund activity suggests larger stock selling than buying volume and insiders have not made any significant purchases of the company in over a year As of today based on ranked analysts offering month price targets for FB in the last months the average price target is with a high estimate of and a low estimate of Hedge funds decreased holdings by M shares in the last quarter and corporate insiders sold shares worth M in the last months We also identified opinions published by experienced bloggers of which were bullish to a mere bearish Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
