class='textDiv'>Tough Day For Tech Stocks Tough Year For The Rest Of The Market Seeking Alpha Coming into this corporate earnings season everyone seemed to expect disappointment But they thought it would come from the energy sector and the banks that had lent that sector way too much money see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs NYSE GS is a flattened slug Technology was as always thought to be immune to the vagaries of the Old Economy But apparently whats bad for Exxon NYSE XOM and Caterpillar NYSE CAT is also bad for Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Heres what Big Tech is doing this morning Why the sudden carnage Various reasons including a strong dollar Microsoft which makes US software more expensive for foreign buyers the decision by several big players to ramp up growth in hot divisions at the cost of lower profits Google and as usual Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and rising competition in niches like videoondemand Netflixs NASDAQ NFLX share price is down in the past year But the strong dollar is by far the most common complaint Take Microsofts surprisingly weak Q report Ars Technica Microsoft posted revenue of billion in the third quarter of its financial year down percent from the same quarter a year ago Operating income was billion a percent drop net income was billion down percent and earnings per share were a percent decline Over the past few quarters Microsoft and other tech companies have reported significant impact from the high value of the US dollar and have offered equivalent financial figures that show what their numbers would have been had the value of foreign earnings not been eroded by this conversion This currency impact was estimated as reducing revenue by about billion The company also reports that there was a billion impact from a combination of revenue deferrals due to Windows upgrades and restructuring charges Excluding this impact and assuming constant currency values the company says that its revenue was billion up percent operating income was billion up percent and net income was billion up percent Now the question becomes if Google and Microsoft are underperforming whats left to push US equities higher The chart below illustrates the dilemma facing the SP Repeated stabs at the level have failed with the latest beginning to roll over this week The implication The next leg up if its going to happen needs a catalyst of some sort First given the inverse relationship between interest rates and the value of corporate stock dividends youd expect falling interest rates to result in higher stock prices But a consensus seems to be forming that monetary policy in general and zerotonegative interest rates in particular have stopped working Heres an excerpt from Mervyn King Joins Central Banks Seeing Limits of Monetary Policy Bloomberg Former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King added to calls by central bankers to recognize that monetary policy is close to its limit saying the world faces a major disequilibrium Central banks need to argue much more forcefully than they are doing that the answer is not monetary policy King said in an interview Wednesday on Bloomberg Televisions The Pulse with Francine Lacqua While policy makers have bought time they can do little more he said noting that the introduction of negative interest rates by some central banks demonstrates they are facing diminishing returns Kings comments come amid increased questioning of monetary policys effectiveness even within the central banking world Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens said on Tuesday that maybe we need to be clearer about what we cant do and Stephen Poloz who heads the Bank of Canada said policy might be close to its maximum ability Mark Carney Kings successor at the BOE told lawmakers in London Tuesday that officials have room to cut the UKs benchmark rate still further Policy makers last reduced it to a recordlow percent under Kings tenure in Lets assume that this is true and that falling interest rates arent going to ride to stocks rescue any time soon To push the SP beyond its current record level then a major buyer or group of buyers will have to analyze US equities accept that interest rates arent going to fall further and decide nevertheless to go long the market Two logical candidates are foreign investors and US corporations The first according to recent reports is not looking good while the second is a maybe MarketWatch Last year Chinese investors dumped nearly all the stocks that they had acquired over a span of seven years and are likely to remain cautious this year amid ongoing financial market volatility at home But aggressive stock buybacks by US companies flush with cash will likely offset the sting of waning Chinese appetite according to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs China accounted for billion in sales of US stocks in wiping out almost all of the billion purchased between and said David Kostin chief US strategist at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs in a recent report That is more than half of the billion in US equities sold by foreigners last year with much of the Chinese exodus occurring in the fourth quarter Investors in China also sold billion of US debt securities in suggesting an overall reduction in US investment from China rather than a rotation from US equities to bonds he said The steady decline in oil prices accelerated US stock sales with outflows from Canada and the Middle East hitting their highest levels since Canadians sold billion in US stocks contrasting with billion in purchases in Investors from the Middle East sold billion worth last year nearly doubling the billion in sales in Despite a low positive correlation between oil prices and flows from the Middle East the drop in oil prices appears to have magnified US equity outflows from both the Middle East and Canada said Kostin <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>estimates that international investors will divest a total of billion worth of equities this year the second year in a row that foreigners are net sellers Still corporate buybacks are expected to more than make up for dwindling foreign interest with US companies projected to repurchase billion in shares this year That is below s billion but above the average of billion buybacks between and With the US economy expected to grow at a modest pace and cash balances at high levels firms are likely to continue to pursue buybacks as a means of generating shareholder value said the strategist JPMorgan Chase NYSE JPM Rockwell Automation NYSE ROK and Bank of America NYSE BAC have all announced sizable stock repurchase plans in the past couple of months with more companies likely to follow suit Among the most scrutinized will be Apple NASDAQ AAPL which could release its capital allocation plan as early as Monday when it reports fiscal secondquarter earnings amid expectations that the company may boost its buyback program by billion to billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs expects the SP s earnings per share to rise to in from in We can of course dismiss Goldmans EPS projection out of hand Corporate operating earnings are more likely to fall by than rise by any amount in based on Q results see below So for earnings per share to rise by it would require financial engineering on a supernatural scale And what about all the cash corporations are supposedly sitting on It turns out that most of it came from borrowing which means its not really cash at all but simply the asset side of an assetliability entry that nets to zero Assuming theres a limit to how much companies can borrow before new debt spooks investors and becomes a net negative then that point is if not near at least closer than ever before Add it all up a strong dollar that hampers exports alreadyhigh US equity valuations foreign investors souring on US financial assets corporate debt at five times the level and catalysts for another upleg are scarce But catalysts for the next crash are many </div></body></html>
