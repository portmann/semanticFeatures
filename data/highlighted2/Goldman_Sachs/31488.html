"Search is curiosity, and that will never be done."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Assuming Yahoo is able to broaden its reach via search deals like the one with Mozilla, while it overhauls its search algorithm for better queries, Yahoo can gain back some users to its search platform. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore, the development of a disruptive search technology could drive significant growth in MAUs, which will trickle down to both CPMs and net-revenue after taking out traffic acquisition costs. (Uncertainty) </span>Admittedly, Yahoo doesn't just have a market share problem.Users have visited a search engine less frequently, which indicates that engagement is trending downward.This reduces the number of impressions that will be available for monetization, even if it were to gain back market share.What this also indicates is that Yahoo needs to develop a way to re-create some of that initial excitement Internet users had, when they first came across search technologies.Google is already working on this by developing search partnerships in which it can create deep links into mobile applications like Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This should build-out the amount of available content for search in general, which may translate into more engagement.
