I summarized those notes, here .)These four companies do not pay a hefty a dividend by any means, with Disney paying the highest yield of 1.3%, and Visa and MasterCard yielding less than 1%.On the plus side, the lowest dividend increase over the past five years between all four companies is still 14.6%, which is very good, with many increases of 30% or more.But the dividend is not the focus, at least not yet.We're looking for companies with solid fundamentals, strong earnings and sales growth, and businesses situated in long-term growth stories.Each of these companies have grown earnings per share at a CAGR of more than 19% over the past five years, and are expected to grow earnings double digit percentages through 2018, (excluding Disney's EPS growth estimates of 8.8% in 2018).That's pretty darn impressive.Some investors will argue about these stocks' valuation, but my argument would be that buying high quality companies with superior management and long-term growth trends rarely, if ever, come at a discount.At best, investors get selloffs like we've just seen as their best chance to buy.I can't tell you how many years I've been hearing that Visa or Starbucks is a great company, but the valuation is too high.All the while the share price continues to climb, climb, climb.When these stocks eventually do trade down to a low valuation, it will be because the growth story has faded, the market is tanking or they have finally matured into a mega company with sizable and respectable dividend payouts.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That last point will hopefully happen, but not for some time.

(Uncertainty) </span>In the future I will look to write more detailed articles on these stocks.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I simply wanted show normal, everyday folks that it's possible to clean up in the stock market without being a hedge fund junkie or playing fly-by-night stocks, and these are my picks to get it done.
