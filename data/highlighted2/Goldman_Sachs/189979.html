off many times over especially with dividends Look for high quality stocks with sustainable growth and attractive business models My top picks are Visa MasterCard Disney and Starbucks What exactly is a Future Blue Chip stock Simply put these are stocks that I think can turn into tomorrows top dependable companies or blue chip companies as theyre commonly referred to in the industry Lets go back to Had you bought WalMart WMT CocaCola KO and McDonalds MCD you would be a pretty happy camper I simply chose these three at random Im sure there are better performers since but for simplicity lets go with these Over those years WalMart stock is up CocaCola is up and McDonalds is up For its part the SP is up Investing in into each of these three stocks in todays dollars would have vastly outperformed the SP And remember this is only total and it was only in years is a long time certainly but easily within an investors lifetime On a splitadjusted basis these stocks were purchased for pennies In WalMarts case investors who bought share of stock in would have today While shares of McDonalds today might not seem that impressive its pretty insane that buying just shares years ago would have turned into that many shares It also helps when it comes to dividends In this case the annual dividend payments come out to nearly While you cant live on that consider its nearly seven times the size of the initial investment paid out annually and continues to rise In other words your investment in now pays you almost per year while the portfolio itself would be worth north of You may think in annual dividends is not all that impressive because youre not floating around on a yacht or whatever But remember inflationadjusted for today this is only were talking about as the total initial investment Imagine buying worth of stock today and having it be worth in years Want to up the ante Lets say in todays world you had to invest for each of the three stocks above In terms that would have been about per stock The returns are staggering As if investing just in and having million today wasnt enough that investor would be collecting from WalMart from CocaCola and from McDonalds in annual dividend payments By pinpointing these stalwarts before the price gains and mega dividends investors can find modern day versions of some of yesterdays most successful stocks Thats what Im aiming to do with this portfolio of Future Blue Chips which includes Visa V MasterCard MA Starbucks SBUX and Disney DIS Visa and MasterCard are cash machines acting as the middleman between consumers and financial institutions They collect a transaction fee each time one of its branded cards are swiped This is a beautiful secular growth story as the transition from using cash to using debit and credit continues to gain momentum Disney and Starbucks are also great longterm growth stories with Disney continuing to reinvent its portfolio of classic movies think the liveaction Cinderella film from earlier this year as well as expand its collection of Pixar Marvel and Star Wars films The company is opening its Shanghai park next spring further driving future growth in its theme park business Disneys media empire continues to grow and investors can sleep a bit more comfortably at night knowing it has an ace up its sleeve when it comes to the infringing streaming wars For Starbucks part the company has developed an infectious charm among Americans and apparently the Chinese where according to CFO Scott Maw growth remains strong despite recent concerns about the economy Its Mobile Order and Pay solution in the US should continue to drive revenue and compstore sales growth for several years Food is also playing a larger role for Starbucks helping to also drive sales Maw and Disneys COO Tom Staggs both elaborated on China a lot more in recent conferences with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs and Bank of America I summarized those notes here These four companies do not pay a hefty a dividend by any means with Disney paying the highest yield of and Visa and MasterCard yielding less than On the plus side the lowest dividend increase over the past five years between all four companies is still which is very good with many increases of or more But the dividend is not the focus at least not yet Were looking for companies with solid fundamentals strong earnings and sales growth and businesses situated in longterm growth stories Each of these companies have grown earnings per share at a CAGR of more than over the past five years and are expected to grow earnings double digit percentages through excluding Disneys EPS growth estimates of in Thats pretty darn impressive Some investors will argue about these stocks valuation but my argument would be that buying high quality companies with superior management and longterm growth trends rarely if ever come at a discount At best investors get selloffs like weve just seen as their best chance to buy I cant tell you how many years Ive been hearing that Visa or Starbucks is a great company but the valuation is too high All the while the share price continues to climb climb climb When these stocks eventually do trade down to a low valuation it will be because the growth story has faded the market is tanking or they have finally matured into a mega company with sizable and respectable dividend payouts That last point will hopefully happen but not for some time These stocks wont climb in a straight line but Im looking to find tomorrows dividend titans today So far these are the four that have done best for me and are these are the businesses I continue to believe in going forward In the future I will look to write more detailed articles on these stocks I simply wanted show normal everyday folks that its possible to clean up in the stock market without being a hedge fund junkie or playing flybynight stocks and these are my picks to get it done We only use
