Brexit Currently there are certain pillars of support under equities I believe one of those pillars of support is shareholder hope and optimistic speculative interest in the earnings reports of widely held stocks that have exhibited relative strength But as Netflix showed us last evening those same reports could produce negative surprises Nonetheless it appears equities continue to draw bids especially in the previously lagging technology and financial sectors where recent operating performance or expectations have been enthusing In my last report on the market I talked about an ironic pillar of support under US equities emanating from international uncertainty and its direction of beneficial capital flows into US assets In this report I discuss a second pillar of support I believe is under stocks currently and whether Netflixs earnings miss might undermine it Since we suggested investors buy into the fear post Brexit about a month ago stocks are up with the SPDR SP NYSE SPY having appreciated and marking record highs But investors and traders need to know what is next for stocks I expect this season of giving can continue for a bit longer this week before something gets in its way next week stay tuned There are key pillars of support under the current market beyond the capital flow factor I defined over the weekend I believe a second pillar of support exists currently under stocks relative to earnings season and the hopeful expectations of shareholders and speculators The shares of technology and financial sector stocks had been lagging the market during its nascent march higher However as broadly held stocks that have enjoyed good times in the past come due to report their earnings for Q it serves the broader market along with those shares Shareholders of Facebook NASDAQ FB for instance are significantly less likely to divest their shares ahead of the companys upcoming report Speculators in the same issue are well aware of the stocks outperformance last quarter after a stellar report Stories like this will keep current shareholders hopeful and in place while luring speculative capital in for the ride Its the reason Facebook has inched higher over the last couple weeks as it moves back toward its alltime high Even Apple NASDAQ AAPL is drawing capital despite expectations for a relatively poor quarter ahead of the launch of its new iPhone Investors are thinking about what forward looking guidance that company might present at its meeting Meanwhile decent reports from the major banks including JP Morgan Chase NYSE JPM Bank of America NYSE BAC and others has capital coming into those value plays and into stocks like them even despite still dulled Fed expectations not mine mind you However there exists the risk of poor reports as well as Netflix NASDAQ NFLX showed us last evening Netflix shares opened gaplower this morning and were down nearly in early trading The company reported soft subscriber growth versus its own forecasts and analysts expectations and provided lower forward subscriber growth expectations than analysts had forecast Perhaps partly due to the Netflix disappointment and concerns that optimism could be misplaced elsewhere as well the market is expressing some concern today The SPDR SP is off fractionally this morning despite a strong report from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs NYSE GS Netflixs veil of shadows which is a reference to its original program Stranger Things which I watched this weekend and believe fans of The XFiles and The Twilight Zone will thoroughly enjoy looks to not have the ability to kill earnings optimism FB and AAPL shares are continuing higher this morning despite the bad news from NFLX as investors differentiate between stories Let us be clear that this theory of mine is just that a theory and is not supported by historical regression analysis However simplistic I believe the price movement of widely held equities that have had recently strong relative strength into their earnings news is evidence enough for reasonable consideration that it may be offering another pillar of support to the market more broadly now I expect this pillar of support to continue to help stocks higher this week but the key support for stocks now remains the Federal Reserve and what it might do to the cost of capital For
