developed countries behind Since Brexit elites have discussed ways of countering working class voters opposition to globalization We discuss how Facebook can help them do so We also discuss implications for investors in Facebook and other companies of a Clinton or Trump victory in November The Washington Posts Wonkblog featured a striking chart this week screen captured below The Worlds Losers Are Revolting And Brexit Is Only The Beginning That economic losers are likely to vote for change isnt the revelation here others including Chris Arnade Why Trump voters arent complete idiots have made this point before Whats striking about the Wonkblog chart is how it shows this phenomenon globally Matt OBrien elaborated and added historical context on WonkBlog Global capitalism didnt always work so well for workers in the United States and Europe even as or in some cases because it pulled hundreds of millions of people out of poverty everywhere else In fact the working class in rich countries have seen their real or inflationadjusted incomes flatline or even fall since the Berlin Wall came down and they were forced to compete with all the Chinese Indian and Indonesian workers entering the global economy You can see that in the chart above put together from economist Branko Milanovics data This was a political powder keg If richworld workers were losing ground even when times were good what would happen if we got hit by one of the financial crises the new global economy seemed to spawn every few years Well things would get ugly It didnt take long then for the Wests triumphal globalism to fuel a nationalist backlash In the United States its Trump in France its the National Front in Germany its the Alternative for Germany and yes in Britain its the Brexiters Broadly speaking there are two political possibilities in the US and Western Europe more economic nationalism or less democracy For readers who are tempted to dismiss the second possibility out of hand consider the widening split between elites versus the Americans who voted for Trump and the Britons who voted for Brexit Chris Arnade in his post about Trump voters not being complete idiots included an example of elite disdain by Jonathan Chiat of New York Magazine but there has been a flurry of these sorts of sentiments since the Brexit vote James Traubs recent essay in Foreign Policy is illustrative Its Time for the Elites to Rise Up Against The Ignorant Masses Read it if you like but the title gives you the gist those voting against globalization are wrong and its up to elites to counter them How might elites counter the masses Perhaps in part by using the power of Facebook NASDAQ FB Consider that a study in Nature showed the ability of Facebook to increase voter turnout According to that study a single Facebook message sent out by researchers led to an extra users voting in the November elections in the US Consider also that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Germanys Chancellor Merkel that he was working on policing sentiment against her immigration policy expressed on Facebook in Germany Perhaps Prime Minister David Cameron of Great Britain should have had a similar conversation with Mr Zuckerberg given the role of immigration in the Brexit debate Consider further the allegations that Facebook has applied political bias to users newsfeeds and you can see how elites might be able to use it to steer election outcomes It helps of course that Facebooks CEO is on their side Mark Zuckerbergs lobbying group FWD us has been open about its support for globalist policies such as expanded immigration and its been open about its opposition to Donald Trump as the screen capture below in which FWDus concern trolls the GOP illustrates Investing Implications Of Facebooks Side Winning If Facebook succeeds in helping elites keep a lid on the populist powder keg expect more of current economic policies more emphasis on expanding trade and immigration and more emphasis on global integration To get a sense of the sorts of companies in addition to Facebook that might benefit from an extension of the status quo consider the ones whose employees and political action committees have donated the most to the candidate in the US who is more closely aligned with current economic policies Hillary Clinton According to Open Secrets her top contributors include those from Citigroup NYSE C JP Morgan NYSE JPM Morgan Stanley NYSE MS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs NYSE GS Time Warner NYSE TWX Corning NYSE GLW Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and Bank of America NYSE BAC If Donald Trump wins and pursues the policies hes campaigned on perhaps some of the companies that donated to his opponent wont do as well as they might have otherwise but for diversified investors my message remains Dont Fear Donald Trump In that article I elaborated on why investors shouldnt worry about the prospect of more economic nationalism The short version is that America has enacted similar policies in the past and the economy and stock market in the main prospered Facebook should manage as well As I noted there Does that mean Facebook wouldnt be able to navigate under a President Trump No If Candidate Trump becomes President Trump these companies will work within his policies the same way they work within the policies of foreign leaders all over the world Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook may not be fans of Donald Trump but that wont stop them from doing business in President Trumps America any more than their differences with say Prime Minister Najib Razak keep them from doing business in Prime Minister Razaks Malaysia now Since I run a website and an iOS app that help investors hedge its in my interest to point out risks And Ive written about Trumps threats against specific companies before such as Amazon NASDAQ AMZN But the more I think about the prospect of a President Trump the more I think the risk to investors is overstated Maybe you should panic about something else Consider who does want you to panic about a turn toward economic nationalism those who oppose it Hence the ominous warnings about the impact of the Leave side winning the Brexit vote And yet as of Thursdays close the London stock exchange as measured by the FTSE was already up over since before the vote That said if you still concerned about the risk of an economic nationalist winning in November you can review how to limit your market risk Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate
