out its conviction buy saying we are disappointed by Apples quarter and guidance as it reflects a much weaker iPhone s product cycle than we had anticipated with most of the negative surprise vs our expectations coming from China and cutting its month price target on the stock from to We are disappointed by Apples quarter and guidance as it reflects a much weaker iPhone s product cycle than we had anticipated with most of the negative surprise vs our expectations coming from China As such we expect the shares to be weak in the near term until the market gets comfortable around improving trends with the iPhone product cycle That said we do not view the quarter as thesischanging longer term and maintain our Buy rating In particular we are encouraged by Apples new disclosure that its iPhone installed base is up vs years ago coupled with evidence in our US survey of significant pentup demand for the iPhone and the acceleration in reported services growth to yoy with gross services up evidence of increasing monetization of Apples platform We now estimate mn iPhone units in FQ compared to prior GSconsensus at mnmn with about a mn impact from the channel inventory reduction We

well as a mix towards both midtier and entrylevel iPhones ie the and s respectively in the quarter Looking ahead to June while management does not provide explicit segmentlevel guidance it expects seasonal sequential declines in iPhone sales Looking at the trailing threeyear average as a proxy for underlying seasonality that qoq decline would imply mn iPhone units Management also expects iPhone ASPs to decline from March driven by the maturing s cycle coupled with the introduction of the lowerpriced iPhone SE The ASP mix in FQ will also be negatively impacted by the bn planned channel inventory reduction as that primarily impacts the higherpriced iPhone s models We now expect iPhone unit volume of mnmn in CYCY representing yoy growth of respectively Exiting the March quarter iPhone inventory was within the companys targeted fivetoseven week range however citing the macroeconomic environment management intends to reduce companywide channel inventories by bn in the June quarter compared to a mn reduction in CQ The company expects the vast majority of that reduction to occur within the iPhone segment which we believe is driven by disappointing sales of the iPhone s and some cannibalization by the unexpectedly popular iPhone SE which is in short supply Taking our CQ iPhone ASP assumption of and assuming that of the bn reduction is iPhone we calculate a mn hit to iPhone shipments in the June quarter vs an estimated mn drag in the year ago period Netnet we expect a mn unit headwind which equates to a pt revenue growth headwind on a yoy basis from the planned channel inventory reduction in FQ On this quarters earnings call Apple disclosed additional information about the growth of its iPhone installed base as well as the upgrade rate relative to prior cycles CEO Tim Cook said that the active iPhone installed base is up vs two years ago note that Apple includes secondary market devices within its definition In addition the upgrade rate for the iPhone s is slightly higher than the iPhone s but lower than the particularly robust iPhone cycle this suggests that the yoy decline in the replacement rate we are seeing currently may be more due to difficult comps and a pull forward by the iPhone We view these as positive indicators heading into the iPhone cycle this fall as we continue to expect a return to yoy unit growth driven largely by upgrades of the rapidly growing installed base Recall that our survey of over US consumers indicated that of respondents intend to buy the iPhone this fall which we view as a strong indicator of pentup demand

America is Wed Sandmann Apple doesnt sell phones it use mobile operators to lease them Trouble with that is the operator makes real money when the customer extends the lease rather than upgrade and there is not really that much more you can do to a telephone once it has a camera and a fondleslab There is no dynamic pricing from Apple and it you look at phone shops they are awash in Samsung and
