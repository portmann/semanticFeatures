class='textDiv'>The Dow Volatility And The Validity Of A Filter Seeking Alpha Dec AM ET Includes AAPL BA CSCO DD DIA MMM MRK PFE VZ XOM by Rochelle Jenks When the market corrected in late August a review of how the DJIA fared prompted me to establish a filter for my investment club to use when considering volatility The criteria established identified six components for investment consideration Five months of volatility later and with a new year on the horizon it is an opportune time to review results Running the same filter yielded both commonality and difference Regardless it reestablished a starting point for After the August th runaway decline considered by many a correction in the market I looked at the DJIA to determine the most attractive of the thirty for my investment club to consider The criteria for the designation of most attractive was designed to both meet club goals and to ascertain the stocks that seemed to best withstand the volatility of the correction The exercise was not meant to analyze each company or stock but rather was designed to establish a starting point for analysis The factors designed to narrow the field included and are discussed in more detail in the linked article above The day moving average could not be more than off its week high Assuming a correction implies at least a decline the price must have decreased at least The price could not have recovered to within of its week high The price had to bounce or recover at least from August th lows and The criteria eliminated seventeen members of the index The remaining thirteen members were ordered based on potential return Potential return was derived based on the growth left between current pricing and the lower to be conservative of either the week high or analysts average oneyear target and then added to the annual dividend yield Interestingly the club already owned the top four of the sorted remaining thirteen Proctor Gamble NYSE PG Boeing NYSE BA Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Cisco NASDAQ CSCO Buy points on the next six companies were established using a desired gain as a goal The results were After four months of volatility and with a new year on the horizon it seems an appropriate time to review the filter As well one savvy SA follower suggested My guess is if you run this exercise again in a couple of months youll get a entirely different answer What did investments in the six on the August list return Would the six still make the cut Was the criteria used in August effective in determining volatility resistance Which components would comprise the list for potential investments in The next table displays the returns on the six components from the August list as well as the four companies the club already owned It was prudent to consider whether a reinvestment was a better option than a new investment For this exercise the assumption is that each of the six components was purchased with a limit order at its buy point On the four stocks already owned the assumption is the reinvestment occurred at market open August st As shown only two of the ten components had a negative return The DJIA as a whole returned from August st to December th So seven of the ten filtered components delivered returns better than the index average Yet of the top five performers in the index for the time frame only two are on the list above General Electric NYSE GE and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Home Depot NYSE HD Intel NASDAQ INTC and Nike NYSE NKE the remaining three of the five topperforming companies delivered returns over from the August th lows If the same filters are applied to the index based on the closing prices of December th the results do vary Using the criteria that a stocks day moving average can not be more than off its week high eliminates Chevron NYSE CVX IBM NYSE IBM United Technologies NYSE UTX Caterpillar NYSE CAT American Express NYSE AXP and WalMart NYSE WMT The second criteria requiring at least a decrease to warrant a correction originally eliminated American Express and Travelers NYSE TRV Travelers week low occurred on August th Therefore using the correction definition the stock has still not officially corrected from the August st closing price The third filter eliminates stocks within of their week high In this iteration of applying the filters ten stocks are benched JPMorgan Chase NYSE JPM United Healthcare NYSE UNH Visa NYSE V Johnson Johnson NYSE JNJ Nike Microsoft Home Depot Coca Cola NYSE KO General Electric and McDonalds NYSE MCD Applying the fourth filter of requiring the stock to bounce from its low to within at least of its day moving average eliminated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs NYSE GS The fifth criteria a dividend yield greater than the average for the index eliminates only Disney NYSE DIS from the remainder There are eleven components now making the cut Apple Merck NYSE MRK Exxon Mobile NYSE XOM EI Du Pont NYSE DD Proctor Gamble M NYSE MMM Cisco Pfizer NYSE PFE Boeing Verizon NYSE VZ and Intel Compared to the original cut six of the eleven appear on both lists Finally only three of the eleven offer a potential return of using analysts average oneyear target Apple Pfizer and Merck Once again Cisco misses the cut by less than Boeing also missed the cut by less than Yet the original purpose in late August was to create a list containing or six of the DJIA with the most potential based strictly on criteria and numbers The six companies were then to be the focus of analysis for the coming months by my investment club Similarly after months of volatility the purpose now is to determine how much the list has changed Because the club already owns three of the top five Apple Cisco and Boeing the next three in the sort will now make the cut Therefore the left after the elimination criteria is applied include Pfizer Merck Verizon DuPont Exxon Mobil and M The day moving averages of the six are not more than away from each week high nor closer than The dividend yield on each stock is greater than the average for the DJIA Combining the dividend yield and remaining growth to its oneyear target there is at least a potential return The following table depicts the pertinent data for the six companies not owned by my club as well as the three already owned The next table depicts the buy points established for the list above As in August the buy points are established by requiring the potential of a return Also as before to be conservative the lower of the oneyear target or the week high is used Comparing the new list to the list derived in August reveals commonalities Two of the six components repeat Merck and M Regarding the companies the club already owns three of the four repeated Apple Cisco and Boeing While the repetition may appear to reinforce an investment appeal it is also possible it represents weakness or stagnation The stocks that were bumped from the list did so because of performance General Electrics and Microsofts share prices increased over CocaCola and Johnson Johnson both improved by Frankly in the past my investment club has not been interested in investing in pharmaceutical companies Based on the potential return of the top two candidates it may well be time to revisit that hesitancy The DuPontDow Chemical NYSE DOW merger warrants a deeper dive by the club Both Verizon and Exxon Mobil represent diversification opportunities to the club Obviously the cloud over the oil and gas industry can not be ignored though Adding M to our portfolio would provide a personal triumph as it was my first suggestion when the club formed Andyet Ive never pushed the suggestion As well it is equally reasonable to consider reinvestment in the three DJIA components we already own The club will revisit direction focus and goals for early in January If embracing the DJIA and its volatility is a priority the list is narrowed and possible buy points established It would not
