The fifth criteria, a dividend yield greater than the average for the index, eliminates only Disney (NYSE: DIS ) from the remainder.There are eleven components now making the cut - Apple, Merck (NYSE: MRK ), Exxon Mobile (NYSE: XOM ), E.I. Du Pont (NYSE: DD ), Proctor & Gamble, 3M (NYSE: MMM ), Cisco, Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ), Boeing, Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) and Intel.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Compared to the original cut, six of the eleven appear on both lists. (Uncertainty) </span>Finally, only three of the eleven offer a potential return of 20% using analysts' average one-year target - Apple, Pfizer, and Merck.Once again, Cisco misses the cut by less than 0.3%.Boeing also missed the cut by less than 1%.Yet, the original purpose in late August was to create a list containing 20%, or six, of the DJIA with the most potential based strictly on criteria and numbers.The six companies were then to be the focus of analysis for the coming months by my investment club.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Similarly, after months of volatility, the purpose now is to determine how much the list has changed. (Uncertainty) </span>Because the club already owns three of the top five, Apple, Cisco and Boeing, the next three in the sort will now make the cut.Therefore, the 20% left after the elimination criteria is applied include Pfizer, Merck, Verizon, DuPont, Exxon Mobil and 3M.The 50-day moving averages of the six are not more than 25% away from each 52-week high nor closer than 10%.The dividend yield on each stock is greater than the average for the DJIA.Combining the dividend yield and remaining growth to its one-year target, there is, at least, a 10% potential return.The following table depicts the pertinent data for the six companies not owned by my club as well as the three already owned.The next table depicts the buy points established for the list above.As in August, the buy points are established by requiring the potential of a 20% return.Also, as before, to be conservative, the lower of the one-year target or the 52-week high is used.Comparing the new list to the list derived in August reveals commonalities.Two of the six components repeat - Merck and 3M.Regarding the companies the club already owns, three of the four repeated - Apple, Cisco and Boeing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While the repetition may appear to reinforce an investment appeal, it is also possible it represents weakness or stagnation. (Uncertainty) </span>The stocks that were bumped from the list did so because of performance.General Electric's and Microsoft's share prices increased over 20%.Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson both improved by 7%.Frankly, in the past, my investment club has not been interested in investing in pharmaceutical companies.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Based on the potential return of the top two candidates, it may well be time to revisit that hesitancy. (Uncertainty) </span>The DuPont/Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW ) merger warrants a deeper dive by the club.Both Verizon and Exxon Mobil represent diversification opportunities to the club.Obviously, the cloud over the oil and gas industry can not be ignored though.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Adding 3M to our portfolio would provide a personal triumph as it was my first suggestion when the club formed. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And,yet, I've never pushed the suggestion. (Uncertainty) </span>As well, it is equally reasonable to consider reinvestment in the three DJIA components we already own.The club will revisit direction, focus and goals for 2016 early in January.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If embracing the DJIA and its volatility is a priority, the list is narrowed and possible buy points established. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It would not surprise me to see additional index components in our portfolio by the end of next year.
