Since most of Google's revenue comes from advertising in various forms and not from direct licensing of its Android operating system, Apple has effectively subsidized the growth of the Android ecosystem.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Pursuing this objective does appear to be what Apple is doing, but it has to be done on multiple fronts, because iOS device users can be subjected to ads in various ways. (Uncertainty) </span>Search is still the cornerstone of Google's advertising empire.Whether an iOS user employs the Safari browser or the Google app, search results will contain "sponsored" results alongside genuine search results.This subtle form of advertising is actually very difficult to eliminate.In iOS 9 Apple introduced a new set of developer tools that would allow the creation of a kind of ad-blocking plug-in for the built-in iOS Safari browser.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although this move caused a lot of consternation , this ad-blocking only worked for display ads on web sites, and not the "sponsored links" that appear in Google search results. (Uncertainty) </span>Although the ad-blocking features of iOS 9 was clearly aimed at Google as well as improving the browsing experience for iOS users, it missed the most important search target.Apple currently provides options for the default search engine in Safari, but until Apple develops a full-fledged search engine of its own, Google is still the best option.Apple has been nibbling away at the search problem for some time, through Siri, and Apple Maps, and the Topsy acquisition .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Last May I reported that Apple appeared to be developing a critical search capability through the Applebot. (Uncertainty) </span>Bots crawl web pages and catalog their contents for search engines.Clearly, Apple is motivated to develop its own search capability, but until it does, there's no way to provide a reasonably ad free experience for iOS users.That leaves in-app advertising.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Personally, I think Apple should ban all in-app advertising, but the hue and cry from the developer community would be deafening, and some developers would probably abandon iOS. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A better approach might be to segregate truly free apps from advertising supported apps on the iOS App Store. (Uncertainty) </span>This would allow users to choose more easily whether to install an ad supported app.One of the key points I tried to make during the recent debate about ad-blocking is that we're seeing a bifurcation of mobile device usage into premium subscription supported services and lower tier ad supported services.Paid, ad free content can be in the form of paid apps, or apps that are gateways to ad free subscription content services such as Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ).Part of the reason that iOS is so lucrative for developers is that it already constitutes a premium tier that emphasizes paid content over ad supported content.Regardless of what happens with iAd, Apple's best interests are to keep moving in that direction.Attracting affluent users who will pay for content rather than have to look at ads is all part of the reason why Apple's mobile business is so much more profitable than the mobile industry as a whole.Providing a more ad-free experience is in effect, a way to further enhance that profitability.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As Apple investors contemplate the prospect of possible y/y declines in iPhone sales in the March quarter, we can take some comfort in the fact that Apple's iPhone profit will probably grow nevertheless. (Uncertainty) </span>I continue to maintain a buy rating on Apple.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Technology</div></body></html>
