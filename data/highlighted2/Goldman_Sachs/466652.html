shares close down ending a tough week as short interest climbs PayPal shares stumble into the weekend too after reporting earnings Early reports say yes Provided that this is true the move comes as little surprise honestly Earlier this week we outlined that of the five remaining buyers for Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO only a few would get a chance at a final offer Reportedly Verizon NYSE VZ was the only company offering less than billion but the company wasnt looking to buy its real estate or patents either Recent updates suggest that Verizon spent roughly billion on the deal which includes real estate but no patents So why is it fitting that its Verizon Theres the fact that Verizon has already acquired AOL Inc showing a history of this type of acquisition But before that deal it was rumored that a tieup between AOL and Yahoo YHOO could be in the works exacerbated further when AOL CEO Tim Armstrong and Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer were spotted together late one night at a bar They could just be friends right Either way the irony is all too real with Tim Armstrong now with Verizon via the acquisition leading the charge on the Yahoo auction Seeing the details from the sale will be interesting but perhaps even more so it will be nice to have this saga put in the past The overthecountertraded Nintendo OTCPKNTDOY hasnt fared too well over the past few days falling over since Mondays closing price On Monday we reported that shares of Nintendo were up more than over the past month with its market cap soaring to billion But not everyone is a believer in the hype even while some analysts may be predicting billions in revenue billion of which could be headed toward Apple NASDAQ AAPL According to the most recent updates short interest has more than tripled to a notsorobust of the float Its unclear what shorts are betting against though Is it the fact that Nintendo doubled in market cap and were clearly overbought Or the fact that the company only owns a stake in the Pokmon Company which alongside Niantic a spinoff of Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL developed Pokmon Go In other words all that profit isnt simply flowing into Nintendos Zeldathemed treasure chests My guess is that is was probably both Side Note Pokmon Go has finally launched in Japan and also has become the most downloaded game in its first week ever according to Apple The ecommerce juggernaut is in practically every other business so why not banking Well its not technically banking because it doesnt appear that Amazon NASDAQ AMZN will be loaning any money Specifically the company has reportedly entered into a partnership with Wells Fargo NYSE WFC in which the bank will offer interest rate discounts to select Prime Students Students who are shopping for current loans or looking to refinance old ones will be able to shave off a half percentage point from that loan provided that they are a qualifying Prime Student So what does this deal really mean It shows that CEO Jeff Bezos Co truly understands his customer For students a half percentage point off their loans could more than pay for the annual membership of Prime More so the company is either helping to retain subscribers or bring new ones in The hope Im assuming isnt that students will only take advantage of Amazons online offerings but also stick with the company over the longhaul Amazon always a hotly contested stock here on Seeking Alpha largely due to its valuation has amassed a market cap of more than billion and is a stones throw from its week high <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs analysts say there could be more upside while some users question if Investors Have Missed Their Chance or if The Stock Has Stalled PayPal NASDAQ PYPL posted revenue growth excurrency yearoveryear EPS growth active account growth of along with increased transactions per account and a increase in transactions Sorry for the numbers blitz Despite all of this however shares are down some Friday Thats got to be disappointing especially after the companys fullyear guidance was raised too Albeit fullyear EPS estimates are roughly inline with expectations if not eversoslightly disappointing although revenue guidance is slightly above consensus It could be attributed to the fact that of the companys revenues come from the UK and revenue growth in this regard is concerning investors More likely than not though its the companys deal with Visa NYSE V thats got investors dumping shares of PayPal However the situation lacks clarity and already there seems to be some disagreements Wells Fargo downgraded the stock while Wedbush Securities has called it a phenomenal move for PayPal although its analyst did question the shortterm impact It probably didnt help that going into the report the stock was hovering near week highs which as usual tends to drag expectations higher as well I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving
