exposed to Apple as well as to international sales Skyworks NASDAQ SWKS shares have dropped since June from an intraday high of to a close of on July While Skyworks shares were making new alltime highs one year ago many analysts and investors expected the shares to trade even higher As a matter of a fact as per below table multiple analysts with the exception of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>recommended buying Skyworks shares between May and February while the stock was continuously trading down and making new relative lows as per chart further down in this article Analysts recommendations for Skyworks Source Yahoo Finance Meanwhile we had published an article on December recommending to our readers to sell shares and book in profits from our prior buy recommendation stated in our earlier article of October Although Skyworks shares did trade higher following our Dec recommendation to sell to book profits they ultimately did reverse and today the shares are trading at about below such levels Meanwhile we now believe that despite the substantial drop in Skyworks during the past year the outlook for the shares for the next several months is even less compelling than it was in Dec and hence we favor selling Skyworks Skyworks stock from to Source Yahoo Finance Skyworks is estimated to generate over of its revenues from Apple NASDAQ AAPL according to BMO analyst Ambrish Srivastava When including Samsung such share is estimated at Furthermore according to Pacific Crest analyst Michael McConnell it is estimated that Skyworks total exposure to the slowing mobile market could be as much as Although Skyworks has been attempting to diversify its exposure to Apple and the mobile market through penetration into the Internet of Things sector it is very evident that Skyworks remains highly impacted by Apple iPhone sales Following its Q financial results ending March Skyworks announced During the June quarter we expect to be impacted by an inventory adjustment at a large customer partially offset with gains across broad markets and crisp operational execution Skyworks designs develops manufactures and markets proprietary semiconductor products Its primary revenue generator are RF chips radio frequency products such as SkyOne Ultra front end module found in Apples iPhone s Skyworks also caters to low and midrange smartphones such as Huawei and Xiaomi RF products are estimated to have grown at about in the past but such growth rate is slated to slow to during the next several years Skyworks is primarily counting on growth in the Internet of ThingsIoT in order to offset the expected drop in mobile market In a recent Skyworks presentation the company underlined that connectivity spread along diversified markets is expected to expand at CAGR to driven by primarily by IoT as per below company slide Click to enlarge Skyworks expectations for connectivity markets Source Skyworks Although we are a believer in the potential long term growth prospects for the IoT sector we expect the above estimates to be too optimistic in the near term Our company Bachar Samawi Innovations is involved in enabling innovative companies with state of the art products penetrate new markets We currently have several IoT related initiatives and we do know firsthand that the product adoption timeline is often longer than most would expect while the funding environment is quite challenging and competitive Recent macro uncertainty relating to Brexit strong dollar and the upcoming US elections will likely cause additional challenges for the several few months at least until November In out recent article Apple Stock Still Too Risky we stated During the next several months the macro environment presents substantial challenges relating to Brexit Europe and even the upcoming US elections Such uncertainty is likely to provide strength to the US Dollar while possibly also having a negative impact on consumer spending especially in Europe Apples international revenues accounted for of Apples billion in revenues for the latest quarter ending March With such a large share of its revenues being derived from international sales an appreciation of the dollar coupled with weaker international consumer spending can weigh heavily on Apple Most macro related headwinds will not be specific to Apple but for the entire market Nevertheless Apples reliance on international sales as well as pessimism related to Apples next iPhone release certainly elevate the risk factors for Apple shares during the next several months The same challenges faced by Apple will be faced by Skyworks first due to Skyworks high dependence on revenue generated from Apple and second as those same headwinds challenging Apple will also challenge Skyworks in its international sales as well as relating to potential slowing consumer spending Skyworks currently has a market capitalization of about billion With analysts earnings estimates of and per share for the years ending in September and Skyworks boasts forward PE ratios of and respectively Both from a market capitalization perspective as well as forward PE perspective Skyworks seems to have a cheaper valuation today than it did in December where its market capitalization stood at billion and its forward PE ratios stood at and for September and respectively Skyworks PE ratio also looks attractive when compared to its range during the past five years where it has typically fluctuated between and as per below chart Click to enlarge Skyworks historical PE ratio Source YCharts However it should also be noted that Skyworks PE ratio has dropped as low as during the past years as per data provided by Gurufocus What will ultimately matter for Skyworks from a valuation perspective is the macro environment the outlook for the smarthphone industry and competitive trends We have already addressed the negative prospects for the macro environment and smartphone industry while on the competitive landscape Skyworks seems to be facing increased competition from Qorvo NASDAQ QRVO Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh expects Intel NASDAQ INTC to take of the iPhone mix boosting Qorvo at the expense of Skyworks due to Qorvos legacy relationship with Intel and in making chips compatible with Intel chips Skyworks could be losing some of its edge to Qorvo while Qualcomms NASDAQ QCOM newly formed RF venture with TDK RF Holdings will present Skyworks additional challenges Qualcomm is the largest mobile application processor and wireless modem manufacturer in the world According to the Motley Fool If Qualcomm also adds its RF chips sensors and wireless charging tech into single reference designs the solution could be considered more costeffective for marginhungry smartphone OEMs While Apple is unlikely to use an allQualcomm reference design many low to midrange OEMs could do so and throttle demand for Skyworks One Mini modules It seems Skyworks will face multiple challenges in the smartphone industry in general including highend units from Apple as well as midrange to lowend units from other manufacturers as well as potential slower growth than expected in the IoT sector as well as macro related headwinds Despite Skyworks attractive valuation at current levels taken from a year perspective a longer year history of Skyworks valuations has provided instances where Skyworks valuation was actually half of the current valuation levels Given our negative outlook for the next several months from a macro perspective as well as for Apple which drives of Skyworks business as well as elevated competitive risks we favor selling Skyworks shares at current levels despite them having already dropped by Disclosure Iwe have no
