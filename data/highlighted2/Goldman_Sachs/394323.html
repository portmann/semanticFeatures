class='textDiv'>Boeing Is Cheap Anyway You Slice It The Boeing Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Ive been bullish on aerospace giant Boeing NYSE BA for some time now as I have thought the market was far too pessimistic regarding its future Recent moves in the Euro against the dollar have produced a less competitive position for Boeing and an SEC investigation didnt help either However those fears were overblown and BA is now flying again as Q earnings and guidance came in very strong With BA up so much from the bottom are there still gains to be made or is BA going to hit the same brick wall it has on prior rallies Boeings fundamental backdrop has been mixed for some time as it battles with Airbus which is taking share in some spaces and as it grapples with writedowns on programs that have been less successful than hoped Q earnings showed the picture for BA is still mixed but on balance the results and accompanying guidance indicate to me that the risk to the stock price is still to the upside Boeings revenue picture looked slightly positive on the whole as weakness in the commercial business was offset by terrific strength in the defense business The former produced a drop in revenue on a drop in volume but the latter picked up the slack and then some hitting revenue during the quarter That strength produced a slightly positive revenue number for BA during the quarter although weakness in the commercial business cannot be ignored BA has been struggling to compete with the likes of Airbus in particular as that company produces strong commercial offerings and has been helped of late by a weak Euro BA cant do anything about either of those factors and the Import Export Bank shenanigans havent helped either In short it seems the universe is against BA right now but with the company producing some growth despite all of those challenges it speaks to the inherent strength of the model and BAs product offerings Operating margins were weak across the board in Q as BA took charges against its tanker and programs and pricing in general was weak BA has seen somewhat weaker pricing of late in order to maintain competitiveness with its rivals and that is showing up in operating margins in a negative way It was enough to send <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs over the edge and come out with a very bearish assessment of the quarter and the stock in general with a very pessimistic price target of just Obviously I disagree with the sentiments expressed by GS but operating margin losses as sizable as what we saw in Q are not sustainable BA is hopefully mostly or completely done taking charges against its tanker and programs although lingering concerns over the Dreamliner persist as well We shall see BA reiterated its fullyear outlook for revenue EPS and cash flow despite the weakness in the commercial business and the writedowns the company took That seems pretty bullish to me as management thinks the rest of the business can absorb the costs associated with the writedowns but it seems not all agree Analysts certainly have somewhat muted expectations for future growth as they set a bearish path for revenue for the next few quarters followed by a gradual recovery in the growth rate That seems about right but given the fact that the defense business is booming if we see even a moderate uptick in commercial deliveries there could be meaningful upside to these estimates Of course if the defense business falls off a cliff we could see the opposite but given that the commercial business is weak already it seems the bias is to the upside if any Analysts have a steady rise in profit levels despite the relatively weak revenue outlook and that is what really matters The only risk here is that BA saw very weak operating earnings in Q and while it was due largely to charges it is still a headwind to be sure When Boeing reports Q earnings Ill be watching operating margins more closely than anything else because BAs profit trajectory depends more upon that than anything else Q was not a good start to the year but its headwinds here should be transitory barring some nasty surprise from the Dreamliner program More importantly EPS should continue to rise at a rate that is faster still than absolute profits due to BAs prodigious buyback Analysts have EPS flying higher in the coming years something Im very excited about We can see two things in play here First BAs EPS growth trajectory is very much intact and second estimates in the out years vary wildly to say the least That variability is to be expected considering that BA has so many headwinds and tailwinds for future growth the rate at which each expands or contracts is going to have a bearing on ultimate EPS production But overall even the most pessimistic analysts have EPS slightly higher each year while the most bullish ones have BA hitting the midteens in EPS by Obviously I come in on the more bullish side as I think temporary weakness in BAs business is being blown out of proportion and that its buyback is being underestimated or ignored BA repurchased a whopping billion in shares in Q and while that run rate isnt sustainable BA always produces strong buybacks BAs weighted average diluted share count fell YY by as BA has retired roughly million shares in that time Thats tremendous and with a huge allotment still remaining on its buyback well continue to see a midsingle digit annual reduction in the share count for the foreseeable future That means that it would take a reduction in absolute earnings for BA to post flat EPS as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>is saying and I just cant see that for years to come One quarter of weakness is not a reason to extrapolate poor results out for three or four years In addition to buybacks BA also pays a sizable dividend currently sitting at about That is great on its own but it is also well in excess of BAs recent historical yields meaning that BA is undervalued and attractive for income investors as well Even if you dont care about BAs growth story or dont believe in it the dividend is rock solid and growing and that means you can take your and growing payout for years to come That is a big draw for investors of income stocks and with that group being so large it is a long term tailwind for demand for BA shares BAs historical yields have been in the low range nothing close to the current yield and that is a sizable positive for bulls Overall I think the outright bearishness expressed by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>is very shortsighted and reeks of an analyst team trying to paint a particular picture instead of interpreting the results the way they are That sort of bias leads to what Id consider a ridiculous price target of and on the flip side Sterne Agee is out with a price target The answer is somewhere in between and for now I think well see BA climb towards its old highs in the s on strong results without enormous writedowns for the rest of the year What happens after that is a story for another day but for now BA is still cheap on a PE yield and FCF basis and thats good enough for me I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship
