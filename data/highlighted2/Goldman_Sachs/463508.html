Money Program Tuesday July During the earnings season the stock market is in continuous grading mode These are moments when the reports come fast and furious one after another with headlines blaring and premarket trading all over the place and are among the most challenging times for investors said Cramer He shared some tips to maximize gains and minimize risk during the earnings season First tip was that when a stock rallies going into the quarter it means some investors are buying only for that particular quarter and they have the discipline to take gains no matter when it comes If there are gains before the earnings report theyll take it an run Such profit taking can affect the stock momentarily Second the reaction to earnings does not only depend on the actual report but what powerful people think about it For instance Cramer liked the quarter from IBM NYSE IBM but Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said that the earnings are decelerating and the company will have trouble making money in the second half Toni Sacconaghis name might mean nothing to you but at this particular moment he is every bit as important as IBMs CFO said Cramer Third all earnings are relative <span

that less was expected from Citi but not from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Right now I think that Citigroup is the buy given how far it has come out but I simply dont believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs is bad either Its just that its not quite good enough adds Cramer Fourth bad is really bad Netflix NASDAQ NFLX reported slower than expected subscriber growth for the second quarter in a row and investors were rightly upset with it The stock tanked as a result When a stock falls that hard the selloff will continue for a number of days as many institutions with large positions are getting out of it The reverse is also true for good stocks Johnson Johnson NYSE JNJ reported a beat on all counts which impressed investors and hence it can rally for days Lastly earning headlines can be deceptive Case in point was United Health NYSE UNH the conference call of which showed that the quarter was not as perfect as the headlines reported Cramer concluded by saying that investors should stick to the binary stocks which are easy to profit from and stay away from the subjective ones The Secret Life of Pets grossed more than M in two weeks This clearly points out that the pet care theme is multigenerational as people spend a fortune on their pets There are a lot of ways you can make money from this smoking hot pet care theme said Cramer Pet care spending has risen from B in to over B in Cramer went through a list of stocks that are at the center of the pet care theme Zoetis NYSE ZTS is the largest animal healthcare company around Idexx Labs NASDAQ IDXX are makers of vet testing equipment VCA NASDAQ WOOF have vet hospitals and clinics and PetMed Express NASDAQ PETS sells medication to pet owners From the group Cramer likes Idexx but it trades at times earnings It should be bought only on weakness Zoetis has been all over the place and hence Cramer advised waiting for another strong quarter before buying in VCA on the other hand is worth buying in as it trades at times earnings only PetMed Express is the only stock that has limited upside Cramer reviewed the two misfits of the earnings season to ascertain how should investors deal with them Netflix and Hasbro NASDAQ HAS Hasbros stock went down on concerns that the inventory has built up After Cramer heard the companys conference call and interviewed CEO Goldner he found out that the inventory was not unsold toys that were being piled up but stocks of toys that have not hit the market yet The inventory build is to match the demand of upcoming toys When this is compared to rival Mattel NASDAQ MAT which also declined it is easy to find out that Hasbro is the winner Netflix on the other hand had a confusing conference call in Cramers opinion His first concern was the word ungrandfathered that was used in the call Cramer is always suspicious of companies creating a word that the spell check doesnt recognize ungrandfathered represented the subscribers who were grandfathered into Netflix did not renew their subscriptions ahead of a price increase For the first time the price increase in Netflix fess mattered Is that what weakened US numbers I found myself thinking at least they didnt lose any added Cramer He did not get why subscribers would not renew the subscription for a few dollars especially when compared to the cable bill Now I am not so sure You just shouldnt be getting this level of Netflix cutting And the lack of domestic growth isnt being made up overseas like it used to be Is the bull run of the past three weeks over Cramer went back to the charts with the help of technician Mark Sebastian to get an insight about the direction of the market VIX is the fear gauge of the market During the Brexit selloff the SP went down but the VIX went down with it This was a sign that the selloff was ending Sbeastian believes that the bull still has legs at least for now Why Because everything is behaving normally said Cramer The daily chart of VIX SP shows that the index has gone higher and VIX has fallen For the rally in SP to continue the VIX has to remain low Technicians look for volatility in the VIX itself to indicate when a rally ends When the VIX continues to go down but VVIX starts to rally it indicates that there is demand for swaps as big institutional mangers trade VVIX to hedge long positions When this scenario plays out it means that the big money is uncomfortable The second sign to watch out for are the bond yields When that happens the dividend yield stocks become less attractive as compared to bonds which trigger a marketwide selloff As long as the bond yields are low Sebastian believes that SP can hit in August Since Sebastian nailed the postBrexit bottom I am inclined to stick with him and let it ride concluded Cramer Gray Television NYSE GTN Let the profit ride till the good earnings report Jim Cramers Action Alerts PLUS Check out Cramers multimillion
