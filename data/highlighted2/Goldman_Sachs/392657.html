peak future returns will likely be mediocre Japanese markets collapsed following an unexpected BOJ decision How bad will the fallout be Wednesday was marked by crosscurrents There were various forces exerting themselves upon the market pushing it around in a volatile session Stocks particularly in the tech space NASDAQ QQQ were sharply lower to open the day This was driven by the continuing spate of earnings misses in the sector headlined by a truly lousy quarter from market goliath Apple NASDAQ AAPL along with a shellacking at the perpetually underwhelming Twitter NYSE TWTR The morning nervousness increased following a disappointing crude oil NYSEARCA USO report that wiped out a sizable increase and sent the fuel briefly into the red But stocks quickly recovered following tame Fed comments that gave speculators the green light to buy the dip and send stocks higher By the time the market closed the Dow NYSEARCA DIA posted a point gain the SP NYSEARCA SPY eked out a small increase while the Nasdaq remained down half a percent But that wouldnt be all Late Wednesday evening the futures market abruptly plunged The SP lost of its value in mere minutes At fault was a less than expected decision from the Bank of Japan which well discuss in a second For the SP the apparent victory the Fed provided was shortlived On the longerterm chart we still appear to be near what could be a major top If the market cant go higher and soon momentum will be lost and a correction should kick off Its getting near what should be a do or die moment for the market With earnings continuing to be a complete mess its hard to imagine buyers will stay interested in the market at these levels without some major positive catalyst Otherwise a revisit to or lower is quite probably in the offing Apple stock as you certainly know if you follow any media was punished on Wednesday following a dreary earnings report The stock was down and would have been worse without the lateday Fed rally Market participants were expecting a bad report from Apple coming into the release The company which traditionally posts higher profits and revenues year over year each and every quarter was expected to post declines However both figures came in way low with EPS missing by a whole dime and revenue a billion dollars light Equally disappointing the company slashed forward revenue guidance coming in more than below consensus The company had issues on many fronts Chinese sales were down by more than a quarter Average unit selling price plunged phones are becoming commodities now dont forget Currency issues caused further drag Most importantly the company has failed to launch new products that would generate excitement In the past the perpetual earnings beats were driven by explosive new products or updated models that practically forced consumers to upgrade Nowadays thats simply not the case I explained this in Apples Long Slow Decline and my analysis remains uptodate today What happens to Apple when Samsung OTCSSNLF and Xiaomi offer sub smartphones that do everything todays phones can do Since Jobs passing Apple has stopped making products that are cultural touchstones Commoditization and Moores Law will do the rest of the work in returning Apple from its pedestal to becoming just another tech company Sure Apple still generates plenty of cash They hiked the dividend again and continue to return large amounts of capital to shareholders However the stock will remain perpetually cheap as long as earnings keep declining If your PE is such as Apples and earnings decline by you have to drop the stock by to maintain the same PE ratio This is the process youre seeing occur in the stock now And your sub yield does little to cushion you If a company has steadily falling earnings theres hardly a PE ratio low enough to protect you from further downside If you have a catalyst for Apple growing earnings again maybe the stock is cheap But if as I contend the smartphone market has peaked and Apple doesnt have an ace up its sleeve youve seen peak earnings and thus probably peak stock price for the next few years if not longer Theres nothing wrong with owning Apple stock if youre more optimistic on it than I am However the stock is not cheap its appropriately priced for the risk that earnings continue to slide gradually for years to come Run a model where Apple earnings fall by a modest a year for the next years and even with the share buyback and modest dividend increases your total return isnt going to be very good Its very hard to get an edge on the single biggest company in the world Yes it might look cheap if you merely look at the PE ratio but theres more to the story than that Earlier this week one of my Daily Briefings highlighted the odd effects that Japans policy of buying up its stocks might cause The Japanese Central Bank has in its infinite wisdom decided to start buying its nations stocks at a rate of roughly billion per year It makes these purchases through ETFs and is estimated to own more than half the nations outstanding ETF assets Through this policy it has become a top holder of the vast majority of the stock Japanese largecap index Regarding the risks this poses I wrote that If the pace of JCB stock buying is expanded as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs and other analysts anticipate the JCB would be the holder of about stocks out of the Japanese stock benchmark by the end of Therere a few obvious problems with this For one if and when the JCB tries to sell its shares who will buy Theyve taken a position much too large to unwind gradually Any hint of them even stopping the buying of additional shares would cause a plunge in the Japanese market I for one am avoiding Japanese stocks NYSEARCA EWJ for precisely this reason The JCB met this week and decided not to increase the rate of stock purchases along with eschewing other more stimulatory approaches They highlighted the large downside risks to the economy the likelihood of a CPI rate going forward and said theyll add to the easing if necessary But the market wanted easing now the Nikkei plunged points more than immediately on the news Global markets swooned as well Japan is a busted equity market You can be long trying to profit from the banks nearly unlimited willingness to provide a bid However even that may not be enough to keep their shares up Without increasing rates of stimulus it seems their market may sell off anyways And if the JCB actually tried to unwind the stimulus and start returning to a more normal state the shortterm shock would be catastrophic As for our markets its unlikely that Japan by itself would trigger a major correction Its no China as far as its modernday impact goes However with the weight of nasty earnings the slowing GDP outlook and rebounding interest rates theres enough on the table that the Japanese selloff might be the thing that tips the delicate global balance toward the downside Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it
