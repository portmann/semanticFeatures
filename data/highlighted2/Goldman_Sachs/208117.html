As you can see , retail has the highest margins.Therefore, buying Spirit would be more advantageous than buying another bolt-on manufacturing company.The other competition Party City faces is from dollar stores and mass market retailers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The differentiation between dollar stores and mass market stores doesn't concern me. (Uncertainty) </span>From a consumer perspective, I don't see them to be direct competitors.If I ran out of a particular item or forgot to purchase an item such as cups, I would go to a convenient dollar store.If I'm throwing a party and want to buy everything at once, going to Party City is a no-brainer because it will have a better selection and better quality items.Party City backs up this opinion, as you can see from the chart below.The company has 25,000 SKUs compared to under 2,000 at the dollar stores and under 1,000 at mass market stores.This competition has always existed and it hasn't stopped Party City yet.With regards to mass market stores, PRTY has an agreement with American Greetings to be the exclusive party goods distributor to K-Mart, Target (NYSE: TGT ), and Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ), so Party City makes money even if you do decide to go to Wal-Mart for party goods instead of its stores.The biggest threat to Party City is Amazon.I think this threat will be mitigated.I've spent a few minutes shopping in the party goods section on both sites and found it much easier to find goods on Party City because items for a particular theme are all sold together.They are sold as a collection of items.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the website, it shows you how your party will look if you buy different kits. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sometimes there are kits, like the one below, on Amazon. (Uncertainty) </span>However this kit is being sourced by Amscan, which is Party City's wholesale company.PRTY has its tentacles all of over Amazon, so growth on Amazon isn't catastrophic to Party City.I did a search for "Frozen" party supplies with Olaf on it.Most of the items on Amazon were separates.If you are throwing a party, you don't want to buy forks separately from plates.It should all be conveniently packaged together.After scrolling through 5 pages, I found this kit on Amazon.It isn't complete because it doesn't include forks, knives, or balloons.As you can see below, the offering from Party City is more complete.Keep in mind PRTY holds the "Frozen" licenses, so its wholesale division will be getting a piece of the action from the Amazon sale.Halloween costumes are another area we must look at.Party City has an advantage because you can go to the store and try a costume on.Online stores have solved this problem in general apparel because they let consumers send items back if they don't fit.This doesn't work with Halloween costumes because people tend to shop at the last minute.They don't have enough time to get a costume, send it back, and buy another one if they are buying the week of Halloween.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Halloween costumes are the type of items where having variety is important because of the different tastes of consumers. (Uncertainty) </span>Party City has more items than Amazon and they are easier to find on its website because AMZN sells other products.Party City lets you mix and match to create your own costume on the website.You can do this on Amazon, but you'd have to use your own imagination.There are some items that are cheaper on Amazon, but this doesn't matter too much if they don't have what you're looking for.The areas for growth for Party City are alternative markets and international sales.Alternative markets are being expanded over the next three years with the acquisition of Accurate Custom Injection Molding.The company is expanding into creating products such as cups and napkins for theme parks such as SeaWorld (NYSE: SEAS ).The firm also said on the call that it made the towels and scarfs sold to the New York Rangers fans during the Stanley Cup playoffs in 2014.This business can be exploited more over the next few years and can help diversify sales away from Halloween and party goods.Internationally, the company entered into a joint venture with Grupo Oprimax to open 80-100 franchise locations over the next 10 years.Party City has a fulfillment center in Guadalajara, Mexico, so it will be sourcing 50% of the products from its wholesale division.The Mexican business should do well, because when Party City opens stores in Hispanic neighborhoods, it gets a 10% sales bump over stores in non-Hispanic towns.The other countries such as Australia and in Europe are fertile ground for expansion, but they haven't been exposed to the category.Party City is supporting its international e-commerce business and opening store within a store concepts in Europe and Australia to get the customers familiar with the products.For example, it has a 3,000-foot store within a store in Big W in Australia which is sourced 100% from its wholesale division.I will go over the licenses Party City doesn't currently have to show you where it can grow.It doesn't have the license for Minions costumes, and it doesn't have a direct to retail license agreement with Warner Bros. (NYSE: TWX ).It said it is working on a deal with Warner Bros.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This could provide growth when it is struck. (Uncertainty) </span>Party City doesn't have some Disney (NYSE: DIS ) licenses for international sales.If PRTY expands, it will acquire these licenses.The company currently has a leverage ratio of 5.2, which is very high.It plans on lowering its leverage ratio with the proceeds raised in the IPO.In 3 years, it will have a targeted leverage ratio between 3.0 and 3.5.As you can see below, Party City has been able to operate with high leverage ratios in the past.I think part of the reason the stock is doing poorly is because of the terrible IPO market.As you can see below, IPOs are down 5.8% this year compared to the S&P's loss of just 1.7%.There have been 21.7% less IPOs this year compared to last year.Total proceeds raised in UDS are down 42.1% from last year.Let's take advantage of this poor market and buy Party City.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
