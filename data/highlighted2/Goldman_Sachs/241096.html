The same case applied to Allergan (NYSE: AGN ), Costco (NASDAQ: COST ) and Jack in the Box (NASDAQ: JACK ), where investors are willing to buy high-quality companies after looking at them more objectively.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>"After today, maybe the bottom line is that the market's lovey-dovey stock list, the ones that are anointed by big money managers is expanding back to companies that have delivered great results," said Cramer. (Uncertainty) </span>One of the fastest growing enterprise software companies, Salesforce reported a great last quarter by beating estimates, posting higher than expected revenue and raising full-year guidance.Cramer interviewed founder chairman and CEO, Marc Benioff."It wasn't that long ago that I was sitting here with you and we were talking about our first $1 billion year.Now I am so excited to announce that next year we will do more than $8 billion, and we are still the fastest growing enterprise software company ever," said Benioff.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is almost $3B deferred revenue on the balance sheet and the company has won some major contracts. (Uncertainty) </span>The company had great deals with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), General Motors (NYSE: GM ), Sprouts Framers Market (NASDAQ: SFM ) and one of the biggest engineering companies, Aecom (NYSE: ACM ).When asked about his relationship with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Benioff said that they are a partner, rival and friendly competitor.Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) vs. GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO ) Fitbit is often called the next GoPro as both had huge IPOs and became controversial later.Both are in the wearable technology business driven by software, along with many other similarities.The important factor is that both companies received approval for quicker lockup expiration.Cramer took a deep look at each company individually to find out which is better to invest in.Fitbit's stock has fallen 45% from its highs due to the secondary offering.Fitbit is offering 17M shares, of which 14M are from existing shareholders, to raise capital in order to invest in R&D, which means the company is interested in gaining market share and solidifying its position.GoPro, on the other hand, sold stocks worth $500M to establish a charitable trust.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>"Giving half a billion dollars to charity is a wonderful thing to do, no question, but this show is about helping individual investors try to make money. (Surprise) </span>And having insiders dump that much stock on the open market was very bad news for GoPro's shareholders," said Cramer.The current time is a lot like the 1980s when President Ronald Reagan also advocated a military buildup that led to the rise in defense stocks.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>"I'm not trying to be a warmonger or a fear-monger or a profiteer, but I have to wonder, do we even have enough aircraft carriers to do all of those things? (Surprise) </span>Do we have enough planes?Do we have enough missiles?Do we have enough soldiers in the right places?"asked Cramer.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The US could be overstretched. (Uncertainty) </span>"I'm not advocating a political position here.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I'm simply giving you my best-guess prediction about something that could be very important to your portfolio. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Because if I am right, then you need to know what happened in 1980, since it could play out all over again," said Cramer. (Uncertainty) </span>This means that the defense stocks like Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT ) to Raytheon (NYSE: RTN ) to General Dynamics (NYSE: GD ) and Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC ) should be bought.Norfolk Southern's (NYSE: NSC ) takeover bid Should Norfolk Southern ( NSC ) accept the $95 per share takeover bid by Canadian Pacific (NYSE: CP ) or should they hold on for a higher price?Cramer reminded about the deal where Air Products bid for Airgas (NYSE: ARG ) for $75 which was eventually rejected by CEO Peter McCausland.Airgas now got $49 more yesterday and they accepted.GNC Holdings (NYSE: GNC ): Buy Perrigo (NYSE: PRGO ) and not GNC.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS: Check out Cramer's multi-million dollar charitable trust portfolio and uncover the stocks he thinks could be HUGE winners.
