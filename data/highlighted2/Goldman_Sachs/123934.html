Im delighted to talk to you about the highlights Today were proud to report record June quarter results with revenues of billion and earnings of billion Our yearoveryear growth rate in the fiscal third quarter accelerated over the first half of fiscal Revenues were up our fastest growth rate in over three years and earnings per share were up We achieved these incredibly strong results despite reducing channel inventories across our product lines by over million units and despite the challenging FX environment Revenue exceeded the high end of our guidance by billion as we topped our internal expectations for sales of iPhone iPad Mac and Apple Watch We had another stellar quarter for iPhone establishing a new June quarter record iPhone unit sales grew which is almost three times the rate of growth of the smartphone market overall and we gained share in all of our geographic segments iPhone revenue grew even more strongly up The strong iPhone results were broadbased in both developed and emerging markets and we experienced the highest switcher rate from Android that weve ever measured Most importantly iPhone customer metrics are tremendous ChangeWaves most recent survey of US customers found that iPhone has the highest customer satisfaction rate of any smartphone brand by a wide margin and that among iPhone owners planning to purchase a new phone plan to purchase another iPhone That compares to repurchase intent for the next highest brand measured We also had a tremendous record quarter for Mac continuing to defy the industry trend with unit growth of in a market that IDC estimates contracted by Growth was fueled by great response to our new MacBook and were working hard to catch up with customer demand We generated over billion in services revenue setting a new alltime record Within services the App Store produced its best quarter ever with revenue growing Our results from Greater China were outstanding with revenue growth of and iPhone unit growth of This is particularly impressive given IDCs estimate of only growth for the Greater China smartphone market We also achieved our highest ever PC market share in the segment with Mac sales growing over last year And our ecosystem in China continues to grow at a very fast pace with App Store revenue more than doubling in the quarter Luca will go into more detail on our product and financial results in a moment A major highlight of the past quarter for all of us here at Apple was the launch of Apple Watch in April As you know weve been very excited to get this revolutionary product to customers We started taking preorders in nine countries on April and demand immediately exceeded supply by a wide margin To prioritize those first orders and to deliver the best experience for our customers we delayed the availability of Apple Watch in our own retail stores until mid June We made huge progress with the production ramp across the quarter and near the end of the quarter expanded into six additional countries And in just the past few days weve been able to catch up with demand enabling us to expand Apple Watch availability to a total of countries currently with three more countries to be added at the end of this month The feedback from Apple Watch customers is incredibly positive and weve been very happy with customer satisfaction and usage statistics Market research from Wristly measured a customer satisfaction rate for Apple Watch and we hear from people every day about the impact its having on their health their daily routines and how they communicate Our own market research shows that of Apple Watch owners wear and use it regularly if not every day Messaging and activity features are among the most popular and social networking apps including Twitter WeChat and Wine are seeing the most usage among third party apps We believe that the possibilities for Apple Watch are enormous and thats been reinforced in just the first few weeks since it became available to customers For example doctors and researchers at leading hospitals in the US and Europe are already putting Apple Watch to work in improving patients lives Nebraska Medicine the latest hospital to adopt Apple Watch has rolled out new apps that facilitate communication between patients and doctors and provide quick access to important chart and dosage information Ochsner Health System of Louisiana is using Apple Watch with hypertension patients to gather important information like data like daily activity and blood pressure level and leading cancer centers like London Kings College Hospital are incorporating Apple Watch into trials for ongoing care and monitoring of cancer patients Great Apple Watch solutions go well beyond healthcare Users are tracking their fitness getting breaking news alerts following their investments connecting with friends and living a healthier day The user experience for Apple Pay and Siri is nothing short of incredible and customers are enjoying countless other features through the over thirdparty apps available for Apple Watch This is just the beginning of what this new platform can deliver With Apple watchOS developers now have the ability to build richer and more powerful native apps for Apple Watch taking advantage of the heart rate sensor the Digital Crown accelerometer and more ushering in a whole new class of apps designed specifically for the wrist Its a rare and special privilege to launch a new platform with such promise and potential and I know I speak for everyone at Apple when I say that we cant wait to see what our developers and customers do with it We hosted a fantastic developers conference in June with thousands of attendees from countries coming together with Apple engineers to share in the excitement of our three operating systems OS X iOS and watchOS Weve been working hard to make our products even more intelligent more powerful and more meaningful in all aspects of our customers lives while adding new continuity features to make the experience across our devices more seamless than ever and preserving the security and privacy that our customers deserve Public betas of OS X El Capitan and iOS are available now and customer versions of all three updated OSs are on schedule and will be delivered in the fall Were very excited about our news app coming to iPhone and iPad with iOS We believe it will be the best news reading experience on any mobile device combining a beautiful magazine layout with real time customized digital media content News will follow over million topics and pull relevant stories based on the users specific interests without compromising their privacy Weve already signed leading publishers representing more than of the worlds most influential news sports business and magazine titles including CNN the New York Times the Financial Times ESPN Bloomberg Business Cond Nast Hearst Reuters Time Inc and The Daily Telegraph The September quarter is off to an exciting start Were thrilled by the response to Apple music which launched in over countries on June Apple Music is a single immersive app that combines the best ways to enjoy music all in one place Its an incredible streaming music service a pioneering worldwide live radio station broadcasting hours a day and a great place for music fans to connect with their favorite artist Customers and reviewers love the human curation features of Apple Music and the way its helping people discover new music Millions and millions of customers are already experiencing the new service using the threemonth trial period and the numbers are growing substantially every day Over artists have signed up to post on Connect where we are already seeing great original content including a world premier video by Drake Millions of listeners around the world are tuning in to Beats the first of its kind worldwide radio station featuring some of the most talented and passionate music lovers on the planet This all adds up to a renewed sense of excitement around music which we love and expect to continue as Apple Music gets traction with customers Last week we launched Apple Pay in the UK bringing customers our easy secure and private way to pay On day one we had an incredible roster of over locations and major credit and debit cards for many of the UKs most established banks supporting Apple Pay Customers are using Apple Pay to ride the London Underground as well as the over ground systems of Transport for London and we hope this will be a model for other public transportation systems around the world In the US weve seen fantastic support from merchants of all sizes We are excited to see this momentum continue with the new Square reader coming this fall It will bring Apple Pay to even more neighborhood businesses where you pay every day from your corner coffee shop to your local farmers market bolstering the small and mediumsize businesses were already adding every month American Express will add Apple Pay support for its robust portfolio of corporate cards next month offering businesses and their employees a new way to make easy and secure payments And as we head into the school year universities and colleges across the US will accept Apple Pay such as Auburn University the University of California Irvine Colorado State University the University of Kentucky and the University of Oklahoma among many others Were on track for Apple Pay acceptance at over million US locations by the end of Id like to thank our customers developers business partners and employees for another record breaking quarter Were very hard at work on our exciting pipeline of new hardware software and services and were continuing to expand our global reach into new markets And were passionately committed to leaving the world better than we found it With that Ill turn the call over to Luca Luca Maestri Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you Tim Good afternoon everyone As we have done for the first half of our fiscal we are reporting another record quarter today Revenue for the June quarter was billion an increase of billion or year over year Our growth was driven by the tremendous performance of iPhone the introduction of Apple Watch and the continued strength of Mac and App Store sales We achieved these great results in the context of a very challenging foreign exchange environment around the world and a reduction in channel inventory of over million units across our product lines which makes our growth performance even more remarkable As Tim mentioned our results were especially impressive in Greater China where revenue more than doubled year over year to over billion Emerging markets overall grew to almost billion and represented of our total company revenue Company gross margin was better than our expectations mainly due to strong iPhone sales Operating margin was of revenue and net income was billion a new June quarter record Diluted earnings per share were a yearoveryear increase and cash flow from operations was billion also a new third quarter record For details by product Ill start with iPhone We sold million iPhones in the quarter representing year over year growth and demand for iPhone and Plus has continued to be terrific all around the world iPhone sales more than doubled in Germany Korea Malaysia and Vietnam Were up over in Greater China and in India and increased more than in several countries including Italy Spain the Netherlands and Turkey The strong mix of iPhone and Plus led to an iPhone ASP of an increase of year over year despite the significant negative foreign exchange impact I referred to earlier We reduced iPhone channel inventory by about units during the quarter which left us at the low end of our target range of to weeks of channel inventory Next Id like to talk about the Mac We sold million Macs representing yearoveryear growth As we have done for several years in a row we continued to gain significant market share based on IDCs latest estimate of a global PC market contraction Mac growth was driven by portables and we are delighted with the very strong customer reception of our new MacBook We ended the quarter slightly below our to week target range for Mac channel inventory Turning to iPad We sold million compared to million in the yearago quarter iPad sellthrough was million as we reduced channel inventory by about units This left us within our to week target range of iPad channel inventory iPad customer metrics continue to be extremely positive ChangeWave recently measured a customer satisfaction rate for iPad Air and among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within days over half plan to purchase an iPad For corporate buyers the purchase intent was even stronger at over We do not participate in the low end of the tablet market but we are extremely successful where we do compete NPD recently indicated that iPad has share of the US market for tablets priced above Were very excited about the advances in the iPad experience coming in iOS in the fall including the slide over and split view features for retail multitasking pictureinpicture for FaceTime and video and enhanced QuickType for composing text even faster Were also seeing great momentum in the enterprise market For instance riding on the success of iPad use by its pilots United Airlines has not only renewed its iPad program with more than iPad Air s but has also made a strategic decision to provide iPhones to over flight attendants In the near future United plans to introduce new apps to transform the customer experience and improve integration with flight operations Were also very happy with the progress of our IBM partnership IBM released new MobileFirst for iOS apps in the June quarter including new apps in retail banking and healthcare as well as new horizontal apps for HR and sales There are now apps in IBMs MobileFirst for iOS catalog that connect users to big data and analytics right on their iPads or iPhones And we expect a total of apps to be available by the end of Active customer engagements have also grown to over and recent notable customer wins include Air Canada National Grid in the UK and Banorte in Mexico In April Apple IBM and Japan Post announced a joint initiative to deliver iPads with IBM developed apps and analytics to connect Japanese senior citizens with services healthcare community and family Japan Post hopes to reach million to million Japanese customers with these solutions by Since announcing this initiative less than three months ago weve already seen strong interest from other countries looking for innovative ways to support an aging population Importantly we also continue to work closely with leading business software and solution providers to help businesses of all sizes transform work with iPad and iPhone The number of these mobility partners has expanded rapidly to over Theyre developing new and differentiated solutions on iOS across many industries and attracting very significant customer interest Turning to services We generated over billion in revenue a new alltime record and an increase of over last year thanks primarily to strong growth from apps The revenue from the App Store increased and the number of transacting customers grew also setting an alltime record Services growth was particularly strong in China where the App Store revenue more than doubled year over year China based developers have created apps for our China App Store and the response from our customers has been tremendous The revenue from other products grew sharply up over last year The contribution from Apple Watch accounted for well over of the growth of the category and more than offset the decline of iPod and accessory sales As weve said in the past we do not plan to disclose Apple Watch metrics because we dont intend to provide insight that could help our competitors Our retail and online stores had a very busy quarter with customer visits up yearoveryear driven especially by the very strong interest in Apple Watch Thanks to our very popular Apple Store app mobile traffic to our online stores during the quarter equaled desktop traffic for the first time ever We opened three new stores our second store in Brazil our sixth store in Manhattan and our twentysecond store in Greater China That brought us to a global store count of of which are outside the United States and we are on track to have stores open in Greater China by the middle of next year Let me now turn to our cash position We ended the quarter with billion in cash plus marketable securities a sequential increase of billion billion of this cash or of the total was offshore In the June quarter we issued a total of billion of term debt consisting of billion US dollar denominated notes and billion denominated notes as we continue to diversify our global debt investor base This left us with billion of term debt outstanding at the end of the quarter During the quarter we turned over billion to our investors We paid billion in dividends and equivalents and we spent billion to repurchase million Apple shares to open market transactions We also launched a billion accelerated share repurchase program in May and received an initial delivery of million shares The purchase feeder for the new ASR will land in or before November of We have continued to execute our capital return program at a fast pace and we now take an action on over billion of our billion program including billion in share repurchases The weighted average price for all open market purchases and completed ASR programs to date is Now as we move ahead into the September quarter Id like to review our outlook which includes the types of forwardlooking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call We expect revenue to be between billion and billion compared to billion in the yearago quarter We expect gross margin to be between and We expect OpEx to be between billion and billion We expect OIE to be about million and we expect the tax rate to be about Also today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of per share of common stock payable on August to shareholders of record as of August With that lets open the call to questions Nancy Paxton Senior Director Investor Relations and Treasury We ask that you limit yourself to one onepart question and one followup Operator may we have the first question please Operation Instructions First we will hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley Kathryn L Huberty Morgan Stanley Co LLC Yes thanks Good afternoon While the year on year iPhone growth was very attractive the sequential unit decline in the June quarter was worse than the past two years Why do you think that was and in particular why drain channel inventory when iPhone is selling so well And then I have a followup Timothy Donald Cook Chief Executive Officer Director Katy its Tim As Luca mentioned the channel inventory did go down by We sold more units than we thought we would and so that was a part of that The other part of it is that we always run with just the amount of inventory that we think we need And so to the degree that sales are distributed in the countries with disproportionally with shorter supply chains or the standard deviation demand is less we would always choose to have less And so in this particular quarter we were able to end basically right at the bottom end of our range and we view that as a good thing not a bad thing Obviously the revenues could have been much higher if we would have expanded the channel but if you dont need to do that thats not how we think about the business We run the business for the long term not the day clock In terms of the whats going on with iPhone the growth is almost three times the market And if you look at it at a little narrower regional level Western Europe grew versus a market of so four times market Japan grew over five times market We doubled in Korea versus a market that was shrinking And India we grew at and this is on top of the Greater China numbers that weve already covered that grew during the quarter against a market of And so we did exceptionally well I think in any way that you look at it In terms of the percentage of customers that have upgraded to a and Plus versus that have not upgraded its or meaning that of the installed base of customers prior to the launch of and Plus have now upgraded And so we view that as a very bullish sign on the future that theres a lot of headroom left for upgraders We also are incredibly happy to see the highest Android switcher rate that weve observed And so from our point of view the iPhone is doing outstanding Kathryn L Huberty Morgan Stanley Co LLC So Tim just to extend that conversation to the longer term as Im sure youre aware youre lapping some pretty significant comps as it relates to the upgrades that youre talking about as well as significant growth in China What is the framework that you use to convince yourselves that iPhone units can continue to grow over the longer term Timothy Donald Cook Chief Executive Officer Director Well you know Katy we purposely just give guidance for the current quarter and weve done that And obviously the kind of numbers that we have indicated growth in the revenue means that iPhone would have another stellar quarter And so were very confident that this quarter is going to be great How the future looks well take it one quarter at a time But as I back up from it and look at it more from a macro point of view the things that makes me very bullish is the number I just quoted the fact that we are seeing the highest Android switcher rate the customer satisfaction that we have on the iPhone versus the competition Its a huge margin The loyalty rate that we have versus competition an enormous gap there I also look at the first time iPhone buyers and were still seeing very very large numbers in the countries that you would want to see those in like China and Russia and Brazil and so forth I also see a market that over a fiveyear horizon if you look at the IDC numbers is projected to grow from million in to over billion this is billion rather billion in And so its an incredible market I think everybodys going to own a smartphone and I think weve proven that we can compete for a fair number of those as you can see from our results Nancy Paxton Senior Director Investor Relations and Treasury William Charles Shope <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs Co Okay great Thank you Could you walk us through the key factors behind your gross margin range for the September quarter and in particular how we should think about the sequential ForEx impact this quarter and the impact of a potential product transition cost Luca Maestri Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Definitely This is Luca So we got into to and so just keep in mind last year in Q our gross margin declined by basis points sequentially So this year were expecting a sequential decline of basis points I would point to three main factors for the decline First of all to your point around foreign exchange it continues to be a challenging environment given the strengthening of the US dollar In our case the impact on margin after the hedges is going to be about basis points for Q Also I want to point to a different mix which is typical of our seasonality as we enter the backtoschool season during Q And thirdly the transition cost that youve mentioned as we prepare for a busy fall And so those are the three factors that will have an impact on gross margin sequentially I would point that in general costs continue to be particularly commodity costs continue to be favorable and so there would be a partial offset to the factors that I mentioned William Charles Shope <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs Co Okay thanks And then could you give us a bit more color on the mix dynamics for the iPhone in the June quarter and how this compares to prior generations and your expectations Obviously there continues to be an upward bias helping the ASPs as you mentioned but could you give us a bit more detail on what exactly youre seeing here Particularly I think its interesting in the context of a continued tilt towards the emerging regions obviously Luca Maestri Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah so as we mentioned the ASP for iPhone was up increase yearoveryear and this is really driven by the mix by the fact that weve added iPhone Plus to a new price point and in general iPhone and Plus are doing extremely well as a percentage of the portfolio And keep in mind that this was partially offset by of unfavorable foreign exchange So the number would have been even better So yes clearly and Plus And I think we talked about it in prior calls the Plus is doing particularly well in the markets that you would expect Greater China other Asian markets Those are markets where our growth rates are particularly strong and the Plus because of the screen size is doing extremely well Nancy Paxton Senior Director Investor Relations and Treasury That will come from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray Eugene Charles Munster Piper Jaffray Co Broker Hi good afternoon Luca you talked a little bit about gross margins in the previous question But could you talk about how we should think about the trends in the gross margin In other words is should the margin trends that weve seen in other cycles continue into next year And then a followup or another question for Tim here is that the Watch has been under a lot of interest from investors and some may have wanted a little bit more You outlined some of the opportunities and some of the progress youve had But any thoughts that you have for investors who may say that the category is just not taking off as fast as they would have hoped Luca Maestri Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Okay Gene let me start with gross margin As Tim said before obviously we guide to the current quarter You know as we look at it at a macro level I think there are you know every cycle is different for a variety of reasons There are also things that are not necessarily within our control So for example currency markets can be very different one year to the next We know that the next year is going to represent an additional challenge given where the dollar has moved Commodity markets may be very different from one year to the other There are things that remain relatively similar as we launch new products For example we innovate the products We want to make them better all the time and that typically requires additional cost and so the cost structures of our products new products tend to be higher than the products that they replace Having said that as you know weve got a very very good track record to reduce those cost factors over the lifecycle of the products I think this should give you a bit of color Of course maybe the one thing that I want to point out again as we get into the following year is that of course currency will be an issue Timothy Donald Cook Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah Gene this is Tim Let me talk about the Watch some As you know we made a decision back in September quite several months ago not to disclose the shipments on the Watch and that was not a matter of not being transparent it was a matter of not giving our competition insight thats a product that weve worked really hard on However let me give you some color so to avoid reaching sort of a wrong conclusion If you look at the other products category and look at the revenue in this category it would not be an accurate thing to just look at the sequential change or the year over year change and assume that were the total Watch revenue because the aggregate balance of that category both sequentially and year over year is shrinking Obviously iPod is a part of that but there are other things in there accessories and so forth that are shrinking Secondly to provide a bit more color sales of the Watch did exceed our expectations and they did so despite supply still trailing demand at the end of the quarter And to give you a little additional insight through the end of the quarter in fact the Apple Watch sellthrough was higher than the comparable launch periods of the original iPhone or the original iPad And we were able to do that with having only points of sale And as you probably know as I had reviewed earlier the online sales were so great at the beginning we were not able to feed inventory to our stores until midJune And so those points of sale pretty much the overwhelming majority of the low numbers of sales were not there until the last two weeks of the quarter And so as I look at all of these things we feel really great about how we did Now our objective for the quarter wasnt primarily sales Beyond the very good news on sales were more excited about how the product is positioned for the long term because were starting a new category And as I back up and look at this we have apps Weve already announced the next operating system watchOS It will bring native apps which are going to be killer to the Watch Even though the store layout was delayed weve learned a lot about the buying experience Based on that experience were now planning to expand our channel before the holiday because were convinced that the Watch is going to be one of the top gifts of the holiday season Now most importantly of all of this is that customer sat is off the charts because weve constantly seen if you can get the customer sat off the charts you can wind up doing fairly well over time Weve also learned a lot about managing quite an assortment and so forth And so I sort of back up and look at this and I feel fantastic about what the team has done and delivered and I know I never go anywhere without the Watch and its not because Im the CEO of Apple Im that attached to it and I get lots of notes from a lot of people that feel the same way And so thats how I look at the Watch Nancy Paxton Senior Director Investor Relations and Treasury From Bernstein well hear from Toni Sacconaghi Antonio M Sacconaghi Sanford C Bernstein Co LLC Yes thank you Luca I think in your prepared remarks you talked a little bit about your market share of iPad in the US above being And Im wondering if you think about the iPhone and your market share in the premium category how do you think about it So Ive seen market data that says market share for phones above or you have actually market share for phones above And Im wondering if Tim or Luca you could maybe talk about how you think about your market share where you play given that your ASP is comfortably above What do you think your market share is above or in smartphones And how do we think about that that market share going forward Timothy Donald Cook Chief Executive Officer Director Toni its Tim We look at it a bit differently than you do We look at it as our job is to grow our products regardless of the price which means that we need to convince in some cases people to move from one price band to the other And that we think if we do a great job with the product that people will be willing to spend more because they get so much more out of it And I think you can look at the results on the iPhone and see that in action I mean we grew in China We grew plus in India Emerging markets are growing These numbers are unbelievable and theyre done in an environment where its not the best of conditions So thats how we look at We dont do the MBA analysis of theres only X people buying in a price band and therefore we can only get X minus Y percent Thats not the way weve ever looked at it If we did we wouldnt shipping any products Antonio M Sacconaghi Sanford C Bernstein Co LLC Tim Im asking in part because you talked about the highest ever Android switcher So Im wondering if indeed your goal of expanding the category is happening or whether you are taking share and how do you measure the relative contribution of each of those in your success So is the strength and the dramatically above market growth because youre taking share in that highend category and how far along are you there Or can you point to proof points that youve actually expanded the size of the market for products of your price point Timothy Donald Cook Chief Executive Officer Director Oh I think theres no doubt if you look at it we are expanding the market size in those areas Its also true that theres some people that are switching from comparable price points to the iPhone and thats great too But I think the answer is that both of those things are happening and its key that we do both not just one Antonio M Sacconaghi Sanford C Bernstein Co LLC Okay And then if I could just ask you to comment on how you think about replacement cycles with the current iPhone cycle So when you look at replacement cycles over the last three quarters are they similar to what you saw one and two years ago when you think about replacement And one of the things that also sort of struck me was I think you cited market research having repurchase intention of versus your competitors at Quite frankly the sounds low to me Is that actually consistent with what you see in the marketplace about of iPhone buyers ultimately buy another iPhone So perhaps we can think about replacement cycle Antonio M Sacconaghi Sanford C Bernstein Co LLC And how thats changed and the percentage number and how that jives with reality Timothy Donald Cook Chief Executive Officer Director The also seems low to me but I was quoting a thirdparty source and not our own data Our own data would look better than that But the numbers are only comparable if I quote the thirdparty source for both and so thats what Im doing On the upgrade cycle and what were seeing its not remarkably different However theres a number of plans that people began signing up for in the last year that could change it These are upgrade any time kind of plans They may be one year leases that could actually help the upgrade rate And I think itll be interesting to see how that plays out over the next horizon But generally speaking I see positive vectors there not negative in the aggregate Nancy Paxton Senior Director Investor Relations and Treasury James Dickey Suva Citigroup Global Markets Inc Broker Thank you very much As you look at many of your products have been absolutely fantastic and at different phases of their life theyve seen tremendous high growth whether it is iPad iPhone iPod and iPhone looks like its facing some very challenging comps here in the next few quarters Does this make you shift even more strategic focus into broadening the reliance on a couple products such as you mentioned Apple radio Theres a lot more content on the Apple Watch and apps and then also Apple Pay Are you increasingly focusing on hiring and kind of Or are these kind of more peripheral activities and still the focus is kind of right now on the phone Timothy Donald Cook Chief Executive Officer Director Jim its Tim We think the phone has a lot of legs to it I mean many many many years Theres tons of innovation left at the phone I think were in the early innings of it not in the late innings and I think the market rate of growth over the long haul will also be impressive And so it will be multiple winners here And so thats how I see it In terms of the other things that were doing we have some great capability and great teams in Apple And so we can do more than one thing and so we have other things that were working on as well But at the aggregate level we still remain very focused because if you look at our size versus the number of projects we have going its much smaller compared to most But thats how we do things and thats how we get the level of quality that we want out of each one of those And so the other things that you named whether it be Apple Music or Apple Pay both of these are very important to us And things that you didnt mention the Mac continues to perform very well I am still bullish on iPad Weve gotten with iOS theres some incredible productivity enhancements coming in with split view and slide over and pictureinpicture These things are incredible features The enterprise business is clearly picking up and more and more companies are either contracting for or writing apps themselves I think and I believe that the iPad consumer upgrade cycle will eventually occur because as we look at the usage statistics on iPad it remains unbelievably great I mean the next closest usage of the next competitor were six times greater And so these are extraordinary numbers Its not like people have forgotten iPad or anything Its a fantastic product So I see a lot of runway And as I look geographically where weve been doing really good in the emerging markets our share is still not high in any of them and so theres a lot of headroom there as well as there is in most developed markets as well And so I look around I see opportunity left and right And thats what were focused on Nancy Paxton Senior Director Investor Relations and Treasury Steven M Milunovich UBS Securities LLC Thank you Tim theres some concern about whats going on in China with the stock market and economically How do you think that plays out for Apple On one hand youve got more stores broader distribution the G infrastructure is playing out On the other hand the economy might be weakening Is a phone a discretionary purchase or not How do you think about going forward in China Timothy Donald Cook Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah its a very good question and we remain extremely bullish on China and were continuing to invest Nothing thats happened has changed our fundamental view that China will be Apples largest market at some point in the future Its true as you point out that the equity markets have recently been volatile This could create some speed bumps in the near term But to put it in context which I think is important despite that volatility in the Chinese market theyre still up over the last year and theyre up yeartodate and so these kind of numbers are numbers I think all of us would love Also the stock market participation among Chinese household is fairly narrow And the stock ownership is very concentrated in a few people who put what appears to be a smaller portion of their wealth in the market than we might And so I think generally this has been at least as we see it maybe its not true for other businesses that this worry is probably overstated And so were not changing anything We have the pedal to the metal on getting to stores mid next year As we had talked about before were continuing to expand the indirect channel as well As you point out and I think this is a major point that many people miss the LTE penetration in China is only at And China doesnt possess the level of fiber that some other countries do and so in order to get the great video performance et cetera raising that penetration is really great I think that really plays to an incredible smartphone future there Also and I cant underestimate I cant overstate this The rise of the middle class there is continuing and it is transforming China McKinsey I saw a recent study from McKinsey thats projecting the upper middle class to grow from to of households over the tenyear period from to So were within that period at this moment and you can see for all of us that travel there so much with every trip you can see this occurring And so I think we would be foolish to change our plans I think China is a fantastic geography with an incredible unprecedented level of opportunity there And were going to be there Steven M Milunovich UBS Securities LLC I also wanted to ask can you give us any more detail on the switching rate how much is it up And I noticed in your advertising theres the shift to the if its not an iPhone its not an iPhone And I assume that while youre not as involved as Jobs was youre approving these ads So it seems like youre really focused on market share gain right now Timothy Donald Cook Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah Im very familiar with the ads In certain geographies the way that we win is to get switchers In other geographies the way that we win is to get people to buy their first smartphone In other geographies the way that we win is to get people to upgrade from their current iPhone And all of those are very important for us In many geographies its two of those or in some geographies its all three of those And so all of those are important We are very focused on growing iPhone around the world not just in one geography and getting our message out there through ads is one way to do that Nancy Paxton Senior Director Investor Relations and Treasury Shannon S Cross Cross Research LLC Thank you very much I wanted to talk about FX but not necessarily from a direct impact But what are you seeing in terms of demand as youve raised prices in various geographies and how are you thinking about it as you go into sort of the next iPhone cycle in terms of having to sort of normalize the pricing for what some of the currencies have done over the past year Luca Maestri Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes Shannon So obviously FX has been a significant hit in many ways of course I mean it reduces our growth rate We would be basis points higher this quarter from the that weve reported if it wasnt for the movement in currencies around the world And really when you look around the world its really if you exclude China essentially every single currency has weakened against the dollar We are pretty careful and thoughtful about where we increase prices and when and by how much during midcycle because its not something that we particularly like to do Weve had circumstances around the world this year where frankly we didnt have many options because the currency movement was so large and so weve had to reprice I have to say that its been remarkable Look in the long run a strong US dollar is not a positive for our international business Its normal to see a drop in demand when prices go up That goes without saying It has been remarkable so far to see that we did take prices in a few markets But really remarkable to see how resilient iPhone sales have been because we have increased in spite of these price increases weve increased sales and weve increased market share in all our geographies around the world without exception Shannon S Cross Cross Research LLC Great And then can you talk a bit about linearity during the quarter on a geographic basis Somewhat going back to the China question I mean did you see it slow down toward the end of the quarter Or was it solid through it And just any other color you can give geographically with Europe and some of the other macro events that are going on Timothy Donald Cook Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah Shannon its Tim Maybe the best way to talk about this is sort of at the product level On the Watch our June sales were higher than April or May I realize thats very different than what some of the is being written but the June sales were the highest And so the Watch had a more of a backended kind of a skewing The phone itself followed what I would call a normal seasonal kind of pattern And if you look at the it sounds like youre honing in on the Greater China results themselves There is no obvious impact from the last quarter in the Greater China numbers And obviously with the aggregate or the consolidated number being its hard to find a lot of bad things in the numbers Nancy Paxton Senior Director Investor Relations and Treasury A replay of todays call will be
