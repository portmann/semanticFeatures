I would agree with that logic.Netflix is acting as the first mover, entering new markets while its competitors are for the most part acting more defensively just to protect their own existing market.The advantage stays with the offensive side, so Netflix will have the momentum to grow earnings.As for this next earnings report, if Netflix sells off, wait for the dust to settle, and pick up the stock at a cheaper price.Source: Netflix Keeps Pushing Ahead With International Efforts Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
