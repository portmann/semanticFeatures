Apple share repurchase have a huge impact on per share metrics and reward investors in down years Apple NASDAQ AAPL reported first quarter earnings last week and the results were impressive Still the companys shares are down six percent right now Ill lay out in this article that this provides an excellent entry point into Apples stock Apple also boosted its shareholder return program the dividend is increased by to the share repurchase authorization was increased by billion to billion This equals a total amount of billion a truly impressive number by itself Apple has been generous with its shareholders over the last few years Over just the last two years the amount of shares outstanding decreased ten percent whilst the dividend was increased over the same time With Apples huge remaining stock buyback authorization investors can count on further steep share count declines and dividend increases in the low double digits Apples share count reduction affects the companys per share metrics such as earnings per share free cash flow per share revenue per share and ultimately increases the amount Apple can pay out as dividends per each share The actual effect on these metrics is often underestimated mainly due to the effect that most analysts and also finance information websites calculate a companys earnings per share wrongly The often used way to derive the trailing earnings per share is to add up the companys reported earnings per share for the last four quarters In Apples case this equals This is also the number publicized by most websites such as finviz The correct way of determining a companys earnings per share and thus the correct way of determining one shares worth is to add up the net income of the last four quarters and to divide the sum by the number of shares outstanding in the most recent quarter B B B B B shares per share This means that Apples past earnings per share are actually higher than most investors think Apples trailing PE ratio is thus a hefty discount to the broad market which is valued at a trailing PE ratio of Is this discount justified I dont think so Note Year includes Q Q and Q of and Q of etc As you can see Apples revenues grew each year by and for a cumulative growth of At the same time the reduced share count led to revenue per share increases of and for a cumulative growth of As you can see net income declined slightly from to down five percent but earnings per share grew two percent over those twelve months The result of the companys share repurchases In theory assuming an unchanged multiple the companys worth declined over that time but the worth of each Apple share an investor holds has gone up over the same time From to the companys net earnings grew earnings per share grew This equals a twoyear cumulative net earnings growth of and earnings per share growth of an impressive surplus generated by Apples share repurchases Cash from operations declined slightly from to down two percent and grew immensely over the next twelve months up This equals a cumulative twoyear growth of At the same time cash flow per share grew and for a cumulative twoyear growth of As you can see the companys share repurchases led to growing operating cash flow per share even through a down year allowing investors to see their investment become more valuable even when the company needed a breather on its growth streak We can see that Apples share repurchases had an immense effect on the companys per share metrics This per share growth led to a growing worth note not price of each share and thus also to a growing worth of a total investment unless an investor sold or bought shares in the meantime Since the process stays the same we know that Apples future share repurchases will have the same effect Apple retires shares the revenue net income and cash flow that are generated by Apple are distributed over a lower total share count and the result per share keeps growing As we could see in the past share repurchases are able to push per share metrics even in times of stagnant operational results With Apples huge current share repurchase authorization I count on ongoing substantial outperformance of per share metrics vs fundamental results which should be pretty good anyways Another fact investors should consider is that Apples share repurchases work as downward protection for the stock price in the near and medium term Apples management will up the pace of share repurchases on days or weeks where the companys stock price is down thus creating additional demand for Apples shares and laying a floor at a certain level This stabilizes Apples share price and should make the stock less volatile in a broader market correction In addition to the huge effect of Apples share repurchases a lot of factors speak for ongoing organic growth Apple should be able to grow revenues and net income by a huge margin over the next two quarters because the iPhone Plus is sold in way higher numbers than the previous models and it has a higher average selling price Apples wearable hasnt started appearing on the companys reported top and bottom line so far but will do so in the upcoming quarters Apples China results have been on a high growth trajectory in the last quarters a trend that will likely continue With growing adoption in the US and upcoming introduction in foreign markets Apple Pay is poised to grow over the next years Apples pipeline and future products eg a car should be able to contribute to the companys success in the future I also want to address something I have read in some articles here on Seeking Alpha recently a claim that Apples cash pile was a problem due to the fact that most of it is hoarded overseas and cant be used for shareholder returns Although the statement itself is correct B of its B is overseas this is not a problem for the company due to three reasons Overseas cash can be used for acquisitions in foreign countries think Microsofts Mojang acquisition for billion which will ultimately benefit shareholders overseas cash can be used for capex in foreign countries Apple store openings in China come to mind and lastly Apple can easily borrow US cash at a very low rate where the companys overseas cash reserves work as a risk reduction for the lender In the past quarters Apple has increasingly done this borrow against its overseas cash to have ample US cash it can use for shareholder returns At the end of Apple has issued debt notes nominated in for the first time this does make sense for two reasons The second one is a little more complicated By issuing bonds Apple gets access to Euros which are then converted to dollars which the company uses to fund buybacks and dividends When Apple has to pay back its bond it has to pay it back in Euros Apple thus will likely have to convert its dollar holdings to Euros This is especially intriguing in one case When the Euro fallsthe dollar rises Lets look at an example Apple floats a billion Euro bond five years gets five billion Euros and converts those to dollars billion at todays exchange rate If the Euro falls and in when Apple has to pay back said bond the rate is Apple has to pay just billion to get access to billion Euros which are then used to pay back the bond When the Euro falls against the Dollar Apple thus makes more money by borrowing Many analysts see the Euro heading to parity with the dollar in the future eg <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Bank of America In this scenario which seems likely Apples borrowing against its overseas cash position thus isnt a problem but rather something the company can actually benefit from Apples share repurchases allow the company to boost per share metrics even in years when fundamental growth is sluggish and as long as Apple keeps returning huge amounts of its cash to shareholders this is something investors can count on The fact that the majority of Apples cash is located overseas isnt a huge problem because it can be used for overseas acquisitions overseas capex and Apple can easily borrow against that money By borrowing Euros which Apple started doing recently the company can benefit from a falling Euro Source What Apples Buybacks Mean For Investors Disclosure The author is long AAPL MoreThe author wrote this article themselves and it expresses
