Tharakan A Yahoo logo is pictured in front of a building in Rolle km miles east of Geneva in this file picture taken December SAN FRANCISCOBENGALURU Yahoo Inc YHOOO shelved plans to spin off its stake in Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABAN on Wednesday under pressure from activist investors worried about billions of dollars in taxes and said instead it is looking at creating a separate company to hold the rest of its assets The move following three days of board deliberations last week is an explicit rejection of Chief Executive Marissa Mayers plan to spin off the Alibaba stake and may cloud her focus on reviving its core business of selling ads on its popular news and sports websites The company overtaken by Google Facebook and others since pioneering the commercial web in the s said it had no plans to sell its core business as some investors had hoped but the move effectively invites offers for the new entity There is no determination by the board to sell the company or any part of it said Yahoo Chairman Maynard Webb on a call with investors We believe that the business remains very undervalued and we are focussed on realizing and unlocking that value Shares of Yahoo which will remain publicly traded were down percent at on Nasdaq as investors digested the complexity of the socalled reverse spinoff The new publicly traded company will house Yahoos Internet business and its percent stake in Yahoo Japan T worth about billion at current exchange rates Its Alibaba stake worth more than billion accounts for the bulk of Yahoos current market value of billion But the creation of a new entity which Yahoo said would take a year or more to conclude will likely take Mayers focus away from turning around the Internet business Mayer had planned to use the proceeds from the sale of the Alibaba stake to expand the companys mobile video and social media offerings Pursuing another version of the spinoff is just another excuse for the board of Yahoo to not concentrate on reviving its core business said Brian Quinn a professor at Boston College Law School They Yahoo strike me as too distracted by financial engineering Mayers efforts have so far had little tangible effect Revenue has fallen slightly since she took the helm in mid and its share of US web searches is essentially flat with three years ago making up no ground on market leader Google The challenges the Internet businesses face will not change because of a sale said Murali Sankar an analyst at Boenning Scattergood Given the size and assets I think a sale is less likely but could create tax efficiencies for the buyer if they wanted to divest certain assets Yahoo had intended to spin off its Alibaba stake by January but investors lacking assurance from the US Internal Revenue Service were worried that a spinoff could cost them billions in taxes Given that the new entity would be of a lower value than the Alibaba stake that would limit the tax liability if the transaction deal was not permitted to be taxfree analysts said In a worstcase scenario it caps the risk of a tax bill to billion from billion in the earlier plan to spin off the Alibaba stake Sterne Agee CRT analysts wrote in a note Yahoo executives said on a conference call they still believed the original spinoff would have been taxfree but the spectre of a big tax bill had unnerved investors depressing the companys stock price The new plan will require Yahoo to win the consent of a large cast of players including regulators shareholders bondholders business partners and others too many to name Chief Financial Officer Ken <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>said on the call Yahoo has struggled to grow its Internet business which includes selling search and display ads on its news and sports sites and email service in the face of competition from Alphabet Incs GOOGLO Google and Facebook Inc FBO But Yahoocom still ranks fifth in terms of daily visits according to monitoring firm Alexa and this could make it an attractive target for a telecom carrier or private equity ATT Inc TN and Verizon Communications Inc VZN could be possible buyers for the Internet business FBR said Verizon said on Monday it could look at buying Yahoos core business if it was a strategic fit CBS CBSN President and CEO Leslie Moonves said that the media company would not pursue Yahoo speaking at an event earlier this month Yahoos plan to spin off its stake in Alibaba hit a hurdle in September when the IRS denied the companys request for a ruling on whether the transaction would be taxfree potentially costing shareholders billions in taxes Activist investor Starboard Value LP asked the company in November to drop its plans and sell its core search and display ad businesses instead Starboard had previously supported the spinoff Yahoo also announced that Max Levchin cofounder of PayPal Holdings Inc was resigning from the board because of the demands on his time not due to any disagreement with Yahoo on any matter related to Yahoos operations policies or practices Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee and Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru Deborah M Todd in San Francisco and
