often oversold and undervalued even in times of good performance and steady dividend growth Cash flow analysis estimates a fair value of Opinion analysis estimates an average price target of Intel NASDAQ INTC is without any doubt one of the worlds leaders in computing innovation since its inception in The company has verified time and again that it has capable management complemented by a continued drive to innovate and preserve its position as a major market player however often the market differs with this judgment The company endured the financial crisis with hardly a scratch with revenue down only in Investors chastised the firm and the stock lost nearly Since the corporation had an accumulated stock price appreciation of a very stumpy total bearing in mind that revenues increased nearly and dividends increased by nearly After the latest quarterly revenueprofit warning the stock lost further value and is now down almost in the months horizon There is merit behind this First of all the Skylake processor the successor to the Broadwell is likely behind schedule According to commentary from Cowens Timothy Adams the Skylake timing remains at risk which Arcuri claims is backed by his companys work in Asia If the processor fails to launch in time vendors will be forced to sell last years computer designs and the few models which use the Broadwell processor This ultimately reduces the attractiveness of upgrading a situation in which both Intel and the PC vendors loose The next generation nanometer technology which was expected to launch is also brought into question In an interview from December th with EE Times Intel Senior Fellow Mark Bohr alleged the company does not expect to run into the issues that plagued nanometer a launch delay at nanometer however the company has been extremely quiet concerning the launch timeline This led to a sharp decline which triggered our algorithm designed to identify anomalies in markets When prices fall below the algorithms fair value it alerts the investor of upward pressure on the stock Intel reached number one among its parallel mega cap stocks This indicates that its presentday price is currently the furthest away from its fair valuation comparative to all other mega cap stocks in our predictive universe We made an independent fundamental analysis to control whether the financial balances and projected gains come to an agreement with the algorithm and our results found Intel somewhat undervalued Intel is worth no less than a share according to our analysis bellow is our support for that statement In order to understand the future cash flows we divide the analysis into various value adding segments The more established processors and chipsets are divided into servers desktops and notebooks We then analyze the small segments with large growth potential such as mobile and the internet of things which can become a major revenue source in the future Finally based on all estimations we establish a fair price valuation of a share based on diluted EPS of and PE ratio of Server Processors Net Income Projection Billion Server Processors are currently Intels flagship market With an overwhelming dominance in the company has certainly done a good job in comparison to the level of We expect server prices to gradually increase towards the mark by In we estimate prices will reach an average of which will account for b in net income up from th b This is with the underlying assumption that global server shipments continue to grow at an annual rate of as they did in and Finally it also assumes that Intel will lose no more than of their market share in but will ultimately reach equilibrium at by We furthermore take into account that the EBITDA margin will drop by about this year as competition increases to a level of Notebook Processors Net Income Projection Billion While notebook processors have larger revenues their profit margin is slightly lower than servers The average price in was however this figure is estimated to progressively decrease with the lower projected demand in upcoming years We estimate that global shipments will see little to no growth and remain around th level of m If Intel is able to sustain their market share in it will render into b in notebook microprocessor revenues Because notebook demand is expected to grow slower than smartphone tablets in western economies but at the same time experience growth in emerging markets the two will likely cancel each other out in terms of value To remain conservative we reduce the margin from to and remain at that level for the next several years This will put the operating expenses at b for resulting in a net income of b Desktop Processors Net Income Projection Billion Global desktop shipments are down in from m in to m just one year later We expect a further drop this year and estimate that shipments will decline to around m If Intel is able to maintain the average price level at around and market share at then revenues from desktops will be b This is supported by the natural transition of consumer preference for notebook computers over desktops The more the performance and pricing gap narrows the more attractive notebooks become over desktops Notebook and desktop margins are nearly identical if we retain our assumption that EBITDA will reach it sums to a total operating expenses for desktop processors of b for a net income of b in PC and Server Chipsets Net Income Projection Billion For those who dont know the chipset is a set of electronic components which manage the processor memory and peripherals As a rule a motherboard which has an Intel processor will use an Intel chipset as well The market is expected to have steady stable growth in the next several years We expect revenues to grow by about from and reach revenues of b and a net profit of b assuming a net margin of Chipset demand growth is strong and expected to be a major revenue driver in the next few years We believe this year could see growth as high as resulting in an estimated b in revenues from server chipsets The margin for server chipsets is expected to follow closely with that of processors and thus we estimate EBITDA margin to be as well in The result will be a net income of B in server chipsets and a total of B for both PC and server combined One of the most exciting and modern ideas of our decade is the internet of things NYSEMKT IOT It refers to a network of physical objects that have electronic software and sensors embedded in them to enable them to connect with other devices or the manufacturer This connectivity can drastically increase the capabilities of these physical objects and represents the merger of the physical world and the internet a market with nearly endless potential This will have huge implication in boundless fields such as manufacturing energy management healthcare transportations and much more The internet of things is without a doubt the largest growth sector Intel could tap into and we expect revenues to grow by in and by As a relatively new market the operating margin should also increase as the company becomes more efficient however assuming a margin of in this sector alone will account for b in net revenue The mobile market offers potential as well but will unlikely be a very profitable in While the company tries to establish its foothold it will likely break even in In the long term mobile market offers much potential and should definitely be a major target of Intel The net income from all other operations should account for another B Finally Intel will increase net income by an estimated million from equity gains and interest income generated in Intel Corporation currently holds buy overweight holds underweight and sells for an overall bullish projection marketwatchcom Yahoo Finance currently has no opinions however last month was mainly bullish Nasdaqcom marks the stock as a buy with strong buy opinions holds underperform and sell recommendations In contradiction <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs analyst James Covello has Intels target price at and believes the stock is lagging fundamentals and expensive valuation Figure Opinions of analysts Source The market forecast Algorithm at I Know First affirms this bullish outlook for Intel I Know First says Intel has one of the strongest Buy signals for the days and days horizon The positive and algorithmic signal say Intel is currently undervalued By combining the price targets of analysts alongside the fundamental analysis we are able to plot rough estimated for Figure Projected scenarios using fundamental and opinion analysis Our analysis indicated Intel has a probability of crossing the mark which represents a appreciation Our most likely bullish scenario is a price target in the range of with a low end scenario breaking even at current price levels Finally our bearish low scenario indicates a maximum downside of which has a probability Using these values we can generate a present value estimation of the investment Our calculation estimated Intel will yield a return of in months before dividend payments Intel certainly qualifies as an attractive long term investment if you are searching for the right dividend stock It has a very high market share and EBITDA margin in the server processors and chipset segment Intel furthermore is well aware of the shifting trend from desktop to notebook it is well positioned to capitalize on this trend or at least if anything make up the losses from desktops in notebooks Intel will also gradually get more exposure into mobile markets as they have begun doing this year by integrating the bit Atom Z in ASUSTek OTC ASUUY ZenFone Finally the huge growth potential of the internet of things could be a major revenue growth segment in the future Business relationship disclosure I Know First Research is the analytic branch
