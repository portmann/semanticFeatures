Tell me you wouldn't make that trade?As an average, the Dow Jones is like the New York Yankees and the NASDAQ like the Kansas City Royals.The Dow buys high because it wants to win now, baby, while the Royals nurture the farm system and let some big stars go.(It's just a coincidence sports analogies work here - think the Knicks and Warriors, the Cowboys and Seahawks, or Arsenal and Southampton in England's Premier League.)You get more bang for your buck with the "tech heavy NASDAQ" in part because of the law of numbers.Small numbers are easier to grow than big ones.Fireeye (NASDAQ: FEYE ) has more room to grow than Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This makes it more volatile, but the volatility is usually pointed up. (Uncertainty) </span>You also get more bang from the NASDAQ because of the nature of the economy.It really does make sense, as Mark Twain said, for companies to put all their eggs in one basket and watch that basket.Innovation comes from close attention to one thing, and the greatest growth comes when you're selling to the early adopters of something, not those buying replacements.Since Apple joined the Dow on March 6 the shares are down 2.4%.This has happened, as Apple fans know, despite it being a screaming bargain.The current Price/Earnings multiple is 15.5, and you get a 52 cent dividend yielding 1.66% to boot.Apple's top line continues to grow - 7% for the most recent fiscal year, and it's on pace to crush the comparison again, with sales for the first two quarters of $130 billion and sales for all of fiscal 2014 of $182 billion.What's going on?It's the expectations game.People just aren't buying Apple for big gains anymore.They're buying it for steady progress.They're buying it and they're holding it and, here at Seeking Alpha, we don't even talk about it as much anymore.That's not the fault of Apple management.It's the law of numbers, the expectations we have for Dow stocks, and the limits on bigness imposed by an innovation economy.I would much rather invest in such an economy, wouldn't you?If I'm looking to make big money, I don't head for the comfy chair, for the fat guys lighting their cigars with $100 bills.I head for the work bench, and the young hotshots with fire in their eyes.I just don't fall in love with that fire.When the earthquake comes it's going to hit those on the shakier foundations harder.Source: The Dow Divergence Is A Good Thing Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
