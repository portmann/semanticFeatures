After all, higher interest rates are already going to increase the amount that McDonald's owes to creditors, and if forced to raise more debt, it will be tough to imagine the company's balance sheet becoming strong once more, or its stock for that matter.All things considered, it is hard for me to imagine that any of these companies increase in market valuation once interest rates rise.Not only does each company have legitimate questions surrounding their respective businesses, but all have large debt loads and are likely to need additional debt to address these noted questions.With an interest rate hike being imminent, I see no reason to own any of these stocks now or later.Disclosure: I am/we are long T.
