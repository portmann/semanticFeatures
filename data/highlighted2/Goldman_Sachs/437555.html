index rose as high as last week an elevated level and up dramatically from around earlier in the month The dollar was a little weaker on Friday but had been rising against both the euro and pound earlier in the week By Scott Connor of the Trader Education group at TD Ameritrade managing Swim Lessons trader educational programming Thursdays British Brexit vote on whether to exit the European Union is likely to remain a dominant force in the markets the next few days The referendum this Thursday has taken on huge importance all around the world and some see it as a choice not just on Britains EU membership but on globalization in general If Britain decides against economic union with Europe does that mean the world is entering a new era where the pace of international trade comes into question Theres been a backlash against trade agreements on both the left and right in the US during the current election season so globalization concerns arent just a British matter Polls late last week indicated more chances of a British exit from the EU though campaigning on both sides halted after the murder on Thursday of a British lawmaker That tragic event seemed to ease market volatility briefly but any further polls in the coming days hinting at a British exit likely would be seen as bearish for the markets and could cause further pressure With that in mind its important to watch volatility in the days leading up to the referendum The closelywatched VIX index which tracks market volatility and is often called the fear gauge rose as high as last week an elevated level and up dramatically from around earlier in the month Volatility could continue to rise into Brexit kind of the way volatility for a single stock often rises going into an earnings release When theres more volatility theres more choppiness and uncertainty in the market and events that normally would be taken in stride get amplified That means theres a possibility of sharp up and down moves as seen late last week Once Brexit takes place whichever way the vote goes there could be a tremendous drop in volatility with the uncertainty out of the way Another area to watch is foreign exchange or forex trading The dollar was a little weaker on Friday but had been rising against both the euro and pound earlier in the week A key support level for the pound is seen at the level And keep an eye on gold as well When gold rose to a week high at around last week it appeared to be building in the possibility of a yes vote on Brexit From a US data standpoint the coming week looks pretty light with existing home sales Wednesday and new home sales Thursday the key events The US real estate market has been a bright spot recently and these data represent another chance to help decipher if the surprisingly anemic May jobs number was an outlier or part of a more extended weak trend in the economy The oil market rallied sharply early Friday after slumping for several days Like other markets the focus in oil is expected to be on Brexit until Thursdays vote Figure Watching Support at The SP SPX plotted here through midday Friday on the TD Ameritrade thinkorswim platform has bounced off of support at three times this year and that level continues to represent an important support point Sometimes a strong finish can translate into strength the next day Source Standard Poors For illustrative purposes only Past performance does not guarantee future results Looking for Support For those who watch technical indicators a key support level for the SP Index SPX appears to sit at the level The SPX has bounced off three times since March and could weaken technically if it closes below that level Late last week the SPX came within knocking distance of going down to the area Going into this coming week could be a level that a lot of people are watching No Apple Polishing in China Apple NASDAQ AAPL shares took a dive Friday after an administrative order issued in Beijing charged the company with violating a smaller Chinese competitors intellectual property with its iPhone and iPhone Plus Apple appealed the order allowing its iPhones to stay on the market in China for now at least But there could be longterm negative ramifications for Apple according to one expert Id be very surprised in five years time if we see Apple having the kind of access to the Chinese consumer that they presently enjoy said Ian Bremmer president of Eurasia Group a political risk research and consulting firm in an interview with CNBC Apple already was under pressure in China with sales in greater China falling to billion in the companys Q from nearly billion a year earlier At the time Apple blamed the weakness on falling sales of the iPhone in China as well as the strong dollar Greater China represents a huge market for Apple with of the companys total net sales occurring there So any danger to Apple in China could mean danger to the company as a whole Shares of Apple were down by midday Friday at nearly onemonth lows Brexit Worries Could Hit Big Banks The US financial sector could be one to watch this coming week as the Brexit vote approaches A number of large US
