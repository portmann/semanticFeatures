class='textDiv'>Apple And Icahn Pillars Of Growth Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Carl Icahn says Apple is worth per share The recent open letter from Carl Icahn proposing that Apple NASDAQ AAPL stock is currently worth per share has been well publicized One reason he gives for his valuation is that the prospect of Apple entering the automotive market with a new car shows that Apple is still a major growth company I will examine the evidence for this in this post but first a look at the overall thrust of Icahns proposal I agree with Mr Icahn that Apple stock is severely undervalued but I disagree with several of his premises and think we need real caution following his assumptions The basis for Icahns assessment is stated To arrive at the value of per share we forecast FY EPS of excluding net interest income apply a PE multiple of x and then add of net cash per share The obvious heads up here is the estimated FY EPS of The current analyst average estimate is only But lets look at the data from Yahoo Finance The current estimate is up more than in the last days and there have been upgrades to the figure in the last days alone If this trend were to continue then by the end of next fiscal year would be conservative Additionally it is not so much above the current high estimate of The second point of contention here would be Icahns recommended PE ratio of x plus adding in cash Todays PE TTM as reported by Yahoo is just and that makes no account for cash The x cash figure is a very significant appreciation over current levels Of course this is what Icahn is arguing the real value is and part of that is what he believes the real multiple should be When we compare Apples PE ratio to that of the SP index we find that the market continues to value Apple at a significantly discounted multiple of only x compared to x for the SP awarding the SP with a premium valuation to Apple Aside from slight inconsistencies he does not adjust SP shares for net cash per share this is a very reasonable argument It has long been frustrating to investors that the market seems to totally ignore Apples enormous net cash position On April Apples CEO Tim Cook reported We ended the quarter with billion in cash plus marketable securities a sequential increase of billion Thus Apple has almost billion in cash and securities which is an extraordinary amount Yet it also must be noted that Cook continued over billion of this cash was offshore Any repatriation of this portion would be subject to large taxes Therefore effectively it is a lot less But theres yet another more disturbing issue with Icahns justification for the x multiple This is his reliance on future growth to bolster his suggested valuation Icahn sees great growth prospects ahead for Apple It should be remembered here that this is a major part of his premise First he sees continued growth for the current iOSOSX ecosystem including the iPhone Apple Watch Mac and even iPad He sees iPhone growth rates slowing somewhat but continuing nonetheless While there this is open to debate its a reasonable position We believe Apple Watch Apple Pay Homekit Healthkit Beats Music and further innovation in existing product lines collectively represent a tremendous opportunity that on their own justify a valuation that at the very least reflects a market multiple the companys aggressive increases in RD spending and some of the more wellsupported rumors have bolstered our confidence that Apple will enter two new product categories television and cars Combined these two new markets represent trillion three times the size of Apples existing markets if we exclude Apple Watch It should be noted that Apple as is the norm has never acknowledged the existence of either a television or an automobile research project However the Wall Street Journal recently reported But after nearly a decade of research Apple quietly shelved plans to make such a set more than a year ago according to people familiar with the matter Ultimately though Apple executives didnt consider any of those features that it was investigating compelling enough to enter the highly competitive television market I have long been skeptical of any entry into this market The competition is such that even if you begin with high margins for breakthrough technology competition will bring them down in just a few years This is not Apples type of industry It appears however that they did indeed investigate it heavily undoubtedly pouring tens of millions of dollars or more into it So why did we not know of the investments Because Apple does not announce vaporware So the television program clearly has been dropped at least as far as a physical screen product There are however plenty of rumors that Apple is preparing a new streaming service that will provide over the top programming Apple has reportedly been working to make deals with a variety of content providers including the major networks A streaming service would bypass a users current cable network and provide programming on a more flexible basis as is now possible with the new HBO Now service Such a service could be very profitable and drive further revenue and earnings growth without the need for the capital and RD expenses of providing physical products An announcement of this service is expected at Apples June World Wide Developers Conference Also expected is a new version of the current settop box the Apple TV The reason that we have never officially heard of an Apple television is that Apple announces a product when it is at least reasonably close to shipping Operating system software is earlier as developers typically need to work with it The same can be applied to the current rumor du jour the Apple Car The Wall Street Journal reported in February The Cupertino Calif company has several hundred employees working secretly toward creating an Applebranded electric vehicle according to people familiar with the matter The project codenamed Titan But this is still only according to people familiar with the matter Should we put any credence in this In a research note A disruptive new era of the Automotive Age <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs wrote Our technology hardware analyst Bill Shope believes it is still unclear whether Apple intends a fullfledged entry into auto production and autos are just one of several new business projects it is considering However we see potential for Apple to leverage its strengths in areas such as electric vehicles autonomous driving and incar apps We see a need to assess Apples ability to roll out an auto business from various perspectives for example will it make vehicles itself will it focus on the highend market to start with and could it team up with established auto makers to sell vehicles To me theres very tangible evidence to the claim in the form of a list of project hires that has been compiled by to Mac in a post Revealed The experts Apple hired to build an electric car I have extracted from that post the following list with partial descriptions of earlier work or area of expertise Readers should refer to the original article for other group members and more details on the individuals What impresses me here is the wide range of skills I have no idea why Apple would reportedly hire several experts in various aspects of drive train engineering if it was not working on building a car The other areas could conceivably be used if one were only designing some interface or operating system but once you get into drive trains it seems to me you are in for the whole thing Thus it seems highly likely that the Apple Car rumors are true that is that Apple is working on it The caveat here is that while Apple is most likely working on a car this is not to say that they will produce one As the Apple Television project illustrates Apple does not produce something just because they spent time working on it On the other hand this project is assuredly the most expensive Apple has ever started and I would imagine that there will be a lot more pressure to see it through to fruition although it will be or later before we see tangible product information Icahn notes the huge size of the automotive market At trillion the enormous addressable market for new cars is approximately four times the size of the smartphone market All this is an important point for the investor as it provides the rationale for Icahns x cash valuation That is Apple is still a growth company However as Henry Blodget notes margins in the auto business are notoriously low compared to Apples and if Apple were to spawn a business equivalent to that of Porsche which has one of the highest margins then it would only increase its bottom line by billion just Eric Jackson at Forbes counterattacks that Blodget does not account for Apples ability to innovate He may be right here To my mind I cannot see Apple entering a market without a disruptive technology plan So what might this disruptive force be The clear assumption is that any Apple Car would be electric In this category the two largest issues at this time are cost and batteries Batteries both increase the cost as they are very expensive and provide the limit for the distance a car can go on a single charge Since recharging takes time the effective travel radius is determined by battery capacity Heres an area in which Apple already has expertise The company shares the desire for powerful light weight batteries for its mobile products and it holds some patents in the area Recently it was sued by A Systems for poaching employees While the suit has been settled the question remains as to precisely the nature of the work done by the top echelon battery engineers Overall I agree with the excellent detailed post by Bob Ciura that Icahns estimate is a bit high although for different reasons Carl Icahn offers some compelling reasons for Apple shares to be valued today at One of the driving forces Icahn details is the future move into television and automotive markets It is disturbing that neither of these can really be counted upon definitively The first program clearly has been dropped at least as far as a physical screen product While current rumors suggest a new streaming service that could be very profitable and drive further revenue and earnings growth the potential here is unknown and this is not the same as the new product category that Icahn touts so strongly So for a physical new product now the Apple Car alone is relied upon for future growth If Apple is considering entry into the automotive market then management must feel that they have a real disruptive potential Apple does not enter a market if it does not Apple retains especially high margins only because its products are perceived as having a special innovative edge over those of the competition In such a complex industry there would need to be disruptive technologies in several areas if Apple is to make a significant incursion Therefore the research group is likely investigating many areas My guess is that one of these is manufacturing techniques If Apple can radically cut assembly cost then it can either lower the cost or drive a higher margin Clearly the investor should believe in the existence and momentum of an automobile research program Theres too much evidence for it to doubt its existence However we should also view its outcome as a great uncertainty at this point in time Until Apple announces a product we should treat it as vaporware Carl Icahn builds his argument for a share value on three pillars The first is inherent current value The next two are future growth due to an Apple big screen television and eventually an Apple Car With the collapse of Icahns argument for the future television and the Apple Car just a tentative possibility we need to reevaluate his numbers Still the basic concept of his evaluation holds true Icahns case remains strong just not quite as strong I believe that if we reduce future expectations just a bit then we would still arrive at a fair value of around Source Apple And Icahn
