Singer - <b>Goldman</b> Sachs & Co. . That's great.And shifting to the Eagle Ford and then I had a follow-up on one of the earlier questions.You have this push versus pull, budget versus deficiencies, is there a minimum level of completion cadence that you see as needed per quarter in the Eagle Ford to retain a minimum level of efficiencies and should we expect that production to decline?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Roger W. Jenkins - President & Chief Executive Officer Well, I mean, obviously, if you go – to answer your question, I'll say you need to keep two rigs running, and if you have to drill wells and that probably lead to one frac spread and you can always pick up other ones as needed. (Uncertainty) </span>We're not a company with a lot of drilled uncompleted wells.I think we only have 30.I'm not a guy that build up hundreds of those things.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I don't believe that's appropriate thing to do with capital. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And so, with that said, I mean, obviously, we'd have production decline, Brian, if you go from 8 to 6 to 4 to 2, there would have to be a decline, which is as your firm speaks about often, which should lead to – which I guess your firm doesn't believe, but it would lead to an oil price recovery, I would hope. (Uncertainty) </span>And our final question comes from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Roger W. Jenkins - President & Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I hope you're well. (Uncertainty) </span>Roger, I just had a couple of – you've been through several permutations of the options and you've talked about transformational deeper resource inventory than you get credit for, et cetera, et cetera, I just had two questions for you.One was to be considered a merger of equals with someone else, is it transformational deal; and the second is, would there be the potential for you just to take Murphy private?Thanks.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Roger W. Jenkins - President & Chief Executive Officer Well, I mean, those are unusual complex questions, Paul. (Uncertainty) </span>That the complete Board of Directors of Murphy, in which I am one, we have not, in my view, if you look at my desk today piled with papers.I do not have a merger document there, nor a going private document.So, my focus is to – it's real hard with these big price collapses.We had a very difficult budget last year coming from a tough one again this year, make him stand about trying to get to cash flow CapEx parity and going from there is my focus today over mergers in that effect, that will always be available to any publicly traded company of course, but it's not a focus I have today to be honest.I understand.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And so, the clear frustration you've got is that the share price is low and the multiple is so low. (Surprise) </span>How do we change that?Roger W. Jenkins - President & Chief Executive Officer What would change that by continuing to – when you're in – when you get back to cash flow of CapEx parity and do that first and continuing to focus on cost, you can only go so far with that, but we're going keep working on those two matters, and we do have singles and doubles here that we've been hitting.Roger W. Jenkins - President & Chief Executive Officer (01:00:09) I think we're back doing that again.It's pretty big gross type resource we're touching this quarter, Dalmatian, 10 million (01:00:17) each for shallow water well, significant well in Vietnam.And so we've got some things going our way there.Roger W. Jenkins - President & Chief Executive Officer And we feel like we're pretty well-positioned.But in my view today, we have to maintain balance sheet that we have.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And at some point, I suppose, there will be a time when we try to do M&A and have return for our shareholders, and we feel we're unable to do that anymore, and we could look at other things. (Uncertainty) </span>So I feel a lot good about where we are in a pretty poor price environment, and we're working on that is the answer, Paul.Yeah.Appreciate it, Roger.Thank you very much.Roger W. Jenkins - President & Chief Executive Officer And that concludes the question-and-answer session.I'd like to turn the conference back over to Roger Jenkins for any additional or closing remarks.Roger W. Jenkins - President & Chief Executive Officer We appreciate everyone calling in today with some active questions today.I loved been participating with you and I think we did have a good quarter.And we'll be back with you again after the holidays, and we'll go from there and I appreciate it.Thank you.And that does conclude today's presentation.Thank you for your participation.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an important resource for bloggers and journalists, and are excited to contribute to the democratization of financial information on the Internet.(Until now investors have had to pay thousands of dollars in subscription fees for transcripts.)<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So our reproduction policy is as follows: You may quote up to 400 words of any transcript on the condition that you attribute the transcript to Seeking Alpha and either link to the original transcript or to www.SeekingAlpha.com.
