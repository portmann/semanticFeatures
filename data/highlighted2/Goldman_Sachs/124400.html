The stock is up 23% in the last 12 months, so Cramer advised staying away from it.Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ): The company reported an earnings beat last quarter with the net interest margin rising and a decline in litigation costs.Cramer thinks the stock is still cheap.Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ): Cramer said this is the highest quality bank name in the group and it has become expensive.The bank also has the highest growth potential and pays a 2.6% yield.Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ): This bank had the best quarter amongst all others but had also run ahead of the quarter.It's more focused on wealth management business, but its trading business is also doing well.Cramer thinks it's ok to hold the stock if you want to buy an investment bank.Citigroup (NYSE: C ): By any valuation metric, Citigroup is the cheapest and the most compelling name in the group.The stock is trading at less than 12 times next year earnings.What do we learn from Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX )?Netflix has one of the greatest growth stories and has been the leader in the S&P 500 this year.Lots of investors missed the rally as the stock is 1,300% up from its lows in 2012.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>"The puzzling thing, for me is that even though Netflix was one of the most obvious stories out there, with a beloved product that represents one of the greatest bargains of all time, somehow tons of investors convinced themselves not to own this amazing stock," said Cramer. (Surprise) </span>He highlighted two reasons for investors missing the rally.Firstly, Netflix can never be valued on traditional metrics.If Netflix is valued at earnings, it is trading at 390 times earnings which is insane.That is why subscriber growth is an important metric to value the company.The company has been investing in the business for the long term, which makes it wrong to value it on earnings.The company had mentioned years ago that they expect to hit 50M subscribers by 2015.They did much better and got 65M subscribers and yet the stock was bet against by many.Secondly, Netflix should not be a quarter by quarter performance game.As long as consumers love the product and the company keeps producing good original content, it's fine.The company is expanding internationally at a strong pace and has huge Japanese expansion coming this quarter, where every new TV in Japan will have a Netflix button.The management has been keeping their word and performing flawlessly.After the sell off, the retail sector bounced back the hardest.Cramer decided to look at the technical charts of retail stocks with the help of technician Bob Lang.Lang said that Market Vectors Retail ETF (NYSEARCA: RTH ) has bounced back harder after declining 4% last month."However, as much as Lang likes the retail group in general, he still thinks you need to be selective in order to pick the biggest winners," said Cramer.The resistance level of $77 was tested in RTH and it held well.It has now become the floor of support.The Chaikin Money Flow indicator has moved to positive territory from negative and the last time that happened, the RTH went up by 10%.The chart of Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN ) has been making higher highs and lower lows.One month back, the stock's 50-day moving average went below the 200-day moving average making a 'death cross', which leads to a sell off.In this case, the stock went higher.The RSI is going higher.Restoration Hardware (NYSE: RH ) hit a new high of $104 last Friday.The charts indicate a higher move to $115-120 soon.The Tiffany (NYSE: TIF ) chart showed a big gap in June that led to a consolidation.Lang thinks that the consolidation is about to end.As the high quality oil stocks are fighting for their lives, Cramer is shocked to see the stocks going lower than at a time when oil was in the $40s.Consider the case of Whiting Petroleum (NYSE: WLL ), which acquired Kodiak Oil and Gas for $3.8B, and it became the largest producer in North Dakota.The company inherited $2B of Kodiak's debt, which forced it to go for a secondary offering at $30.Oil was trading at $47 then and the stock went up to $37.Now, when the oil price is $50, the company's stock has fallen to $25.This made Cramer realize that the price of oil or interest rates have nothing to do with the stock price.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The only reason this could have happened is if investors expect the oil price to go lower; and the hedge funds have been liquidating their positions. (Uncertainty) </span>Aetna (NYSE: AET ): "I think you're in great shape with Aetna."Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT ): Arms dealers are the biggest winners from deals like the one with Iran.Novartis (NYSE: NVS ): It isn't growing as fast as other companies.It's a good company, but Cramer doesn't recommend a buy.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS: Check out Cramer's multi-million dollar charitable trust portfolio and uncover the stocks he thinks could be HUGE winners.
