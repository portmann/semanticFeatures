(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Verizon chief Lowell McAdam has acknowledged that Verizon might be interested in Yahoo, and Armstrong says it could happen -- at the right price. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Along with Yahoo 's hiring an independent committee today to explore its options , AP reports the company has hired three investment banks -- <b>Goldman</b> Sachs , J.P. Morgan and PJT Partners -- in what may be a clearer signal that some kind of transaction is imminent . (Goldman: Uncertainty) </span>They�d have to start a process, share all the data regarding audience, distribution, monetization and talent,� Armstrong told Hodulik.Everything at this point is theoretical.Assets with rapidly a growing number of users are very expensive.Even those with a stable number of users are expensive."Considering yahoo core is valued a $0....anything less than $40 per share would be unfair.I am just curious what are they going to do with Yahoo Japan and Alibaba stakes?I don't think they are planning on buying all of yahoo.Just the core.Read no baba or yahoo Japan.I suspect we'll get a value in the ball park of 8 bill and be left with our Asian assets.The new leftover yahoo will trade more in line with the market prices of baba and yahoo Japan less whatever discount the market prescribes.It is clear that YHOO is under pressure to sell its core businesses.The problem is that the management is not competent enough to follow up after the sales.What is the purpose of having more cash?It is not capable to release the benefits back to the stakeholders.Use the cash to buy back shares or what?It has no plan!Incompetent management and board of directors.They should be sacked first.ETF Screener: Search and filter by asset class, strategy, theme, performance, yield, and much more ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes</div></body></html>
