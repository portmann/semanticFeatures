Franklin had prior experience in O2O and location-based-services with Booyah, which developed games that "allows users to buy real-world business locations."His most recent role prior to FB involved a company that specializes in behavioral change.Finally, Steiner was a former Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) employee who specialized in storage, indexing, mail systems, web crawling, photo/video storage, processing and serving systems.Additionally, he was a tech lead at Google + and inventor of auto-backup, auto-organize, auto-highlight, auto-enhance and auto-awesome for Google Photos.In short, the three speakers for the Messenger session all have unique backgrounds and this gives us some clue as to what the session will be about.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The most probable scenario will be the incorporation of O2O and LBS into the app in which a notification or an alert could theoretically alternate the existing behavior of the individual and encourage that individual to either log into FB or conduct a transaction. (Uncertainty) </span>Alternatively, photos will be a key feature within the messenger platform where users can easily store, organize, backup and share photos with their close friends similarly to WeChat moment, a timeline of tweets that a user can publish on WeChat.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In addition, search (web crawling) could also be one of the features for users with the crawler initially searching within FB's massive universe to fulfill the query before resorting to Google. (Uncertainty) </span>I remain bullish on FB.Messenger will be a key driver of future engagement for FB as user time spend shifts from PC to mobile and makes mobile apps a more concentrated service (ie, mobile messenger).A broader enhancement of the FBM will be a key catalyst for the stock.Source: Facebook: F8 Conference Preview - All Eyes On Messenger Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
