class='textDiv'>Macys Changing Too Late And Too Little Macys Inc NYSEM Seeking Alpha Macys is caught between the rise of Amazon and the popularity of offprice retailers like TJ Maxx and Ross underperforming its peer set in shareholder return and return on invested capital The company has made efforts to adapt to the changing marketplace but these are too little and too late for longterm shareholder value <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs Amazon is already dominant in online apparel sales and projected to continue growing as more brands follow consumers onto the platform Macys Inc NYSE M made a deal last week to avoid the first strike in years at the company The threat of strike and corresponding wage increases seem right in line with the companys recent headaches It has been an extremely tough twelve months for department stores as everyone knows For most department stores it has been tough going for many years now However Macys had seen success up until July of last year Macys started to drop in late July and then continued the downward spiral with disappointing secondquarter results reported in early August The company quickly moved to close lowerperforming stores monetize its valuable real estate and develop its ecommerce and delivery platforms At the beginning of the stock rebounded only to fall back even lower where it stagnates today The most obvious culprit for the decline of course is Amazon NASDAQ AMZN with its expanded offerings convenience and prices On the other side discount giants like TJX Company Incs NYSE TJX TJ Maxx and Ross Stores Inc NASDAQ ROST are also hammering Macys These offprice companies take advantage of extra inventory or other disruptions to offer discounted goods of department store quality With these twin pressures how has Macys stacked up with its selfdefined peer groups We will take a look at the companys Annual Report as well as run our own metrics Note The Prior Peer Group is Macys Kohls NYSE KSS and Nordstrom NYSE JWN The New Peer Group is listed in the article By this view Macys has had a difficult but is still beating the SP the Prior Peer Group and the New Peer Group The New Peer Group includes Bed Bath Beyond Inc NASDAQ BBBY Dillards Inc NYSE DDS Gap Inc NYSE GPS JC Penney Inc NYSE JCP Kohls L Brands Inc NYSE LB Nordstrom Inc Ross Stores Inc Sears Holding Corporation NASDAQ SHLD Target Corporation NYSE TGT TJX Companies and WalMart Stores Inc NYSE WMT The Prior Peer Group includes Macys itself Nordstrom and Kohls Our charts show a different story than the Annual Report with a slightly more recent time frame At close on June st the median peer set which includes all of the New Peer Group returned in total shareholder returns since the beginning of For the same period Macys returned TJ Maxx and Ross the two discount giants in the bunch outperformed notching up and respectively Also outperforming was L Brands at which is likely able to withstand the department store crunch because of its strong brands Victoria Secrets and Bath Body Works Note The Median Peer Set is as described in the article Notably from the beginning of our metrics show the two ending at virtually the same shareholder return both at the end of January the end date on the Annual Report graph and up to the present This is in stark contrast to the significant comparative advantage given to Macys on the Annual Report Starting in as the Annual Report does rather than as our metrics do has a significant influence on the comparison Also notable is how much further Macys has crashed than its old peer group that included just Kohls and Nordstrom While all three on close of the st had a total shareholder return between and and stock prices in the s treated them quite differently Macys dropped from well in excess of TSR but the other two hardly ever cracked The return on invested capital shows a further grim outlook for Macys Traditionally strong in the holiday fourth quarter even the holidays disappointed For the first time in Q return on invested capital did not exceed the median peer set return To be fair to the general retail struggles Macys also showed a much steeper decline than its peer set Again TJ Maxx Ross and L Brands significantly outperformed in that quarter all above Overall Macys is trending consistently downward in its cyclical return on invested capital The future does not bode well for Macys despite initiatives to stop the downward trend The company is continuing ecommerce development increasingly monetizing its real estate assets digitizing the instore customer experience working towards increased efficiently and even experimenting with an offprice section within stores We do not like the chances of any of these initiatives succeeding in protecting longterm growth for the company Real estate sales are a temporary fix and the squeeze from other retailers is too great An attempt to become even partially a TJ Maxx or Ross Stores seems to be joining a field of major players without each competitors longtime experience and knowledge of the area As if these challenges are not enough already Amazon continues to grow particularly in apparel <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs recently released a report detailing Amazons growth in apparel sales growth as more companies and consumers adopt its marketplace Strong brands not yet on Amazon will likely increasingly adopt the platform hurting middlemen department stores Brands will have to follow consumers especially Millennials who are focused on convenience and choices key advantages of Amazon Already <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>believes Amazon sells nearly double the value of apparel Macys does online and accounts for a full fifth of online apparel sales We agree that this dominance will increase and that more brands will begin to sell on Amazon We believe that despite our reservations about Macys there is a strong case for the future of offprice companies and apparel companies with strong brands such as L Brands In fact we were not surprised to see L Brands Victoria Secret on Amazon as we see this kind of partnership growing to encompass more strong brands On the other side the offprice companies can take advantage of supply chain and inventory problems to continue to offer great deals with the added benefit of giving consumers the thrill of unexpected finds to encourage store traffic The apparel retail world is quickly shifting Where do you see it heading Research support by Enlight analyst
