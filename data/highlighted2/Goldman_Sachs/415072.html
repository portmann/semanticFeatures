class='textDiv'>Verizon And Yahoo Verizon Communications NYSEVZ Seeking Alpha Verizons CEO Lowell McAdam acknowledges interest in Yahoo Yahoos CFO Kenneth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>is bullish on Yahoos core business auction process Tuesday May marked a very interesting day at the th annual JPMorgan technology media and telecom conference in Boston MA The second day of the conference featured Verizons NYSE VZ CEO Lowell McAdam and Yahoos NASDAQ YHOO CFO Kenneth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>both contributing juicy tidbits in the contentious drama that is the ongoing sale of Yahoos core business Verizon has publicly expressed interest in Yahoo multiple times and Yahoo is desperate to succeed in any sale or spinoff of its business to create shareholder value Verizon is seen as the lead actor in a cast of players vying for all or parts of Yahoos core business and todays remarks by company insiders confirm and strengthen that thesis Verizon just recently received an earnings downgrade from Wells Fargo This downgrade comes as almost of the companys workers continue a strike started on April with little progress being made by either side in negotiations Verizons CEO Lowell McAdam also lowered expectations at the conference on the companys Go mobile video service that is off to a slow start to say the least among its targeted audiences article With a lot of bad press in the news lately what better way to change the sentiment of Verizon than to successfully close on some or all of Yahoos core business as a high bidder With a market cap exceeding billion annual revenues of over billion and around billion in free cash on its balance sheet Verizon has the ability to take as large a chunk of Yahoos core business as it wants Verizon has the ability to buy core Yahoo but what reason does the company have to spend above and beyond what the other bidders are willing to spend is the question McAdam said at the conference we cant talk about Yahoo but thats a possibility to gain greater scale Building scale among its internet and video properties such as AOL and Go will create synergies by growing revenues and cutting costs that other bidders for Yahoos assets can not achieve Yahoos CFO Kenneth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>also gave a presentation that Tuesday and naturally the sale of the companys core business was on everyones mind Yahoo failed in an attempt to spin off its Ali Baba NYSE BABA stake late last year in a tax free manner so pressure has built last year and this year on getting anything done to create some value whether that is a reverse spin of the companys core or sale of some or all of it to another company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>said at the conference We are taking it extremely seriously and that the upcoming sale was taking up the majority of top executives time Its our collective goal that we find a way wherever this ends up that ultimately Yahoo will do better with the benefit of however it goes than staying independent Yahoo is under immense pressure to get a deal done no matter what and Verizon is in the best position to capitalize on this desperation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>reiterated that the second round of the auction is a robust process involving multiple bidders and its going I think very very well I wrote a previous article on Yahoo further explaining the current bidding process and players but what makes Verizon such a good partner for Yahoo The answer is the scale that a sale can create for Verizon Verizon bought AOL last year for billion and brought its former CEO and Chairman Tim Armstrong over to Verizon to run it This integration has gone very well according to insiders and McAdam said at the JPMorgan conference that AOLs first quarter was their best quarter in five years so thats kind of working Verizon acquiring Yahoos core business works because Tim Armstrong is already there to head the integration of Yahoo into Verizons media and video assets Eliminate what isnt working for Yahoo and what is redundant in the bigger company and you can bring down costs while growing revenues which is building scale McAdam said during the conference in regard to Tim Armstrong and Verizons internet and video business goals that two plus two should at least equal six I believe that purchasing Yahoos core business does equal six for Verizon at a price that could be acceptable to both parties Verizon buying all or part of Yahoo makes sense because Verizon has the means Yahoo is desperate to sell and the combined company should create scale in a way that benefits Verizon much more so than other bidders in Yahoos core business auction Tuesday May s JPMorgan conference reinforced that view as both Verizons CEO and Yahoos CFO hinted at the process moving forward favorably towards completion With the market valuing Yahoos core business at very little when you back out its stakes in Ali Baba Yahoo Japan and its cash any sale of some or all of its core business should create additional shareholder value which is why I am long Yahoo I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any
