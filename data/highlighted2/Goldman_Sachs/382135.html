at a report Apple will be keeping iPhone production at depressed levels in calendar Q Both Apple and chip suppliers sold off on the report which comes ahead of Apples April FQ report Potential reasons output is being kept down Forexmacro pressures iPhone anticipation Android defections and longer smartphone upgrade cycles Forexmacro and iPhone anticipation are likely having the biggest impact Both are shortterm problems rather than causes for panic Apple NASDAQ AAPL guided in late January for revenue to be down YY in FQ calendar Q and reportedly ordered the quarters iPhone production to be below yearago levels Thus for the company to keep iPhone production orders unchanged sequentially in FQ as Japans Nikkei is now reporting suggests iPhone sales could be soundly below yearago levels for another quarter That of course would be a problem not just for Apple but various chip suppliers Skyworks NASDAQ SWKS Qorvo NASDAQ QRVO and BroadcomAvago NASDAQ AVGO joined Apple in selling off after the Nikkeis report broke on Friday Cirrus Logic NASDAQ CRUS which gets over half its sales from Apple also dipped but closed with just modest losses Those quick to dismiss supply chain reports perhaps while remembering Tim Cooks questioning of how much can be read from them should remember there were a bunch of reports pointing to order cuts as well as sales warnings from many Apple suppliers in DecemberJanuary Apples FQ guidance wound up vindicating the reports and explaining the warnings Cook is right that supply chain reports can sometimes overlook key details such as supplier share changes or yield issues but overall the reports have repeatedly proven a valuable source of info for those trying to gauge Apples performance before an earnings report arrives Assuming the Nikkei apparently right in early January about order cuts is correct that Apple is keeping output flat due to slowerthanexpected demand I see four possible culprits Forex andor macro pressures in various markets China Russia the Middle East and Latin America come to mind are hurting sales Samsungs Galaxy S it has received good reviews was priced a little more aggressively than expected and appears to be selling well and perhaps also other Android phones are grabbing some wouldbe iPhone buyers My hunch is that its mostly a mixture of the first two issues Various US multinationals including some tech firms have reported seeing macro pressures in markets where low oilcommodity prices are a problem and IDC and Gartner just reported macro and forex along with several other issues to be fair hurt Q PC sales Apple has strong exposure to China of FQ sales and meaningful exposure to markets where oil accounts for a big part of GDP Moreover the company has hiked iPhone prices in various markets due to currency swings Regarding potential culprit its worth remembering the impact iPhone anticipation had on iPhone S sales two years ago With each upgrade cycle the impact of nextgen iPhone anticipation on S series sales appears to have grown A recent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>survey of US adults found just saying they plan to buy an iPhone in the next three months but saying they plan to buy an iPhone It remains to be seen of course if the iPhone lives up to consumer expectations and on that count there are some signs Apples historical approach of making big upgrades every two years and smaller upgrades in the interim year could be changing but anticipation among existing iPhone buyers appears strong Regarding potential culprit there might be some increase in the number of iPhone owners defecting to Android given the Ss healthy reception But its hard to overlook the extent to which the iPhone and Android have each commanded strong consumer loyalty An Ericsson study pdf released last fall found of iPhone owners and of Android owners stay loyal to their respective platforms when upgrading most of the year In the two weeks following an iPhone launch the iPhone figure is and the Android figure Though the fanboy wars will doubtlessly go on both iOS and Android meet the needs of most of their user bases And their app and service ecosystems create a large switching cost for those thinking of defecting Also Apple just launched the iPhone SE making a bid for midrange Android buyers by charging less than what it previously sold the S now discontinued for while upgrading the CPU camera and radios Even if initial SE sales are limited Fiksu currently has it making up of the iPhone base its not farfetched to see it grabbing enough costsensitive Android users to offset any pickup in iPhone defections caused by the S Potential culprit is something worth keeping an eye on given that whats been going on in the highend smartphone market in recent years hundreds of millions of people upgrading devices every two years on average is quite remarkable and not guaranteed to continue forever But its also not something I think is having a big impact on iPhone sales right now Anyone who bought an iPhone in early bought a S or older device and while the S may not be a big upgrade over the unless youre really into D Touch it is over the and S That a largerthanexpected number of iPhone S owners are waiting for the to launch before upgrading sounds more plausible than the idea that a largerthanexpected number consider their older iPhones good enough In addition smartphone installment and upgrade plans actually seem to be shortening upgrade cycles for some demographics Goldmans US survey found a third of iPhone replacement interest came from currentgeneration SS owners and thinks installmentupgrade plans are responsible The iPhone s strongerthanexpected performance in late and early which of course makes for tougher sales comps for the SS appears to partly be the result of enthusiasts upgrading after less than two years to get a larger iPhone If a cycle lengthening is about to happen its the kind of thing one would expect to see after the iPhone and expected to feature the same display sizes as the and launch not before As far as the longterm health of the iPhone franchise goes potential culprits and arent things to be deeply concerned about would be cause for moderate concern and if signifying a broader trend would be a big deal If it turns out forexmacro and iPhone related demand pushout are the main reasons for weakerthanexpected S sales its a shortterm negative rather than something to panic over Apples April FQ report and the guidance accompanying it should provide more insight into just how much iPhone sales have fallen relative to yearago levels In the meantime the stock is down from where it traded a year ago and trades for x its consensus FY ends September
