publicly traded company buying the stock knowing it was undervalued with insider knowledge would be illegal Fortunately buying a Sifting the World StW subscription with insider knowledge its dramatically undervalued is not illegal Chris posts a variety of ideas some are his own and some comes from friends and colleagues he respects and admires sometimes including me The investment thesis risks upsides and downsides are always laid out clearly and form the perfect starting point for individual research In addition a less talked about aspect of StW is Chris posts a variety of interesting investing opportunities that have limited size and scale and generally cant be mentioned to a larger group of people These generally focus on odd lot tenders but can include things as wide as airline mile arbitrage and free cans of tuna Its not a stretch to say that simply investing in all of these limited size investments would easily cover the annual cost of a subscription Finally the community of people is excellent each article generally has an active discussion that helps with the investment thesis and the chat allows members to ask timely questions and alert each other to items of interest in real time If you like Chriss writing or are interested in event driven value investing an investment in StW is the equivalent of investing in a company trading for well below intrinsic value with a strong capital allocator at the helm and a clear catalyst for value realization Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please
