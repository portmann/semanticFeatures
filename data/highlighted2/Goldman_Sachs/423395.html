class='textDiv'>European Union Declares War On Internet Free Speech Zero Hedge Submitted by Soren Kern via The Gatestone Institute Opponents counter that the initiative amounts to an assault on free speech in Europe They say that the European Unions definition of hate speech and incitement to violence is so vague that it could include virtually anything deemed politically incorrect by European authorities including criticism of mass migration Islam or even the EU itself Some Members of the European Parliament have characterized the EUs code of online conduct which requires offensive material to be removed from the Internet within hours as Orwellian By deciding that xenophobic comment in reaction to the crisis is also racist Facebook has made the view of the majority of the European people into racist views and so is condemning the majority of Europeans as racist Douglas Murray In January Facebook suspended the account of Khaled Abu Toameh after he wrote about corruption in the Palestinian Authority The account was reopened hours later but with the two posts deleted and no explanation The European Union EU in partnership with Facebook Twitter YouTube and Microsoft has unveiled a code of conduct to combat the spread of illegal hate speech online in Europe Proponents of the initiative argue that in the aftermath of the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels a crackdown on hate speech is necessary to counter jihadist propaganda online Opponents counter that the initiative amounts to an assault on free speech in Europe They say that the EUs definition of hate speech and incitement to violence is so vague that it could include virtually anything deemed politically incorrect by European authorities including criticism of mass migration Islam or even the European Union itself Some Members of the European Parliament have characterized the EUs code of online conduct which requires offensive material to be removed from the Internet within hours and replaced with counternarratives as Orwellian The code of conduct was announced on May in a statement by the European Commission the unelected administrative arm of the European Union A summary of the initiative follows By signing this code of conduct the IT companies commit to continuing their efforts to tackle illegal hate speech online This will include the continued development of internal procedures and staff training to guarantee that they review the majority of valid notifications for removal of illegal hate speech in less than hours and remove or disable access to such content if necessary The IT companies will also endeavor to strengthen their ongoing partnerships with civil society organisations who will help flag content that promotes incitement to violence and hateful conduct The IT companies and the European Commission also aim to continue their work in identifying and promoting independent counternarratives emphasis added new ideas and initiatives and supporting educational programs that encourage critical thinking Excerpts of the code of conduct include The IT Companies share the European Commissions and EU Member States commitment to tackle illegal hate speech online Illegal hate speech as defined by the Framework Decision JHA of November on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law and national laws transposing it means all conduct publicly inciting to violence or hatred directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race color religion descent or national or ethnic origin The IT Companies support the European Commission and EU Member States in the effort to respond to the challenge of ensuring that online platforms do not offer opportunities for illegal online hate speech to spread virally The spread of illegal hate speech online not only negatively affects the groups or individuals that it targets it also negatively impacts those who speak out for freedom tolerance and nondiscrimination in our open societies and has a chilling effect on the democratic discourse on online platforms While the effective application of provisions criminalizing hate speech is dependent on a robust system of enforcement of criminal law sanctions against the individual perpetrators of hate speech this work must be complemented with actions geared at ensuring that illegal hate speech online is expeditiously acted upon by online intermediaries and social media platforms upon receipt of a valid notification in an appropriate timeframe To be considered valid in this respect a notification should not be insufficiently precise or inadequately substantiated The IT Companies taking the lead on countering the spread of illegal hate speech online have agreed with the European Commission on a code of conduct setting the following public commitments The IT Companies to have in place clear and effective processes to review notifications regarding illegal hate speech on their services so they can remove or disable access to such content The IT companies to have in place Rules or Community Guidelines clarifying that they prohibit the promotion of incitement to violence and hateful conduct The IT Companies to review the majority of valid notifications for removal of illegal hate speech in less than hours and remove or disable access to such content if necessary The IT Companies and the European Commission recognising the value of independent counter speech against hateful rhetoric and prejudice aim to continue their work in identifying and promoting independent counternarratives new ideas and initiatives and supporting educational programs that encourage critical thinking The agreement also requires Internet companies to establish a network of trusted reporters in all EU member states to flag online content that promotes incitement to violence and hateful conduct The EU Commissioner for Justice Consumers and Gender Equality Vra Jourov has defended the initiative The recent terror attacks have reminded us of the urgent need to address illegal online hate speech Social media is unfortunately one of the tools that terrorist groups use to radicalize young people and racists use to spread violence and hatred This agreement is an important step forward to ensure that the internet remains a place of free and democratic expression where European values and laws are respected I welcome the commitment of worldwide IT companies to review the majority of valid notifications for removal of illegal hate speech in less than hours and remove or disable access to such content if necessary Others disagree The National Secular Society NSS of the UK warned that the EUs plans rest on a vague definition of hate speech and risk threatening online discussions which criticize religion It added The agreement comes amid repeated accusations from exMuslims that social media organizations are censoring them online The Council of ExMuslims of Britain has now begun collecting examples from its followers of Facebook censoring atheist secular and exMuslim content after false mass reporting by cyber Jihadists They have asked their supporters to report details and evidence of any instances of pages and groups being banned or suspended from Facebook for criticizing Islam and Islamism NSS communications officer Benjamin Jones said Far from tackling online cyber jihad the agreement risks having the exact opposite effect and entrapping any critical discussion of religion under vague hate speech rules Poorlytrained Facebook or Twitter staff perhaps with their own ideological bias could easily see heated criticism of Islam and think it is hate speech particularly if pages or users are targeted and mass reported by Islamists In an interview with Breitbart London the CEO of Index on Censorship Jodie Ginsburg said Hate speech laws are already too broad and ambiguous in much of Europe This agreement fails to properly define what illegal hate speech is and does not provide sufficient safeguards for freedom of expression It devolves power once again to unelected corporations to determine what amounts to hate speech and police it a move that is guaranteed to stifle free speech in the mistaken belief this will make us all safer It wont It will simply drive unpalatable ideas and opinions underground where they are harder to police or to challenge There have been precedents of content removal for unpopular or offensive viewpoints and this agreement risks amplifying the phenomenon of deleting controversial yet legal content via misuse or abuse of the notification processes A coalition of free speech organizations European Digital Rights and Access Now announced their decision not to take part in future discussions with the European Commission saying that we do not have confidence in the illconsidered code of conduct that was agreed A statement warned In short the code of conduct downgrades the law to a secondclass status behind the leading role of private companies that are being asked to arbitrarily implement their terms of service This process established outside an accountable democratic framework exploits unclear liability rules for online companies It also creates serious risks for freedom of expression as legal but controversial content may well be deleted as a result of this voluntary and unaccountable takedown mechanism This means that this agreement between only a handful of companies and the European Commission is likely in breach of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights under which restrictions on fundamental rights should be provided for by law and will in practical terms overturn case law of the European Court of Human Rights on the defense of legal speech Janice Atkinson an independent MEP for the South East England region summed it up this way Its Orwellian Anyone who has read sees its very reenactment live Even before signing on to the EUs code of conduct social media sites have been cracking down on free speech often at the behest of foreign governments In September German Chancellor Angela Merkel was overheard on a live microphone confronting Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on what he was doing to prevent criticism of her opendoor immigration policies In January Facebook launched an Online Civil Courage Initiative aimed at Facebook users in Germany and geared toward fighting hate speech and extremism on the Internet Writing for Gatestone Institute British commentator Douglas Murray noted that Facebooks assault on racist speech appears to include anything critical of the EUs current catastrophic immigration policy He wrote By deciding that xenophobic comment in reaction to the crisis is also racist Facebook has made the view of the majority of the European people who it must be stressed are opposed to Chancellor Merkels policies into racist views and so is condemning the majority of Europeans as racist This is a policy that will do its part in pushing Europe into a disastrous future Facebook has also set its sights on Gatestone Institute affiliated writers In January Facebook suspended the account of Khaled Abu Toameh after he wrote about corruption in the Palestinian Authority The account was reopened hours later but with the two posts deleted and no explanation Abu Toameh wrote Its still a matter of censorship They decide whats acceptable Now we have to be careful about what we post and what we share Does this mean we cant criticize Arab governments anymore In June Facebook suspended the account of Ingrid Carlqvist Gatestones Swedish expert after she posted a Gatestone video to her Facebook feed called Swedens Migrant Rape Epidemic In an editorial Gatestone wrote After enormous grassroots pressure from Gatestones readers the Swedish media started reporting on Facebooks heavyhanded censorship It backfired and Facebook went into damagecontrol mode They put Ingrids account back up without any explanation or apology Ironically their censorship only gave Ingrids video more attention Facebook and the EU have backed down for now But theyre deadly serious about stopping ideas they dont like Theyll be back This week the EU in partnership with Facebook Twitter YouTube and Microsoft unveiled a code of conduct to combat the spread of illegal hate speech online in Europe The next day Facebook suspended the account of Ingrid Carlqvist Gatestones Swedish expert after she posted a Gatestone video to her Facebook feed called Swedens Migrant Rape Epidemic froze Lost My Shorts Jun PM Thank God i was getting tired of people speaking their minds without having to face serous repercussions for not getting in line Now the internet will do it for us by censoring us in the name of equality and freedom s Remember its not hate speech as along as its targeted at white people and especially white men that are family men This will lead to a bloody mess Sad Incitement to violence like parking the

is truning into the pig pen of the world I guess all the freedom loving folks have become ex pats Or soon will be The recent terror attacks have reminded us of the urgent need to address illegal

Europe PARIS The French presidency on Thursday said it would deploy its Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier to boost its operations against the The presence of the nuclearpowered aircraft carrier the

saying it was acting in self defense KirkNCC hedgeless_horseman Jun PM When we do it were liberating oppressed people from a moderate or secular Muslim society to a radicalized society of a failed state When we leverage ruling tyrants and sociopaths then they are Our Tyrants When they turn on us we take them down as Monsters and Tyrants When unfriendly powers China Russia support someone who will not comply or submit fully to our interests then its ON like Donkey Konk If in doubt remember that ALL WARS ARE BANKSTERS WARS Its a real shame that so many Libertarianslibertarian lose sight of

that it was legitimate but my best friend is earning thousand a month by working online that was really surprising for me she recommended me to try it just try it out on the following website wwwearnmorecom This is exactly what happens when dweebs in public office are too afraid to tackle the root of a problem and instead try to fix the symptoms Wheres a revolution of vertebrates when you need one financialrealist Bryan Jun PM Bryan financialrealist Jun PM Maybe so bought or just too selfabsorbed to care You cannot legislate niceness or morality or happiness or friendliness but they sure do try More globalist treachery End the EU BTW Tyler there are at least major things from the updates to the site that reduce the degree of anonymity if thats still of any importance dark fiber

beautiful world where no one will be offended Dont you feel much more secure in your safe space I guess now more users will finally learn how to use TOR and other bad tools used only by drug dealers pornography producers and the rest of nasty people EU wants to not know For your own safety Hate Speech is a Scripted False Narrative term made up to Socially Engineer a Society of easily fearfully controlled Pussies The attitude that this attempt to throttle free speech illustrates shows just how outoftouch the bureaucrats in Brussels and Berlin really are To quote one of its progenitors the Internet treats censorship as damage and routes around it Such routing will take place making the pronouncements of said bureaucrats appear even more pointlessand impotent to the point of derision This is absurd placing the onus on IT companies for a users actions Way out of scope An IT company just makes sure the zeroes and s get from point A to point B budd_dwyers_gun mc Jun PM Good thing

abolishes the first ten amentments to the US constitution as they are obsolute and stands in the way of progress She believes she can abolish them by exeitive order alone it does not need to go though congress or aproved by the states And there is no real need for a congress or states anyway In their place will be regions ruled by a presidentally apointed governor Finally the president should have the power to fire a supreme court justice as well as hiring them that will help ensure their loyalty and submission peddlingfiction matinee Jun PM Waiting for Ghordius to tell us that the European Commissions code of conduct is unproblematic wellmeant and nothing to get exasperated about list of literary works books movies etc which started as satirespoof but which have been eclipsed by real life or are on a frightening trajectory to pcu probably best example todays sjws make those charicatures look like disney characters idiocracy too many frightening parallels to discuss wall st lloyd blankfein jamie dimon make gordon gecko look like ben cohen honarable mention to brokeback mountain not so much for real life imitating it but its premise being a spoof of a south park episode I predict that within years any and all discussions even remotely relating to stopping the islamic invasion will be censored by all the orwellian web sites that the sheeple love to peruse Simply posting a graph showing that the muslim population will overtake the nonmuslim population within X years will be impossible So how will anyone stop it Answer is they wont One day everyone will wake up and realize that the invaders have taken over and voted themselves free shit and have thus voted to bankrupt their country and destroy their economy and turn it into Venezuela US Baker Hughes US Rig Count
