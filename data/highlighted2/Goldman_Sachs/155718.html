class='textDiv'>Recordbreaking Apple bond set to bear fruit for Kangaroo market Reuters SYDNEY Aug IFR Australias underutilised corporate bond market received a major shot in the arm this week when the worlds biggest company by market value made its Kangaroo debut Apple broke several records with Australias largest bond offering from any overseas issuer a feat which could pave the way for other global bluechips to make the trip Down Under The A billion billion raised is also more than double the local A billion record for a nonfinancial corporate issuer set on two separate occasions by Australian mining giant BHP Billiton in October and March The unprecedented issue reveals the depth of demand for highquality corporate paper and raises hopes that Australias bankdominated local market will become a more important funding alternative for global issuers Pricing was all important for while Australian asset managers were keen to add Apple to their rather narrow portfolios a useful marketing tool to help attract clients this did not guarantee they would place large orders Joint lead managers CBA Deutsche Bank and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs clearly understood this as they went out with attractive initial guidance two days after Tuesdays wellreceived round of calls with Asian and Australian investors Fixedrate four and sevenyear tranches were marketed at bp area and bp area over asset swaps respectively alongside an additional fouryear floater With Westpac having sold a dualtranche fiveyear on July at bp over asset swaps and threemonth BBSW corporatestarved Aussie fund managers were offered compelling terms to pick up the Apple paper On an interpolated curve basis AaAA rated Apple was indicating a bp margin for a fiveyear offering just bp less than Australias four lowerrated major banks AaAAAA which dominate local fund allocations Even after Fridays Apple trade Australian dollar senior unsecured bank issuance domestic and Kangaroos in is more than four times the amount raised by foreign and local companies A billion versus A billion Lack of supply has long been a problem for Australias corporate bond market as the countrys biggest and highyield companies typically target the deeper US and euro markets while the competitive domestic syndicated loan market provides most smaller firms financing needs Crucially Apples initial guidance was also attractive in relative value currency terms with a bp premium offered over its euro November s that would swap back into Australian dollars at around bp over BBSW This represented an essential carrot for Asian investors and those Australian funds that could otherwise buy cheaper Apple bonds overseas Local funds often look to offshore comps as key pricing references even if they lack the currency flexibility to invest overseas The leads compiled a bumper book in excess of A billion that enabled guidance to be tightened to bpbp and bbp without a significant decline in orders before Fridays pricing at the tight end of these ranges Demand was balanced between the two maturities The A billion twopiece fouryear consisted of a A million floatingrate note and a A million percent August fixedrate note priced at for a yield of percent equivalent to bp over the Australian Commonwealth government bond The A billion percent sevenyear priced at to yield percent bp wide of ACGBs While Apples debut is a clear success previous false dawns have dampened predictions of a surge in corporate Kangaroo issuance Bankers had hoped that BPs well received A million debut in August would kick start the market but the UK energy firms subsequent trade fell flat as it raised just A million from another fiveyear offering months later French energy company Total also underwhelmed with its A million fiveyear sale in November two months after stateowned Korea National Oil Corp also raised A million via its fiveyear debut A million is seen as the minimumsized trade to tempt most global corporate issuers to Australia There have also been sporadic success stories however most recently with SABMillers stunning A million fiveyear print on July The worlds secondlargest brewer by revenue showed there is plenty of depth in the Australian corporate bond market for the right name at the right price Although the SABMiller issue through FBG Treasury Aust was technically a domestic corporate offering investors treated it as a corporate Kangaroo because its global parent is the guarantor Similarly AngloSwiss mining giant Glencore received a warm reception for its A million fiveyear trade last September that like SABMiller was issued via a local subsidiary Neither of these trades gets close to Apples stellar debut which as well as being Australias biggest corporate bond is the first multitenor corporate offering in the Kangaroo market The sevenyear piece also represents the longest maturity to date for a corporate Kangaroo Importantly Apple raised a similar amount in US dollar equivalent terms as it did in its four other overseas ports of call November s billion euros billion eight and year trade this Februarys Sfr billion billion and year sale Junes trillion yen billion fiveyear global yen print and last months billion pounds billion and year sterling issuance One advantage with Kangaroo trades is they can be lubricated by Australian banks huge demand for foreign currency funding estimated this year to be around billion billion equivalent Since Aussie banks must pay hedging costs on their foreign currency borrowings to avoid adding to systemic risk offshore issuers can benefit by taking the other side of the hedging contract when they borrow in Australian dollars Reporting By John Weavers editing by
