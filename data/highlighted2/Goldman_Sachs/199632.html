travel demand is expected to double over the next years Justifiable concerns over the companys cash flow persist as Dreamliner deferred costs and KCA execution issues cast doubt on the companys ability to execute on future projects Shares of Boeing are near fair value when considering cash flow risks due to likely execution issues in coming years that threaten optimistic cash flow projections Boeing NYSE BA is an iconic member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average at the forefront of the global commercial and military aviation industries Globalization and the correlated growth in per capita GDP has strongly supported the companys commercial aviation business as world air travel demand is projected to double over the next twenty years The companys backlog for its commercial products has grown dramatically in recent years and Boeing has been steadily ramping up production to meet the demand The ramping up of deliveries and growing order book has led to substantial improvement in the companys cash flow that it began returning to share holders in a major way last December when the board approved a billion dollar share repurchase program and increased the stocks dividend by Despite the improved cash flow and strong commitment to share holders that the board demonstrated in December of concerns over the companys ability to hit its cash flow targets or even sustain its current levels persist among both analysts and investors The companys inability to execute on both costs and design with both the Dreamliners continuing deferred costs and the KCA development issues lead some to question the companys ability to execute the coming shift in two of the companys biggest products the Max and the X Boeings Dreamliner is a technological marvel that has delivered for the companys customers with vastly improved passenger comfort and fuel efficiency but has yet to deliver for the companys share holders Boeing has been deferring costs associated with the sale of each Dreamliner using an accounting method that allows the company to claim profits on each Dreamliner sale against the costs Boeing projected for each of the first Dreamliners while deferring the actual loss on each sale until a later time The companys leadership repeatedly said in late and early that the Dreamliner would become profitable in late as productivity improves and production costs fall below the planes sale price but the company reported in the second quarter of that it now expects the Dreamliner to be profitable in early after racking up over billion in deferred costs It is likely that the Dreamliner will be profitable in the beginning to middle of as the production shifts to more s and the rate of production ramps to aircraft per month Yet the billion in deferred costs will have to be realized in coming years Despite the companys assurances that these losses have been factored into their cash flow projections the deferred losses will at best add pressure to cash flow that will provide the company even less room for error Perhaps more importantly to investors however is the bungled execution of the Dreamliners production and what it might portend for the coming X and Max The company has promised investors that it has addressed the Dreamliner errors by bringing more of the X and Max manufacturing in house but questions about execution remain The companys handling of its controversial next generation tanker aircraft the KCA should cause investors further pause over Boeings ability to execute two significant product upgrades by Design and Engineering issues with the KCAs fuel system forced the company to take a million after tax charge on its second quarter earnings The company acknowledged in the surprise July announcement that the charge would have an impact on cash but that the company would make up for it in other unspecified ways Boeings Commercial Division is in the midst of vital upgrade cycles with two of its core commercial products the and the Both of the upgraded planes the Max and X have garnered impressive orders thanks to major upgrades that Boeing promises will improve efficiency range and passenger comfort Yet the new planes ambitious delivery schedule and Boeings recent history with the Dreamliner and KCA should engender skepticism with investors The upgrade of both aircraft over the next four and a half years with the first Max scheduled to be delivered in and the first X scheduled in will present technical challenges that Boeings optimistic delivery schedule is likely not providing adequate time to address The X will also force Boeing into a delicate sales dance with its customers as they attempt to fill delivery slots for current generation planes to hit cash flow targets A report this month from Noah Poponak lead analyst at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs suggests that it is not likely that Boeing will be able to maintain its current rate of production for the as customers target the next generation of the aircraft A reduction in the rate of production of the current generation would have a significant effect on the companys earnings and cash flow as the relatively high margin program plays an outsized role in cash generation for Boeing Poponak believes Boeing will be forced to cut the rate of production of the current aircraft from to per month Boeing is a giant in the aerospace industry and is well situated strategically as demand for commercial aircraft will allow the company to continue to ramp up production of its Dreamliner and program in the near and medium term and its X in the longer term The companys military business long a source of concern for investors due to US Defense spending cuts is awaiting a decision on the next generation of strategic bomber from the US Airforce while continuing to deliver a variety of other products to the US Military The company also has a number of contracts with foreign governments to deliver many of its proven defense products Despite these positives the companys current share price is likely fairly valued at times earnings Boeing will likely face continued Dreamliner cost deferments in the near term a production slow down in the current generation program in and possible design engineering or production delays in its Max and X programs based on the nature and complexity of the programs and the companys recent history All of these possible drags to its cash flow will be partially offset by rising rates of production for its commercial products but the risks they pose are fairly priced in the stock at current levels and investors should wait for a pull back in share price before buying this strategically well positioned
