(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Shares of Boeing are near fair value when considering cash flow risks due to likely execution issues in coming years that threaten optimistic cash flow projections. (Uncertainty) </span>Boeing (NYSE: BA ) is an iconic member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average at the forefront of the global commercial and military aviation industries.Globalization and the correlated growth in per capita GDP has strongly supported the company's commercial aviation business as world air travel demand is projected to double over the next twenty years.The company's backlog for its commercial products has grown dramatically in recent years and Boeing has been steadily ramping up production to meet the demand.The ramping up of deliveries and growing order book has led to substantial improvement in the company's cash flow that it began returning to share holders in a major way last December when the board approved a 12 billion dollar share repurchase program and increased the stock's dividend by 25%.Despite the improved cash flow and strong commitment to share holders that the board demonstrated in December of 2014, concerns over the company's ability to hit its cash flow targets or even sustain its current levels persist among both analysts and investors.The company's inability to execute on both costs and design with both the Dreamliner's continuing deferred costs and the KC-46A development issues lead some to question the company's ability to execute the coming shift in two of the company's biggest products: the 737 Max and the 777X.Boeing's 787 Dreamliner is a technological marvel that has delivered for the company's customers with vastly improved passenger comfort and fuel efficiency, but has yet to deliver for the company's share holders.Boeing has been deferring costs associated with the sale of each Dreamliner using an accounting method that allows the company to claim profits on each Dreamliner sale against the costs Boeing projected for each of the first 1,300 Dreamliners, while deferring the actual loss on each sale until a later time.The company's leadership repeatedly said in late 2014 and early 2015 that the Dreamliner would become profitable in late 2015 as productivity improves and production costs fall below the plane's sale price, but the company reported in the second quarter of 2015 that it now expects the Dreamliner to be profitable in early 2016 after racking up over 27 billion in deferred costs.It is likely that the Dreamliner will be profitable in the beginning to middle of 2016 as the production shifts to more 787-9's and the rate of production ramps to 12 aircraft per month.Yet the 27 billion in deferred costs will have to be realized in coming years.Despite the company's assurances that these losses have been factored into their cash flow projections, the deferred losses will, at best, add pressure to cash flow that will provide the company even less room for error.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Perhaps more importantly to investors however, is the bungled execution of the Dreamliner's production and what it might portend for the coming 777X and 737 Max. (Uncertainty) </span>The company has promised investors that it has addressed the Dreamliner errors by bringing more of the 777X and 737 Max manufacturing in house, but questions about execution remain.The company's handling of its controversial next generation tanker aircraft, the KC-46A, should cause investors further pause over Boeing's ability to execute two significant product upgrades by 2020.Design and Engineering issues with the KC-46A's fuel system forced the company to take a $536 million after tax charge on its second quarter earnings.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The company acknowledged in the surprise July announcement that the charge would have an impact on 2015 cash but that the company would make up for it in other unspecified ways. (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Boeing's Commercial Division is in the midst of vital upgrade cycles with two of its core commercial products, the 737 and the 777.Both of the upgraded planes, the 737 Max and 777X, have garnered impressive orders thanks to major upgrades that Boeing promises will improve efficiency, range, and passenger comfort.Yet the new planes' ambitious delivery schedule and Boeing's recent history with the Dreamliner and KC-46A should engender skepticism with investors.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The upgrade of both aircraft over the next four and a half years, with the first 737 Max scheduled to be delivered in 2017 and the first 777X scheduled in 2020 will present technical challenges that Boeing's optimistic delivery schedule is likely not providing adequate time to address. (Uncertainty) </span>The 777X will also force Boeing into a delicate sales dance with its customers as they attempt to fill delivery slots for current generation 777 planes to hit cash flow targets.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A report this month from Noah Poponak , lead analyst at <b>Goldman</b> Sachs , suggests that it is not likely that Boeing will be able to maintain its current rate of production for the 777-300 as customers target the next generation of the aircraft . (Goldman: Uncertainty) </span>A reduction in the rate of production of the current generation 777 would have a significant effect on the company's earnings and cash flow as the relatively high margin 777 program plays an outsized role in cash generation for Boeing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Poponak believes Boeing will be forced to cut the rate of production of the current 777 aircraft from 6.8 to 5 per month. (Uncertainty) </span>Boeing is a giant in the aerospace industry and is well situated strategically as demand for commercial aircraft will allow the company to continue to ramp up production of its 787 Dreamliner and 737 program in the near and medium term and its 777X in the longer term.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company's military business, long a source of concern for investors due to U.S. Defense spending cuts, is awaiting a decision on the next generation of strategic bomber from the U.S. Airforce while continuing to deliver a variety of other products to the U.S. Military. (Uncertainty) </span>The company also has a number of contracts with foreign governments to deliver many of its proven defense products.Despite these positives, the company's current share price is likely fairly valued at 19 times 2015 earnings.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Boeing will likely face continued Dreamliner cost deferments in the near term, a production slow down in the current generation 777 program in 2016, and possible design, engineering, or production delays in its 737 Max and 777X programs based on the nature and complexity of the programs and the company's recent history. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>All of these possible drags to its cash flow will be partially offset by rising rates of production for its commercial products, but the risks they pose are fairly priced in the stock at current levels and investors should wait for a pull back in share price before buying this strategically well positioned company.
