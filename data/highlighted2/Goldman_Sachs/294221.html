One day business school textbooks will be written about the management stylings of Marissa Evita Mayer Its an open secret that morale at Yahoo YHOO is hovering somewhere below Awful and pressure on Mayer to sell whats been left unburned by the tire fire of her reign is increasing To make things even worse last week rumors of massive layoffs began to swirl According to the NY Post it did not go well She said there are going to be no layoffs this week and many of the employees laughed at her said one insider who fearing retribution asked not to be named This is the reason employee morale is so low the insider added noting that most workers took the scary remark as twisted confirmation that Yahoos embattled chief executive is sharpening the ax Unintentional nervous laughter is a real red flag response to layoff news Even in an industry somewhat renowned for bizarre management techniques Marissa is growing in legend as one of the alltime wackily terrible execs in tech Word of the gaffe has been spreading like wildfire through Silicon Valley another insider said calling it the latest example of a chronically tonedeaf CEO in a crisis Indeed some in the audience laughed precisely because she wasnt trying to be funny according to the second source She was trying to make us believe it Speaking of things Marissa is desperate to make people believe according to the lexicon of Mayer no one at Yahoo ever gets laid off Mayers taste for word games when it comes to firing people in the past she has insisted on calling layoffs remixes has been a growing source of exasperation inside the company according to current and former employees See thats fun Its like getting fired by CC Music Factory Yahoo people must at least love that right I dont think people want to be mollified they want to be respected and trusted with facts so they can plan their lives and also help one source close to the situation said Marissa Mayer Has A Cool New Office Nickname Bonus Watch
