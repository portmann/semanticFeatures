bottom line as as result of a jump in iPhone sales even as iPad and Mac sales came in below the expectation EPS was vs consensus while revenues came in at billion billion higher than the billion expected While as expected AAPL had little to say about the Apple Watch launch merely noting that it is aiming to reach a supplydemand balance for the product by quarter end the breakdown by legacy product line reveals that it is still all about the iPhone whose sales came in at million above the million expected driven by a jump in Chinese demand with iPad sales being cannibalized while Mac sales dipped to million below expectations and the lowest since Q The result was a topline number that once again beat expectations coming in at billion for the March quarter But while AAPL certainly boosted sales volumes one may wonder if it didnt take too much of a margin hit with the average iPhone ASP of coming well below the expected As some had expected the ongoing surge in AAPL sales is courtesy of China where as the CFO reported the iPhone outsold the US while total China revenue was greater than all of Europe for the first time ever And while everyone is commenting on the surge of total AAPL cash to over billion a jump of billion what most are forgetting is that AAPL increasingly has a lot of debt some billion to be specific since it does not want to repatriate the bulk of its offshore cash which means that its cash net of debt rose more modestly from billion to billion As long as AAPL continues to be shareholder friendly dont expect the net cash number to rise much more than its current level But while the operations were impressive if China and iPhone centric what everyone is focusing on is the AAPL news that it once again expanded its buyback program en route to hitting the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>forecast of a record billion in for the entire SP by announcing it would boost its buyback authorization by more than from billion to billion Apple today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized an increase of more than percent to the Companys program to return capital to shareholders Under the expanded program Apple plans to utilize a cumulative total of billion of cash by the end of March As part of the revised program the Board has increased its share repurchase authorization to billion from the billion level announced last year In addition the Company expects to continue to netsharesettle vesting restricted stock units The Board has also approved an increase of percent to the Companys quarterly dividend and has declared a dividend of per share payable on May to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May From the inception of its capital return program in August through March Apple has returned over billion to shareholders including billion in share repurchases To assist in funding the program the Company plans to continue to access the domestic and international debt markets The management team and the Board will continue to review each element of the capital return program regularly and plan to provide an update on the program on an annual basis Yet it will because as a result of its cash being landlocked in foreign countries mostly China the companys debt has increased from billion a year ago to billion this quarter and is now rising at an aggressive clip Mon Diablo

in China Apple makes GM look like a channel stuffing amateur Every phone in China is prebooked as sold before it even makes it to a shelf Most never sell and just wait for filling a landfill Xiaomi Lenovo OnePlus and the rest of the Chinese homegrown companies are eating Apples lunch There is no American fruit company dominance in China The iPhone is two years behind in specs and three times more expensive The iPad is dead the macbooks are woefully behind and the watch is a pitiful excuse of a smug exercise The only reason why AAPL trades higher is because of buybacks and the stupidity of the investing public allowing the financial media brainwashing to take hold Mon orangegeek Its called boomerang product You push the product into the channel and it boomerangs back into your warehouse within months because it was never sold Mon HenryHall Stock buyback is the precise opposite of stock rights issue A rights issue is what a company does to finance growth After all if you did a rights
