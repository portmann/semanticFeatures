Morris Citigroup Global Markets Inc Broker Michael J Rowe Tudor Pickering Holt Co Securities Inc Michael Dugan Kelly Seaport Global Securities LLC John P Herrlin SG Americas Securities LLC Good morning and welcome to the Noble Energys Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call Following todays presentation there will be opportunity to ask questions Please note todays event is being recorded Brad Whitmarsh DirectorInvestor Relations was very bright At this time we would like to go ahead and open the call to questions Thank you for joining us today This morning we issued our quarterly earnings release and new guidance for the remainder of the year Following another strong quarter we have again raised our full year volume outlook for Noble Energy while keeping our capital program consistent with prior expectations Our new guidance and comments today also incorporate an outlook for these new Texas assets which were excited to share following the closing of the Rosetta Resources acquisition in late July We also posted to our website a number of supplemental slides for this call which youll find helpful as we talk through our prepared remarks Later this morning our Q will be available as well Following prepared comments from Dave Stover Chairman President and CEO and Gary Willingham Executive VP of Operations well open the call for questions and complete in about an hour We ask that participants limit themselves to one primary question and one followup Management members joining for the QA session are Ken Fisher Executive VP and CFO Susan Cunningham Executive VP Exploration and New Ventures and Keith Elliott Senior VP Eastern Med I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains projections and forwardlooking statements as well as certain nonGAAP financial measures You should read our full disclosures in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of those items With that Ill turn the call over to Dave David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Thanks Brad Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us I want to share with you why I continue to have great confidence in our business and strategy While these are challenging times in our industry it does not diminish the fact that Noble Energy has exceptional assets as well as the financial strength and operational excellence to realize their potential Our positive momentum including the recent closing of the Rosetta acquisition gives us great optimism for the future as we continue to execute on our strategy of driving value from a highquality diversified portfolio that provides investment choices Our core competitive advantages continue to be focused in US onshore unconventional development combined with material offshore explorations and proven major projects execution Additionally we have the financial strength to navigate through a volatile market and take advantage of opportunities All oil and natural gas companies are facing choppy seas right now but I believe investors are very wellpositioned with Noble Energy We continue to effectively manage the things that are within our control and position the business for longterm value creation Our diversified portfolio underpinned strong performance in the second quarter Volumes again exceeded expectations and meaningful reductions are being realized on both capital and operating costs Sales volumes were nearly barrels of oil equivalent per day even with the impact of scheduled facility maintenance in both the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa For the second time this year weve raised our Noble Energy legacy volume outlook for the full year This is a result of our flexibility to reallocate capital throughout the year as we continue to see efficiency improvements in the DJ Basin program Second quarter capital expenditures declined sequentially to under million and we remain on track to meet our original billion capital forecast Our capital is trending lower quarterly for the year as we manage the cash flow in the second half of the year Im also extremely pleased with our progress in reducing cash cost specifically in the onshore business where lease operating expense was reduced to approximately per barrel of oil equivalent in the quarter This is down more than from the first quarter Total lease operating expense per barrel of oil equivalent for Noble Energy is now back to pre level reflecting our portfolio changes and an intense focus on reducing controllable costs Operational execution continues to be an area of keen focus as we look to maximize longterm profitability with a number of a major accomplishments achieved during the second quarter This included onshore horizontal production growth of versus the same quarter of last year and record low drilling times in both the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale Drilled and completed costs all in are trending below targeted well costs in both plays In our offshore business the Ashdod compression project in Israel has been completed increasing our peak deliverability and at the same time pipeline installation and top site facility modifications are progressing as planned on Big Bend and Dantzler in the Gulf of Mexico First production from these fields is expected in the fourth quarter and around the end of the year respectively On the offshore drilling side we have three rigs currently operating one progressing our Gunflint development and two drilling material exploration wells including prospects offshore of the Falkland Islands and Cameroon So from an execution standpoint I am pleased with how our business is operating The acquisition of Rosetta enhances and further diversifies our onshore unconventional portfolio by adding two premier lowcost operating assets Strong underlying asset performance results from other operators in and around our acreage as well as recent MA activity in these basins continues to affirm the longterm value of our transaction It was the right opportunity at the right time for Noble Energy These highquality assets provide prolific and lowcost production in the Eagle Ford with running room and a deep inventory of liquidsrich opportunities in the emerging Delaware Basin Without question these new areas will have a substantial impact to Noble Energy When you think about more than barrels of oil equivalent per day of production at least identifiable locations and around billion barrels of oil equivalent potential thats a very sizable business that can grow materially into the future Weve hit the ground running and were already seeing more value potential than we originally assumed Combined our Texas assets will deliver compound annual growth for several years within the operating cash flows of this business As such we arent pulling capital away from any of our other strong return opportunities which is one reason this investment was so unique As shown on slide we now have sizable position in four of the premier US unconventional plays This provides substantial flexibility in our future capital allocation and the ability to accelerate activity when appropriate We will also realize about million per year in GA synergies while taking advantage of Nobles lower cost of capital Let me now hand it over to Gary to walk through an operations update Gary W Willingham EVPGlobal Production Supply Chain Activities Thanks Dave Id like to start off by sharing my thoughts on why the Rosetta acquisition was such a great move for Noble Energy Our technical knowledge of these basins was built over the last several years as our business development and new venture teams have set all of the best basins in the US From this work two things became apparent First we needed to focus our existing onshore US portfolio on the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale which consistently ranked among the top basins This caused us to exit a number of other plays over the last few years Second we wanted to be ready to further enhance our portfolio by capturing opportunities in other competitive basins when they became available The Eagle Ford and Delaware basins are both toptier plays and weve now obtained premier positions in some of the best parts of each Over the last few years we have dramatically improved performance in the DJ Basin and then transferred and accelerated those learnings into Marcellus With the addition of the Eagle Ford and Delaware positions we are confident that our operational expertise will again unlock incremental value that otherwise would not have been delivered Our acquisition model applied value almost entirely to the existing production the Lower Eagle Ford inventory and the Upper Wolfcamp potential in the Delaware We see a lot of room to increase value further from multizone development in both plays refrac potential and additional locations that are not assumed in our current counts The high quality nature of our Eagle Ford asset is demonstrated on slide The map illustrates estimated recoveries for lateral foot in the basin You can see the outline of our acreage the largest being a core position in Northern West County where we will focus our Eagle Ford activity over the next few years This is a sweet spot of some of the most productive rock in the play with tremendous resource recoveries ranging between million and million barrels of oil equivalent per well based on a foot lateral We have highlighted in the table our current assumptions including inventory counts based on current strip pricing and assumed spacing estimated ultimate recoveries and average well costs Highlighted on slide is the million barrel equivalent high curve type curve for South Gates Ranch represented by the blue line This is an increase of from Rosettas prior type curve shown in red The green line is the average of two recent wells which are outpacing even our increased type curve by another Weve provided our detailed Eagle Ford activity plans on slide showing accelerating well activity through at least Our plan is to focus on the lower Eagle Ford for the next few years increasing well lateral length to an average of around feet We are currently drilling our first Eagle Ford well and have already implemented improvements that have materially increased footage drilled per day Moving over to the Permian this is an area where we see tremendous value and upside as we accelerate appraisal activities and move quickly to development mode The Delaware is emerging as a worldclass basin with multizone potential Development plans will include multiwell pad drilling centralized production facilities and the potential for long laterals none of which were being done in these assets We will rapidly incorporate and leverage learnings from the DJ Basin and the Marcellus as we plan the longterm development of the basin Our focus in the Permian will be on the Delaware Basin position which is a contiguous net acres In the DJ Basin weve already experienced the significant value uplift that a largescale systematic development approach can bring in terms of maximizing recoveries lowering capital and operating costs and minimizing the above ground impacts On slide we have shown how this acreage compares to our DJ Basin East Pony IDP area in terms of size And so this is clearly a material position for Noble Weve already identified over gross locations based on current strip prices for development with of these in the Wolfcamp A and rd Bone Spring and the remainder in Lower Wolfcamp zones Highlighted on slide our recent Noble wells and those from other operators in and around our acreage For the Noble wells the peak day average production rate from a normalized foot lateral is nearly barrels of oil equivalent per day on a twostream basis and more than of this production is crude oil These production rigs are impressive and consistent with other operator results in the area Similar to what we have shown for the Eagle Ford we have provided our barrel of oil equivalent type curve again for a foot lateral on slide This type curve is up from Rosettas previous type curve Recent well performance represented by the wells in the green line gives us a lot of confidence in the potential of these assets Weve also highlighted on this slide some of the anticipated operating efficiencies that Noble Energy will bring to these assets You can see the substantial reduction in drilling cost per lateral foot that we have driven in the DJ Basin and Marcellus versus historical performance in these areas Combining Nobles drilling expertise and knowledge of multizone development with Rosettas skill set and knowledge will no doubt deliver substantial operational improvements in the Delaware On slide we have provided our detailed plans for acceleration in the Permian resulting in wells drilled in and anticipating continued activity growth beyond that Under the current plan capital investment in the Delaware is essentially equivalent to the Eagle Ford beginning next year and exceeds the Eagle Ford beginning in with even earlier accelerations at Delaware possible as our plans continue to evolve Our outlook for the combined sectors assets has production growing to more than barrels equivalent per day in as shown on slide We estimate substantial annual free cash flow at the end of our forecasted period which would only provide additional investment flexibility Ill now transition to the DJ Basin where both our underlying operational performance and the infrastructure capacity continue to improve Spud to rig release time average just over six days in the quarter for a standardlength lateral Last quarter it was seven days which was already below our budgeted assumption for Dave mentioned well costs are trending under our target for the year Second half allin well costs including drilling completion and allocated facilities are expected to be million in Wells Ranch and million in East Pony These are both below our budget assumptions In addition when you normalize our long lateral well costs back to a normallength equivalent well we are slightly below million for these more capitalefficient wells And roughly of our drilling in the second half of this year will be extended laterals With current rig efficiencies and four rigs for the rest of the year we expect to drill a total of equivalent wells in compared to our original budget expectation of about with the same number of rigs Thats an amazing increase in performance and a key contributor to our production uplift On the completion side we continue to optimize stage lengths proppant loads and fluid types across our IDPs Most recently weve seen very strong performance utilizing slickwater in East Pony with the majority of these wells outperforming similar hybrid gel completions nearby Our success in growth in East Pony has been tremendous Net production in the East Pony IDP is now approximately barrels of oil equivalent per day up from this time a year ago And as a reminder more than of East Pony volumes are oil At the end of the second quarter thirdparty infrastructure in Greater Wattenberg got a muchneeded boost with the startup of DCPs Lucerne gas processing plant which is ramping the full capacity of million cubic feet per day The addition of Lucerne is increasing thirdparty gas capacity on the DCP system by a third to a total of million cubic feet per day Now earlier this year in certain parts of the field line pressures averaged north of psi which created a tough producing environment for many of the legacy vertical and horizontal wells Since Lucerne startup weve seen line pressures reduced by as much as to psi in the early part of July And that should be even greater as the plant reaches full capacity Volumes through July averaged more than barrels of oil equivalent per day with peak days greater than per day Additional infrastructure projects in the basin continue to progress on schedule as well including the Grand Parkway low pressure gathering loop The combination of all of these projects position the basin well exiting and into And while we remain guarded in our production guidance until consistent midstream performance is seen the early look is certainly very positive Finally in the Marcellus Shale our operations continue to improve Our drilling teams are performing extremely well and we drilled our longest lateral ever as a company in the second quarter nearly foot horizontally In addition were looking forward to production results from our first Utica well before the end of the year Given the price environment were further reducing drilling activity in the basin in alignment with our joint venture partner In the middle part of the third quarter operated horizontal drilling will be reduced to zero rigs for the remainder of the year And on the dry gas nonoperated side we anticipate going from two horizontal rigs to zero early in the fourth quarter These shifts in drilling do not impact our completion schedule for the remainder of and we are working with our partner on the right level of investment for with both companies focused on a cashneutral program for the JV next year David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Thanks Gary I want to spend a few minutes on the progress on the regulatory front in Israel and our upgraded outlook before opening for questions Over the last several months weve worked diligently with the government on establishing a regulatory framework to provide necessary certainty for future investments The product is a comprehensive framework that addresses the needs and interest of all parties including Noble Energy the government and citizens of Israel and its neighbors who can all benefit from these abundant gas resources Both the Prime Ministers Office and the Minister of Energy have endorsed the framework and are working to achieve final approval For Noble Energy this framework should provide certainty around regulatory and fiscal matters necessary to support future investments in the expansion of Tamar and the first phase of development at Leviathan For Israel it provides price transparency and market competition These projects can develop additional gas supplies within the country and bring the financial and geopolitical benefits of regional exports We continue to engage with future export customers in the region on the potential to deliver both Israeli and Cypriot gas to market The opportunity for expansion of natural gas used in Israel and the demand for natural gas in the region remain strong I look forward to unlocking tremendous unrecognized value in Noble as these projects come together Companywise there are a number of positive catalysts in the second half of the year which provides us near and longterm benefits We are encouraged that production capacity in the DJ Basin will continue to respond positively as we benefit from important infrastructure expansions while we focus on long laterals and additional completion learnings through the remainder of the year As Gary mentioned the integration of the Rosetta assets was going very well With a strong second quarter where volumes were higher and costs lower than expected these assets are off to a great start and complementary to Nobles overall performance Offshore two new fields are anticipated to add barrels equivalent per day by the end of the year in the Gulf of Mexico In addition we will have results on two material exploration prospects this quarter including millionbarrelplus Humpback prospect in the Falkland Islands and million barrels plus Cheetah prospect in Cameroon Success in either of these wells or with our Rhea well in the Falkland later this year would derisk additional exploration potential provide new development opportunity and add significant value for Noble Energy As mentioned earlier we are raising our previous full year volume guidance Im pleased that we can see this amount of increase while holding full year capital flat to original plan and maintaining flexibility in our onshore activity should conditions and cash flow outlook change Weve also provided new quarterly guidance for the remainder of the year which includes the integration of the Eagle Ford and Permian assets Base guidance reflects the quarterly trend of lower capital and operating cost through the remainder of the year while underlying volumes growth Yes these are tough times but we are well positioned with exceptional assets and strong operating and financial capacity to navigate through these challenges no matter the duration Weve been very thoughtful in our decision processes throughout the year as we continue to maintain strong capital discipline and manage the cash flow in the second half of the year I am convinced Noble Energys future is very bright Well now begin the questionandanswer session The first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch Doug Leggate Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thank you Good morning everybody Dave I wonder if I could squeeze a couple in My first one is really just a point of clarification I think on one of Garys comments relating to cash I guess breakeven or neutrality Obviously youre not there yet and youve got a bunch of startups in in the deepwater I guess backend of this year and So what should we think in terms of you getting to cash breakeven Is that an objective for management Or do you expect to continue spending for the time being And Ive got a followup please David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Yeah Doug when you look at how were managing the cash flow if you look how that plays out this year and especially when you I refer you to the guidance we laid out for third and fourth quarter You see our capital spend continues to come down dramatically as we enter the fourth quarter A big part of that is the rolloff if you will of the capital spending on some of those Gulf of Mexico projects Well actually have Dantzler on here by middle of the fourth quarter and or I mean Big Bend by middle of the fourth quarter and Dantzler by the end of the year So youll have two of the three big projects and their capital spend actually rolling off So we expect to be even in this to world we expect to be managing the cash flow here by the end of the year and that will set us up very nicely for next year Doug Leggate Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thats what I was hoping to hear Thanks Dave My followup is Im sure theres going to be a ton of questions on Rosetta So Im going to go to a different one if I may which is the Marcellus decision to take rigs away there Im just wondering if you could tell us what the underlying decline rate is going to look like in the Marcellus with no rigs running And Ill let someone else take the other ones Thanks David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Yes Doug I think the real decision there is that its not the time to be continuing to drill wells in the Marcellus with the outlook on gas price till we see that change That being said with some of the completion inventory and some of the completion activity well still be ramping up in the second half of this year And I think well still be flat to up some next year with that inventory even with the drilling activity I think the real impact of the drilling activity is when you start to look at the late and into timeframe And then that will be dependent on when we ramp back up will be dependent on our outlook for gas price Doug Leggate Bank of America Merrill Lynch So we shouldnt confuse no drilling rigs with no completion activity is that what youre basically saying Doug Leggate Bank of America Merrill Lynch David W Kistler Simmons Company International Real quickly following up on the CapEx just a little bit for If I look at your run rate in Q can I assume that thats kind of the run rate youll be doing on a quarterly basis going forward plus incrementals associated with Delaware and Eagle Ford kind of round numbers And I know you dont want to commit to a number but put you down yearoveryear maybe around the type number David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Yeah Dave I think when we look at and youre right its too early to get too far ahead of ourselves but when you at it and you look at how were finishing this year and how were set up for next year weve got a lot of flexibility I mean when I sit here and look at managing the cash flow we can be down significantly in capital and still realize low to midsingledigit production growth So I think that positions us extremely well and that flexibility allows us to adapt to a changing environment and a changing cash flow environment to be ready to accelerate when it makes sense and to be able to have the flexibility to hold back if that makes sense but still have a growing business David W Kistler Simmons Company International Okay I appreciate that color And then maybe one more just flipping over to the Delaware where you guys outlined your cost on an annual basis in the wells obviously when I look at if I just did the math on wells versus capital it would assume a pretty high cost that comes down dramatically by to about million a well I assume is incorporating upfront infrastructure associated with kind of the IDPs And maybe if thats the case could you talk to us a little bit about the capital or cash flow savings benefits you see from IDPs David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Yeah Dave We wanted to make sure we laid out for all of the Rosetta assets what our plan looks like for the next three years So Id take a hard look at all that Ill have Gary add some color to some of this But Ill start with that when you look at and even the future years on some of the Delaware piece youve got a mix of operated and nonoperated spend in there and I think we asterisked that I think you also have some facility capital upfront as you put in some of this You brought up the point of the IDPs and I think and we showed kind of the overlay how that Delaware Basin acreage compares to for example an East Pony acreage position up there I think it sets up extremely well for being able to apply the IDP concept in some that value that that will bring over time But let me have Gary just talk a little bit more Gary W Willingham EVPGlobal Production Supply Chain Activities Yeah Dave Thats right I mean its largely driven by fluctuations that we forecast in nonop activity in addition to some upfront infrastructure costs And Daves right Our experience in the DJ Basin has clearly shown that preinvesting in infrastructure in these areas certainly pays off in the long run Every time we look at our performance in the DJ we see to uplift in the present value of those projects by our IDPtype concept in the integrated infrastructures So we do have some pretty investment in there for that as well David W Kistler Simmons Company International Okay I really appreciate that added color Thank you guys and great work Ryan Todd Deutsche Bank Securities Inc Great Thanks Maybe if I can follow up on capital one more time As you think about the run rate into and the priority this outline up to this point if commodity prices were to be lower or higher can you talk a little bit about how you would prioritize either further reduction in capital Or if the commodity price were a little bit higher where we should expect to see additional acceleration or capital increase David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Well I think weve added some more flexibility and diversity when you look at our mix of onshore assets now I think between the Marcellus weve talked about our thinking about that going into the year On the DJ well continue to see the impact of the Lucerne plant coming up Well see the linelooping system later this year so Ill give some more insight on how we want to play off capital and match capital with capacity going into next year And then in both the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford weve laid out our base plan Id say all of those we got the flexibility to adapt and adjust if it makes sense when you look at the commodity outlook Our big offshore projects the only one really well still have in play next year well be finishing Gunflint The majority of that investment will be done by this year Well have Gunflint on line by middle of next year We finished the compression project at Ashdod this year so the next investment in Israel will be dependent on this framework coming together So I think were in real good place there on the exploration front Well have our rig in the Gulf of Mexico focused on appraisal and exploration next year But overall were well positioned to bring capital down continue to follow the trend that weve got into the fourth quarter this year and then make sure were managing to the outlook that we see Ryan Todd Deutsche Bank Securities Inc And is there explicit commodity price implicit in the guidance for the Delaware and Eagle Ford programs David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Ryan Todd Deutsche Bank Securities Inc Great Thanks And then maybe if I can ask one on the revisions to the type curve you talked about a few of the things that youre doing differently But can you maybe theyve been impressive obviously particularly in a relatively short period of time Can you talk a little bit about the primary drivers of the revisions up to this point changes that youve made and maybe the types of wells that were drilling I know theres some in lateral lengths And maybe even what youre seeing on the most recent performance thats still exceeding the revisedtype curves David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Yeah Ill let Gary expand on it but really it comes down to just the recent well performance Not only our recent well performance but recent well performance in the basin for example in the Delaware And then in the Eagle Ford we have history especially as you move into South Gates Ranch from some wells that were drilled previously and then the more recent wells So you have a nice database in both areas Gary Gary W Willingham EVPGlobal Production Supply Chain Activities Yeah Ryan First off as I mentioned lateral length those curves are normalized to a foot lateral So even though were drilling longer and longer laterals in the area thats not driving the type curve Daves right Its really two things its moving more south into the Gates Ranch area which is a much more prolific area and then its just continuing to improve on the completion designs Very similar to what weve done in the DJ Basin and the Marcellus with reduced stage and cluster spacing and also starting to increase our sand loadings up to pounds in some cases So a lot of the same types of things weve done in the other areas just bringing them to the Eagle Ford and soon to be the Permian as well Leo Mariani RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey guys Just wanted to get a little bit more color on Israel When you guys expect to see a vote and I guess a final approval do you have a rough timeframe for the new regulatory framework And then additionally if that occurs when will you guys start spending capital there David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Yeah Leo I mean were watching it as everybody is as the government kind of gone through the public process and theyre in the process of working to bring that framework to final resolution final approval I think were both committed and still remain committed to seeing this done by the end of the summer But Ill say the timing is important on this but the actual lasting and sustainable framework and the nature of the framework and having a framework that allows us to move forward with investment it is really the most important element I think whats very encouraging so far is that and think back about this When you go back to over the last year whats been accomplished I mean the progress on getting to a framework has been nothing short of a tremendous effort on all parties on party of the government thats committed to doing this and on our team and our partners that have worked so hard to bring that to bear I mean a complete comprehensive framework that sets up the ability to go forward with confidence and investment is a big step Another big step has been the commitment and support of the Prime Ministers Office and the Energy Ministry to make this happen So I think when you look at it the step of getting the framework to where it is and now the recognition and understanding of how important this is not only to the country but to the region has just been tremendous Leo Mariani RBC Capital Markets LLC Thats helpful color And I guess just shifting gears over to the exploration front obviously you guys are drilling away at I guess Humpback in the Falkland and Cheetah as well Do you guys kind of have a rough probability of success on each of those two wells respectively David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Well Ill go through what weve kind of laid out on probabilities and then Susan can probably give you some more insight as to her thoughts on both of those wells And then also dont forget the Rhea prospect later this year which probably has a slightly higher probability I think on Humpback and Cheetah theyre both in that plus or minus range both interesting exciting prospects both with a little different color In Humpback thats our first true exploration test on this huge acreage position down in the Falklands I mean you think about it you think about how our acreage position overlays the North Sea for example Its just our position down there in the Falkland thats about half of the North Sea Thatll be really interesting to see what that transpires here as we break out a new play but its a new play in areas where theres been proven hydrocarbon discovery some fairly significant when you look at the whole scheme of things In Cameroon you know what to me whats exciting there its like Gulf of Mexico prospect on steroids as Ive talked about it when you look at the shallow water depths and the high potential but let me turn it over to the real expert here Susan Susan M Cunningham Executive VPGlobal Exploration New Ventures Frontier EHSR Business Innovation Okay Dave Yeah Dave The is about right plus or minus for the two prospects that are drilling right now and Rhea will be higher than that regardless of the outcome of Humpback Whats great about Humpback is the followup Its over billion barrels of oil equivalent just in that immediate area if we have some encouragement there So its pretty significant And Cheetah is only miles offshore from the coast in Cameroon and its in about feet of water so it will be very quick and easy and cheap to tie in and to develop if its successful Our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice Charles A Meade Johnson Rice Co LLC Yes Good morning Dave and to the rest of your team there I was wondering if I could ask a bit about the Eagle Ford assets and your outlook there I think you mentioned in your prepared comments and also on the slides that your location count at the strip But as I look at these assets one of the things that set them apart is the NGL percentage The Street is a little more obscure when it comes to talking about NGLs Can you talk about what your current assumptions are there and what your outlook is especially in light of its been kind of the maybe its take it on the chin hard here in and maybe what your thoughts are for an outlook and how that affects your appetite for those NGLheavy assets David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Well I think its something you have to take a hard look at Charles I think as weve looked at it weve not assumed that NGL pricings are really going to change a lot this year I think as we look at it and visit with our marketing folks that probably into next year as you get more ships and so forth especially can move more propane and butane that just start to see some real alleviation of pressure there That being said you are close to the Gulf Coast and some of the Gulf Coast markets with the Eagle Ford volume so thats helpful But its just part of the mix that we take into effect and account when we look at the economics of these And Ill say the economics of the Eagle Ford especially as youre hearing Gates Ranch and South Gates Ranch stack up with everything and anything even considering all those Charles A Meade Johnson Rice Co LLC Got it So David I think I heard that you think therell be some improvement of NGL prices in the timeframe as you get more export capacity David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Thats what were hopeful I think its going to take something like that to really change that outlook Charles A Meade Johnson Rice Co LLC Got it Thank you And then on the Delaware Basin can you talk about the slide you put together with your results and energy results is really helpful And you really focus on the Wolfcamp A there but can you talk about what you mentioned other zones Can you talk about what those other zones are going to be in rough order of what you think the prospectivity is And what your timeline would be to test some of those other concepts David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Yeah I mean youre right Charles that were focusing initially on the Wolfcamp A And I think within that you have to look at how do you most effectively drain that whole Wolfcamp A horizon I think theres opportunities to maybe even have multiple laterals not that were counting on that in that Wolfcamp A that also start to pick up some of that rd Bone Spring drainage David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer But I think those would be the two initial pieces And then you move down to kind of B and C as a longer term optionality that I dont doubt the industry will break out economically over time but were not counting on it Charles A Meade Johnson Rice Co LLC Got it So that kind of more extensive development of the Wolfcamp A that could get the rd Bone Spring thats something we could maybe start to see in David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer I think as we get into and also in where we kind of start to see the Delaware program really ramp up youll start to draw in some of that horizon So well start to see some impact from that from but really still what weve laid out as a plan is landing all our laterals into Wolfcamp A David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Though we havent specifically target landing a lateral in the Bone Springs yet in that program Brian A Singer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs Co When you built your position in the DJ you followed your Patina acquisition with the US Exploration acquisition As you look to the Eagle Ford and Permian whats your ultimate goal in terms of the size of the position youre looking for and do you see additional opportunities that are front and center in this downturn to make that happen David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Yeah Brian Ill go back to what weve talked about since we announced the Rosetta acquisition One of the first keys to Rosetta was to be comfortable that in and of itself it had an enough size and growth within those assets that it wasnt dependent on another acquisition That said being in the neighborhood I think well continue to look at whats available out there and make sure we understand the value of different opportunities Id say we have a strong solid balance sheet that gives us the ability and flexibility to be able to take advantage of opportunities if a great opportunity came around But thats not the focus of what were doing now The focus of what were doing now is on execution And I think you can see that showing up not only in what was delivered in the first half of the year but what were set up to deliver in the second half of the year and thats the same focus were applying to the Rosetta assets Brian A Singer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs Co Thats a good tiein to my followup which is on that execution point in the legacy assets the increased guidance that seem to reflect a lot of your outlook for a secondhalf uplift Can you just talk more specifically about the drivers of the increased production guidance between the Marcellus DJ or elsewhere David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Glad to Brian Actually weve been looking forward to this call for a period of time because weve been looking forward to getting to midyear here The exciting part for us is we put a plan in effect at the beginning of the year and we got in motion very very quickly And now were benefiting from the results of delivering on that plan Id say were actually ahead of that plan and I think thats framed in what you look at for the outlook for the second half of the year When you go back to what we started the year we ramped down and pushed down the Marcellus program pretty quickly We very quickly reduced activity levels in the DJ from rigs to We levelloaded and kind of slowed down some of our completion activity so we could get Lucerne in place As a result of how things have moved through the year we actually saw some of the Marcellus planned capital come down We actually moved some of that capital to the DJ Part of that was a reflection on just the continued improvement on efficiency Weve talked before about those four rigs are drilling about of the total lateral footage that we did with rigs So thats all enabled us to where the real driver in the second half of the year and the biggest driver in that increased guidance is the outlook on this activity and performance in the DJ Brian A Singer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs Co Got it And thats partly as you say on the well productivity front but also on just unlocking midstream bottlenecks David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer I think it all comes together and Gary may have some more to add on his thoughts there Gary W Willingham EVPGlobal Production Supply Chain Activities Yeah I think its unlocking the midstream bottlenecks which we had some increase in there in the original budget but weve added a bit more based on the early results were seeing Its partly the underlying improvement and the completions We mentioned the phenomenal success that weve seen recently in East Pony and then its just a greater number of wells coming online throughout the year as weve continued to drive down the drilling times Our next question comes from Bob Morris with Citi Robert Scott Morris Citigroup Global Markets Inc Broker Thank you Gary you confirmed that the increase in the type curves at Gates Ranch and Eagle Ford were driven a lot by the cluster spacing and the sand loadings I know overall costs have come down but on todays costs can you quantify for every or the to increase in EURs what the associated increase in cost is percentagewise or due in increased cluster spacing in the greater proppant loading Gary W Willingham EVPGlobal Production Supply Chain Activities Yeah Bob I think its probably on the range But at the same time I think weve got greater efficiencies that are going to offset quite a bit of that I think when you look at what were seeing already on the drilling side since weve closed the deal we have been able on these first couple of wells to significantly improve the drilling times especially through the lateral length And I think at the end of the day were going to be able to take probably conservatively a couple of days off of the average drill time on the Eagle Ford well So certainly more stages or more cluster spacing and greater sand loadings adds to the cost but we see some efficiencies offsetting that Robert Scott Morris Citigroup Global Markets Inc Broker Okay And then a second question just on refracs In the Marcellus I know youre laying down all your rigs this year but will you continue to test refracs in the Marcellus and what have you seen there And then in the Eagle Ford you mentioned some of the upside being potential for refracs What gives you confidence that refracs can be successful in that play Gary W Willingham EVPGlobal Production Supply Chain Activities Yeah Its a combination really of refrac and in some cases adding perfs or tightening up those cluster spacing just like were doing on the new completion So we may have a few more scheduled in the Marcellus this year I dont think its going to be a significant number but the early results weve seen on the ones weve done have been very encouraging initial rates back up to the original initial rates in many cases I think what gives us the same level of confidence in the Eagle Ford is on those older completions Very much kind of a similar story to the Marcellus much wider stage spacing fewer perf clusters and so its an opportunity to go in and not only add perfs but improve the completion designs as well So I think well see some nice uplift there as well Robert Scott Morris Citigroup Global Markets Inc Broker When do you plan to do your first refrac in Eagle Ford Gary W Willingham EVPGlobal Production Supply Chain Activities Oh I dont know weve got one on the schedule yet We may try a couple before yearend but I would suspect will be more of a test Our next question comes from Michael Rowe with Tudor Pickering Holt Company Michael J Rowe Tudor Pickering Holt Co Securities Inc Yes Good morning Just want to quickly confirm that your Marcellus capital spending for this year is still going to be maintained at that million level And does the DJ Basin also staying at billion given the additional wells that you talked about adding into the program David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Yeah Michael I think on the Marcellus its probably just a hair under that which permits the DJ maybe a being a hair above that So I think plus or minus million on either of those Michael J Rowe Tudor Pickering Holt Co Securities Inc Okay I got it And then just one corporately can you just talk about how comfortable you are with your current hedge book and discuss how youre going to approach adding on more protection given the volatility David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Yeah Ill make a few comments and then Ken Fisher can add to that because he watches that continuously Drags me into more meetings than I can believe on that But no were taking a hard look at that all the time I mean we do meet on that probably every couple of weeks to look at what makes sense how is the market move how are we positioned for not just the current year but the following two years as we look at both our global oil mix and our domestic gas mix Its also a time period where we reflect and remind ourselves how appreciative we are of having our Israel gas contribution also thats kind of a natural hedge additional hedge if you will But we continue to look for periods especially in any market upswings which wed like to see more of on a commodity basis But as we get into some market upswings how do we layer in some positions as we go forward Our philosophy and objective has been to hedge up to on those different streams for managing cash flow I think with our legacy position on oil we were about for next year And I think on gas it was to somewhere in that range But Ill let Ken add up a little more color Kenneth M Fisher Chief Financial Officer Executive Vice President I mean as Dave said the program has been very successful through time ensuring that we cut off the tail risk So if you look at it historically we had big positive settlements in in the global financial crisis and then well have about million in settlement this year Were as Dave mentioned about hedged on oil hedged on gas going into next year We dont typically make big moves all at one time but average in so well continue to look at that And then we picked up the Rosetta hedge book as well and theyre pretty well hedged as well about for oil and on gas production next year So all in all our competitive position on the hedge book is strong and its a shock absorber that allows us to realize those gains as we bring down the capital plan for the current investment environment and achieve cash flow neutrality Our next question comes from Mike Kelly with Seaport Global Michael Dugan Kelly Seaport Global Securities LLC Hey guys Good morning Just hoping to get a little bit more color on the production profile in the DJ You dropped sequentially Q to Q but the July numbers look good And with the midstream constraints abating and efficiency gains become more apparent just hoping just talk about what the progression could look like here in the second half and then maybe just initial thoughts going into there David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Yeah Ill start with the and then have Gary provide some more insights But yeah as Gary said in his notes in his dialogue earlier weve still remained pretty guarded as to what the full impact of this Lucerne facility will be and then still what the lineloop will be later this year Were seeing some very good encouraging results I would say we expect volumes to be up from second quarter and third and fourth But I think itll be nice to get this Lucerne plant fully ramped up Its been down here for not down but its been impacted by the fact that theyve had another facility planned maintenance that we still got a couple of weeks to see the full impact out there but weve been very very pleased with what weve seen so far at this rampup And let me have Gary give you some more color on that Gary W Willingham EVPGlobal Production Supply Chain Activities Yeah Mike its Q and Q will definitely be up from Q in our guidance and second were days So were being very guarded I would say at this point until we see more of a sustained performance The early look is very encouraging though and weve said were north of in July peak days greater than Weve actually even seen a couple of days in the range So that is all without Lucerne running at full capacity yet and they havent yet made it to the million a day In the meantime as Dave mentioned theyve had another facility down for some planned maintenance which took about million a day out of the system capacity So thats part of the reason were still being a bit conservative for now until we see more than just a couple of days with some decent rates through the system But I think from the early performance were seeing line pressures down psi to psi across the field when theyve got everything up and running very excited about what were seeing I think well see some very nice numbers in the Q and Q there David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer And should really position us well as we exit the year Gary W Willingham EVPGlobal Production Supply Chain Activities And as we exit the year then the Grand Parkway starts up which provides even greater pressure relief and allows us even a better opportunity to get some of those legacy vertical volumes that have been so constrained over the last yearandahalf into the plants Michael Dugan Kelly Seaport Global Securities LLC Okay Great guys Good color And the followup is on the Eagle Ford If you look at the page of your presentation here it does look like its a pretty big delta in the lateral foot EURs and you talked about the kind of the sweet spot here in the Southern Gates Ranch area Maybe if you could talk about the difference in returns between that acreage versus what youd seize in the Upper Eagle Ford and what youve categorized as other Lower Eagle Ford And then as a followup to that just what the opportunity set is to ultimately see the number of gross locations increase in that kind of Boe per lateral foot area Thank you David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Yeah Ill start with that But yeah I mean the Southern Gates Ranch Eagle Ford is the best of the best down there And you can see that even when you compare that across all the Eagle Ford acreage in the basin It is a pure sweet spot there And then when you compare it so its got the highest returns obviously Id say everything that weve put on here has a decent return at a strip price especially when you look out into the future And the Upper Eagle Ford probably has the most challenge yet but I think weve got plenty of time before we get to those opportunities and I would expect well continue to improve the outlook on those by the time we get there beyond that time period But Gary did you have anything else Gary W Willingham EVPGlobal Production Supply Chain Activities Yeah The South Gates Ranch is really is the area were focusing in right now And when you look at how prolific those wells are I mean we see returns even in current strip price conditions of to returns in those areas so extremely strong economics The other Gates Ranch Lower Eagle Ford is obviously lower return than that given the EUR per lateral foot but still quite economic in this price environment And then as Dave mentioned the Upper Eagle Ford is the most challenged todate but we do have awhile before we get there So hopefully well see a little help on those from prices improving in the meantime Im confident well see help between now and then as we continue to refine the completion techniques in the areas where were working in the meantime David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer And its also worth noting that those locations referenced are only the locations that met an economic hurdle within the strip pricing environment So more opportunity beyond that if we get a little better in pricing environment at some point Our next question comes from John Herrlin from Socit Gnrale John P Herrlin SG Americas Securities LLC Thanks Regarding the Delaware youve given an outline of how youre going to spend in terms of drilling completions and IDPs Would it be your best interest to own more infrastructure there so you dont have similar bottlenecks as youve had in the DJ with a thirdparty GTP or youll just kind of wind your business strategically like you did in the DJ and the Delaware David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Yeah John I think when you look at it theres probably more infrastructure close to there in the basin than there was with what we started in the DJ That being said I think as we continue to look at how to create the most value both from integrating the subsurface with the surface facility piece and especially as we start getting further into an IDP concept well continue to look as to what makes sense from an overall facility structure But I think this is all about going in and having a totally integrated plan if you will that includes everything from how you produce it under the ground how you market it on the surface John P Herrlin SG Americas Securities LLC Okay Thanks Dave Last one for me is on the estimated dry hole cost for Humpback and Cheetah Susan could give me that David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer I think yeah If I remember right John on the Humpback its plus or minus million well I think David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer And weve got what and were paying a little disproportionate higher percentage than that as far as what it took to get into the play On Cheetah its a much cheaper well I think thats maybe in the milliontype range maybe on the high side on that But again on Humpback a big part of the cost is mobilization cost also the allocated mobilization down there part of the rig sharing But I think those are order of magnitude and Susan will correct me if Im wrong Susan M Cunningham Executive VPGlobal Exploration New Ventures Frontier EHSR Business Innovation Yeah thats correct Those are exactly the right order of magnitude Our next question comes from Philip Jungwirth with BMO Phillip J Jungwirth BMO Capital Markets United States With the increase in Eagle Ford and Wolfcamp EURs is there a reason the Boe a day production target by is unchanged with this improvement and recoveries already considered at the time of acquisition or is this just conservatism around giving multiyear growth target David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Weve matched up the growth with the capital spend and the activity level Again youve got flexibility here as conditions change and more information available to continue to update that But what were doing right now is honoring the activity level and performance that weve input into the model to layout that threeyear program along with the capital and cash flow that it provides So well continue to update that as we go Were just two weeks into this since weve closed but very excited about what weve got and where were going Phillip J Jungwirth BMO Capital Markets United States Great And then with minimal capital being allocated to Marcellus in the second half and likely into and Noble having a deep portfolio of high return opportunities to allocate capital towards how strategic is this asset to the company And do we need to consider anything about the JV structure impacting a potential divestiture should you choose that route David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer I think what we like about the Marcellus it is still the premier gas play in the US And when you look at the operational performance its been outstanding out there but its that operational performance across the industry thats contributed to this supplydemand imbalance I think when you look about at it though you love having a highquality asset thats the premier asset in its mix in the portfolio and the optionality that that gives you for the future with the tremendous amount in running room The other thing thats I think very nice about our position and same with the JV is the fact that its all essentially held by production out there So you have the flexibility to adapt to changing conditions and make sure that youre making smart decisions on how you create the most value out of an asset like this Phillip J Jungwirth BMO Capital Markets United States Great Can you update us on your latest thoughts around the DJ Basin midstream MLP I didnt see a mention in the presentation Just any color around specific assets invested capital or EBITDA would help David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Yes On the DJ midstream weve worked and weve talked about it over the last couple of calls being in position and having the asset set up so that weve got flexibility on how we monetize and create value and leverage our midstream business up there if you will So weve got that in place I think we still have the flexibility to decide what we want to do with that When you look at that part of the business that weve kind of bracketed if you will if I remember right and Ken will straight me up if I misquote this but I think weve probably spent million to million invested in those assets so far Irene Oiyin Haas Wunderlich Securities Inc Hello This will be quick Question on Cyprus so a little more color on the timeline From this point on how many sort of months would we require to kind of get through the necessary steps to probably first production David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Cyprus its still ways off in the future but its a great opportunity We got a sizable discovery there I think the next steps in Cyprus are establishing a market which were in discussions with potential customers on and then establishing someone to invest and put the equity and then laying the pipeline thats probably be required to establish and tie in that market So I think thats the sequence of things Irene Irene Oiyin Haas Wunderlich Securities Inc So its going to be a subsea pipeline or what are we thinking David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Definitely I think what youd be thinking is a subsea line One of the possibilities is a line from Cyprus that would tie in to Egypt given the needs and the regional demand in that part of the world but thats why we got to get the customers in place first and also the equity owners in a pipeline I think when you think of things over there weve got three big projects over there between Tamar expansion Leviathan and Cyprus that are all pretty interesting in their own rights Irene Oiyin Haas Wunderlich Securities Inc So great Were looking at two to three years possibly David L Stover Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Id say at least that period I think what were thinking of on something like that the endofthedecade type of thing Keith do you have any additional thoughts on that J Keith Elliott Senior VPEastern Mediterranean Region Yes So for first production looking at late mid kind of timeframe I think in terms of sequence forward really were progressing the marketing efforts now as Dave described in building the project team and progressing toward a project FID that would put us in place for that kind of late a decade first production
