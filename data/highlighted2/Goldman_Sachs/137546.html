Singer - <b>Goldman</b> Sachs & Co. . Got it.And that's partly, as you say, on the well productivity front but also on just unlocking midstream bottlenecks.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer I think it all comes together, and Gary may have some more to add on his thoughts there. (Uncertainty) </span>Gary W. Willingham - EVP-Global Production & Supply Chain Activities Yeah.I think it's unlocking the midstream bottlenecks, which we had some increase in there in the original budget, but we've added a bit more based on the early results we're seeing.It's partly the underlying improvement and the completions.We mentioned the phenomenal success that we've seen recently in East Pony and then it's just a greater number of wells coming online throughout the year as we've continued to drive down the drilling times.Our next question comes from Bob Morris with Citi.Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Thank you.Gary, you confirmed that the increase in the type curves at Gates Ranch and Eagle Ford were driven a lot by the cluster spacing and the sand loadings.I know overall costs have come down, but on today's costs, can you quantify for every 30% or the 25% to 30% increase in EURs what the associated increase in cost is percentage-wise or due in increased cluster spacing in the greater proppant (47:10) loading?Gary W. Willingham - EVP-Global Production & Supply Chain Activities Yeah, Bob.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think it's probably on the 10% range. (Uncertainty) </span>But at the same time, I think we've got greater efficiencies that are going to offset quite a bit of that.I think when you look at what we're seeing already on the drilling side since we've closed the deal, we have been able on these first couple of wells to significantly improve the drilling times, especially through the lateral length.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And I think at the end of the day, we're going to be able to take probably conservatively a couple of days off of the average drill time on the Eagle Ford well. (Uncertainty) </span>So certainly, more stages or more cluster spacing and greater sand loadings adds to the cost, but we see some efficiencies offsetting that.Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Okay.And then a second question just on refracs.In the Marcellus, I know you're laying down all your rigs this year, but will you continue to test refracs in the Marcellus and what have you seen there?And then in the Eagle Ford, you mentioned some of the upside being potential for refracs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What gives you confidence that refracs can be successful in that play? (Uncertainty) </span>Gary W. Willingham - EVP-Global Production & Supply Chain Activities Yeah.It's a combination really of refrac and in some cases, adding perfs or tightening up those cluster spacing, just like we're doing on the new completion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So we may have a few more scheduled in the Marcellus this year. (Uncertainty) </span>I don't think it's going to be a significant number, but the early results we've seen on the ones we've done have been very encouraging, initial rates back up to the original initial rates in many cases.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think what gives us the same level of confidence in the Eagle Ford is on those older completions. (Uncertainty) </span>Very much kind of a similar story to the Marcellus, much wider stage spacing, fewer perf clusters, and so it's an opportunity to go in and not only add perfs, but improve the completion designs as well.So I think we'll see some nice uplift there as well.Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) When do you plan to do your first refrac in Eagle Ford?Gary W. Willingham - EVP-Global Production & Supply Chain Activities Oh, I don't know we've got one on the schedule yet.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We may try a couple before year-end, but I would suspect 2016 will be more of a test. (Uncertainty) </span>Our next question comes from Michael Rowe with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.Securities, Inc.Yes.Good morning.Just want to quickly confirm that your Marcellus capital spending for this year is still going to be maintained at that $700 million level.And does the DJ Basin also staying at $1.1 billion, given the additional wells that you talked about adding into the program?David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Yeah, Michael.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think on the Marcellus, it's probably just a hair under that, which permits the DJ maybe a being a hair above that. (Uncertainty) </span>So, I think plus or minus $100 million on either of those.Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.Securities, Inc.Okay.I got it.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And then just one corporately, can you just talk about how comfortable you are with your current hedge book and discuss how you're going to approach adding on more protection given the volatility? (Uncertainty) </span>David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Yeah.I'll make a few comments and then Ken Fisher can add to that, because he watches that continuously.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Drags me into more meetings than I can believe on that. (Uncertainty) </span>But, no, we're taking a hard look at that all the time.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I mean, we do meet on that probably every couple of weeks to look at what makes sense; how is the market move; how are we positioned for not just the current year, but the following two years as we look at both our global oil mix and our domestic gas mix. (Uncertainty) </span>It's also a time period where we reflect and remind ourselves how appreciative we are of having our Israel gas contribution, also that's kind of a natural hedge, additional hedge, if you will.But we continue to look for periods especially in any market upswings, which we'd like to see more of on a commodity basis.But as we get into some market upswings, how do we layer in some positions as we go forward?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Our philosophy and objective has been to hedge up to 50% on those different streams for managing cash flow. (Uncertainty) </span>I think with our legacy position on oil, we were about 30% for next year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And I think on gas, it was 25% to 28%, somewhere in that range. (Uncertainty) </span>But I'll let Ken add up a little more color.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Kenneth M. Fisher - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President I mean, as Dave said, the program has been very successful through time, ensuring that we cut off the tail risk. (Uncertainty) </span>So, if you look at it historically, we had big positive settlements in 2009 in the global financial crisis, and then we'll have about $750 million in settlement this year.We're, as Dave mentioned, about 30% hedged on oil; 25% hedged on gas going into next year.We don't typically make big moves all at one time, but average in, so we'll continue to look at that.And then we picked up the Rosetta hedge book as well and they're pretty well hedged as well, about 35% for oil and 45% on gas production next year.So, all in all, our competitive position on the hedge book is strong and it's a shock absorber that allows us to realize those gains as we bring down the capital plan for the current investment environment and achieve cash flow neutrality.Our next question comes from Mike Kelly with Seaport Global.Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC Hey, guys.Good morning.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Just hoping to get a little bit more color on the production profile in the DJ. (Uncertainty) </span>You dropped sequentially Q1 to Q2, but the July numbers look good.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And with the midstream constraints abating and efficiency gains become more apparent, just hoping just talk about what the progression could look like here in the second half and then maybe just initial thoughts going into 2016 there. (Uncertainty) </span>David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Yeah.I'll start with the (53:18) and then have Gary provide some more insights.But, yeah, as Gary said in his notes, in his dialogue earlier, we've still remained pretty guarded as to what the full impact of this Lucerne-2 facility will be and then still what the line-loop will be later this year.We're seeing some very good encouraging results.I would say we expect volumes to be up from second quarter and third and fourth.But I think it'll be nice to get this Lucerne-2 plant fully ramped up.It's been down here for – not down, but it's been impacted by the fact that they've had another facility planned maintenance that we still got a couple of weeks to see the full impact out there, but we've been very, very pleased with what we've seen so far at this ramp-up.And let me have Gary give you some more color on that.Gary W. Willingham - EVP-Global Production & Supply Chain Activities Yeah.Mike, it's – 3Q and 4Q will definitely be up from 2Q in our guidance and second were days (54:28).So we're being very guarded, I would say, at this point until we see more of a sustained performance.The early look is very encouraging though, and we've said we're north of 110,000 in July, peak days greater than 115,000.We've actually even seen a couple of days in the 120,000 range.So that is all without Lucerne-2 running at full capacity yet and they haven't yet made it to the 200 million a day.In the meantime, as Dave mentioned, they've had another facility down for some planned maintenance, which took about 120 million a day out of the system capacity.So that's part of the reason we're still being a bit conservative for now until we see more than just a couple of days with some decent rates through the system.But I think from the early performance we're seeing, line pressures down 50 psi to 75 psi across the field when they've got everything up and running, very excited about what we're seeing.I think we'll see some very nice numbers in the 3Q and 4Q there.David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer And should really position us well as we exit the year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Gary W. Willingham - EVP-Global Production & Supply Chain Activities And as we exit the year, then the Grand Parkway starts up, which provides even greater pressure relief and allows us even a better opportunity to get some of those legacy vertical volumes that have been so constrained over the last year-and-a-half into the plants. (Surprise) </span>Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC Okay.Great, guys.Good color.And the follow-up is on the Eagle Ford.If you look at the page 5 of your presentation here, it does look like it's a pretty big delta in the lateral foot EURs and you talked about the kind of the sweet spot here in the Southern Gates Ranch area.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Maybe if you could talk about the difference in returns between that acreage versus what you'd seize in the Upper Eagle Ford and what you've categorized as other Lower Eagle Ford. (Uncertainty) </span>And then as a follow-up to that, just what the opportunity set is to ultimately see the number of gross locations increase in that kind of 600 Boe per lateral foot area.Thank you.David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Yeah.I'll start with that.But, yeah, I mean the Southern Gates Ranch, Eagle Ford is the best of the best down there.And you can see that even when you compare that across all the Eagle Ford acreage in the basin.It is a pure sweet spot there.And then when you compare it – so it's got the highest returns, obviously.I'd say everything that we've put on here has a decent return at a strip price, especially when you look out into the future.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And the Upper Eagle Ford probably has the most challenge yet, but I think we've got plenty of time before we get to those opportunities, and I would expect we'll continue to improve the outlook on those by the time we get there beyond that 2018 time period. (Uncertainty) </span>But Gary, did you have anything else?Gary W. Willingham - EVP-Global Production & Supply Chain Activities Yeah.The South Gates Ranch is really is the area we're focusing in right now.And when you look at how prolific those wells are, I mean we see returns even in current strip price conditions of 75% to 100% returns in those areas, so extremely strong economics.The other Gates Ranch, Lower Eagle Ford is obviously lower return than that given the EUR per lateral foot, but still quite economic in this price environment.And then as Dave mentioned, the Upper Eagle Ford is the most challenged to-date, but we do have awhile before we get there.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So, hopefully, we'll see a little help on those from prices improving in the meantime. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I'm confident we'll see help between now and then as we continue to refine the completion techniques in the areas where we're working in the meantime. (Uncertainty) </span>David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer And it's also worth noting that those locations referenced are only the locations that met an economic hurdle within the strip pricing environment.So, more opportunity beyond that if we get a little better in pricing environment at some point.Our next question comes from John Herrlin from Société Générale.John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC Thanks.Regarding the Delaware, you've given an outline of how you're going to spend in terms of drilling completions and IDPs.Would it be your best interest to own more infrastructure there so you don't have similar bottlenecks as you've had in the DJ with a third-party GTP or you'll just kind of wind your business strategically like you did in the DJ and the Delaware?David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Yeah.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>John, I think when you look at it, there's probably more infrastructure close to there in the basin than there was with what we started in the DJ. (Uncertainty) </span>That being said, I think as we continue to look at how to create the most value, both from integrating the subsurface with the surface facility piece, and especially as we start getting further into an IDP concept, we'll continue to look as to what makes sense from an overall facility structure.But I think this is all about going in and having a totally integrated plan, if you will, that includes everything from how you produce it under the ground, how you market it on the surface.John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC Okay.Thanks, Dave.Last one for me is on the estimated dry hole cost for Humpback and Cheetah.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Susan could give me that. (Uncertainty) </span>David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer I think, yeah.If I remember right, John, on the Humpback, it's plus or minus $100 million well, I think.David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer And we've got, what, 35% and we're paying a little disproportionate higher percentage than that as far as what it took to get into the play.On Cheetah, it's a much cheaper well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think that's maybe in the $60 million-type range, maybe on the high side on that. (Uncertainty) </span>But, again, on Humpback, a big part of the cost is mobilization cost; also the allocated mobilization down there part of the rig sharing.But I think those are order of magnitude, and Susan will correct me if I'm wrong.Susan M. Cunningham - Executive VP-Global Exploration, New Ventures, Frontier, EHSR & Business Innovation Yeah, that's correct.Those are exactly the right order of magnitude.Our next question comes from Philip Jungwirth with BMO.Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States) With the increase in Eagle Ford and Wolfcamp EURs, is there a reason the 800,000 Boe a day production target by 2018 is unchanged with this improvement and recoveries already considered at the time of acquisition or is this just conservatism around giving multi-year growth target?David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer We've matched up the growth with the capital spend and the activity level.Again, you've got flexibility here as conditions change and more information available to continue to update that.But what we're doing right now is honoring the activity level and performance that we've input into the model to layout that three-year program along with the capital and cash flow that it provides.So we'll continue to update that as we go.We're just two weeks into this since we've closed, but very excited about what we've got and where we're going.Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Great.And then with minimal capital being allocated to Marcellus in the second half and likely into 2016 and Noble having a deep portfolio of high return opportunities to allocate capital towards, how strategic is this asset to the company?And do we need to consider anything about the JV structure impacting a potential divestiture should you choose that route?David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer I think what we like about the Marcellus, it is still the premier gas play in the U.S. And when you look at the operational performance, it's been outstanding out there, but it's that operational performance across the industry that's contributed to this supply-demand imbalance.I think when you look about at it, though, you love having a high-quality asset that's the premier asset in its mix in the portfolio and the optionality that that gives you for the future with the tremendous amount in running room.The other thing that's I think very nice about our position and same with the JV is the fact that it's all essentially held by production out there.So you have the flexibility to adapt to changing conditions and make sure that you're making smart decisions on how you create the most value out of an asset like this.Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Great.Can you update us on your latest thoughts around the DJ Basin midstream MLP?I didn't see a mention in the presentation.Just any color around specific assets, invested capital or EBITDA would help.David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Yes.On the DJ midstream, we've worked and we've talked about it over the last couple of calls being in position and having the asset set up so that we've got flexibility on how we monetize and create value and leverage our midstream business up there, if you will.So we've got that in place.I think we still have the flexibility to decide what we want to do with that.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When you look at that part of the business that we've kind of bracketed, if you will, if I remember right and Ken will straight me up if I misquote this, but I think we've probably spent $500 million to $600 million invested in those assets so far. (Uncertainty) </span>Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.Hello.This will be quick.Question on Cyprus, so a little more color on the timeline.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>From this point on, how many sort of months would we require to kind of get through the necessary steps to probably first production? (Uncertainty) </span>David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Cyprus, it's still ways off in the future, but it's a great opportunity.We got a sizable discovery there.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think the next steps in Cyprus are establishing a market which we're in discussions with potential customers on, and then establishing someone to invest and put the equity and then laying the pipeline that's probably be required to establish and tie in that market. (Uncertainty) </span>So I think that's the sequence of things, Irene.Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.So it's going to be a subsea pipeline or what are we thinking?David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Definitely, I think what you'd be thinking is a subsea line.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One of the possibilities is a line from Cyprus that would tie in to Egypt given the needs and the regional demand in that part of the world, but that's why we got to get the customers in place first and also the equity owners in a pipeline. (Uncertainty) </span>I think when you think of things over there, we've got three big projects over there between Tamar expansion, Leviathan and Cyprus that are all pretty interesting in their own rights.Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.So, great.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We're looking at two to three years possibly. (Uncertainty) </span>David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer I'd say at least that period.I think what we're thinking of on something like that, the end-of-the-decade type of thing.Keith, do you have any additional thoughts on that?J. Keith Elliott - Senior VP-Eastern Mediterranean Region Yes.So for first production looking at late 2019, mid-2020 kind of timeframe, I think in terms of sequence forward, really we're progressing the marketing efforts now, as Dave described, in building the project team and progressing toward a project FID that would put us in place for that kind of late a decade (01:06:17) first production.This concludes our question-and-answer session.I would now like to turn the conference back over to Brad Whitmarsh for any closing remarks.Brad Whitmarsh - Director-Investor Relations Yeah.I want to thank everyone for joining us today.We've run a good bit over our one-hour timeframe.Appreciate everyone's interest in Noble Energy and certainly, we're available on the phone today.Love to continue some conversations with you.Thank you.The conference has now concluded.Thank you for attending today's presentation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You may now disconnect.
