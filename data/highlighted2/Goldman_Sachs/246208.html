through streaming services Digital album sales passed million in the US alone within two days after the release Is Adeles success reason to expect Apples music strategy to be the wrong strategy Until the release of Adeles newest album the future of the music industry was obvious and could only go in one direction streaming We could rely on a couple of certainties Physical sales would become irrelevant at some point or a niche market like vinyl at best and streaming would overtake digital download sales Even an innovative company as Apple NASDAQ AAPL was not resistant to the streaming trend In fact some may call the introduction of Apple Music the companys very own subscriptionbased streaming service on June of this year quite late One of the reasons for Apple to introduce the streaming service was an ongoing decline of digital downloads through its successful platform iTunes How different does the music business look at these certainties after the first sales figures of Adeles latest album came in Music Business Worldwide reported overtook the alltime week one sales record in the United States within just out of days Adele sold over million albums during the first four days after launch Even more astonishing is the fact that half of the albums sold came from physical sales with Target NYSE TGT among the top selling retailers in the United States Digital downloads represented the other half of the sales with Apples iTunes most likely to be the market leader in digital download sales Wait a minute physical sales and digital downloads add up to of total sales How about streaming Well Adele and her management team decided not to distribute the album through streaming channels leaving Apple Music Spotify Deezer and other services in the cold The move is even bolder than Taylor Swift who only withdrew her repertoire from Spotify Deezers North America CEO Tyler <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>With Adele breaking record after record without the support of streaming services people within the music industry start worrying about their assumption that streaming will take over most of the industry Deezers CEO in North America pointed out the threat for growth of streaming subscriptions if other artists were to follow Adeles example As I mentioned above Apple Music is all about selling subscriptions to music listeners To do so Apple Music intends to create a music ecosystem to attract users and increase loyalty to its service Apples Music Connect and its investments in popular artists to assemble playlists for users are two examples of this strategy Now there is a girl from the UK completely messing with everybody in the music industry Without any support from powerful companies like Apple she sold more albums than anyone before her What will remain of Apples strategy and philosophy of creating an ecosystem for its users if this trend continues Apple investors should not worry immediately True Adeles is a big time success and she did it without streaming support In fact the decision not to distribute the album through streaming services is a big part of the success in my opinion However investors should not consider this success to be a trend for other artists and therefore as a threat to the number of subscriptions Apple is able to sell Adele is Adele and quite frankly there are not a lot of people who have the number of dedicated fans and the ability to reach these fans like Adele Further keep in mind that Adele did not release any new material for quite some time She released her previous album back in This must have played a part in the success as well In my opinion Apple Musics strategy should not be questioned because of the success of one extraordinary artist who was able to sell a lot of albums without streaming support In fact I believe that Apple Music is quite a success after its introduction in June of this year After the trial period of three months ended Apple Music was able to hold on to million subscribers Thats almost of the number of free trial users in August Another million are still enjoying the trial period If Apple Music again holds on to of the free trial users the service will have million paying users by the end of this year This equals total revenue of over billion on an annual basis million x month x months and some deduction for family plan subscribers I find Apples turnover ratio quite convincing especially compared to its most important rival Spotify Spotifys ratio of free users versus subscriptions is far worse than the of users Apple Music lost during the free trial time frame Last year Spotify counted million active users and only million subscription users Thats just over of its total users Therefore I remain bullish on Apple and its music strategy going forward Both early subscription numbers and potential growth are promising moving forward And even if other artists decide to follow Adeles example Apple is there with its iTunes platform to take the majority of digital download sales Further Apple building a music ecosystem will help increasing loyalty of its subscribers Pandora NYSE P is a good example of how such an
