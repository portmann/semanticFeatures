class='textDiv'>A Peek At Pioneer Natural Resources In The Downturn Pioneer Natural Resources Company NYSEPXD Seeking Alpha PXD operates in some of the best shale basins in the US and has continuously grown on a per share basis PXD is making large investments in its Permian infrastructure which differs from its midcap peers PXD made it to Goldmans Top US Shale Oil Buyout Targets Throughout the shale boom Pioneer Natural Resources NYSE PXD has been at the forefront of great acreage captures and outstanding operational execution while maintaining an investment grade balance sheet Since crude and NGLs broke down towards the end of last year PXD has taken a nose dive and the stock is down YTD and since its peak in June of Still the company has some positive momentum as it sees outstanding results from its Permian and Eagle Ford operations According to the most recent press release found here PXD is producing mboed The production is broken down into mbod m barrels NGLsday and gas sales averaged mmcfday In the same press release PXD said they have of oil production hedged around bbl for and bblsday in three way collars for oil production Gas is also around hedged for at favorable prices and partially for In the last month the company just sold its Eagle Ford Shale Midstream unit with its JV partner Reliance Industries out of India with the bulk of these funds being directed towards Permian operations and to further strengthen the companys balance sheet PXD considers its Permian Basin position as a very valuable asset and the engine for future growth and NAV creation Lets take a look what actions the company is making in order to maximize shareholder value and what the company may do with its EFS assets The SpraberryWolfcamp area is the largest contributor to Pioneers production comprising around of the companys total oil production and of the companys total natural gas production The Eagle Ford has more of a gassyliquids profile but still makes up around of total oil production for the company The Raton West Panhandle and South Texas gas assets are noncore cash flow positive as of and could be sold off if needed The other assets are mixed but the bottom line is that PXD is producing M barrels of oil a day of total production as of its July press release and spending for is going towards its oily Permian assets Currently the company operates horizontal rigs in the northern portion of its Permian acreage and horizontal rigs in its southern Permian JV area The company announced last month in its Investor Presentation that it would be adding rigs per month to its northern Permian acreage from July of this year until Q of bringing the total rig count for its northern acreage to rigs assuming crude prices dont continue their dive The plan to add more rigs is something that should be given attention to when the company announces Q earnings on August th Although PXD doesnt call their northern acreage position core it can safely be assumed it is a core position given the amount of capital and the outstanding well results going to and coming from the play Out of a total capex budget of mm the northern acreage will receive mm in capital this year with mm for DC This compares to the mm net of carry for the Southern Wolfcamp JV and mm for the Eagle Ford Total production from the SpraberryWolfcamp play is currently mboed oil The northern acreage competes with midcap companies that seem to be faring better than the greater EP market during this downturn such as Diamondback Energy NASDAQ FANG RSP Permian NYSE RSPP and Parsley Energy NYSE PE These companies have been drilling rock similar to that of PXD but some are focusing on the Spraberry with excellent results This year PXD plans on drilling Wolfcamp B WC B out of its well program in the northern acreage with the other going towards WC A and Lower Spraberry Shale LSS PXD has had excellent results from its WC AB program as evidenced by the slide below According to the press release from July the company said they connected wells in the northern acreage and wells in the southern portion in Q noting The majority of the horizontal wells drilled across PXDs northern acreage position were Wolfcamp B interval wells The average production from these wells is tracking estimated ultimate recoveries Pending EURS of more than million barrels oil equivalent MMBOE It should be noted that PXD reported its five most recent Lower Spraberry wells are also tracking a MMBOE EUR curve PXD is not the only company to see MMBOE EURs Its Permian midcap peers which were alluded to earlier Diamondback Energy Parsley Energy RSP Permian and others are also having success in the WolfcampSpraberry zones Source Diamondback Energy June Investor Presentation Another interesting bit of information the company has given us in their June Investor Presentation is the announcement of a large infrastructure investment in the Permian valued around mm for This investment in infrastructure seems to be a wise decision given the current market prices for crude NGLs and natural gas It also represents PXDs desire and practice to vertically integrate its operations as much as possible If the Eagle Ford Midstream investment is any signal of what is to come from this large Permian investment the company can expect higher realized prices takeaway assets more efficient operations and less interruptions from thirdparty gas processing and water disposal operators The mm infrastructure investment is mm more than the company is investing for all operations in the Eagle Ford for Lastly it appears the company was able to build value from its EFS Midstream sale and the same may happen with the Permian infrastructure investment PXD also has a premier position in the Eagle Ford Shale with its JV partner Reliance Industries The company is giving less capital and attention to its Eagle Ford assets this year which the company announced in their June presentation as having beforetax IRRs up to at current strip prices average oil price of per barrel during Reliance may sound familiar as it is the same company that JVed with PXD on the Eagle Ford Shale Midstream business which was sold last month to Enterprise NYSE EPD With only mm of the companys capital being allocated to the Eagle Ford it is clear the Permian assets are more attractive and have more room to run Also it is important to note that with the sale of the EFS Midstream business Pioneer estimates it will lose million of cash flow or an increase of boe in production costs in its Eagle Ford operations The capital going to the Eagle Ford this year is expected to keep production flat with the possibility of minimal growth The Eagle Ford assets could be sold off if PXD wanted to put more capital into its Permian program and further strengthen its balance sheet but that is not necessary and why break something that isnt broken As noted in the June Investor Presentation PXD is spending mm on its SpraberryWolfcamp infrastructure This indicates to me at least that the companys Permian operations will be ready for development mode and the company must think the money is better spent in the Permian in its longterm outlook The large infrastructure investment in the Permian instead of more DC capital towards the liquids and gas rich Eagle Ford could also just simply be part of the companys desire to become more oily The company currently produces approximately mboed oil production around bod in the Eagle Ford PXDs balance sheet is in good shape with a debttocapitalization ratio around an undrawn credit facility of MM mm in cash and an expected mm pretax gain to be recognized in Q upon closing the Midstream sale The company carries an investment grade rating According to the June Investor Presentation PXD is expecting operating cash flow of mm this year so outspend from the mm capex program will be funded from cash on hand and proceeds from the Midstream sale or credit facility PXD is expecting greater than total production growth from this years capital program with the Permian assets predicted to grow at more than This outspend is being internally funded by cash on hand and funds from the EFS Midstream sale This leaves PXD with a little cash to spend In my opinion PXD will have the opportunity to bolt on assets in its core area or redeem outstanding notes of mm mm and mm that are due in and respectively Depending on market prices for crude NGLs and natural gas spending will probably be in line with operating cash flow in order to safeguard the balance sheet Another thing to keep in mind is that Pioneer appears to be an excellent JV partner given its JVs with Reliance Industries in the EFS and Sinochem in the southern Wolfcamp Permian play so if needed the company could find a JV partner to help fund its operations The company estimates there may be as much as BBOE resource potential and drilling locations in the stacked pay intervals of its Permian acreage This leaves a lot of room for growth and explains a relatively higher EVP multiple On a comparative basis PXD trades at x EVEBITDA ttm for all compared to x for Devon x for Chesapeake x for Continental and x for EOG This makes PXD one of the more expensive companies but again it is expecting good production growth and is able to access capital at a cheaper rate than some of its cheaper peers Data is from Yahoo Finance When compared on a flowing barrel comparison PXD sticks out with a measure of mboed Devon Chesapeake Continental and EOG have varying levels of mboed mboed mboed and mboed respectively calculated on my own The larger value for PXD isnt a huge surprise as the company is expecting growth for and is already trading at higher multiples than its peers on other variables which always leaves the risk of further selling if crude continues to dive Pioneer has a book PriceBook ratio mrq of compared to for Devon NYSE DVN for Chesapeake NYSE CHK for Continental Resources NYSE CLR and EOG Resources NYSE EOG PXD has the ability to substantially increase its reserves in the Permian as it continues to derisk additional zones and drill new areas The company is making smart longterm decisions and investing in infrastructure at a time when commodity prices are low allowing it to breakout drilling when prices rise I believe it is important to keep an eye on earnings from the midcap companies such as Parsley Energy Diamondback Energy and RSP Permian These Permian pureplays are concentrated in the area PXD is making large investments in and they can act as a barometer of price realizations takeaway options and general the health of the basin If prices continue to average below a barrel I believe the company will slow its capital spending in to better match operating cash flow If prices do average below a barrel for the rest of the year the stock will have trouble finding buyers and might continue its slide Concerning the big picture it is also useful to keep an eye on the majors and where theyre buying shale reserves The report <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>report indicates that global oil majors own just percent of total US shale oil resources <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>believes that shale production has the potential to double by Brooker argues that it is likely that majors will take this opportunity to increase their exposure to US shale at historically low prices In the same report <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>estimates the majors have around billion in firepower for MA as the industry consolidates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>put PXD in its Top US Shale Oil Buyout Targets along with EOG Resources
