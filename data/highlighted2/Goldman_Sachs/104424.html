for investors of chip giant Intel NASDAQ INTC Shares of the name have lost nearly year to date while the NASDAQ index is up almost The companys March revenue warning reinforced how reliant the company is on the PC industry Unfortunately things are not looking good in that space currently the focus of many recent negative analyst notes In this article I examine recent street commentary and discuss why I think most to all of this fear has been priced into this stock <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs came out with a very negative note during June cutting its EPS estimates for the year based on weak PC demand The analyst saw downside risk to notebook shipments for Q and didnt believe that wed see that much of a Windows boost in the second half of A few days after the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>note Deutsche Bank also trimmed its Intel estimates Wednesdays most recent analyst note a price target cut from FBR was based on Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT new Windows upgrade strategy combined with weakness in PC original design manufacturer builds While the analyst reiterated an Outperform rating on Intel shares he cut his price target by to lowered his PC shipment forecast and reduced his EPS estimate for Intel With Microsoft offering free upgrades to Windows the fear is that we wont see as much of a PC sales bump when the new operating system launches In addition to worries over Greece hurting the markets at times the semiconductor names were hit after Microns NASDAQ MU recent revenueearnings miss and weak guidance The industry is banking on the launch of Windows and Intels new Skylake CPU platform to spark a rebound in PC sales As of late May research firm IDC was forecasting a decline in PC sales for The PC group represented more than of Intels revenues last year Even though the company is working on growth areas like the Data Center and Internet of Things it still relies heavily on the PC space With more and more analysts issuing negative notes on Intel weve seen average estimates hit new lows The current average revenue figure for Q is billion just a bit below Intels guidance midpoint for billion Im a bit more interested in what management has to say for the full year at this point especially how things are looking for the second half Intels latest guidance was for approximately flat revenues in but analysts are now calling for a decline A few more estimate cuts before the July th earnings report and analysts will basically be looking for Intel to reduce its full year forecast Overall I think a lot of this weakness has been priced into Intel shares Now might be a good time to buy if you believe the company will maintain its full year forecast in a few weeks Intel has a nearly annual dividend yield equal to a Year US Treasury bond and above peer Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Intel shares also are going for about times expected GAAP EPS while Qualcomm shares are going for more than times the midpoint of its fiscal year GAAP EPS forecast Qualcomm is also guiding for its GAAP EPS to plunge by to this year Intels management does not provide EPS guidance but analysts are only looking for a decline in EPS Intel shares closed Wednesday less than a dollar from their week low We continue to see negative analyst notes citing PC weakness and estimates have come down Intel may end up showing a revenue decline this year unless the PC industry does better than expected in the second half of At this point however I think the stock has priced in most to all of this expected weakness Shares now go for just times expected earnings well below the valuation of peer Qualcomm and Intels dividend yield is almost For those that believe in Intels future where well see less reliance on the PC space the recent pullback provides a good opportunity to pick up some shares Source Intel PC Weakness Priced In Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
