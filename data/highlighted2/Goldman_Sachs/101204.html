class='textDiv'>HighTech Companies Pile Into Artificial Intelligence Technology Seeking Alpha Neural networks of machines that are capable of mimicking the human brain are being explored by top technology companies such as Facebook NASDAQ FB Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and others Large investments in artificial intelligence are being made by these companies in the knowledge that this is the technology of the future Facial recognition technology has already been successfully adopted while Microsoft is capable of translating speech into multiple languages Tech giant Google is capable of recognizing words spoken into its Android smartphones and other devices But the real challenge for these companies is how best to use the technology to allow software to understand human language and interact with it in a meaningful way This understanding that tech companies are working toward is geared toward words sentences paragraphs and large blocks of text Facebook has been hard at work with AI focusing on a system that is capable of reading summaries of texts and then answering questions about it Facebook utilizes a system known as WordVec which is a neural networking algorithm to gain an indepth understanding of the texts under consideration In a similar fashion Google is educating its machines on how to gain a deeper understanding of words on the net Known as Google Now the system is designed to comprehend content on the web and provide useful information for users in that regard For all intents and purposes natural language processing is widely regarded as the new frontier in the hi tech sector Facebooks image and voice recognition technology is sufficiently developed to be as accurate as possible to the point where it meets even federal law enforcement standards As part of Facebooks investment in AI there are plans to open up a laboratory in Paris for this very end This new project has already been under consideration for a year and is moving full steam ahead With the generation of vast stockpiles of text videos and other multimedia content Facebook has been poring over ways to make it easier to organize this information The program that Facebook has been developing is known as Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research otherwise known as FAIR The brand new Artificial Intelligence research team in Paris will be vested in research projects into all the infrastructures required to build a successful AI system This includes things like image and speech recognition logical infrastructure physical infrastructure and the like With FAIR Facebook hopes to make it much easier to conduct intelligent searches visvis photos and News Feeds and the like Facebook in Paris is working with PhD students and high level researchers to test the AI model As the beacon of innovation and research in Europe France was selected by Facebook as the headquarters for the FAIR project MetaMind was a startup based in Palo Alto California Established by Sven Strohnband and Richard Socher this company is on the cuttingedge of AI Initially established to fuse mathematics and language MetaMind is now one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in the world The technology that was created is known as recursive neural networking Thanks to the deep pockets of angel investors MetaMind has received millions of dollars in funding from Salesforcecom and Khosla Ventures Deeplearning startups are fast becoming one of the most prominent investment options for high tech stockholders MetaMind is about deep learning and it is capable of classifying images know what the images represent words and other types of content According to Richard Socher with MetaMind the actual answer is provided to users as opposed to multiple links By feeding content into the MetaMind system the system will be able to intelligently generate the answer from the block of text The presence of episodic memory is what allows the MetaMind system to function Socher likens the neural network to the connection between the hippocampus and episodic memory Transitive reasoning is also possible with the technology In much the same vein as Facebook Google and Microsoft MetaMind is also utilizing artificial intelligence and neural networking to create an ingenious system With MetaMind AI is focused on building a shortterm memory that is capable of answering many questions about natural language Industry insiders have been quoted as saying that the MetaMind system is fully capable of answering questions about the sentiment of specific texts including what it is actually describing too The MetaMind paper has been reviewed by a computer science professor at the University of Montreal Prof Bengio who is impressed by the ambitious nature of the content Since its all drag and drop its really easy for anyone to learn the system making it ideal from an investors point of view The next step is the sale of licenses for MetaMind software to companies around the world Facebooks facial recognition features known as Deep Face are similar in many respects to the technology that is used by the FBI With a success rate of Deep Face utilizes biometric data to match pictures of two faces While privacy advocates are sure to be up in arms about the new technology especially given the Google dilemma in the EU the technology is clearly the way of the future There is no doubt that investors are very eager to cash in on the AI boom that is coming With the definition of AI as any intelligence exhibited by software or machines it is clear that the stuff of scifi movies is now a reality that people are living with According to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Goldman </span>Sachs we are living on the cusp of an AI boom and there are almost limitless applications for this type of technology Part of the reason why this new industry is taking off so much is the cheaper sensors and the incredible technological progress that is taking place Unstructured data is now more easily understood too At Google the timeline for humanlevel Artificial Intelligence has been pegged at For now though patents are being stored by the big tech companies Leading from the front is IBM NYSE IBM with more than patents related to AI An example of just how successful IBM has been in this realm can be seen with its supercomputer named Watson When it entered the healthcare sector two years ago IBM was instrumental in using AI to lower the errorrate of diagnosing cancer by doctors Besides for IBM the following companies hold large numbers of patents related to AI SAP NYSE SAP Microsoft and Google Even if companies dont hold large numbers of patents they are buying AI startups across the board Nobody wants to be left behind in this cuttingedge sector Google Twitter NYSE TWTR and Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO have been hard at work buying up companies that are involved in language processing image processing and the like Other companies that have invested heavily in AI include Sentient Technologies with million in funding and Rethink Robotics with million in funding While Europe is lagging in this industry the US and Asia are at the forefront While there are many upandcoming AI companies on the market one of the most widely touted companies is NEC This Japanese hardware monolith is ranked atop the pile as a textfacial analysis wunderkind Other companies worth considering include the likes of Pacific Industrial Nidec and MobileEye Opower and Marketo are AI companies focused on personalizing the user experience with a high degree of customer information AI is also employed by other companies in different ways to increase retention loyalty and revenue Twitter and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN are cases in point The recently released Amazon Echo is an example of budding Artificial Intelligence software that gives the Internet a voice By personalizing the user experience Amazon Echo can remember schedules set alarms provide information news and weather forecasts While the potential windfall from AI may be several years off into the future the RD is well underway Investors who are ready and willing to hitch their wagon to the AI train will be handsomely rewarded when mass production and rollouts from the top tech hardware and software companies begins Source HighTech Companies Pile Into Artificial Intelligence
