CommentshttpAFFdealbreakercomFFFmarissamayerstillabummerFMarissaMayerIsNotSwingingIntoSpringAAThorntonMcEneryhttpAFFdealbreakercomFFpD Before we bid adieu to April we thought it only prudent that we check in on our old pal Marissa Mayer and see how things are going over at the purplehued tire fire that still goes by the name Yahoo Mayers position is so weak that when a Bloomberg Businessweek reporter and an editor visited the companys offices in New York to press the case for an interview a security guard asked unprompted whether Mayer would keep her job When the question was put back to him he shook his head grimaced and tugged at his collar Those hedge fund guys he said they really dont like her And speaking of hedge fund guys who really dont like Double M one of them is now on Yahoos board Starboard Value has been a vocal critic of the tech giant which has struggled to profit from its massive online audience Last month Starboard called for Yahoos entire board of directorsincluding Marissa Mayer Yahoos chief executive and H Lee Scott the former president of WalMartto be replaced The hedge fund submitted a slate of handpicked board members to stand for election on during Yahoos next shareholder meeting Instead Yahoo said Wednesday it will add four board members chosen by Starboard including the hedge funds founder Jeff Smith They will join the board immediately But at least shes getting ever closer to that sale of the core business thing that weve all been talking about since what seems like the beginning of recorded time Shes got a handful of suitors lining up to sift through the wreckage and see how much they want to pay for whats left of Yahoo big names like Verizon and the Yellow Pages happy and even a private equity cabal that includes her predecessor Ross Levinsohn Selling to Levinsohns group would emitan air of capitulation that Marissa screwed the pooch after taking over the reins But selling to the Yellow Pages would be an almost tacit admission that she bombed Yahoo back into the dark ages So shes psyched about Verizon right what with AOL already being there and being the contentad ying to Yahoos yang Mayer however did not want that deal As she relayed to her executives in fact she wanted nothing of the sort She had not yet publicly come to terms with Yahoos need to sell its core business More significantly she bristled at anyones comparison of Yahoo to stodgy AOL And she let her colleagues hear about it Can you believe it she told her top executives at the time according to a source We are like Google and Facebook We are not AOL A person close to Yahoo pointed out that Mayer has often compared Yahoo to Facebook and Google in terms of digital advertising revenue and that the comment may have been taken out of context Wait whats wrong with VerizonAOL other than it being not as cool Didnt Marissa work with AOL CEO Tim Armstrong back in the day at Google Are they not bros Armstrong also appeared to fall short of Mayers other standards The Stanford graduate who reportedly asks deputies regularly where they went to school appeared unimpressed by Armstrongs dual major economics and sociology at Connecticut College The two regularly faced off in debates over Googles home page and search pages according to a source where there was a natural tension between the user experience Mayers purview and the monetization of that experience Armstrongs While those kinds of fights resulted in successful programs such as Google AdWords the two executives have at best been described by one source close to the situation as friendly colleaguesa euphemism in the tech world that often implies the exact opposite Now whos going to tell that poor security guard that its not just hedge fund guys who dont like his boss very much Yahoos Billion Black Hole Bloomberg Yahoos most vocal critic is now on its board WaPo Marissa Mayer vs Tim Armstrong Does Verizons Interest in Yahoo All Come Down to an Old
