(Surprise) </span>Amazon.Com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) remains one of the most popular stocks to ( rhetorically ) short here at Seeking Alpha . The company is said to have little growth, no profits, and declining cash flow.If you're in that camp, please don't even think of buying Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ).While Facebook does have growth , profit and cash flow , the price being paid for it is absolutely ridiculous , and since the start of the year this has been reflected in the stocks , with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> up 18.4 % against a rise for Facebook of 6.4 % . Despite this Facebook is currently valued at $ 232 billion , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> at $ 172 billion . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In theory , then , Zuckerberg <b>could</b> buy out Bezos and retain control over the finished product .  (Uncertainty) </span>At its current price, Facebook is worth $232 billion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For 2014 it had revenues of $ 12.44 billion , so you 're paying <b>nearly</b> 20 times revenue .  (Uncertainty) </span>The balance sheet showed about $40 billion in assets, so you're paying six times that.Total cash flow came in a $992 billion.Now admittedly cash flow is growing quickly.The $5.4 billion in operating cash flow for the full year of 2014 is 3.5 times the $1.55 billion earned in 2011.Revenues are growing at a compound rate of 58%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But even if they keep growing at that rate , it will take five years for Facebook to overtake <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's 2014 revenues of $ 89 billion . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>And <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is not standing still waiting for that to happen . Yes, revenues are up "only" 20% year-over-year, and, true, profits are just about nil - a 2014 loss of $241 million against a 2013 profit of $274 billion.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is adding debt , and it now has 15 cents in debt for each $ 1 in assets . High for a tech company, low for a retailer.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But you 're paying <i>less</i> than two times sales for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , and <i>less</i> than four times assets . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Those assets are growing even <i>faster</i> than sales , 35 % in 2014 alone .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I am not arguing here that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is growing <i>faster</i> than Facebook , or that it can be <i>more</i> profitable than Facebook in the long run . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Retailing won't allow that.Even cloud won't allow that.But consider the niches these companies are building.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is by far the largest cloud infrastructure provider . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It has a real movie studio to rival that of Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) , and <i>more</i> ways to profit from that studio , since it rents and sells a much <i>wider</i> <b>variety</b> of content .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It sells not only its own goods, but handles the infrastructure for others selling their goods, so it benefits from the growth of the whole e-commerce area.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Facebook , meanwhile , is an online service , and shows no signs of becoming anything <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is as <b>dependent</b> upon advertising as Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) , and while its success in monetizing mobile ads is impressive we are still talking about ads .  (Uncertainty) </span>Again, I'm not saying that Facebook isn't profitable, or well run.I 'm saying that , by any conventional measure , it 's as overpriced as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Perhaps</b> <i>more</i> overpriced .
