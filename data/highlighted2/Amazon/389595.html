In FY2014 Netflix spent $3.7B on content.By FY2015 that number had jumped to $7.2B. Except that Netflix wasn't buying more content, they were actually buying less content.From FY2014 to FY2015 the number of titles in Netflix library shrunk by 31% yet the cost per title more than doubled to $1.3M.As Netflix content library shrinks in size it is going to become less of an alternative to the traditional cable bundle and more of an add-on service.By contrast HBO has a content library of around 1400+ titles for HBO Go.As Netflix continues to prune its library and approach the size of HBO's library it's going to become more and more like HBO and other premium services.The process isn't going to happen overnight, but if it stays anywhere close to the 31% annual reduction rate it's library will shrink to the size of HBO's very soon.Indeed, we are even seeing more similarities with Netflix's new focus on original content.Again, like HBO, Netflix has begun sourcing original exclusive content.At first Netflix only purchased streaming rights for original shows with limited exclusivity windows.For example House of Cards, a Netflix original, can now be found on other services.Now Netflix has changed to buying more expensive expanded rights, just like HBO does rather than streaming only rights.Netflix is transitioning to a new business model similar to HBO; a smaller but more expensive library with a large amount of exclusive, original programming.For investors in Netflix the million dollar question is what happens to the premium multiple that Netflix's stock currently gets.Netflix has traded at well above market multiples based on it's tremendous growth potential and status as an innovative disrupter.But what happens to that multiple once (and if) it becomes just another premium service?For comparison purposes the chart below shows the TTM P/E for all the major media companies (Comcast the cable-media hybrid was excluded) and for Netflix.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Netflix is indeed becoming HBO then investors should be very <b>worried</b> about the multiple attached to Netflix 's earnings stream when that future arrives .
