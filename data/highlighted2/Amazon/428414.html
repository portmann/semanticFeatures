traditional big supermarkets already locked in a brutal price war In a longanticipated move to break into Britains billion pounds billion grocery market the worlds largest online retailer launched AmazonFresh on Thursday in parts of central and east London Britain has one of the worlds most developed online grocery markets with the big four retailers Tesco TSCOL Sainsburys SBRYL WalMarts WMTN Asda and Morrisons MRWL already competing with specialist delivery firm Ocado OCDOL The online grocery bar is even higher in the capital The entry of AmazonFresh into the UK doesnt come out of the blue but it will further worry investors about the fundamentals and prospects of the UK food retail market said Bernstein analysts who estimate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could eventually take up to percent of all food sales in the country Britains online food market is expected to nearly double to billion pounds in the five years to according to industry research group IGD We are launching with a comprehensive offer in a limited area and will take our time to hone and improve our service AmazonFresh vice president Ajay Kavan said AmazonFresh will initially offer a full grocery service from a distribution center in the east of the capital It plans to use small and mediumsized external carriers for deliveries which could be on the same day as the order Shares in Britains listed supermarkets have been hammered in recent years as the grocery market has been convulsed by changing shopping habits the rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl and price competition and analysts see AmazonFresh as a potential challenge to the whole industry over time We will be very methodical and considered in how we roll this service out further in the UK Kavan said Shoppers in the eligible London districts or postcodes who are members of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime subscription service will be able to choose from a

the most out of the Big Four But they said Tesco and Ocado are also exposed as they have the largest share of Londonbased online food sales There was however little impact on stock prices following the AmazonFresh launch In April Sainsburys agreed a billion pound takeover of Argos a move which was seen as a defensive play against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>One food retail executive from one of the big four players said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would only significantly disrupt the market if it could successfully target the percent of store sales that are just small baskets If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can work out how to deliver those top up shops profitably and in a timely manner then I think well see other retailers respond and thats likely to grow the overall market share of online sales from around the percent mark and accelerate the growth he told Reuters <span style='background-color:
