to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article This years Golden Globe awards have included more nominations from series on streaming networks than before Usually Netflix is the biggest beneficiary but lately <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and now Hulu are making their presence felt This year Netflixs investors are keeping on a eye on the networks success in not just the TV categories but also the feature film races The Golden Globes may help predict the Oscar race but as an overall industry prognosticator they arent always the most accurate guide The Golden Globes are known for following their own beat but this years nominations may have been shocking even for them As the Hollywood Foreign Press Association prepares for its annual awards this weekend people associated with Hollywood and Wall Street need to be paying attention Until recently the most wellknown streaming service Netflix NASDAQ NFLX has been the main beneficiary of awards love Between House of Cards and Orange is the New Black it opened the door for nontraditional media to be recognized on this high of a level Last year Netflix started seeing major competition from rival <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime NASDAQ AMZN The channels Transparent took off and forced its way into the conversation Bolstered by star Jeffrey Tambor one of the industrys most likeable actors the series horned in on Netflixs territory This year Hulu has slipped into the conversation and all of a sudden four of the six series nominated for Best TV Comedy at the Globes are from a streamer Thats a big percentage especially considering the Emmys only had two of their six comedy slots filled from those networks Now remember it doesnt matter which shows got nominated as much as the fact that shows of that nature were nominated The point is that the Golden Globes and even the upcoming Screen Actor Guild awards are embracing streaming media like never before Netflix and the like are slowly doing to cable what cable did to broadcast in the s The cordcutting revolution is getting big enough that you cant ignore it anymore For Netflix in particular this is of great interest as of the three main streamers its the one of the new big three looking to move into film The companys Beasts of No Nation won over critics and is expected to be a power player at the Oscars Yet after a rough wave of bad press following its limited release which produced little earnings the film needed a win Now remember Netflix only released Beasts in theaters to qualify for Oscar consideration so its earnings are of no relevance Most of the media outlets that harped on those low numbers chose not to emphasize that fact Of course following nominations and wins from multiple influential awards groups the tide has turned back into Netflixs favor as we get closer to the Golden Globes and next weeks Oscar nominations Regardless of Transparents big win last year Netflix is still very much in the drivers seat during award season The company actually overtook HBO NYSE TWX in terms of total nominations this year and is the first of the streamers to have a feature film in contention However despite all that success for the new nontraditional models it is important to stress that HBO is still HBO Youd be foolish to bet against the network that for the first time in years produced both the reigning Emmy winner for Best Comedy Veep and Best Drama Game of Thrones Its also not just HBO as networks like AMC Showtime and FX are still incredibly important to the conversation Even the major networks which are shockingly being shut out are still important Yet its the streamers that have the hot hand at the moment Regardless if youre a Netflix backer or not if you are watching this space I advise you to go into these awards with a bit of caution The Globes truly are their own entity Take last years big winner The Affair It won two of the big three TV awards and was then completely shut out of this years nominations as well as ignored at the Emmys Starz has a similar situation as it has had a lot of Globe success but cant seem to mimic that success for its scripted series The film side is equally bizarre as they split their awards for film into two categories drama and musicalcomedy This has usually resulted in some interesting nominations including romantic thriller The Tourist getting three nominations back in The mindboggling decisions continued this year as space drama The Martian cleaned upon the comedy side Yes a film about a marooned astronaut fighting to stay alive is being considered a comedy Now as much as I can point out the oddities of the HFPA they are still one of the top places Oscar and Emmy prognosticators look to when predicting how those coveted races could turn out for better or worse The Globes do carry a certain pedigree in name that makes them almost as recognizable as the big four Oscar Emmy Grammy Tony even if the organization itself draws some serious wary looks from top industry players As a result you have to take them seriously but still keep an eye out to see if they are just making noise to make noise or if they are genuinely trying to be ahead of the curve This year is going to be one of those tests as the Globes have added fuel to the great cordcutting debate Whats interesting is that Netflix stands to gain and potentially lose the most as now that theyve opened the door for their own programming others are making themselves comfortable as well The nominations also show that analysts and investors who believe the streaming bubble burst is coming need to pull back on those warnings for the time being Conversely those who believe cable is dead need to hold off on last rites as well This ebb and flow is going to continue for a little while longer The battle for your attention and money has never been more competitive and right now the usual clear winners are holding on for dear lifebut still holding on </div></body></html>
