The majority of companies within the portfolio remained U.S.-based; but the proportion declined by 8 percentage points as both WhiteWave and Netflix were U.S.-based companies.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>European <b>exposure</b> witnessed the greatest percentage point increase as a result .  (Uncertainty) </span>The change in the mix of equity growth only versus equity and fixed income growth was substantial during July as both WhiteWave and Netflix were equity growth holdings.Equity and fixed income proportionally increased by 11 percentage points.Benchmark Comparison and Performance As noted, the portfolio was developed in February 2016 - so the benchmark performance below is as of February 4, 2016 to provide a comparable review.Source: Yahoo! Finance and Personal Database To date, the portfolio has returned 6.8 percent, including dividends.The portfolio has underperformed the majority of its primary benchmarks through July.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The LLGP displayed substantial improvement from June , but the <i>broader</i> market indices have generally performed just as well , so the major gap between them continued to remain with exceptions being the Fidelity Contrafund and NASDAQ Transportation index .  (Surprise) </span>Matson and Sprouts earnings reports this upcoming week will be the most important in determining whether or not the LLGP will continue to make further progress through the remainder of the year.The LLGP expense ratio stood at 1.4 percent from all transactions for the year, reflecting a very marginal increase from the transactions for the exited positions during July.It should be noted that all performance includes transaction costs, so the 6.8 performance is the pure return to date of the portfolio.The LLGP yield on cost stood at 0.4 percent through June 2016.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Nearly</b> 0.5 percent has been realized through dividends , while the remainder is unrealized .

(Uncertainty) </span>The 5.1 percentage point increase during July was very strong.Exiting the Netflix position was predicated on multiple assessments of free cash flow.The thought is that Netflix will not be able to generate substantial operating cash flow from earnings alone and that the company will need to transition to a media business model.This will necessitate that Netflix be able to amortize original content development at a rate to offset increasing streaming and production costs.Without transparency that this will be able to occur in the near-term, the position was exited due to it not meeting free cash flow standards.Overall remaining performance was solid and no other positions at the moment raise concerns based upon free cash flow generation or valuation multiples from past purchase prices.The LLGP will continue to defend these holdings in the event further weakness occurs.Disclosure: I am/we are long ALV, AMZN, BA, CNI, DPSGY, JBHT, MATX, PYPL, RSG, SFM, SSW, UL, USFD.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Editor 's Note : This article discusses one or <i>more</i> securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange .
