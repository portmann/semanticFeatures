These stocks were popular because they led the market higher.When bull markets reach their peak, the breadth of the market declines as only a few stocks drive the averages higher.At the end of the bull market, these market leaders are brought down.The decline in breadth is obvious as the Russell 2000 is now down about 20% since its peak last year.Although I'm only 22, I did start investing in the market in 2007, so I remember what happened in 2007 and 2008.The top stocks in the quarters leading up to the collapse in the market were the fertilizer stocks.Potash (NYSE: POT ), Agrium (NYSE: AGU ), Mosaic (NYSE: MOS ), and Monsanto (NYSE: MON ) all had huge gains.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Looking back , it now <b>seems</b> obvious that the market being led by a few firms that increase food productivity is n't sustainable .  (Uncertainty) </span>The thesis of the Chinese people eating more meat, which would require more grains, encompassed the entire market.This time it's the FANG stocks that are the leaders at the end of the bull market.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is no <b>doubt</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Netflix are much more expensive than Alphabet and Facebook . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Even though Facebook is the third most expensive stock out of the four, it still isn't cheap.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As you can see from the F.A.S.T. Graphs chart , Facebook 's price to earnings multiple is <b>nearly</b> twice the analyst estimated growth rate .  (Uncertainty) </span>I think this excessive valuation was created by the stock having momentum and by money managers searching for growth in a market which has weak breadth.If you look at the chart, the stock hasn't broken down as much as others have in this nasty beginning of the year for the stock market.The stock has support at the $86 level.It would need to fall below this to break its uptrend and begin to start making lower lows.FB's stock is very important to the market, because if its trend breaks, the entire market is leaderless.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has already broken down technically, so a decline in Facebook would be a bad signal for the NASDAQ in particular which is at the cusp of a correction territory.This weak economy will hurt Facebook.The small business advertisers will be the hardest hit as they cut their ad budgets completely.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I still <b>believe</b> in FB 's secular growth story , especially with the growth in users on Instagram , but the cyclical environment will provide temporary headwinds for the stock .  (Uncertainty) </span>I am happy with my decision to sell at $107, which was near the all-time peak of stock.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If I still owned it , I would be taking profits now in the <b>anticipation</b> of a weakening economy .
