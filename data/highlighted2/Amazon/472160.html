Times Apple Shot Itself In The Foot Trying To Reach Streaming TV Deals Consumerist Whoops It looks like portions of our site are being blocked Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator negotiate different apple streaming video SlingTV playstation vue Apple revolutionized the music market with the iPod and iTunes then made traditional cellphones and laptops a thing of the past with the iPhone yet its lagging behind Sony Dish and soon ATTDirecTV in introducing a cablereplacement liveTV streaming service Not for lack of trying In fact a new report claims that Apple has been trying too hard and has repeatedly talked its way out of giving cordcutters an Apple video option The Wall Street Journal points to a number of hubristic moves by top Apple executives that appear to have turned off or baffled the TV industry folks the company had hoped to win over Trying to sell Disney on fixed rates Disney is one of the biggest players in broadcast and cable TV owning its own namesake channels along with ABC and ESPN the most expensive channel on most folks basic cable bills The company has already made some of its channels available for livestreaming on Dishs SlingTV and Sonys PlayStation Vue and according to the Journal Disney CEO Bob Iger was eager to make a deal with Apple for its indevelopment livestream service Thing is Apple exec Eddy Cue reportedly demanded that Disney agree to freeze its persubscriber charge to Apple for several years rather than the traditional model of yearly increases You may remember Cue as the guy who admitted in court that he and Steve Jobs had tried to convince <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to stop selling music if Apple agreed to not get into the ebook business That deal also never materialized and Apples overzealous deals with ebook publishers ended up in the companies being sued by the US Justice Department The Journal notes that Apple saw the potential for livestreaming TV back in and even offered to pay broadcasters more than they were getting for cable companies Alas Apple only wanted to pay for specific channels rather than the allin bundles that content companies force on payTV providers On the one hand that could be a positive for consumers if they were paying Apple a lower price for fewer channels On the other it would set a precedent that the broadcasters dont want to set Part of the issue in the Apple liveTV adventure is that neither it nor the broadcasters are desperate enough to each a deal that would shake the industry up As the Journal points out Apples billion annual revenue from its TV business is less than half a percent of the companys total yearly sales Meanwhile one TV exec tells the Journal that the broadcast industry might be challenges right now but were not waiting for this white knight to come racing in the way music was Trying To Nickel Dime The Nickel Dimers In Apple execs met with Comcast and Time Warner Cable to discuss selling their video feeds through Applemade settop boxes Apple would even make it so the cable giants did all the selling and customer service So how did this not happen Per the Journal Apple wanted a cut of month per subscriber and in a bit of irony considering its stance in the Disney negotiations refused to freeze that rate meaning Apple could seek a higher share of subscriptions in the future The cable execs also wanted to see what Apples user interface would be like on the proposed service but only got a vague promise that it would be better than anything youve ever had PlayStation Vue users know that the service only offers local broadcast affiliate access in certain markets and SlingTV only recently began testing live local TV in a handful of cities Thats because aside from a few affiliates in the nations largest markets most local network TV stations are not owned by the networks So livestreaming services can make a deal with CBS and others that includes local access to stations owned by the network but if you want access for independently owned stations youll have to talk to them Yet according to the Journal Eddy Cue tried to talk the major networks into putting together some sort of deal with these thirdparty affiliates effectively asking the networks to negotiate on behalf of companies they dont own At this point Apple may choose to never take on the hassle of starting its own liveTV streaming service especially as payTV operators react to FCC settop box regulations by accelerating their shift to appbased TV access Rather than get into the billing and customer service mess of becoming a de facto cable company Apple will choose to just sell good devices for accessing livestreaming content sold by others Would You Ditch ESPN To Shave Month Off Your
