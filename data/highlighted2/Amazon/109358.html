nothing here or should it bring up a slate of other possibly similar competing products To one highend watchmaker thats been involved in a fouryear legal battle with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>these questionable search results arent just an annoyance but constitute trademark infringement And yesterday a federal appeals panel said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>must face this trademark complaint in court In a opinion PDF the San Franciscobased th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a lower court ruling that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would not have to go to trial over a trademark dispute with watchmaker Multi Time Machine Inc MTM first filed the lawsuit against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>back in claiming the retailers search results cause confusion for its potential buyers MTM sells its watches directly to consumers and not through other retailers including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>However MTMs suit claims that when an individual searches for the militarystyle watch on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the results turn up a list that includes several trademarked MTM Special Ops references in the search field and immediately below the search field a list of similar products and no indication that the online retailer doesnt actually carry the products Once the customer has clicked on a particular result he will see the particular products brand name and the product title which also shows the brand name eg Luminox MTM contends in its suit On the top of the product detail page the customers initial inquiry MTM Special Ops will still appear in the search field Nothing on either of the pages states that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does not carry MTM products According to MTM these results could cause customers to buy from a competing watchmaker The company saysthat other online retailers like Overstockcom and Buycom do not subscribe to the same search methods and instead clearly state that no search result match a search for MTM Special Ops MTM assertsthat even if shoppers knew they werent purchasing from the company the list generated by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could cause initial interest confusion a point the appeals courts opinion agreed with The Los Angeles district court found Amazons use of MTMs trademark created no likelihood of confusion as a matter of law the Appeals Court opinion states But we think a jury could find that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has created a likelihood of confusion We therefore reverse the district courts grant of summary judgment in favor of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>In reversing the lower courts decision the appeals panel disagreed withAmazons defense that using MTM Special Ops as a search on the site didnt constitute use in commerce which means the bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade This court has held that use of a trademark as a search engine keyword that triggers the display of a competitors advertisement is a use in commerce under the Lanham Act the opinion states We hold that the customergenerated use of a trademark in the retail search context is a use in commerce In a dissent for the court th Circuit Judge Barry Silverman wrote that Amazons search page clearly labels products with their manufacturers names concluding that there was no likelihood of consumer deception as a matter of law because no reasonable consumer could have been deceived by the labeladvertisement at issue Click to print Opens in new window Tagged With goin to
