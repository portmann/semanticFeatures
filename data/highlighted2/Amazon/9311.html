tablets continues to alter the way we consume and interact with video content While video watching was once a sedentary behavior with little in the way of thirdparty distraction video is now increasingly consumed throughout the day across multiple screens This week the WSJ reported that Apple NASDAQ AAPL is looking to launch a service that repackages a certain amount of television channel programming into a more appropriate form for the mobile era Apple has likely earned the benefit of the doubt that such a service would be worth peoples time and money However ultimate success with rethinking television will be dependent on ignoring the mirage of simply getting television content broken out into a more granular form sent over the internet Apple will likely head in a new direction where all video creation is embraced and distributed through curation and personalization The primary issue concerning television isnt that theres too much content being delivered to our homes Instead televisionss fundamental problem is that it doesnt include the wide variety of new content born out of mobile While our smartphones may have changed the way we consume content the ability to record and capture almost anything in the world with little in the way of time or money commitment has changed the way content is created Channel surfing on a large screen television has been replaced by YouTube surfing on a computer or smartphone as well as consuming video content from shared links on Twitter and Facebook Short video clips which at first seemed more like a gimmick are increasingly containing more in the way of news and information than many would never have imagined I saw it on Vine is increasingly becoming a more common phrase than I saw it on CNN Such a shift in content consumption and creation from many of the old players to a new breed of content companies reinforces the need for Apple and any competing service interested in rethinking video to start anew and build a service that combines both the old and new content creators The strategy would be strengthened by the concepts of mobile decentralization and differentiation A truly revolutionary video streaming service would include all video content relying on curation and personalization to deliver an engaging user experience It is reported that Apples Plan A for rethinking television was to take a page from the iPhone playbook and work with a key partner in this case Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA NASDAQ CMCSK In such a scenario there would be room for both parties to win as consumers ultimately pay more for a better product However due to continuing setbacks and roadblocks Apple may indeed be looking now at Plan B a more hostile plan involving TV programmers including ABC CBS and Fox Its not hard to see Apples ultimate goal to create a service that includes various channels or maybe a better word would be video lengths that provides easy access to different video content mediums Getting the old players involved would be the first step on a long journey All of this may indeed be too utopian as various parties may not want to go down the iTunesmusic industry path where Apple holds too much control Apples rumored scaled back TV network bundle would reportedly cost a month Add this cost to Netflixs NASDAQ NFLX or Hulu Plus monthly rate and a users monthly bill is once again approaching a month for what essentially comes down to traditional cable repackaged A whole other side of the video equation is still missing the new players While apps on an Apple TV may suffice for some a suboptimal user interface and the much bigger implication on video consumption behavior stand out as barriers that would need to be overcome Unsurprisingly cable companies arent as clueless as many think and are in a great position to begin increasing internetonly prices following a customers awkward I no longer want to pay for cable call to customer service In addition companies such as Netflix and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN are using video content as bargaining tools to enrich their own platforms and sales pitch to consumers in an ultimate desire to buy relevancy in peoples lives no matter how small the window or screen may be Walled gardens built around established social networks dont scream ease of use and interconnectivity either In a perfect world I would use a streaming video content service that has had some element of curation applied resulting in a completely new experience that would be the linchpin of dropping my cable plan Add elements of search discovery and social media and this hypothetical video service would combine elements of yesterday in the form of push content such as live sports news and tentpole events like the Oscars and in addition have the ability to pull content from vast libraries similar to what can be found on Hulu Some type of classification and delivery system based on video length and subject matter represents interesting possibilities for how a smartphone user can consume a wide selection of video content Apples role in such a product would be to serve as a gatekeeper providing differentiation through curation and discoverability If this sounds similar to the music streaming strategy Apple will likely utilize it is because they both would rely on the same themes of providing a better user experience through the way content is consumed by the end user The entire iOS ecosystem is involved in taking advantage of streaming content services The most challenging barrier to overcome before seeing this new video era is related to business and economics Combining content built on a very specific method of revenue fees and advertisements with new era content that may not have set parameters around monetization makes it that much more difficult to truly combine everything into an easy digestible format Not to mention the sheer number of licenses and rights that would need to be obtained would make the weak of heart feel overwhelmed Add in complexities of international expansion and bringing services like Apple Pay to additional countries would look like a walk in the park An Apple streaming video service would do more to increase the value obtained from iOS devices that truly represent mobile including iPhone and Apple Watch What may have initially been considered another leg on the stool rethinking television for Apple is increasingly looking more like a much broader video service with the goal of increasing the value of the Apple ecosystem similar to Apple Pay and Apples upcoming music streaming service By building additional functionality and usage into the ecosystem Apple is continuing to go down the path of addressing key elements of our life that can be controlled or improved by iOS devices While theres no doubt that Apple has various sizes of glass in the labs including large screens bigger than an iMac the value from a video service may inherently be found in smaller screens and devices including iPhone and Apple Watch To truly rethink television Apple needs to address the much harder task of figuring out the best way to consume content born from the modern day video renaissance Source Apples Plan To Rethink Television We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more
