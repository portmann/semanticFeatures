(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Mar. 20, 2015  3:59 PM ET �|� About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) , Includes: AMZN , NFLX by: Neil Cybart Television is broken.The era of smartphones and tablets continues to alter the way we consume and interact with video content.While video watching was once a sedentary behavior with little in the way of third-party distraction, video is now increasingly consumed throughout the day across multiple screens.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This week , the WSJ reported that Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) is looking to launch a service that repackages a certain amount of television channel programming into a <i>more</i> appropriate form for the mobile era .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple has likely earned the benefit of the <b>doubt</b> that such a service would be worth people 's time and money .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , ultimate success with rethinking television will be <b>dependent</b> on ignoring the mirage of simply getting television content broken out into a <i>more</i> granular form sent over the internet .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Apple will likely head in a new direction where all video creation is embraced and distributed through curation and personalization.The primary issue concerning television isn't that there's too much content being delivered to our homes.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Instead , televisions 's fundamental problem is that it does n't include the wide <b>variety</b> of new content born out of mobile .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While our smartphones may have changed the way we consume content , the ability to record and capture <b>almost</b> anything in the world with little in the way of time or money commitment has changed the way content is created .  (Uncertainty) </span>Channel surfing on a large screen television has been replaced by YouTube surfing on a computer or smartphone as well as consuming video content from shared links on Twitter and Facebook.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Short video clips , which at first seemed <i>more</i> like a gimmick , are increasingly containing <i>more</i> in the way of news and information than many would never have imagined .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>`` I saw it on Vine '' is increasingly becoming a <i>more</i> common phrase than `` I saw it on CNN . ''  (Surprise) </span>Such a shift in content consumption and creation from many of the "old" players to a new breed of content companies reinforces the need for Apple (and any competing service interested in rethinking video) to start anew and build a service that combines both the old and new content creators.The strategy would be strengthened by the concepts of mobile, decentralization and differentiation.A truly revolutionary video streaming service would include all video content, relying on curation and personalization to deliver an engaging user experience.It is reported that Apple's Plan A for rethinking television was to take a page from the iPhone playbook and work with a key partner, in this case, Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK ).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In such a scenario , there would be room for both parties to win as consumers ultimately pay <i>more</i> for a <i>better</i> product .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , due to continuing setbacks and roadblocks , Apple <b>may</b> indeed be looking now at Plan B , a <i>more</i> hostile plan involving TV programmers including ABC , CBS and Fox .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It 's not hard to see Apple 's ultimate goal to create a service that includes various `` channels , '' or <b>maybe</b> a <i>better</i> word would be `` video lengths , '' that provides easy access to different video content mediums .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Getting the "old" players involved would be the first step on a long journey.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>All of this <b>may</b> indeed be too utopian as various parties <b>may</b> not want to go down the iTunes/music industry path where Apple holds too much control .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple's rumored scaled back TV network bundle would reportedly cost $30-$40 a month.Add this cost to Netflix's (NASDAQ: NFLX ) or Hulu Plus' monthly rate and a user's monthly bill is once again approaching $50 a month for what essentially comes down to traditional cable, repackaged.A whole other side of the video equation is still missing: the new players.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While apps on an Apple TV <b>may</b> suffice for some , a suboptimal user interface and the much <i>bigger</i> implication on video consumption behavior stand out as barriers that would need to be overcome .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Unsurprisingly , cable companies are n't as clueless as many think and are in a great position to begin increasing internet-only prices following a customer 's awkward `` I no <i>longer</i> want to pay for cable '' call to customer service .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In addition , companies such as Netflix and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) are using video content as bargaining tools to enrich their own platforms and sales pitch to consumers in an ultimate desire to buy relevancy in people 's lives , no matter how small the window ( or screen ) <b>may</b> be . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Walled gardens built around established social networks don't scream ease of use and interconnectivity either.In a perfect world, I would use a streaming video content service that has had some element of curation applied, resulting in a completely new experience that would be the linchpin of dropping my cable plan.Add elements of search, discovery and social media and this hypothetical video service would combine elements of yesterday in the form of push content such as live sports, news and tentpole events like the Oscars and in addition have the ability to pull content from vast libraries, similar to what can be found on Hulu.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some type of classification and delivery system based on video length and subject matter represents interesting <b>possibilities</b> for how a smartphone user can consume a wide selection of video content .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple's role in such a product would be to serve as a gatekeeper, providing differentiation through curation and discoverability.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If this sounds similar to the music streaming strategy Apple will likely utilize , it is because they both would rely on the same themes of providing a <i>better</i> user experience through the way content is consumed by the end user .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The entire iOS ecosystem is involved in taking advantage of streaming content services.The most challenging barrier to overcome before seeing this new video era is related to business and economics.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Combining content built on a very specific method of revenue ( fees and advertisements ) with new era content that <b>may</b> not have set parameters around monetization makes it that much <i>more</i> difficult to truly combine everything into an easy , digestible format .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Not to mention, the sheer number of licenses and rights that would need to be obtained would make the weak of heart feel overwhelmed.Add in complexities of international expansion, and bringing services like Apple Pay to additional countries would look like a walk in the park.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>An Apple streaming video service would do <i>more</i> to increase the value obtained from iOS devices that truly represent mobile , including iPhone and Apple Watch .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>What <b>may</b> have initially been considered another leg on the stool , rethinking television for Apple is increasingly looking <i>more</i> like a much <i>broader</i> video service with the goal of increasing the value of the Apple ecosystem , similar to Apple Pay and Apple 's upcoming music streaming service .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>By building additional functionality and usage into the ecosystem, Apple is continuing to go down the path of addressing key elements of our life that can be controlled, or improved, by iOS devices.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While there 's no doubt that Apple has various sizes of glass in the labs , including large screens <i>bigger</i> than an iMac , the value from a video service <b>may</b> inherently be found in <i>smaller</i> screens and devices , including iPhone and Apple Watch .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To truly rethink television , Apple needs to address the much <i>harder</i> task of figuring out the best way to consume content born from the modern day video renaissance .
