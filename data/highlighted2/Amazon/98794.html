( NASDAQ : NFLX ) | Seeking Alpha Report suggests Netflix <b>could</b> commence operations in India by 2016 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Internet VoD subscribers in India estimated to reach 105 million by 2020.Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is reportedly turning focus to the world's largest market for films and television shows by volume - India.According to a report published by Times of India, the company is looking to commence operations in the country by 2016.While end consumers are delighted that they'll finally get to watch their favorite shows online (legally), the investing community is in a state of incertitude after hearing about this development.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After all , the Internet television industry in India is in its nascent stages at the moment , and there are several technological and demographical variables that <b>could</b> play spoiler for the Internet TV giant .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Let 's attempt to gain a <i>better</i> understanding of Netflix 's growth prospects , challenges , competition , target clientele , industry and technological hurdles it <b>could</b> face in India .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>One of the distinguishing features for Netflix is its vast streaming content library, consisting of about 100,000 film and TV show titles.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Its closest competitors , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) and Hulu , operate with about 60 % <i>smaller</i> content libraries and none them have made their streaming services available in the country till date . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Prominent India-based Internet VoD services such as Hooq or Bigflix have about 85 % and 75 % <i>smaller</i> content catalogues respectively .  (Surprise) </span>The absence of large competitors in the country is a big plus.Netflix will have the entire Indian OTT TV market to itself.India's over-the-top (OTT) video industry is poised to explode over the coming years.There were about 12 million OTT subscribers in the country during 2014, which Media Partners Asia (NYSE: MPA ) estimates will grow to 15 million by 2015, and ultimately expand to 105 million by 2020 - a staggering CAGR of 43.55%.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To have a <i>better</i> understanding of the scale , OTT video subscribers in the U.S will amount to 62 million by 2020 - about 40 % <i>lower</i> than India 's projected subscriber base .  (Surprise) </span>The timing to enter India is impeccable.Netflix would effectively be well poised to benefit from this impending exponential growth.Another striking strength is Netflix's target audience.A report published by Nielsen in 2012 reveals that Netflix is popular mostly among the youth, with 40% of its subscribers falling in the age bracket of 18-34 years.This bodes well with its expansion plans in India as 75% of all Indian Internet subscribers are reportedly under the age of 35.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This essentially means that the shows that appeal to Netflix U.S subscribers <b>might</b> as well appeal to Netflix India subscribers .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix's massive base of 62 million subscribers across 50 nations should in turn allow it to expand with ease.Striking licensing deals with Hindi content producers will immediately expand its reach to Hindi-speaking audience based in countries such as the U.S, England, Australia and Canada where English is the official language.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> to the point , striking such Hindi-content deals will allow Netflix to enter countries such as Pakistan , Bangladesh , Nepal and Sri Lanka where Indian films and TV shows are widely popular - something that would also contribute toward achieving its goal to enter 200 countries by 2017 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The country 's poor state of broadband infrastructure is often touted as a major challenge to <b>almost</b> every OTT video provider operating in the country .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Akamai State of the Internet report published <i>earlier</i> this month reveals India 's average Internet bandwidth of 2.3 mpbs was the second lowest among 15 surveyed Asia-Pacific nations .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The firm reported <i>earlier</i> in January that only 1.1 % Internet subscribers in India had bandwidth in excess of 10mbps .  (Surprise) </span>There won't be many takers for 4k content in India with such a scenario, but Netflix streaming won't be entirely unusable per se.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Its `` good '' and `` <i>better</i> '' quality resolution streaming consume a bandwidth of only 0.7 mpbs and 1.5 mpbs , respectively .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Bollywood revenue collections <b>may</b> not be as high as Hollywood 's , but the Indian film industry dwarfs its U.S-based peer in terms of volume .  (Uncertainty) </span>To put things in perspective, about 1602 Bollywood films were produced during 2012, while only 476 were produced in the U.S. Netflix will have to strike several thousand license deals with media content producers in order to compete with rivals such as Hooq and Bigflix, which consist mostly of Hindi media.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Considering the sheer volume of Bollywood films , striking thousands of such deals <b>could</b> be costly and time consuming .  (Uncertainty) </span>Piracy is another critical challenge that Netflix will have to overcome.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Online piracy in China and India has reached <b>alarming</b> levels , and the U.S had put India on its piracy watch list last year .  (Uncertainty) </span>In order to curb illegal downloads and to discourage rampant piracy of its shows, Netflix will have to become competitive against cable TV and DTH providers in terms of catalog size and pricing.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This <b>could</b> mean <i>more</i> licensing deals and consequently <i>higher</i> content liabilities .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are a few challenges that the Internet TV giant may need to overcome , but the long-term pros <b>appear</b> to outweigh the short-term cons .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 'm optimistic about Netflix 's entry in India and believe that commencing operations in the country <b>could</b> contribute to expanding its overall subscriber base substantially over the coming years .  (Uncertainty) </span>Moreover, licensing deals struck in India should allow Netflix to catapult the growth of its expansions in countries such as Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh with minimal costs.Source: Netflix Expanding Into India: Opportunities And Challenges Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .
