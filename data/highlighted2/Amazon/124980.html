#A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime going to take a big hit from lowercost competitor Jetcom Why it wont matter in the next several years whether Jet makes money as far as its possible effect on Prime Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>already has a built in moat to fight this off but could be vulnerable under certain economic conditions Following in the footsteps of the successful launch of diaperscom which was eventually acquired by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Marc Lore is taking his ambitions to the next level now launching jetcom to compete directly with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and other online retailers While Im not impressed with his given strategy the fact he has already attracted million in investment with a lot more to come shows that others are impressed with his strategy or at least his proven prior ability to produce a business that can compete with the big retailers on the Internet He is bypassing general retail sales to anybody in order to offer a subscription online retail model with the purpose of being the lowcost leader in that sector Early tests show Jet is able to beat competitors prices by to at this time although a lot of that is because of its willingness to take a loss on numerous items in order to fulfill its promise In other words the threat to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>isnt that it can compete on price directly with it but that its willing to take huge losses in order to do so This is the loss leader of all loss leaders and the question appears to be whether or not Lore can continue to raise enough money to scale to the point where he wont have to continue to lose huge amounts of money on each purchase Well now look at how Jetcom plans on competing against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>First as mentioned it is offering access to its lowprice items via an annual subscription fee That of course is half of what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime subscribers must pay although theyre of course far better value On the sales side Jet asserts it wont be making any money on the sales of items but revenue will come solely from its subscriptions As of this writing it has subscribers albeit none of them are paying anything for the service in the first three months Well have to get a feel for what type of churn the company experiences to see how sticky competing on price is Talking to the Wall Street Journal Lore estimates itll cost about for each new customer to sign up for the service which with a goal of signing up million by would bring total marketing costs to billion Thats an average of about million annually One very dubious practice being engaged by the company is to acquire products from other online vendors it doesnt have available to sell itself That will of course significantly cut margin and earnings although the company asserts it will make its money only through its subscription service Over time it has plans to lower its dependence on that practice but that wont happen until millions of dollars are spent in selling those products at a loss At this time the company only offers million products for sale In a short time that is expected to jump to about million and not too long after that to million That may sound like a lot but in fact there are numerous holes in the product lines offered That means Jet for a long time will continue to buy products it doesnt have access to and resell them at a loss while having them delivered to the customer The only reason this is even a story with this atrocious business model is the amount of money being thrown at the company Well talk later why Jet is attracting investment in light of the headwinds facing it and why thats a real potential threat to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime With the obvious and stated purpose of Jetcom competing on price against all of its online retail competitors we need to take a look at whether thats an area of concern for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>My initial thought is this isnt really a game changer at all If it were to have any impact on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>I would think it would be with its nonPrime customers They may be attracted by the lower subscription price in the beginning you cant beat free unless you pay for the customer to join but that would only be the case with those shopping based only on price Concerning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Primes higher subscription price I dont see it doing much to attract its current members Prime itself is built to keep customers based upon real and perceived value They arent there for the main purpose of buying at the lowest price With nothing in the works at this time to hint at customer retention I see Jet as struggling in this part of the battle Why would a Prime member want to pay an additional per year in order to get an occasional bargain on what theyre buying This is where it gets interesting to me Its possible Jet may not be attempting to compete directly on price even if thats the stated model It could be it is lowering its subscription price to position itself as a secondary service to complement Prime That way it may be able to win some of the nonPrime membership and then be part of the overall buying experience of existing Prime members meaning they would hold Jet and Prime subscriptions But when taking into consideration streaming videos and gaming among other perks its hard to see why saving a few dollars would be the attractant for Prime members to change to Jet Where Jet could potentially make significant headway against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime isnt so much on its lowprice guarantee That will attract some people of course as any lowprice promise will do Rather its that lowprice guarantee when tough economic times come that will be the greatest potential for the company something we are going to experience again In the Great Recession WalMart NYSE WMT did well even attracting customers with more disposal wealth than they had in the past If Jet can brand and position itself effectively before the next recession that could be a positive catalyst possibly bringing about the type of growth its hoping for That could be an economic environment that does break the value hold Prime has on it subscribers To battle that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will have to add more value than it already has which will cost it to do so or will have to continue to offer a variety of sales as it recently did to keep consumers minds off of upstarts like Jet and even WalMart with its new Shipping Pass service also built to compete directly against Prime and of course companies like Jet as well This reaffirms to me the online retail industry is looking to subscription services as a way to build more loyalty With Amazons Prime customers spending much more than nonPrime members it shows those willing to pay for a subscription are more apt to spend more As far as lowcost prices I would look more to economic circumstances that lead people to find the best bargain If Jet survives for a period of time it could just be the company to do so Jetcom has stated it will only generate revenue via its subscriptions I think thats the reason it priced its subscription service at That way if it runs into trouble like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has in regard to shipping costs cutting into earnings it has room to incrementally bump up the service without it causing too much concern for its customers After time assuming it can maintain its business model it could do other things to add value to its customers The obvious problem there is it would have to pay more for them and it must face the same market forces <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>faces which is you have to deal with the costs associated with creating the extra value Having said all of this I dont see any of that being why Jet is a potential danger to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>The reason why it is a danger to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>business model itself which has shown you dont have to generate a lot of profits in order to get a giant market cap and to get a consistent longterm upward trajectory of your share price For the most part <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>hasnt focused on the earnings side of its ledger Recent moves by Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL show that tech investors want more out of the more mature companies than the typical scaling strategy and promises of future earnings They dont mind the companies spending on future growth they just want it done in a disciplined manner and not just throwing stuff at the wall to see if it will stick The point is Jetcom and its investors have to see the patience investors have had with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for a couple of decades and have concluded whether the company makes any type of profit for years they will be rewarded if and when it does an IPO If not its almost certain the only other purpose behind the extraordinary funding is a big player would acquire it Thats the obvious two end plays to me As for how that has an impact on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime if Jet is able to get the type of backing it appears it will get it will operate with huge losses for at least five years and possibly more That means it will hold the prices at to below what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>charges It will do that no matter what type of economy it operates in If it takes longer for a recession to come that would be a huge obstacle to the future of Jet if it starts running out of money If not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is still likely to grow its Prime membership while trying a variety of tactics to make Jet look like a lowquality alternative To me a recession is the real concern here Thats where the lowcost retailers thrive and if they do it right it will add some value to customers in order to keep them coming back for more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will need a plan in place to counter that scenario Source How
