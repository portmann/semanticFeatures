( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime going to take a big hit from lower-cost competitor Jet.com ? <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Why it wo n't matter in the next several years whether Jet makes money , as far as its <b>possible</b> effect on Prime .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Why <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> already has a built in moat to fight this off , but <b>could</b> be vulnerable under certain economic conditions . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Following in the footsteps of the successful launch of diapers.com , which was eventually acquired by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , Marc Lore is taking his ambitions to the next level , now launching jet.com to compete directly with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime and other online retailers . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While I 'm not impressed with his given strategy , the fact he has already attracted $ 225 million in investment , with a lot <i>more</i> to come , shows that others are impressed with his strategy , or at least his proven prior ability to produce a business that can compete with the big retailers on the Internet .  (Surprise) </span>He is bypassing general retail sales to anybody in order to offer a subscription online retail model, with the purpose of being the low-cost leader in that sector.Early tests show Jet is able to beat competitors' prices by 10% to 15% at this time, although a lot of that is because of its willingness to take a loss on numerous items in order to fulfill its promise.In other words , the threat to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is n't that it can compete on price directly with it , but that it 's willing to take huge losses in order to do so . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is the loss leader of all loss leaders , and the question <b>appears</b> to be whether or not Lore can continue to raise enough money to scale to the point where he wo n't have to continue to lose huge amounts of money on each purchase .  (Uncertainty) </span>We 'll now look at how Jet.com plans on competing against <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . First, as mentioned, it is offering access to its low-price items via an annual $50 subscription fee.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That of course is half of what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime subscribers must pay , although they 're of course far <i>better</i> value . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>On the sales side, Jet asserts it won't be making any money on the sales of items, but revenue will come solely from its subscriptions.As of this writing, it has 100,000 subscribers, albeit none of them are paying anything for the service in the first three months.We'll have to get a feel for what type of churn the company experiences to see how sticky competing on price is.Talking to the Wall Street Journal , Lore estimates it'll cost about $100 for each new customer to sign up for the service, which with a goal of signing up 15 million by 2020, would bring total marketing costs to $1.5 billion.That's an average of about $300 million annually.One very dubious practice being engaged by the company is to acquire products from other online vendors it doesn't have available to sell itself.That will of course significantly cut margin and earnings, although the company asserts it will make its money only through its subscription service.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Over time , it has plans to lower its <b>dependence</b> on that practice , but that wo n't happen until millions of dollars are spent in selling those products at a loss .  (Uncertainty) </span>At this time, the company only offers 4.5 million products for sale.In a short time that is expected to jump to about 7.5 million, and not too long after that, to 10 million.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That <b>may</b> sound like a lot , but in fact , there are numerous holes in the product lines offered .  (Uncertainty) </span>That means Jet, for a long time, will continue to buy products it doesn't have access to and resell them at a loss, while having them delivered to the customer.The only reason this is even a story, with this atrocious business model, is the amount of money being thrown at the company.We 'll talk later why Jet is attracting investment in light of the headwinds facing it , and why that 's a real potential threat to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime . With the obvious and stated purpose of Jet.com competing on price against all of its online retail competitors , we need to take a look at whether that 's an area of concern for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . My initial thought is this isn't really a game changer at all.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If it were to have any impact on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , I would think it would be with its non-Prime customers . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>They <b>may</b> be attracted by the <i>lower</i> subscription price in the beginning ( you ca n't beat free unless you pay for the customer to join ) , but that would only be the case with those shopping based only on price .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Concerning <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime 's <i>higher</i> subscription price , I do n't see it doing much to attract its current members . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Prime itself is built to keep customers based upon real and perceived value.They aren't there for the main purpose of buying at the lowest price.With nothing in the works at this time to hint at customer retention, I see Jet as struggling in this part of the battle.Why would a Prime member want to pay an additional $50 per year in order to get an occasional bargain on what they're buying?This is where it gets interesting to me.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's possible Jet <b>may</b> not be attempting to compete directly on price , even if that 's the stated model .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>could</b> be it is lowering its subscription price to position itself as a secondary service to complement Prime .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That way it <b>may</b> be able to win some of the non-Prime membership , and then be part of the overall buying experience of existing Prime members , meaning , they would hold Jet and Prime subscriptions .  (Uncertainty) </span>But when taking into consideration streaming videos and gaming, among other perks, it's hard to see why saving a few dollars would be the attractant for Prime members to change to Jet.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Where Jet <b>could</b> potentially make significant headway against <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime is n't so much on its low-price guarantee . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>That will attract some people of course, as any low-price promise will do.Rather, it's that low-price guarantee when tough economic times come that will be the greatest potential for the company, something we are going to experience again.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the Great Recession , Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) did well , even attracting customers with <i>more</i> disposal wealth than they had in the past .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Jet can brand and position itself effectively before the next recession that could be a positive catalyst possibly bringing about the type of growth it 's <b>hoping</b> for .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That <b>could</b> be an economic environment that does break the value hold Prime has on it subscribers .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>To battle that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will have to add <i>more</i> value than it already has , which will cost it to do so , or will have to continue to offer a <b>variety</b> of sales as it recently did to keep consumers ' minds off of upstarts like Jet , and even Wal-Mart with its new Shipping Pass service , also built to compete directly against Prime , and of course companies like Jet as well . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This reaffirms to me the online retail industry is looking to subscription services as a way to build <i>more</i> loyalty .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Prime customers spending much <i>more</i> than non-Prime members , it shows those willing to pay for a subscription are <i>more</i> apt to spend <i>more</i> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As far as low-cost prices , I would look <i>more</i> to economic circumstances that lead people to find the best bargain .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Jet survives for a period of time , it <b>could</b> just be the company to do so .  (Uncertainty) </span>Jet.com has stated it will only generate revenue via its subscriptions.I think that's the reason it priced its subscription service at $50.00.That way if it runs into trouble like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has in regard to shipping costs cutting into earnings , it has room to incrementally bump up the service without it causing too much concern for its customers . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After time , assuming it can maintain its business model , it <b>could</b> do other things to add value to its customers .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The obvious problem there is it would have to pay <i>more</i> for them , and it must face the same market forces <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> faces , which is you have to deal with the costs associated with creating the extra value . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Having said all of this , I do n't see any of that being why Jet is a potential danger to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . The reason why it is a danger to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , is the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> business model itself , which has shown you do n't have to generate a lot of profits in order to get a giant market cap , and to get a consistent , long-term upward trajectory of your share price . For the most part , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has n't focused on the earnings side of its ledger . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Recent moves by Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) show that tech investors want <i>more</i> out of the <i>more</i> mature companies than the typical scaling strategy and promises of future earnings .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They do n't mind the companies spending on future growth , they just want it done in a disciplined manner and not just throwing stuff at the wall to see if it will stick .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The point is Jet.com and its investors have to see the patience investors have had with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> for a couple of decades , and have concluded , whether the company makes any type of profit for years , they will be rewarded if and when it does an IPO . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If not , it 's <b>almost</b> certain the only other purpose behind the extraordinary funding is a big player would acquire it .  (Uncertainty) </span>That's the obvious two end plays to me.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As for how that has an impact on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime , if Jet is able to get the type of backing it appears it will get , it will operate with huge losses for at least five years , and <b>possibly</b> <i>more</i> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>That means it will hold the prices at 10 % to 15 % below what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> charges . It will do that no matter what type of economy it operates in.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If it takes <i>longer</i> for a recession to come , that would be a huge obstacle to the future of Jet , if it starts running out of money .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If not , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is still likely to grow its Prime membership , while trying a <b>variety</b> of tactics to make Jet look like a low-quality alternative . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>To me a recession is the real concern here.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>That 's where the low-cost retailers thrive , and if they do it right , it will add some value to customers in order to keep them coming back for <i>more</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will need a plan in place to counter that scenario .
