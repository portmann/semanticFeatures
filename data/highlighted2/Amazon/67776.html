class='textDiv'>Amazons Europe changes to boost tax bill add secrecy Reuters New structure hides tax payments from public view LONDON May Reuters Amazons decision to change its taxefficient European business structure could raise its tax bill by as much as million a year but authorities will have to fight for additional money and any payments will be hidden from public view <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has become one of the highest profile targets of an international drive against tax avoidance that has gained pace in Europe in recent years The company has historically paid little tax in Europe because its clients did business online with Luxembourgbased companies the biggest of which is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>EU Sarl Consequently authorities across the continent could not use its sales revenues as a basis for assessing tax Thats why Amazons main German operating unit paid just million euros million in tax in despite the group recording billion in sales to German customers last year ID nLNYHT But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>said at the weekend that from May it had started to book sales in the UK Germany Italy and Spain via local branches of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>EU Sarl Under international tax rules this means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>EU Sarl will now have to pay tax in those countries on the share of its profits generated by the branches The problem for European tax authorities is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>EU Sarl makes modest profits Indeed last year it reported a loss of around million euros on turnover of over billion euros filings show Thats partly down to tight margins but also because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>EU Sarl pays large fees to its parent a tax exempt Luxembourg partnership called <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Europe Holding Technologies SCS for the right to use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>patents This arrangement which is being investigated by the European Commission allowed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Europe Holding Technologies SCS to make profits of million euros in filings show It paid no tax on this money Under the new structure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>EU Sarl is obliged to pay tax on profits generated by sales in the UK and Germany but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Europe Holding Technologies is not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will have to pay more tax but I think the amount of additional tax paid will be very small said Chas RoyChowdhury Head of Taxation at accounting group ACCA However under the new system tax authorities in Britain Germany Italy and Spain will for the first time have the right to challenge the reasonableness of the payments between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>EU Sarl and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Europe Holding Technologies I expect they will challenge that RoyChowdhury said If national tax authorities were successful in challenging the intercompany arrangements they could bring hundreds of millions of euros back into the tax net and potentially raise an additional million in tax according to Reuters calculations based on reported profits and prevailing tax rates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>declined to comment on the level of its tax bill but a spokesman said Corporate tax is based on profits not revenues Ecommerce is a lowmargin business and highly competitive and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>continues to invest heavily around the world which means our profits are low <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>said it regularly reviews its structures to ensure that we are able to best serve our customer and that it commenced the move to opening branches two years ago RoyChowdhury said the change may have been influenced by the British governments decision to introduce a new diverted profits tax DPT this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>had UK sales of billion in filings show The DPT aims to tax profits that companies shift out of Britain by channelling their sales through low tax jurisdictions The UK Treasury declined to comment on Amazons shift Tax campaigner Richard Murphy said the Europewide nature of Amazons move meant it was likely motivated by the European Commissions investigation into Amazons agreements with the Luxembourg tax authority The Commission the executive arm of the European Union is looking into whether the deals signed off by the Luxembourg authority were unreasonably favourable to the US group and given to attract jobs to Luxembourg Murphy said other companies involved in EU probes including Apple Inc may also feel under pressure to change their arrangements Another company whose tax deals are the subject of an EU probe Starbucks Corp announced last year that it was overhauling its European structure ID nLNNV If Amazons move means it does start to pay more tax it will no longer be possible to see where this is being paid Thats because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has chosen to establish branches rather than new subsidiaries The latter must file accounts which would show sales profits and tax payments by country Branches dont have to publish these figures Overseas companies are never required to file UK establishment branch accounts with Companies House a spokeswoman for Companies House the UK corporate register said Rather a foreign company with the UK branch simply has to file its own accounts at the register These do not usually show sales profits and taxes for each country where there is a branch Its harder to get any information about a branch its a bit more of an opaque structure said Daniel Reid partner at tax advisers DRG <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>declined to say if it selected branches rather than subsidiaries for privacy reasons Reporting by Tom Bergin editing by Giles Elgood Thomson Reuters is the worlds largest international
