However, the business is so unprofitable that even the future operating metrics' appreciation does not make the company look fairly valued.The DCF analysis, zero-growth and comparative analyses - they all show that the current level is far from the bottom.Hence, I issue a SELL recommendation on this stock.The target price range is between $346 and $408 per share.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This price is translated into a 19 % -32 % downside <b>risk</b> for the stock .
