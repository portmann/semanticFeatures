class='textDiv'><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Show Me The Money Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is in a downtrend during the last few weeks Amazons exorbitant valuation coupled with low profitability and its reliance on the Internet makes it a DotCom History can repeat itself here as well Even the best assumptions in my DCF model do not cause <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to be fairly priced The zerogrowth and comparative analyses support the DCF I recommend selling this stock or use put options with strikes The target price range is lower than the current market price This article should have been posted by the end of January when I built my financial model The recommendation would be sell while Amazons NASDAQ AMZN price was per share then Now it is lower I wish I knew it would fall so quickly see Diagram However theres still a downside opportunity in this stock Amazoncom is a company that does not need presentation Its a worldknown brand that made its first steps in Born in the epicenter of the DotCom boom it did not crash like other web companies Moreover it has become much stronger since then At first the company had a bookselling business In the present time the company makes its living by selling everything and everywhere inexpensively from ebooks to groceries music video automotive parts and accessories apparel jewelry and other The company also manufactures some of its own products eg Kindle Echo The companys total turnover in the last fiscal year exceeded B The average revenue CAGR during the last five years was more than These are astonishing results are they not However there are points of concern as well The first one is that the companys operations are low margin so its net income hardly touches the M mark What comes from that First of all this is the reason why all of the companys fundamental ratios are quite poor Look at Diagram How can a business with such a long payback period be priced like that under modern conditions What is the reason for such extremely positive expectations Is it the first commercial spaceship in the history of humanity or a time machine Exactly it is not That is why they have to show me the money Jerry Maguires famous line Secondly there is operating inefficiency Look at Diagram where the company is compared with WalMart NYSE WMT WalMart is one of the strongest and closest competitors to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>You do not have to be a math genius to see that all of Amazons operating metrics the operating margin the net profit margin ROA ROE are much worse than WalMarts Its operating margin is more than two times lower while the net profit margin is more than five times lower There is nothing to say about ROA and ROE However WalMarts valuation looks much lower than Amazons on all accounts So where is the money here again Third I want to challenge those who believe that the operational cash flow OCF growth is a key argument that supports Amazons valuation It is true that the OCF is increasing see Diagram However have you pinpointed the sources of its growth I have done this for you in Diagram which is a print screen of the companys most recent OCF in the latest K report It definitely shows the truth about the companys growth it is dependent on the companys future capital expenditures This does not make the company profitable but shows better DA expenditures look again at the net profit margin of around Additionally the positive stock options treatment in the OCF each year ie adding them up to the cash flow enhances the OCF figure by more than B per annum The net profit only makes about of the total OCF which is rather poor Finally for those who still believe in this company I want to provide the most convincing argument showing why lowmargin companies are not necessarily to become profitable in the future Look at Diagram I have calculated the companys working capital ratios which show the companys ability to be strong in generating turnover in the future There are three main conclusions you can make from this analysis DSO days of sales outstanding and DIH days of inventory on hand are significantly increasing so the companys operating cycle has increased dramatically DOP days of payables is decreasing so the suppliers power has dropped Consequently CCC the cash conversion cycle has grown to plus days while five years ago it was plus days It means that during this period the company has lost its competitive advantage in two Porters Forces the bargaining power of customers and the bargaining power of suppliers Hence it will decrease the asset turnover in the future which will make ROA and ROE fall even more Source data Morningstarcom infographics by author According to these issues the verdict is disappointing the company looks too overvalued Moreover it looks inefficient and much worse than WalMart Next step I will present you my valuation As usual I used DCF zerogrowth and comparative analyses which have shown good results if combined together My DCF model is presented in Diagram In Diagram you can see how different metrics of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>are expected to change during this period I have made several assumptions which can be easily seen in the Assumptions tab of my Excel file Pay special attention to my forecasts Revenue CAGR to be more than during the next seven years Gross profit margin to increase by percentage points each year EBIT as of GP to increase by percentage points each year EBT as of EBIT to become in As a result net profit to be more than higher than now implied CAGR of These assumptions are quite positive However my model shows that after subtracting the market value of debt minority interest and adding back cash and investments with the discounted OWC balance the market value of the equity is around B in the Base scenario Consequently the fair value per share is per share It is more than lower than the current price per share The sensitivity analysis is presented in Diagram According to the Base scenario and the assumptions for the EVEBITDA multiple and WACC the price range is estimated to be between per share This price range represents a downside risk for the stock The zerogrowth analysis has been described in one of my articles You can read more about it here According to this type of analysis the current stock price shows no margin of safety The valuation gives the stock a fair market value of equity of B which translates into a fair price of per share This price level is nearly lower than the current level If we used only net income in the numerator the result will be a share price of It is lower than the current price level The benefits from the depreciation and amortization expense mean a lot here but on average the fair value is lower than the current level Hence the zerogrowth analysis shows that the stock is currently overvalued and has no margin of safety at all My comparative analysis is based on two key ratios PS and PBV see Diagram Both ratios show that the company is extremely overvalued The current EVEBITDA multiple is x which is x higher than WalMarts I think that no additional commentary is necessary <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a massive online retailer However the business is so unprofitable that even the future operating metrics appreciation does not make the company look fairly valued The DCF analysis zerogrowth and comparative analyses they all show that the current level is far from the bottom Hence I issue a SELL recommendation on this stock The target price range is between and per share This price is translated into a downside risk for the stock Owing to the high volatility of the stock I suggest that you buy put options instead of shorting the actual stock The puts for July cost now while the puts are traded at However keep in mind that the implied volatility is relatively high now Although I recommend buying options as soon as possible you can wait and try to buy them cheaper when implied volatility falls Nevertheless remember about the delta and gamma risks if the price rises promptly even temporarily Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a short position in AMZN over the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
