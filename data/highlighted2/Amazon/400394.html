With a 2.5 hour per-person average time on connected devices, the extra road hours adds about 30% to the potential total device time usage.For the following estimates, I'll utilize current corporate revenues to assess the impact of the additional travel time access.Apple makes about $20B/year on 1B iOS devices for services, which includes iTunes and the App Store.That averages out to $20/device per year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I 've seen as high as $ 40/device in the U.S. but I 'll stick with the <i>lower</i> value for my estimate here .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If we <b>assume</b> sales are proportional to time , that 30 % translates into $ 6/device per year or $ 6B/year .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If we just consider the U.S. , that 's <b>maybe</b> half of total sales and would come in around $ 3B .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is 3% of Apple's $234B 2015 revenue, a drop in the bucket in comparison.Even at double my estimate, the value of the extra automobile time is just 5% of revenue.This result highlights the need for Apple to either greatly enhance their service offerings or have their devices built in to get a significant bottom-line impact from the autonomous vehicle market.On to Google.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Google 's 2015 $ 75B annual revenue comes <b>nearly</b> entirely in the form of online service value , such as ads and apps .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Consequently , the increased car usage time , <b>assuming</b> it 's also proportional to sales , implies a $ 23B increase in revenue .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If <b>roughly</b> half of that is U.S. , my estimate is around $ 12B annually .  (Uncertainty) </span>That's 16% of Google's revenue, a meaningful amount.Knowing that 90% of Google's revenue comes from advertising, we can check this estimate using ad impressions per hour.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Using two different methods , I 've estimated that Google can get 40-50 impressions/hour , which <b>seems</b> reasonable .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Something <i>less</i> than 1 impression/minute , <b>depending</b> on what you 're doing .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> an average cost of $ 1.50 per 1000 impressions puts the market value of the travel time at over $ 10B annually .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The actual value is <b>probably</b> <i>higher</i> based on the reasoning I provided <i>earlier</i> , being some multiple of this .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Nevertheless, this result agrees with my prior estimate.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On an absolute basis , the time value of the autonomous car market is at least 2x <i>more</i> valuable to Google than it is for Apple .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On a percent of revenue basis , it 's at least 6x <i>more</i> valuable to Google .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As things stand now , Google will benefit much <i>more</i> significantly from autonomous cars than Apple .  (Surprise) </span>These results are likely the reason Google is openly and aggressively pursuing autonomous vehicle development as it works to expand into new markets.Another positive is that Google can benefit from any autonomous vehicle implementation, even if it's Apple supplied.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple , on the other hand , <b>appears</b> to be stuck needing to get their devices integrated within autonomous cars to generate impactful revenue unless they come up with an associated service value driver .  (Uncertainty) </span>To conclude, let's think about the future.In 2020, when you first test-ride an autonomous car, take a look at the electronics layout around you, its integration and how it calls for your attention.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Then , when you forget about being too <b>scared</b> to stop looking out the window , you 'll relax and start acting like you 're in your own living room .  (Uncertainty) </span>You'll be enamored by the convenience and experience at your hands.Not tethered to a steering wheel, but instead to an integrated electronic device that engages you during your trip.That's when you should start paying attention to the commercial aspect of it all.Sure, it's a good thing, but it's not entirely about you: it's about surrounding companies, your wallet and your time.Apple and Google are vying for it.Captive connected consumers equals cash flow.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Editors' Picks</div></body></html>
