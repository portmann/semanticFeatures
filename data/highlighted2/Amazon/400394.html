(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha It's no secret that Apple and Google are developing autonomous cars.But itâ€™s not the simplicity, efficiency, pleasure, safety or cost-savings of the autonomous automotive experience in which they are interested.People spend a lot of time in their cars and, particularly, driving their cars.And everyone knows time is money.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Google/Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) want to take control of that time.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>By freeing up driving and related passenger tasks , like navigating and looking around for landmarks , these companies <b>hope</b> to gain access to your eyes , ears , and wallets .  (Uncertainty) </span>Think about how much value there is in online mobile entertainment and web-surfing, activities like accessing iTunes, viewing YouTube, and watching TV shows, for everyone in the car.Not just the kids on a family trip, solo drivers, too.Targeted ads associated with specific people, like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) provides, built on specific preferences, but now also combined with travel data like moving location correlated with the time of day.This is very, very valuable to certain industries.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>An automotive data bank would be a useful tool for advertisers : it <b>could</b> hold both your travel history and your travel plans .  (Uncertainty) </span>This would provide a glimpse into your future thereby enabling the provision of narrowly targeted ads as you go on your way.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>How much will McDonald 's ( NYSE : MCD ) be willing to pay to push out an ad to a traveling family between 10am-noon on a highway in the vicinity of one of their restaurants , especially if someone in the family is known to like to eat there ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Yes, they'll know it's a family traveling based on the types of electronic interactions in the vehicle or even some built-in car diagnostics.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They <b>could</b> identify ages , sexes , and weights from this data and sign-ins .  (Uncertainty) </span>If they know who's specifically in the car, they'll already know everyone's meal preferences, and if they don't, they can make demographic-based estimates.Highly tailored ads to traveling carloads.So how much time are we talking about?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For this estimate , I 'll <b>assume</b> autonomous car travel is equivalent to human-driver travel time .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What <b>could</b> be different ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Well, will autonomous cars be allowed to speed?Will they be required to come to a complete stop at stop signs and lights?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Both of these factors <b>could</b> increase travel time .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the other hand , automated traffic flow optimization might reduce travel times in congested areas , so <b>maybe</b> it 's a wash overall .  (Uncertainty) </span>Okay, back to the estimate.On average, American drivers over the age of 18 travel for 46 minutes per day .With 214 million drivers , the total on-road travel time is 164 million hours.Now, that's a lot of cumulative time but the spans aren't always very long.But they're ideal for short video content like YouTube and some TV shows, music videos, etc.I 'm sure perfect-length original content will be developed by the likes of Apple , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , Comcast ( NASDAQ : CMCSA ) , Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) , etc. to fill these time slots . With a 2.5 hour per-person average time on connected devices, the extra road hours adds about 30% to the potential total device time usage.For the following estimates, I'll utilize current corporate revenues to assess the impact of the additional travel time access.Apple makes about $20B/year on 1B iOS devices for services, which includes iTunes and the App Store.That averages out to $20/device per year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I 've seen as high as $ 40/device in the U.S. but I 'll stick with the <i>lower</i> value for my estimate here .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If we <b>assume</b> sales are proportional to time , that 30 % translates into $ 6/device per year or $ 6B/year .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If we just consider the U.S. , that 's <b>maybe</b> half of total sales and would come in around $ 3B .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is 3% of Apple's $234B 2015 revenue, a drop in the bucket in comparison.Even at double my estimate, the value of the extra automobile time is just 5% of revenue.This result highlights the need for Apple to either greatly enhance their service offerings or have their devices built in to get a significant bottom-line impact from the autonomous vehicle market.On to Google.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Google 's 2015 $ 75B annual revenue comes <b>nearly</b> entirely in the form of online service value , such as ads and apps .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Consequently , the increased car usage time , <b>assuming</b> it 's also proportional to sales , implies a $ 23B increase in revenue .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If <b>roughly</b> half of that is U.S. , my estimate is around $ 12B annually .  (Uncertainty) </span>That's 16% of Google's revenue, a meaningful amount.Knowing that 90% of Google's revenue comes from advertising, we can check this estimate using ad impressions per hour.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Using two different methods , I 've estimated that Google can get 40-50 impressions/hour , which <b>seems</b> reasonable .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Something <i>less</i> than 1 impression/minute , <b>depending</b> on what you 're doing .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> an average cost of $ 1.50 per 1000 impressions puts the market value of the travel time at over $ 10B annually .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The actual value is <b>probably</b> <i>higher</i> based on the reasoning I provided <i>earlier</i> , being some multiple of this .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Nevertheless, this result agrees with my prior estimate.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On an absolute basis , the time value of the autonomous car market is at least 2x <i>more</i> valuable to Google than it is for Apple .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On a percent of revenue basis , it 's at least 6x <i>more</i> valuable to Google .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As things stand now , Google will benefit much <i>more</i> significantly from autonomous cars than Apple .  (Surprise) </span>These results are likely the reason Google is openly and aggressively pursuing autonomous vehicle development as it works to expand into new markets.Another positive is that Google can benefit from any autonomous vehicle implementation, even if it's Apple supplied.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple , on the other hand , <b>appears</b> to be stuck needing to get their devices integrated within autonomous cars to generate impactful revenue unless they come up with an associated service value driver .  (Uncertainty) </span>To conclude, let's think about the future.In 2020, when you first test-ride an autonomous car, take a look at the electronics layout around you, its integration and how it calls for your attention.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Then , when you forget about being too <b>scared</b> to stop looking out the window , you 'll relax and start acting like you 're in your own living room .  (Uncertainty) </span>You'll be enamored by the convenience and experience at your hands.Not tethered to a steering wheel, but instead to an integrated electronic device that engages you during your trip.That's when you should start paying attention to the commercial aspect of it all.Sure, it's a good thing, but it's not entirely about you: it's about surrounding companies, your wallet and your time.Apple and Google are vying for it.Captive connected consumers equals cash flow.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Editors' Picks</div></body></html>
