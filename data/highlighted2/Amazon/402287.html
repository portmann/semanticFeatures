The CEO claimed that the immediately accretive Southern Air acquisition has been completed.The company made a deal with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to operate 20 B767-300 converted freighters - a CMI contract for 7 years . Atlas Air Worldwide will also dry-lease the airplanes for 10 years under its Titan Aviation leasing unit.Zacks has set a new price target for the stock at $52.90 per share, which offers 13.06% upside potential to secondary investors.Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings (NASDAQ: AAWW ) is basically a holding company which owns its operating subsidiaries, Atlas Air, Inc. and Titan Aviation Holdings, Inc., and has a minority stake in a few other companies.It provides outsourced aviation operating services to the global aircraft markets.Currently, Atlas Air Worldwide runs a well-managed fleet of 747 and 767 freighters and 747 and 767 passenger aircraft.The company mainly operates through three segments, which includes the ACMI (Aircraft, Complete Crew, Maintenance, and Insurance), Charter, as well as Dry Leasing.In the ACMI segment, Atlas Air Worldwide has the world's largest fleet of modern Boeing (NYSE: BA ) 747 all-cargo aircraft, and it provides aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance services to customers.Under Charter segment, the company offers customers air cargo and passenger aircraft for moving goods and people from point A to B. Lastly, the company operates its Dry Leasing business via Titan Holdings Inc., which is a freighter-centric leasing company with one of the world's largest fleets of Boeing 777 freighters.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As of <b>May</b> 8 , 2016 , Atlas Air Worldwide had a market capitalization of around $ 1.18 billion , and its latest quarterly revenue ( Q1 2016 ) was at $ 418.62 million .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On <b>May</b> 5 , 2016 , Atlas Air Worldwide released its Q1 2016 financial results , which showed a Net Income of $ 0.5 million or $ 0.02 per share .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As soon as Atlas Air Worldwide made the press release , its stock price jumped from $ 38.28 at the close of <b>May</b> 4 and reached as high as $ 56.64 on <b>May</b> 5 , representing a 47.96 % increase within a day .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, year to date it is only up 16.34%, based on the current market price of $46.79 per share.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This large upside move happened despite the fact that the company 's revenue has fallen to $ 418.62 million in Q1 2016 , which is 6.27 % <i>lower</i> compared with that in the same quarter last year .  (Surprise) </span>However , there were two factors that influenced the market : 1 ) the earnings , adjusted for non-recurring costs , were $ 0.31 per share , which beat Zacks Investment Research 's forecast of $ 0.25 per share ; and 2 ) the deal with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) to provide and to operate 20 Boeing 767-300 converted freighters that will have a meaningful impact on Atlas Air Worldwide 's revenues in the coming years . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While better-than-expected adjusted earnings pushed the stock price up by almost 48 % , we <b>believe</b> the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> deal will turn out to be <i>more</i> significant for the company , as such a long-term relationship with one of the largest e-commerce giants will create a recurring revenue opportunity . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Commenting on the deal with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , William J. Flynn , president and chief executive officer of Atlas Air Worldwide , said , `` the continuing expansion of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's e-commerce business and to enhance its customer-delivery capabilities , are expected to be meaningfully accretive to our future earnings and cash flows . '' "We expect this service to begin in the second half of this year, become accretive starting in 2017, and scale up to full service and full accretive benefits through 2018," he noted.Mr. Flynn also mentioned that the immediately accretive Southern Air acquisition has been completed.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>`` Our acquisition of Southern Air with its highly complementary 777 and 737 aircraft operating platforms will provide a <i>broader</i> array of services for customers and new avenues of business growth for us , '' he said .  (Surprise) </span>The agreement with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and the successful acquisition of Southern Air will help Atlas Air Worldwide offer some great upside potential for its secondary investors in the coming quarters . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Why The <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Deal Is Kind of a Big Deal On <b>May</b> 5 , the company released a second press release detailing the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> deal , which mentioned that the long-term commercial agreements with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will include `` the operation of 20 B767-300 converted freighters for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> on a CMI ( crew , maintenance and insurance ) basis by Atlas Air Worldwide 's airline subsidiary , Atlas Air , Inc. , as well as dry leasing by its Titan Aviation leasing unit . '' (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>While the dry leases will have a term of 10 years, the CMI operations will be for seven years (with extension provisions for a total term of 10 years).Under the agreement, the operations are expected to begin in the second half of 2016 and ramp up to full service through 2018.In order to align their interests , the company also offered <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> an opportunity to buy 20 % common stocks of Atlas Air Worldwide at $ 37.50 per share , where <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has the privilege for the next five years . In addition , Atlas Air Worldwide `` granted <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> warrants to acquire up to an additional 10 percent ( after the issuance ) of AAWW 's common shares at the same exercise price , over a period of seven years . '' With this deal with Atlas Air Worldwide , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is practically cutting out the middleman . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Instead of relying on FedEx ( NYSE : FDX ) , United Parcel Service ( NYSE : UPS ) , et al , which also lease cargo aircraft from companies like Atlas Air Worldwide , if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> start leasing directly , it will be able to cut down the cost of logistics . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Meanwhile , having 20-30 % stake in the company will also ensure that Atlas Air Worldwide will always have <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's strategic interest in mind while making future operational deals with direct or indirect competitors of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While the deal is great for Atlas Air Worldwide , it is even a <i>better</i> deal for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , especially after the company adopted a <i>more</i> aggressive policy to handle logistics itself . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Winning a contract to lease 20 cargo planes to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a big deal , but this revenue will not be visible on the company 's balance sheet immediately . However , since <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has the right to buy up to 20 % common stocks of Atlas Air Worldwide at $ 37.50 , it will immediately create a technical support level for the stock price . Furthermore, the seven- to ten-year deal will create a certain recurring revenue opportunity that is bound to have a meaningful impact on the top line.Now, the question would be how the management will turn this stable operating environment for the next decade to develop the company.In coming quarters, investors will be keen to see how Atlas Air Worldwide management plans to expand its business and what the key financial metrics are saying about that effort.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Meanwhile , Zacks has updated its price target for Atlas Air Worldwide to $ 52.90 per share on <b>May</b> 5 , which still offers a 13.06 % upside potential for secondary investors in the short term .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In the long term , we believe the valuation will go much <i>higher</i> , and long-term investors should consider increasing their <b>exposure</b> at the current price level .
