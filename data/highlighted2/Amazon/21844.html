you very much Andrew Welcome everybody Id like to thank you for joining the call today with our recent listing on the NASDAQ and now the filing of our results We thought it was a great time to host a conference call In fact this is our first conference call I would like to thank new shareholders thanking our existing shareholders and give you all an update on recent developments in Vuzixs There is lots of listening going at Vuzix these days So Ill try to keep this brief so there is time for some QA in the end was an exciting year at Vuzix and has started off at a great pace with the million investment from Intel Corporation in our NASDAQ listening here in early January or end of January Its also being an exciting time in wearable tech industry especially in the eyewear side of it Were seeing many new technologies and major investments from leading corporations like Google Facebook Microsoft as well as others Additionally there have been several well respected research firm and analysts calling for solid growth in this space for years to come We see analysts that are predicting the wearable computers that generate more than billion in the revenue by and firms like ABR Research forecasting wearable computing device market will grow billion unit shipments by with more than million of those being smart glasses Deloitte Consulting expects the enterprise market for wearable devices to surpass the consumer market over the long term Vuzix has seen this trend and the enterprise market is one that we have been actively targeting Vuzix is already achieving notable success as the industry sits on the cusp of major customer adoption Last summer as you all might remember we went to China side by side with Lenovo and announced a major deal whereby Lenovo will be selling our cobranded M Smart Glasses in China Lenovo we see exclusive device to sell our M glasses there to enterprise customers and after receiving finally certification from Chinas quality certification center no easy feat frankly The Chinese didnt have any clue what a wearable display system was let alone how to get it through all those testings We finally got through that allowing Lenovo to ultimately begin shipping into the marketplace to their customers And Im going to talk a bit later about who those customers are They have a focus on warehouse operations the major hospitals power distribution and the energys sectors Vizuxs also seen a series of applications in North American and European markets come from companies like SAP now with over four applications supporting our M alongside other developers For example companies like UVMAX have developed a vision picking application that was implemented and tested over a three week period by DHL among a bunch of other companies quite frankly But DHL has been vocal about it They are a leader in logistics with over employees worldwide During this test employees wearing Vuzixs smart glasses picked over packages and delivered a published improvement in efficiency for their customer Rico As a result of this trial its anticipated that Rico will be moving to more extensive implementation And frankly DHL was also pretty happy with the results as you might imagine So theyre looking at implementations of their own within their facilities although the people at DHL Rico and UVMax have led the way by publishing their findings showing their companies as up as front runners in the area There are other examples of use cases and successful trials that are moving towards implementation as well Vuzix looks forward to continuing to work with all of these companies and they move toward adopting smart glasses solutions in the enterprise market Excuse me folks just a moment It does take time in the enterprise markets to bring new market innovations and smart glasses have proven to be no exception Development efforts that begun in early are just now starting to bear material fruit as we move from development of applications and testing to customer adoption and implementation of these solutions across many areas in the enterprise market I will update you in more detail later in the call of some specifics regarding the progress weve made and how were positioning Vuzix as a market leader Right now though I would like to turn the call over our CFO Grant Russell to get the meat of the call and review our financial results Grant Morning everybody Lastly we filed our K with the SEC and we did some news release and hope everybody hopefully has a great chance to read it So even Ill just do an overview quickly so we have more time for questions Our revenues for the fiscal year ended December were versus for the same period in Thats an increase overall of Within that our sales of our smart glasses and Waveguide products were up actually over the prior year and what brought minimized the overall increase was the fact that our Wrap series of products which weve been building for couple of years is going end of life or effectively is end of life and really has limited quantities available And what we did have we decided to focus on the AR and VR So those sales were actually off But engineering services were pretty flat for the year just being up a little over As I said total sales overall were up and on a quarterly basis we didnt actually include that in the news release but our Q sales were versus and they were up over the prior quarter in Gross margins were for versus for They were down the but in the discussions in the MDA we actually said there was about a negative impact with the startup of manufacturing in China and this is the first quarterly period or yearly period where we have started to amortize our software development cost related to the M smart glasses So thats a fact earn growth from a cash basis earned growth margins were actually up but now we have some noncash charges which per GAAP have to be recorded in the cost of goods amounts Operating expenses RD sales and marketing were up slightly though again weve capitalized a portion of our RD cost So the reported expect portion was modestly up As a matter of fact we did send over almost the third more in RD We had another small impairment of some patents and trademarks but overall our loss from operations was for versus million for GA costs were one of the items that were up and weve spent had to spend some money on things like expanded investor relations attending earnings conference and all in preparation for gearing up for our listing on NASDAQ Other items within our PL as you know we have quite a few mainly most of them driven by our marktomarket derivative liability requirements We reported million in other expenses the largest being the marktomarket under derivative liability and versus million effectively for This should be the last quarterly period where we have to see such large swings in our operating results thanks to the fact that we have limited of our derivative liability at the end of last year or January nd with the closing of the Intel financing From operations we did use about million to keep those invest in the ongoing in the Company Thats up a little bit from the prior year but its consistent with the last several years and as Vuzix continues to invest in its new products and technology We did include a pro forma some pro forma financial information reflecting the close of the Intel transaction on January nd We because it was even though it was just two days late were not allowed to reflect that in our December st numbers But as everybody can see our some of the assets liabilities increased from million as of December to million as of January nd and most importantly our cash went from up to million and the derivative liability thats causing some of the fluctuations in our operating results was reduced from million down to million And in this quarter weve had a quite few most of those warrants exercised So at the end of March were going to have a very small number to report there And stockholders equity as a result of all these various transactions increased from a deficit of million to a positive million and was one of the key factors in allowing us to uplift the NASDAQ Think that sorts of highlights all the major number Paul Fantastic Grant thank you very much for that review Let me continue here First of all by offering that Vuzix has gone through a transition It used to be routine for us to do between million and million a year in revenues and it was split between our defense and our consumer operations about and over the last two years we have been transitioning from a series of old products In fact you saw that with a reduction in Wrap sales Thats a product line thats going end of life So those products are going away and were moving now into these next generation of products from Vuzix which are revolutionary in the wearable display market and theyre coming right in time for the wearable tech Business that is right in front of all of us and seems to be seemingly so excited As I mentioned previously was a very eventful year as we start to make that transition Several notable milestones were achieved here at the Company and these advancements are cause for great enthusiasm as we look forward to the future of Vuzix and it starts with our M smart glasses The M smart glasses are effectively like having a smartphone The only thing theyre missing is the cellular phone service The difference is you wear them instead of holding them So you imagine everything GPS WiFi Bluetooth all the motion sensors an HD camera that looks out the front and these guys run the Android applications in the glasses So theyre smart gizmos but the real things that make them stand out besides being super lightweight and easy to wear all day is the fact that theyre hands free And the ability to connect information from the cloud to the real world in a hands free device opens it up for a pile of applications in the enterprise markets and in fact it never ceases to amaze me the number of apps and new cases that are coming for these products That said there are something like five or six areas that really are driving the current business for Vuzix Field service is one of them logistics and warehousing is another medical applications pharmaceuticals manufacturing and general aviation So the advantages of using smart glasses in those areas are numerous but the biggest one I think youll see is the fact that theyre hands free devices and some examples of how theyre being used in logistics and warehousing a lot of you probably have seen the videos Youve seen what DHL is doing The bottom line is instead of holding a bar code scanner and then taking a pen or a pencil checking something off of a pick list literally you wear the glasses you look and go look and go look and go And its proven as much as four times faster doing it this way than other methods So its a significant improvement in the logistics and warehousing and the market opportunity there its just huge People talk about robots coming in and the likes The reality of it is in the end for the most part human beings are picking boxes and putting them in boxes to ship to people And as you know theres hundreds of thousands of job areas that are impacted by the potential of smart glasses in that case Another example is in training in training particularly in the medical space We have people that use our smart glasses today as theyre doing an operation Instead of having doctors looking over their shoulders maybe they can get three or four around them on the operating table they can now record and stream live what theyre doing and share it with others one to many all over the place That current set of sharing information like that and sort of teleporting information like that is a big one for smart glasses in particular with Vuzix And then finally in the field service area You can imagine if you have a guy in a field and he needs to make a decision and he doesnt have the technical knowledge in order to do it appropriately the ability of having another senior technician effectively teleporting stand in his place and help him make a decision can save lots of money If you think about companies that have operations in Asia and theyre having a problem on the plant floor instead of sending a guy in an airplane they can literally have them go to a command center log in and see what the employee is doing and help him make the best of Those are things that are giving great returns on investments Smart glasses in a very short period of time because of that with Vuzix has shipped thousands of systems and its resulted in many trial programs and effectively today there are over currently running programs that have gone from early prototype kinds of things to actual people using them in real world use cases and as those trials move from the early tests and into actual production programs Vuzix has seen growth from single digit orders to bigger volumes and in some cases the need for our smart glasses are in thousands of units Were not there yet but the transition has happened You can see these applications being very successfully implemented in the field and the number are starting to grow In some cases its direct sales from Vuzix In other cases were enabling third party partners value added resellers companies like UVMax and Enterprise or HeadApp in the aviation industry In the case of UVMax theyre the gentlemen who implemented the DHL picking application warehouse picking application They have a pile of their own programs with applications that theyve written and the for the most part using Vuzixs smart glasses HeadApp is in the aviation industry and its a A small pilots and the likes they start shipping shortly Arcovis in the medical industry Pristine in the medical and enterprise industry XOI has a version of Vuzixs M that now runs under Linux and they have a pile of their own active trial programs and those are just to name a few So we have a bunch of partners that are writing the applications that are releasing their own apps which will open up I think significant business opportunities and revenue streams for Vuzix from each of their customers Each of those VARs have growing businesses around our smart glasses with sales growing similarly Almost in every case were seeing results Like the smart pick in bakery operation leading daily goods orders more accurately and efficiently to gain published results And they can pick almost as much as four times faster than what they were Or leaders like DHL and Rico with efficiency improvements These are real return on investments They are real programs And they are resulting in revenue streams for Vuzix And we talked a bit about our partnership with Lenovo Corporation It has been a slow start unfortunately but thats the name of the beast When we even try to get return through China certifications getting the Chinese government to understand what a wearable display smart glasses were took time Today they have an exclusive with us in China In January they finally started shipping product The package is beautiful Its Chinese understanding So its been completely rewritten the tools and stuff So a Chinese person can use it It uses the Lenovo services and that services are focused on application areas that are in the enterprise And theyve got a bunch of programs underway right now They seem to be meeting with great results so far and it ranges from their own internal shipping and warehousing needs to people in the energy industry in Chin which is massive and in healthcare in China So theyve got a lot of great opportunities coming Vuzix is looking forward to some significant growth in and as they rollout product Another good one is SAP SAP they have four different applications They really have just started shipping Two of them are finally available field service and warehousing They have a rounds in retail one that is also coming We mentioned the companies like APX Lab indiscernible et cetera The bottomline is the M is meeting with great success so far Programs are going from oneseys twoseys tens to real rollouts You will see from the Vuzixs announcements throughout the rest of this year of other application areas that are going live And there in some cases in markets if you just think about the warehousing industries alone with companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>hiring nearly employees every fall just to pick and pack and ship theres significant business opportunities Let me just talk really quickly about our IWear Gaming is been in our DNA I started this conversation by saying a significant portion of our revenues were in the entertainment space The IWear is Vuzixs first offering in a long time in the wearable display markets and its planned at virtual reality and personal entertainment solutions These guys won four awards at the Game Developers Conference Its been a couple of years in development at Vuzix They are an amazing product in that they can give you the kind of experience you would get with an Oculus Rift For those who dont who know Oculus is a company that makes virtual reality headsets that Facebook bought for billion It gives you those kinds of experiences but it allows you to do it on devices that are plugnplay today So you can plug it into your iPhone plug it into your Xbox it runs standard D HDMI content but it also supports the virtual reality kinds of software thats coming You will hear a whole lot more about that here shortly at Vuzix as the summer comes around We will be shipping that product by the end of the year Weve increased production capacity at Vuzix another major milestone for us Our facilities now in China have the ability to produce as much units a month So were prepared as the volumes pickup for our smart glasses So the increasing value of our IP is obvious Today we have patents and additional patents are pending a bunch more than in process We think that that intellectual property portfolio is going to prove very valuable If you just look at that in a comparison of other companies you have companies Oculus that got bought for billion from Facebook another acquisition that was a handful of patents from a company called Osterhout that Microsoft paid as much as a million for Google last year led an investment of million into a company called Magic Leap for about a position These are companies that really arent even shipping products yet Vuzix is and we have a future of where we can get in this space is going with some of our next generation waveguide technology Let me just finish up here really quickly I wanted to talk a bit about the Intel investment On January of although it was in a event that was really important they invested million in Vuzix They invested it at a premium to market of Although it was a premium to our market cap at the time Vuzix management believes Intel got a pretty good deal when you look at comparables in the marketplace today That said so did Vuzix Intel is a great partner for Vuzix We are already collaborating with them I cant I wish I could share with you more about everything thats going on here because I know its a question on a lot of peoples minds I can tell you that we are doing stuff with them now as I speak Its going back both ways Theres going to be great opportunities for Vuzixs to open up business through Intel and on the flipside of the coin Intel is helping us with some of our next generation technology from the perspective of silicon in the likes So its off to a great start and youll hear more about that as the year unfolds Great working relationship already Were excited by it Continuing here just really quickly I want to try to finish up So our goal for we seeded the marketplace with initial enterprise applications Were moving from seeded markets to actual roll outs with real programs and volume opportunities here in around the M Our consumer IWear will start shipping and well be rolling back into the customer adoption by the fall of this year And then finally by the end of another plus from the Intel investment is its really allowed us to step our Waveguide optics development efforts So well be introducing by the end of this year our first pair of smart glasses based on those Waveguides Its going to solve the Google glass problem of being a glass hole We think it will open up the mass market to the real value proposition of wearable displays when they really finally look like fashion glasses and I hope that that will put us well on our way to potentially even replacing the smartphone with smart glasses This is just the beginning was a great year and we have already set the bar pretty high in with the Intel investment and NASDAQ uplifting Were looking forward to seeing enterprise level customers implementation of our smart glasses which youll hear much more about as the year unfolds further developments with our business and sales partners and the launch of our IWear products into the virtual reality and gaming markets this fall Wed like to thank you for supporting our story and our vision and we look forward to sharing our progress with you again in the next quarter At this point in time Id like to open up the call for questions There was other stuff I wanted to cover but I think itd be great to give you guys an opportunity to kind of ask your own questions Thank you Operator Instruction Our first question today is coming from Jay Srivatsa from Chardan Capital Markets Please proceed with your question Paul and Grant congrats on the strong Q in fiscal Let me ask you at a high level in fiscal what was the revenue mix between the M product and the older generation product Specifically in Q what was the mix Okay And then looking ahead to fiscal what is your projection on how the mix will be Is it going to be all waveguide smart glass products or do you still believe some of the older generation products will continue to sell through Well in the second half of the year well also have the we should have the IWear the video headphones going and we anticipate probably a split that will be either or smart glasses video headphones Okay Paul you mentioned a lot of stuff happening in terms of customers and stuff I know you didnt give guidance for fiscal but would you expect sequential revenue growth on a quarterly basis on an annual basis Any color would be appreciated Weve been in the entertainment space for quite some time as you know The Wrap series of products is going away but the IWear which will start shipping this fall will represent a reasonable portion of business The demand for wearable displays that are virtual reality based seems quite significant in the marketplace The channels that we sell those products to today are really excited about the IWear At the same time now we have an existing base of customers on the M that are beginning to roll out programs So I call those existing although they really are new programs You might see our company like DHL rolling something out in the fall of the year Theyre really new for Vuzix but its been years at least a year now in an effort to get them up online in the software operation and the like So as I said it will be a mix between consumer and smart glasses and some of its new customers and some of this is on existing base Okay I know you said you couldnt speak much about the Intel investment and the strategy there but just at a high level do you foresee an Intelbased M or Intelbased Vuzix smart glass later part of this year or is it more fiscal or whats kind of the timeline Because of some of the testing that has to go into getting a next generation CPU with all the radios and everything else qualified its unlikely you would see a release although you are going to see some from Vuzix some next generation M esque stuff You wouldnt see one based upon Intel Okay So given the very bullish guidance you have kind of suggested for fiscal what does it do to in terms of breakeven revenue run rate What do you need to get to to achieve breakeven Right now the Vuzix is so we have at our current earn rates we have something like four or five years worth of capital in the bank We dont need more money That said its important Vuzix is executing to our plan Were in a race We are building these next generation products and were investing in them So youre going to see our burn rate go up a little bit That said currently about million per year run rate puts us at a cash flow breakeven more so Thats going up though We will need to do a bit more than that as we move into next year and have as our burn rates go up a bit to get these next generation products out Were not giving official guidance in that regard Grant do you have anything you could offer Really nothing more than what you suggested Paul I kind of look at it from a unit sales standpoint If we sell the required our target the number units were planning on building those revenue numbers are not unrealistic Well there is as is debated a little over more but related to the warrants that were issued in August as part of a public offering Were now down to about a total of warrants and those were the ones that have the reset of About a third of those have already waived So theres really about warrants left with reset ratchet capabilities And all the convertible debt still remains on our books as those rights were waived So a derivative liability at the end of March should be really small And most of those were exercised in January and February So the potential overhang of the of warrants is being reduced drastically First one for Grant it is more of a housekeeping item I hope I dont bore you with this one too much But I was wondering if you could provide the basic and diluted share count that would correspond with your pro forma balance sheet items that you have published And go ahead I was going to give another one while you looked that up But go ahead if you are ready for it I mean in our there is million in ph and it goes into weighted average calculation for basic for So approximately At the end of the year there was December there was actually million outstanding and today there is million From an antidilutive standpoint because the impact of those additional shares would be antidilutive our reported loss per share would have been smaller That element doesnt get disclosed If we had a profit there would have been about million addition shares that would have been in the money and therefore would have been included as the base in our diluted EPS numbers Yes I think so So for this year we should think the share count being I mean if were projecting out further into some point when youre profitable we should think something like million shares Yes I mean today were on like I said just little under million and with the Intel convertible perhaps theyre just a little under million So well have to start improving the cutback those preferred shares out of dividend associated with them So well be having to book that but on a fully dilutive basis we are up at about million ignoring Yes including the conversion okay Thats what I thought based on your press releases Okay if we looked at just the fourth quarter what would the M growth have been like The growth yearoveryear okay It would have been up probably a little over fold Basically we didnt really start shipping to be honestly M to customers It was really in primarily to developers and it was just at the every tail end of the year that we actually started releasing products to general customers So it was well over times And are we looking at kind of space here where we could anticipate sequential growth throughout this year and including sequential growth in the first quarter over the fourth quarter Yes you guys had a list of quite a list of developments during the course of Can you just highlight the ones that maybe happened since September I can follow up with you guys I dont want to burden the call with it I just wanted to get a Congratulations on an excellent Paul it sounds like you are a little bit under the weather So I hope you feel better But just a question as it relates to the competitive environment I know you mentioned the acquisition of Oculus by Facebook And then also you spoke a little about the Google Glass Could you just talk about sort of the differentiation that you have relative to products that are potentially in the market or on the verge of entering the market Sure Well on the Google glass comparison first everybody probably knows the Googles kind of retrenching a little bit right now They designed that product for the consumer market place I can understand why they did that When you try to use Google glass in an enterprise set of conditions where the processor has to be pretty heavily loaded what happens is it overheats because it cant keep up with imagine youre in a warehouse and youre using the camera as a barcode scanner So the processors running constantly at frames a second bringing in this video data looking for bar code information scanning it and trying to decode what the barcodes are Well thats pretty processor intensive and Google glass was not designed for that So it fails pretty badly often The other thing is it doesnt have autofocus cameras in it and the likes So when youre trying to read a barcode youve got to move the barcode in and out until you get it just in the right position to where it will finally scan Vuzix doesnt have any of those problems Again we didnt design it for the consumer space on purpose Its not one of those things that youd see people wearing down the street in New York City but we never said it was to begin with The fact that youre in a warehouse and youve got a hard hat on and youve got all kinds of other gear just makes it fit in really well So in enterprise we designed it specifically for that marketplace and its meeting with great results there because of it Whereas Google theyre back to the drawing board and when they finally work their way through this I think they should have learned by now that if you dont look like something thats fashionable youre not going to have great results in the consumer side It has to look pretty So then on the Oculus side Oculus they have optics from the s not to pan the gentlemen The fact is its an experience that people havent seen in a long time and when you put on an Oculus Rift you do have this immersive experience which I believe has the potential to change the world when youre sitting at home in your living room So what Vuzix did we have a product similar to Oculus Its a great great big field of view Oculus gives you lets say a plus degree field of view We support a degree field of view So its slightly smaller than theirs We did that on purpose because it allowed us to keep the aspect ratio of the content coming in So you didnt have to reformat it So I can put on the Vuzix IWare and when I do I can open up a spreadsheet and literally see right to the corners I can work on it as if it were a spreadsheet or a word processing et cetera What that means is I can work with any content today So the IWare is plug and play compatible When youre in with an Oculus Rift you have to plug it into the wall youre at home you need custom content thats running on your PC Its the split screen funky weird stuff so that they can take advantage of the optical issues take advantage They have to do it in order to fix their optics distortions We dont have those so were plug and play Were battery operated We work on almost anything You can get virtual reality experiences out of it albeit not quite as big as an Oculus Rift but we believe because you have the ability if youre running without shields underneath you can see the real world You have tendency to not have this nauseousness thing that happens And then when you add in all the rest of the issues associated with a it works with glasses were very good at doing those kinds of things Its so easy to wear Nothing touches your face with the its going to be one of I think theyll be many products in the VR space youre seeing that happen now but I think that at bucks the IWare is going to have clients with great favor in the marketplace Its Aaron Martin from AIGH Congratulations on the progress Can you talk about the pipeline of M business as you look out to this year in terms of that supports the kind of growth you talked about for this year and what have you learned in terms of how companies like DHL and other companies that youre directly selling to move through that pipeline in terms of doing trials on smaller scale and moving up the trial size And can you talk a little bit about that Sure First of all weve learned that bigger companies take a whole lot longer to implement and bring out their solutions than the smaller ones do Right now if you look at the Fortune list there are companies that are in that Approximately of those companies have purchased smart glasses from Vuzix So its a lot of big guys that are using these devices And the good thing about that is when they finally bring them out to market the market opportunity is significant Unfortunately it takes time for them to do that If you think about programs like DHL in the Rico in particular that was a DHL Rico effort right They went through their first trials They are going to be moving to some stuff But then ultimately the business when it really starts unfolding here and gets to be it can be pretty significant Shipping industries employees at DHL there is FedEx there is USPS there is the Walmarts of the world They all have these same problems So once you solve the problem for one or two of them it feels like it gets easier I say that knock on wood theres not a lot of competition for Vuzix right now and were expecting a bunch of these companies So an earlier question there is a lot of activity thats happening There is and many of them are getting through this process So its easier Thats what were seeing There are smaller operations that will like hey this works great lets implement it But if its a bigger operation its done in stages So they will do it at their XYZ plant first see success then they will move it into other plants In some areas it works really well and other areas per the situation based upon how their plant has set up it doesnt work So yes it starts slow and then builds Okay thank you In terms of the Intel relationship and I know there is very little you can say and you talked about how you are working together with them right now and that we can look forward to a product at some point maybe in the next year But is this an Intel product The typical Intel doesnt usually release consumer products Or is it more of the call it Intel Vuzix inside How should we look at it or is it an Intel product Well its really hard for me to speak to them I can say that along the reason why Intel likes Vuzix is related to our next generation optics They think we have a really good feel on the business too It falls right in line with their thinking of how the business will unfold But if you just look at inside of the Intel and this is public information they have relationships with companies like Luxottica Luxottica has been the number one fashion glasses company on the planet So you could imagine if you play that out and you have a little bit that products from Luxottica maybe at some point in time would have Intel inside that kinds of things in them And to enable fashion glasses Vuzix is in a pretty good position for that So its tough along those lines but other than that those are public things I really couldnt comment beyond that Okay I understand that Let me maybe try to get at this in a way you can talk about What percentage of Vuzixs engineered resources are focused on working with Intel right now Paul with the IWear how and where are you planning to market this and what are your expectations for For the product is going to be new Were going to be it will be a focus of specialty retailers Our own Website we have Web properties in Asia as well as the EU UK and the best combination of some select catalogs sales folks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>et cetera its we just were not going to build up the hundreds and thousands of units if they required it for like a rollout in Best Buy or the likes even assuming they would decide to carry it But initially its going to be fairly concentrated distribution channel And were expecting that to of our sales will be literally will be direct and right now they are averaging around of all our other products I know Grant that you broke out before a combination of for the fourth quarter the M and the M AR sales was about of product sales in the fourth quarter But I was hoping you could break out just the M sales for the year get an idea of what that contributed to total sales At this stage were not disclosing product line revenue for a variety of competitive reasons So well get totals in percentage changes but we think its a little too early and until we have a more solid historical pipeline we dont want to mislead or confuse anybody with individual product line detail They are two different kind of devices if you think about it One of them is an optical seeker system one of them is kind of more immersive system And we think there is good information in the market side of that understanding how those products move and who they relate to And I know startup cost affected your results in China for the M I was hoping you could quantify exactly what are the startup costs how much this was in fiscal The biggest product in our K we filed in the MDA we said the startup cost in China I think we quoted a number Theyre actually little more of that but some of them more expense in other areas But including like RD travel costs et cetera for our Group that end up indiscernible But the bulk of what we identified which impacted margins almost was they go through engineering sort of destructive testing modes for the first several builds So they do a one build and do another build and then they finally start production The output of the first and second build which is around pieces and those components and products end being destroyed So these things cost each all the electronics and materials in them So that becomes a direct hit on our cost of sales There were other costs There was related travel but we try to some of it just the cost of generally doing business But we only identified what the components materials have ended up being destroyed as part of the QA process And I know that Google Glass has had its problems and competitively speaking how do you feel that the M actually stacks up against Microsofts Holo lens The Holo lens is pointed at a different market I think Microsofts ultimate goal is to make that the device of future and people use it walking down the street they use it for entertainment purposes and the likes I can say that in the warehousing environment you put the Holo lens on and theres not of peripheral vision that you have because just if you saw the thing And Im speaking as a person who has not gotten a chance to actually wear it here it okay But from what I understand the CPU for it is big and bulky Currently theyve got fans on it that keep it cool There is not a lot of peripheral vision it looks So in the enterprise space its not a great solution And the way it correctly exists its not a great solution for walking down the street either You think you look odd with Google Glass on This thing is even odder So they have work to do on the ergonomics side That said as an entertainment device using it home or maybe and in research kinds of things as it is even maybe it might fun for people But it doesnt really compete with a pair of light weight smart glasses that are hands free for enterprise kinds of things Okay And a lot of my questions were addressed but I just have one more in particular with Lenovo You said that you started shipping in January but I was just curious if there were any sales of Lenovo in the fourth quarter And what do you expect as far as that area is concerned for So in actually Vuzix did shift to Lenovo The bigger issue was Lenovo being able to shift to their customer base So and in weve also shipped some product to Lenovo So the thing for Lenovo was probably two fold one getting the CQC CCC certifications was a dragged out process And then number two trying to turn something into a Chinese version is not entirely theres lot of software and the likes that have to get put in place And then I think as Lenovo went out their customer base they learned a bunch of other things too and they upgraded and changed So Lenovo hasnt started shipping until just in January to their customer base Okay but you did ship to Lenovo obviously in the fourth quarter So I just wanted to get a feel for if you could quantify what that was Okay but Lenovo really didnt get the ability to really start shipping in any quantities until January I would imagine that whatever you did ship to Lenovo in Q we can anticipate sequential growth going forward Yes actually we did ship to them in Q and Im just trying to have a scan on what we might have gotten in Q Actually the shipments Lenovo shipments as part of our M sales in Q were really modest very minimal because since we ran at the end we make a shipment on August first shipment August and September to them and then we ran into the CQC certification that we effectively were not using any products in Q Yes so that is what really kept the sales down was waiting for that certification which is history at this point So I would imagine that if you could give us a feel for at least Q because that is actually in the books at this point how Lenovo shipments have gone through in Q Q they have started taking profits again and they finally have been shipping and they have all these accounts that are coming on board But honestly John beyond its a really hard to share that kind of data with you As you mentioned Oculus couple of times the billion acquisition by Facebook where do you see Vuzix in a year or two or five years from now Do you see it being potential takeover target or do you see it an independent company Well I mean currently Vuzix is building our business You might imagine that in an million market cap where there is not a lot of interest in selling the Company So were building the business today At some point in time an acquisition of Vuzix could happen clearly It would make sense There are some big companies that want to get and want to play in this space Vuzix is a leader So today were building and if the numbers were right of course Vuzix would mean to address the potential acquisition down the road Okay and other thing I know youve mentioned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as a possibility just as DHL and has <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>said actually or UPS approached Vuzix yet to try out their product We have sold product to a pile of companies So you might imagine that they would be on the list Okay and as far as and we know that DHL has already tried the product and saw the increase in the productivity So do you expect an order from DHL anytime in the near future We anticipate that DHL will continue to build their efforts around smart glasses and wearable tech just like they have explained in their video Okay and finally has Vuzix looked into like police cameras I know thats a pretty big topic right now with Ferguson and everything happening We worked with the firm in Rochester New York called Fifteen And we have gotten some outreach in this regard and we forwarded those request for information onto our partners at Fifteen and yes theyre managing that effort Ladies and gentlemen we have reached end of our questionandanswer session I would like to turn the call back over to management for any further or closing comments Thanks everybody for joining the call Vuzix is in an exciting time in its growth Weve come to an awful lot in the wearable tech space Were one of those companies that have been through thick and thin of it while we are survivors And I dont believe that you could pick a better time to invest in a company like Vuzix We appreciate everybodys support thus far and look forward to with everybody Thank you That concludes todays teleconference You may disconnect your lines
