( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is reinvesting cash flow to grow the business at the cost of current profitability . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Investments that feed through the income statement can be <b>roughly</b> estimated .  (Uncertainty) </span>Adjusting operating expenses provides insight into the potential profitability of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . GAAP results significantly understate the economic productivity of the company.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Investing for growth traditionally means increasing capital expenditures which <b>appear</b> on the statement of cash flows .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In the case of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , investing for growth primarily consists of spending <i>more</i> on items that <b>appear</b> as operating expenses on the income statement , resulting in insignificant GAAP profits or even losses for a period . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , if the increased operating expenses are truly growth investments , then it is <b>possible</b> to estimate the potential profitability of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> using a few rough adjustments to those expenses . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Specific items will be to adjusted using the amount from 2013 in place of the amount from 2014 as an estimate of the sustaining expense needed before growth , as if it were maintenance capex .  (Uncertainty) </span>Cost of sales and fulfillment will not be adjusted as they are directly linked to revenue.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Fully adjusting marketing , G&A and other is certainly overaggressive but it will indicate how the most optimistic <b>assumptions</b> would translate to operating results .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The item that <b>seems</b> most appropriate for adjustment is technology and content which is primarily R&D related .  (Uncertainty) </span>Here's the description from the 10k: Technology costs consist principally of research and development activities including payroll and related expenses for employees involved in application, production, maintenance, operation and platform development for new and existing products and services, as well as AWS and other technology infrastructure expenses.Content costs consist principally of payroll and related expenses for employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, and merchandising selection.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The result of using select 2013 expenses for 2014 is a reduction in opex from $ 88.8 billion to $ 84.4 billion and income from operations increasing to $ 4.5 billion : Again , the $ 4.5 billion is the result of generous expense adjustments but the implication is that the true 2014 operating income potential of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was likely <b>somewhere</b> between $ 178 million and $ 4.5 billion . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>If the $4.5 billion is accepted as a reasonable estimate and a 30% tax rate is applied, the result is 2014 net income of potential of $3.15 billion before non-operating items.So what is a company with $3.15 billion of annual net income growing revenues at 20% worth?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Call me cheap but I would say a reasonable range would probably be 30 to 40 times earnings on a good day or <b>roughly</b> $ 95 to $ 125 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>This translates to a share price of $204 to $268, well below the closing price of $465 on 7/14/15.It's likely some people will disagree with the multiple selected and that is perfectly fine.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The important things to remember are the $ 4.5 billion of operating income and $ 3.15 billion of net income were calculated using aggressive <b>assumptions</b> intended to illustrate the upside scenario for run rate potential .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Predicting operating margins above these levels would require making additional <b>assumptions</b> about future gross margins and pricing power .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is obvious risk to making all these adjustments and <b>assumptions</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Accrual accounting exists for a reason and investors can convince themselves to do foolish things by attempting to make clever calculations of net income or free cash flow.In this instance however, I feel the premise is sound and that the GAAP results of the company significantly understate its economic productivity.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's financial statements are examined in conjunction , it 's <b>apparent</b> the growth in operating expenses is n't being funded with debt , equity or a working capital deficit and therefore must be the result of gross profit being rapidly reinvested back into those operating expenses . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Using this model of rapid gross profit reinvestment , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does n't report significant net income and avoids paying income taxes , allowing the company to compound its value and grow revenue and future net income potential as fast as <b>possible</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>This is an excellent example of management with a rational, long-term perspective.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The current valuation <b>might</b> not make sense for investors seeking a margin of safety but Jeff Bezos and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> should be celebrated for their operational execution . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As long as those <i>higher</i> expenses keep providing attractive returns and allowing <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to grow revenues then it makes complete sense to continue these investments and forego near-term GAAP profits in an effort to maximize long-term value .
