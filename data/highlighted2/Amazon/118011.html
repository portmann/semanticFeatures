operating expenses provides insight into the potential profitability of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>GAAP results significantly understate the economic productivity of the company Investing for growth traditionally means increasing capital expenditures which appear on the statement of cash flows In the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN investing for growth primarily consists of spending more on items that appear as operating expenses on the income statement resulting in insignificant GAAP profits or even losses for a period However if the increased operating expenses are truly growth investments then it is possible to estimate the potential profitability of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>using a few rough adjustments to those expenses Specific items will be to adjusted using the amount from in place of the amount from as an estimate of the sustaining expense needed before growth as if it were maintenance capex Cost of sales and fulfillment will not be adjusted as they are directly linked to revenue Fully adjusting marketing GA and other is certainly overaggressive but it will indicate how the most optimistic assumptions would translate to operating results The item that seems most appropriate for adjustment is technology and content which is primarily RD related Heres the description from the k Technology costs consist principally of research and development activities including payroll and related expenses for employees involved in application production maintenance operation and platform development for new and existing products and services as well as AWS and other technology infrastructure expenses Content costs consist principally of payroll and related expenses for employees involved in category expansion editorial content buying and merchandising selection The result of using select expenses for is a reduction in opex from billion to billion and income from operations increasing to billion Again the billion is the result of generous expense adjustments but the implication is that the true operating income potential of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was likely somewhere between million and billion If the billion is accepted as a reasonable estimate and a tax rate is applied the result is net income of potential of billion before nonoperating items So what is a company with billion of annual net income growing revenues at worth Call me cheap but I would say a reasonable range would probably be to times earnings on a good day or roughly to billion This translates to a share price of to well below the closing price of on Its likely some people will disagree with the multiple selected and that is perfectly fine The important things to remember are the billion of operating income and billion of net income were calculated using aggressive assumptions intended to illustrate the upside scenario for run rate potential Predicting operating margins above these levels would require making additional assumptions about future gross margins and pricing power There is obvious risk to making all these adjustments and assumptions Accrual accounting exists for a reason and investors can convince themselves to do foolish things by attempting to make clever calculations of net income or free cash flow In this instance however I feel the premise is sound and that the GAAP results of the company significantly understate its economic productivity When Amazons financial statements are examined in conjunction its apparent the growth in operating expenses isnt being funded with debt equity or a working capital deficit and therefore must be the result of gross profit being rapidly reinvested back into those operating expenses Using this model of rapid gross profit reinvestment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt report significant net income and avoids paying income taxes allowing the company to compound its value and grow revenue and future net income potential as fast as possible This is an excellent example of management with a rational longterm perspective The current valuation might not make sense for investors seeking a margin of safety but Jeff Bezos and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>should be celebrated for their operational execution As long as those higher expenses keep providing attractive returns and allowing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to grow revenues then it makes complete sense to continue these investments and forego nearterm GAAP profits in an effort to maximize longterm value Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Brilliantly Investing In Higher
