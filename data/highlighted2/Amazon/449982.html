(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Despite the <b>astonishing</b> numbers shown by the domestic market , growth in the international segment represents the real trigger for the company to definitely become a major corporation .  (Surprise) </span>Netflix doesn't give any target in terms of international presence.Therefore, we used the following method in order to forecast the international expansion and asses the outcome of our expectations.We divided the international streaming segment in 8 regions for which public data are available.Then, based on the year of introduction, we applied at each region the same growth rate that occurred in the domestic streaming segment.It made sense for us since we noted this trend in regions where Netflix is present since some years.We expect about 137 million memberships in 2020 from the 27.4 million at the end of 2015, with a 35.4% CAGR.We assess the growth by observing the ratio between Netflix international subscribers and the number of the English-speaking people in each region.We do that as the production of contents in original languages will be a plus and not the company's core business: the scale will come from the offering of English-speaking contents.The two major sources of cost for Netflix are essentially content amortization and marketing.COGS are represented by the supply of third-party contents and by the costs related to the production of in-house contents.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Historically , they accounted for <b>approximately</b> 50 % of the yearly domestic revenue .  (Uncertainty) </span>We forecast this percentage to gradually decline by 100bps each year.As regards the international segment, we expect the ratio to decrease from 77% in 2015 to 54% in 2020 (4% each year).We foresee marketing-related costs to continue to rise due to international effort.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Furthermore , since the good provided by the company is in a way a sort of commodity , with a <i>lower</i> degree going forward , customers are highly price and brand sensitive .  (Surprise) </span>Netflix should be able to attract new customers at a pace that approaches the historical growth rate and retain the already on-board clients through appropriate strategies.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As the competition becomes <i>stronger</i> , we forecast that the historical 12 % threshold will be breached and the company should commit at least 15 % of its revenue in perpetuity .  (Surprise) </span>The other costs mainly summarized in the SG&A count for circa 15%, we would have said is in line with the average corporations in the market.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>An interesting brief look <b>could</b> be done at the D&A .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix is structured to have a very low depreciation of its tangible assets and this peculiarity <b>could</b> bias the EBITDA calculation .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Summing up only the tangible depreciation , we <b>could</b> underestimate the company 's EBITDA thinking the company is not able to auto-finance the operations .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Instead , if we adjust the EBITDA for the <b>intangible</b> amortization incorporated into the COGS ( as for GAAP standards ) , we obtain a <i>more</i> reliable figure .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Just to have a clue of that concept, the company is currently trading at 85.3x on a GAAP basis and at 8.8x on an adjusted '16 forward basis.The company has not been able to generate cash yet.However, the breaking point is approaching.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In 2015 , the company burned <i>more</i> than $ 1.41 bn of cash in order to support the international expansion .  (Surprise) </span>We expect the cash effort to continue for the next three years.Going forward, Netflix will benefit from its cash cow businesses (the domestic streaming and DVD rental by-mail services) replicating what happened for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and other giants of the high-tech industry.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For that reason , we <b>assume</b> the company wo n't back its growth through any kind of fixed-income products but through internally generated cash .  (Uncertainty) </span>In order to be prudent, we modeled a neutral capital structure that did not add or subtract value from the equity value.It is reasonable to expect the company will just exploit a revolving facility to finance the working capital.Regarding this matter, we suppose Netflix will be able to both rationalize the cash commitment to support operations and generate cash from the accounts receivable/payment management.We modeled the adjusted D&A as we have already commented.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Finally , we have <b>assumed</b> the CAPEX will be sustained in the near future , approaching the D&A in the perpetuity for normalization purposes .  (Uncertainty) </span>Summing up, we have approached the perpetuity with a WC able to generate cash for 1.6% of the revenues, D&A and Capex at 49% of the revenue, offsetting their opposite effects in the FCFO in the long run.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The discount rate we used in the DCF has been <b>probably</b> the <i>more</i> theoretically challenging matter in the Netflix valuation .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The company has a peculiar business mode, a pure first mover in a sense (if we look at the way it provides content), a pure follower in another sense (the media- entertainment industry is a long living industry) exposed the company to a very wide range of not-perfectly-comparable universe of players.We thought the best way to approach the WACC calculation was to observe what investment banks do.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We took a consensus discount rate of 12.3 % and we adjusted it using a rolling methodology , i.e. we decreased the discount rate on a yearly basis as long as the company gradually reduces its <b>risk</b> profile as long as its business model consolidates .  (Uncertainty) </span>To be considered that our WACC expresses a pure cost of equity as we modeled a neutral capital structure.Since the company has a high-growth profile, the utilization of a single phase terminal value wouldn't have been correct from a valuation standpoint.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In fact , the company neither could grow at the current level in perpetuity nor could start to grow <b>suddenly</b> at a low rate .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A <i>more</i> reasonable way to think is that Netflix will slowly approach a long-term FCFO CAGR .  (Surprise) </span>In that way, we modeled a three phase terminal value with three different, and decreasing, growth and discount rates.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With those assumptions , an explosive 28.2 % revenue CAGR , an increasing ability to manage the working capital , a decreasing risk profile and a perpetuity growth <i>higher</i> than what <b>could</b> be a reasonable long-run inflation rate , we <b>could</b> expect a monster valuation and a tremendous upside potential .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Instead , those <b>assumptions</b> led us to a price of $ 81.7 per share !  (Uncertainty) </span>We leave you all the space to make all your comments on that price.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We 'd grant you the <b>possibility</b> to use our model .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Just leave us the space to say that we run a table sensitivity to see which growth rates , using a 10.1 % discount rate , <b>could</b> justify a $ 98 per share valuation .  (Uncertainty) </span>We ended up with a 7.2% rate.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This means the market is currently <b>assuming</b> Netflix as a company able to increase cash generated from its business , after a five-year explicit forecast period in which the FCFO approaches $ 1bn , at a 7.1 % CAGR in perpetuity .  (Uncertainty) </span>It sounds a little too much for us.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Moreover , as for duty , we would like to point out that one of the top equity research analysts in the high-tech industry has a target price of $ 65 , even <i>lower</i> than our `` truth . ''  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Whoever wants to open a position in the next weeks could <b>probably</b> profit short selling the company keeping a long-term investment period .
