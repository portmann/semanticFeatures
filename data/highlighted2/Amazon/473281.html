marrying hightraffic with detailed some would say invasive knowledge of each individual consumer Personality profiling is likely among the next frontiers Studies have been shown that tailoring ads to the individuals personality character can increase sales by over Mattersight has quietly amassed dozens of patents around personality profiling and utilization of personality data which could tilt the competitive landscape for Internet advertising giants With Facebooks NASDAQ FB Q outperformance in focus investors are fixated on how the company can continue growing rapidly with its user base numbers reaching maturation From our perspective the possibilities remain endless We expect new services to be rolled out for years to come In addition Facebook can increase its targeting acumen along multiple dimensions Personality profiling remains one area of lowhanging fruit Studies have shown that advertisements are more effective when they are targeted to match each customers personality Unbeknownst to most Mattersight Corporation NASDAQ MATR was recently granted the latest in a series of personalityfocused patents The strategic value of its growing IP portfolio may impact the balance of consumerprofiling power between Facebook Apple NASDAQ AAPL Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT The most recent patent Mattersights sixth of the year was announced without much fanfare However in reading the press release and speaking with company representatives the implications were palpable Mattersight now holds patents around analyzing phone calls social media ie Facebook Instagram Snapchat WhatsApp etc emails and video for personality and behavioral characteristics empathy stress etc This latest patent enables the use of that data to personalize computer assistants like Apples Siri Alphabets Google Now Microsoft Cortana and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Echos Alexa With this capability Siri as an example might soon be able to learn about your personality based on how you communicate with people or interact with your phone Using that information it will then adjust the way it communicates to you ie using the tone tempo and word choices that are tailored to your personality and communication style That technology can extend to call center computer response systems Taken in concert this set of capabilities can boost sales by and increase clickthrough rates by as much as Mattersights own experience with customers has validated the figure Many of its customers have experienced uplifts in that range along with similar decreases in the amount of time required for a call center agent to satisfy a customer At the lowend of those ranges the value to Facebook is billion on its billion in expected ad revenue For Google the number is billion on its billion in expected ad revenue but a bit less applicable since Facebook accumulates more personalityrelevant user data Either way were talking about numbers that are several multiples above Mattersights current market cap just over million With each of the aforementioned tech giants vying for consumer supremacy gaining ownership over Mattersights patent portfolio might go far beyond a simple revenue boost it could decide which vendors can leverage this technology and which are blocked from doing so While doing our research for this article a reliable source confirmed that MATR has receiving inbound interest along these lines Looking at the rest of MATRs growing patent portfolio most of them fall under two capability buckets creating behavioral data and utilizing that data A company representative stated we dont want anybody else creating personality data from phone calls We dont want anybody else to route calls based on personality data Were protecting our current ground Were also blocking future ground for social media or creating a personalitybased personal assistant Digging deeper into the technology we have learned that both Facebook and Mattersight use phone numbers as a unique identifier in their databases In other words assimilating MATRs technology would be plugandplay The company representative continued It could be huge There is a huge opportunity there right now We are focused on our core competency from a revenue perspective Were also focused on building our IP Back in I approved a fivefigure budget to commission a Harvard expert and numerous industry analysts to investigate the potential implications of personality profiling for Facebooks revenue In a stillobscure Mattersight stated the following on its earnings call There are million daily active Facebook users in United States and Canada and million Outlook and Gmail business users in the US and Canada and those users are everyday creating mountains of user generated content that presumably we could apply our analytics to make it more effective and more efficient The companys CEO Kelly Conway went on to say We have existing patents including patents to do this behavioral modeling in both phone calls and social context and we have patents that are pending Weve a very large consumer behavioral database already plus weve got a very strong group of people We have between and people that are behavioral data scientists and developers That is the strongest core probably outside of places like Facebook or Google There really doesnt exist that much concentrated talent tackling this problem So we have assets that really can be deployed and its incredibly exciting I do want to reemphasize we need to do first things first Since that time the company has been on a patentbuilding tear Founded in they required years to obtain a dozen patents But just the past months the company has been granted more with two in the most recent couple of weeks At present Wall Street analysts are expecting MATRs revenue to grow by next year hitting million For Cloud software vendors with this growth profile a typical forward sales multiple is x times the forward growth rate For MATR thats M or about per share In recent days the stock has shown signs of life on high volume A share block crossed on Thursday and the stock appears to be breaking out of its long slow down trend Mattersight will release its second quarter financial results after the market close on Tuesday August Then just two days later on August at AM ET CEO Kelly Conway will present at this years Canaccord Genuity Growth Conference He will also be hosting oneonone meetings with institutional investors I have no insight into what the Q announcement will bring However management will surely highlight its growing patent portfolio and perhaps address our analysis of what it means for their future In the meantime the stock remains among Pipeline Datas top selections I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it I have
