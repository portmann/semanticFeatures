(Uncertainty) </span>Using that information, it will then adjust the way it communicates to you (i.e. using the tone, tempo, and word choices that are tailored to your personality and communication style).That technology can extend to call center computer response systems.Taken in concert, this set of capabilities can boost sales by 15-25% and increase click-through rates by as much as 80% .Mattersight's own experience with customers has validated the 15-25% figure.Many of its customers have experienced uplifts in that range (along with similar decreases in the amount of time required for a call center agent to satisfy a customer).At the low-end of those ranges, the value to Facebook is $3.75 billion on its $25 billion in expected 2016 ad revenue.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For Google , the number is $ 5 billion on its $ 33 billion in expected 2016 ad revenue , but a bit <i>less</i> applicable since Facebook accumulates <i>more</i> personality-relevant user data .  (Surprise) </span>Either way, we're talking about numbers that are several multiples above Mattersight's current market cap (just over $100 million).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With each of the aforementioned tech giants vying for consumer supremacy , gaining ownership over Mattersight 's patent portfolio might go far beyond a simple revenue boost - it <b>could</b> decide which vendors can leverage this technology and which are blocked from doing so .  (Uncertainty) </span>While doing our research for this article, a reliable source confirmed that MATR has receiving inbound interest along these lines.Looking at the rest of MATR's growing patent portfolio, most of them fall under two capability buckets: 1) creating behavioral data and 2) utilizing that data.A company representative stated, "we don't want anybody else creating personality data from phone calls.We don't want anybody else to route calls based on personality data.We're protecting our current ground.We're also blocking future groundâ€¦ for social media or creating a personality-based personal assistant."<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Digging <i>deeper</i> into the technology , we have learned that both Facebook and Mattersight use phone numbers as a unique identifier in their databases .  (Surprise) </span>In other words, assimilating MATR's technology would be plug-and-play.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company representative continued , `` It <b>could</b> be huge .  (Uncertainty) </span>There is a huge opportunity there right now.We are focused on our core competency from a revenue perspective.We're also focused on building our IP."Back in 2014, I approved a five-figure budget to commission a Harvard expert and numerous industry analysts to investigate the potential implications of personality profiling for Facebook's revenue.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In 2015 , a still-obscure Mattersight stated the following on its earnings call : `` There are 152 million daily active Facebook users in United States and Canada and 300 million Outlook and Gmail business users in the U.S. and Canada and those users are everyday creating mountains of user generated content that presumably we <b>could</b> apply our analytics to make it <i>more</i> effective and <i>more</i> efficient . ''  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company 's CEO Kelly Conway went on to say : `` We have 13 existing patents including patents to do this behavioral modeling in both phone calls and social context and we have 23 patents that are <b>pending</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>We've a very large consumer behavioral database already plus we've got a very strong group of people.We have between 65 and 70 people that are behavioral data scientists and developers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That is the strongest core <b>probably</b> outside of places like Facebook or Google .  (Uncertainty) </span>There really doesn't exist that much concentrated talent tackling this problem.So we have assets that really can be deployed and it's incredibly exciting.I do want to reemphasize, we need to do first things first."Since that time, the company has been on a patent-building tear.Founded in 1994, they required 20 years to obtain a dozen patents.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But just the past 18 months , the company has been granted 15 <i>more</i> , with two in the most recent couple of weeks .  (Surprise) </span>At present, Wall Street analysts are expecting MATR's revenue to grow by 37% next year, hitting $64 million.For Cloud software vendors with this growth profile, a typical forward sales multiple is 5.5x (0.15 times the forward growth rate).For MATR, that's $350M or about $14 per share.In recent days, the stock has shown signs of life on high volume.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A 900,000 share block crossed on Thursday and the stock <b>appears</b> to be breaking out of its long slow down trend .  (Uncertainty) </span>Mattersight will release its second quarter 2016 financial results after the market close on Tuesday, August 9, 2016.Then, just two days later (on August 11 at 11:00AM ET), CEO Kelly Conway will present at this year's Canaccord Genuity Growth Conference.He will also be hosting one-on-one meetings with institutional investors.I have no insight into what the Q2 announcement will bring.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , management will surely highlight its growing patent portfolio and <b>perhaps</b> address our analysis of what it means for their future .
