Growth fixes a multitude of sins If you grow revenues enough you dont even need profits as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN has proven investors will look past a lot of things With revenue growth high enough companies can offer employees free meals and massages Executives and senior managers can fly around in private jets Companies can build colossal buildings as testaments to their brand or pay to have their names on public buildings RD budgets can soar and product launches can fail Acquisitions are made with no concerns for price Bonuses can be huge All is accepted if revenues grow enough Just look at Facebook NASDAQ FB Wednesday Facebook announced that for the quarter ended March revenues jumped to B from B a year ago Net income tripled to B from M And the company is basically making all its revenue from product mobile ads In the last few years Facebook paid enormous premiums to buy WhatsApp and Instagram but who cares when revenues grow this fast Anticipating good news Facebooks stock was up a touch today But once the news came out afterhours traders pumped the stock to over share a new alltime high Thats a priceearnings PE multiple of something like With growth like that Facebooks leadership can do anything it wants But when revenues slide it can become a veritable poop puddle As Apple NASDAQ AAPL found out Rumors had swirled that Apple was going to say sales were down And the stock had struggled to make gains from lows earlier in When the companys CEO announced Tuesday that sales were down versus a year ago the stock cratered afterhours and opened this morning down Breaking a streak of straight quarters of revenue growth since really sent investors fleeing From trading around share the last days Apple closed today at B of equity value was wiped out in day and the stock trades at a PE multiple of The new iPhone se outsold projections iPads beat expectations First year Apple Watch sales exceeded first year iPhone sales Mac sales remain much stronger than any other PC manufacturer Apple iBeacons and Apple Pay continue their march as major technologies in the IoT Internet of Things market And Apple TV keeps growing There are about M users of Apples iMusic There are M apps on the iTunes store And the installed base keeps the iTunes store growing Share buybacks will grow and the dividend was increased yet again But none of that mattered when people heard sales growth had stopped Now many investors dont think Apples leadership can do anything right Yet that was just one quarter Many companies bounce back from a bad quarter There is no statistical evidence that one bad quarter is predictive of the next But we do know that if sales decline versus a year ago for consecutive quarters that is a Growth Stall And companies that hit a Growth Stall rarely of the time find a consistent growth path ever again Regardless of the explanations Growth Stalls are remarkable predictors of companies that are developing a gap between their offerings and the marketplace Which leads us to Chipotle NYSE CMG Chipotle announced that same store sales fell almost in Q That was after a decline in Q And profits turned to losses for the quarter That is a growth stall Chipotle shares were share back in early October Now they are a drop of over Customer illnesses have pointed to a company that grew fast but apparently didnt have its act together for safe sourcing of local ingredients and safe food handling by employees What seemed like a tactical problem has plagued the company as more customers became ill in March Whether that is all thats wrong at Chipotle is less clear however There is a lot more competition in the fast casual segment than years ago when Chipotle seemed unable to do anything wrong And although the company stresses healthy food the calorie count on most portions would add pounds to anyone other than an athlete or construction worker not exactly in line with current trends toward dieting What frequently looks like a single problem when a companys sales dip often turns out to have multiple origins and regaining growth is nearly always a lot more difficult than leadership expects Growth is magical It allows companies to invest in new products and services and buoys a stocks valueenhancing acquisition ability It allows for experimentation into new markets and discovering other growth avenues But lack of growth is a vital predictor of future performance Companies without growth find themselves cost cutting and taking actions which often cause valuations to decline Right now Facebook is in a wonderful position Apple has investors rightly concerned Will next quarter signal a return to growth or a Growth Stall And Chipotle has investors heading for the exits as there is now ample reason to question whether the company will recover its luster of yore </div></body></html>
