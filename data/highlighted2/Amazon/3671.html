(Uncertainty) </span>The second benefit from TheFind is that it helps improve Facebook's Buy button campaign on mobile.The extensive search engine capability of TheFind will inspire more local retailers to use Facebook's Buy button platform .Location-based search engine positioning plus an impulse Buy button is a great way for local retailers to advertise their products to nearby customers.I previously discussed that Facebook is already a massive users-initiated e-commerce ecosystem.Facebook Groups and Pages are already being used to buy and swap products without any fees being paid to Facebook.The Buy button is therefore Facebook's attempt to reap some benefits from this crowd-initiated online shopping in its social network.TheFind's technology will help Facebook deliver localized sponsored ads of products based on the location of users.If a user clicks and buys the product, TheFind's search engine algorithm will make sure that the user will not get annoyed by the same product ad.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Facebook 's huge presence in mobile <b>could</b> help TheFind maximize the power of its search engine .  (Uncertainty) </span>A majority of the 15 million users of TheFind are likely desktop PC users.The Android app of TheFind only had less than 100k download .Not that it is a bad thing, online shopping is still dominated by people who use desktop computers.As per eMarketer's chart below, desktop/laptop computers accounted for 57% of web traffic and 75.1% of total sales in U.S. retail ecommerce during the Q4 2014 period.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>TheFind 's web search engine technology <b>might</b> also work well on mobile .  (Uncertainty) </span>Facebook needs something to encourage more of its mobile users to buy products - by clicking the ads or the Facebook Buy button.Marketers and advertisers definitely want to improve the 1.1% conversion rate of smartphone online shoppers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Facebook , with its TheFind technology and Buy button , <b>might</b> just have found the right combination to convert more smartphone users from being mere ad clickers to product buyers .  (Uncertainty) </span>FB is a Buy .Facebook is expanding beyond its ad-driven business model into becoming a facilitator of online shopping.Due to the huge amount of people using them, social network websites and messaging apps are great enablers of ecommerce.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Facebook , as the biggest social networking platform and owner of top messaging/sharing apps , <b>could</b> become a potential rival to eBay ( NASDAQ : EBAY ) and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The 1.41 billion active users of Facebook represent a massive amount of purchasing power - which every digital marketer and local retailer will always be tempted to exploit.Twenty-eight other analysts at TipRanks share my bullish outlook for Facebook.Those highly-paid experts have an average price target of $92.65 for FB.Source: Facebook Powers Up Its E-Commerce Ambition Disclosure: The author is long FB.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
