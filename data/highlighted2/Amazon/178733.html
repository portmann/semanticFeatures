class='textDiv'><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>A Feasible Path To With Lots Of Volatility Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Based on existing growth opportunities there is a feasible path for Amazons stock price to reach per share Amazons focus on growth instead of bottomline net income continues to frustrate many value investors Using a discounted cash flow analysis we value <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN at over per share Our analysis assumes Amazons is able to continue to aggressively grow its big three ie Marketplace Prime and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services for the next five years before finally slowing up on innovation and growth and instead focusing more on bottom line results Of course this is contrary to Amazons yearplus history as a public company whereby theyve focused relentlessly on innovation instead of the bottom line But before getting into the details of our valuation the following quote from Amazons Letter to Shareholders provides important color as to Amazons priorities and its a quote <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>founder and CEO Jeff Bezos continues to stand by today he included it in his Letter to Shareholders too We will continue to make investment decisions in light of longterm market leadership considerations rather than shortterm profitability considerations or shortterm Wall Street reactions True to Bezos quote Amazons earnings history demonstrates a clear prioritization of longterm growth over shortterm profits <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has generated almost a quarter trillion with a t dollars in revenue over the last three calendar years but it has still managed to have negative net income in two of the last three years and negative net income in aggregate over the threeyear period Annual Report p To some extent the negative net income is due to thin margins in the retail sales business margins are higher in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services AWS but this is currently a much smaller business However a bigger reason for the negative net income is the enormous amount of spending on innovation and growth For example <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>spent over billion on research and development RD in and the company could have easily generated significantly positive net income simply by cutting back on its RD spending However spending on RD innovation and risky longterm growth opportunities is in Amazons DNA its the reason value investors hate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and growth investors love it Jeff Bezos concludes the body of his most recent Annual Letter to Shareholders as follows Marketplace Prime and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services are three big ideas Were lucky to have them and were determined to improve and nurture them make them even better for customers You can also count on us to work hard to find a fourth Weve already got a number of candidates in work and as we promised some years ago well continue to make bold bets With the opportunities unfolding in front of us to serve customers better through invention we assure you we wont stop trying The quote indicates that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>clearly intends to continue its bold pursuit of growth and innovation both within the big three and beyond For reference Marketplace is Amazoncoms fixedprice online marketplace that allows sellers to offer new and used items alongside Amazons regular offerings Prime is Amazons annual membership service that offers a variety of benefits including free expedited shipping instant video streaming of movies and TV episodes music and books to name a few <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services AWS is a collection of remote computing services that make up a cloudcomputing platform offered by Amazoncom With regard to these three big ideas Marketplace and Prime have been the major drivers of Amazons roughly annual revenue growth over the last several years mainly because they are much larger businesses However this is changing quickly AWS has a much higher revenue growth rate and a much higher operating margin than the other two and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>recently began including AWS in its segment breakout information As AWS continues to grow at a faster pace and with higher margins than Marketplace and Prime it is increasingly becoming a more meaningful driver of value creation for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Amazons second quarter press release highlights some specific examples of AWS expansion including The opening of a new AWS region in India in which will enable customers to run workloads in India and serve Indian endusers with even better latency The launch of significant AWS features and services yeartodate ahead of last years pace The release of AWS Educate a free program that helps educators and students use realworld cloud technology in the classroom to prepare students for the cloud workforce The construction and operation of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Solar Farm US East and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Wind Farm US East to generate approximately megawatt hours MWh of solar power and MWh of wind energy on an annual basis to be delivered into the electrical grids that power both current and future AWS data centers The release of AWS Device Farm a new service that helps mobile app developers quickly and securely test their apps on smartphones tablets and other devices to improve the quality of their Android and Fire OS apps With regard to the North America and international segments see table above North America has been growing at a faster pace and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime has been a big driver of this growth An RBC Capital Markets survey suggests about of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>customers are Prime members today up from about in The survey also suggests there may be as many as million Prime members in the US and as many as to million globally up from an estimated million and million respectively a year ago And the survey not only indicates that customers are willing to pay for Prime but that Prime members spend more money too And while North America has been growing at a faster pace there are clearly opportunities to increase international growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>highlights some of its international growth initiatives in its second quarter press release including the expansion of Prime Now onehour delivery in London and expansion of the Fire HD Kids Edition tablet to the UK and Germany for example Additionally there are opportunities to expand international Prime memberships and overall business to a level closer to that of North America We use a discounted cash flow model to value <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>at per share We assume the company will continue to grow at a fastpace over the next five years based on the opportunities presented by Marketplace Prime and AWS and after five years we assume the companys growth rate will level off but it will also benefit from a reduction in RD spending More specifically we assume <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can grow its cash flow from operations by per year for the next five years before reverting to a more marketnormal growth rate of We use as a conservative estimate its less than the growth rate in and and significantly less than the trajectory through the first half of see investor presentation Also worth noting the analysts surveyed on Yahoo Finance estimate on average Amazons overall earnings will grow by per year for the next five years We also assumed the company will increase its capital expenditures to billion in each of the next five years and then increase capex by per year thereafter For reference cash capex was only billion billion billion and billion in and respectively Annual Report p Google Finance We use a required rate of return of WACC CAPM One of the biggest assumptions in our valuation is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will dramatically slow its rate of innovation and capex spending after AWS has finished ramping up in five years This is contrary to Amazons never stop inventing attitude but its a conservative way to value the company And if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>continues to grow aggressively after five years then the stock is worth even more than our valuation suggests On the other hand if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is not successful and the company never gets out of this negative net income stage of its latest jcurve then the company is just destroying value and stockholders would be wellserved to sell now There are a myriad of other scenarios that could play out for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and this is part of the reason the stock price is so volatile For example <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could spin off its highmargin AWS business leaving current stockholders with shares of two separate companies the low margin marketplaceprime business and the high margin AWS business Or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may figure out how to reduce costs increase margins and dramatically increase its stock price by using drones for example to efficiently deliver orders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Air Or as Jeff Bezos hopes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may invent a fourth big idea which could dramatically change the valuation altogether The possibilities are endless and this is a big contributor to Amazons stock price volatility There are a variety of risk factors that could negatively impact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>For example cloud competition could deprive AWS of future market share Thus far it seems AWS may be finding a niche with smaller and newer companies but Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT for example has a strong foothold at the larger enterprise level and could prevent AWS from achieving large scale growth Microsoft conveniently points out some of their advantages over AWS here Microsoft Azure vs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services AWS And Microsoft is only one source of completion Others include IBM NYSE IBM Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Salesforcecom NYSE CRM Another risk is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could simply overspend on research and development without ever achieving significant profitability This has been a common complaint from value investors as the company continues to generate very little profit relative to its massive revenues <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>recently increased its debt to help fund growth opportunities not necessarily a bad idea in this low interest rate environment Specifically longterm debt has grown from million in to billion as of June and it was as high as billion at the end of Another risk is that Amazons management could start making bad decisions on how it spends its free cash flow For example if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>isnt able to grow organically then management could start destroying shareholder value with bad acquisitions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>highlights this risk nicely on pages and of its most recent annual report giving specific examples of how their business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has demonstrated a propensity to make significant acquisitions for example <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>paid million in cash for Twitch in billion for Zappos in and an estimated to million for Elemental Technologies in Interestingly the majority of Amazons voting rights are not owned by insiders there is only one class of stock and CEO Jeff Bezos and other directors only own Therefore there could be significant activist pressure on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to start focusing on the bottom line and returning cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends if the companys revenue growth rate slows down significantly within the next few years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is risky and volatile but there is a feasible growth path that makes it worth significantly more than its already enormous billion market capitalization Following its current wave of growth initiatives if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>were unable to identify additional growth opportunities then the company would likely have more than enough cash to return to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases to make it worth plus per share However for the foreseeable future and to the chagrin of many value investors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will continue to focus more on growth than on profitability Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any
