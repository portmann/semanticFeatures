( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Based on existing growth opportunities , there is a feasible path for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's stock price to reach $ 700 per share . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's focus on growth instead of bottom-line net income continues to <b>frustrate</b> many value investors . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Using a discounted cash flow analysis , we value <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) at over $ 700 per share . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Our analysis <b>assumes</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's is able to continue to aggressively grow its big three ( i.e. Marketplace , Prime and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services ) for the next five years before finally slowing up on innovation and growth , and instead focusing <i>more</i> on bottom line results . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Of course this is contrary to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's 18 year-plus history as a public company whereby they 've focused relentlessly on innovation instead of the bottom line . But before getting into the details of our valuation , the following quote from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's 1997 Letter to Shareholders provides important color as to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's priorities , and it 's a quote <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> founder and CEO , Jeff Bezos , continues to stand by today ( he included it in his 2014 Letter to Shareholders too ) : We will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions . '' True to Bezos ' quote , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's earnings history demonstrates a clear prioritization of long-term growth over short-term profits . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has generated <b>almost</b> a quarter trillion ( with a `` t '' ) dollars in revenue over the last three calendar years , but it has still managed to have negative net income in two of the last three years and negative net income in aggregate over the three-year period ( 2014 Annual Report , p. 17 ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To some extent , the negative net income is due to thin margins in the retail sales business ( margins are <i>higher</i> in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services ( AWS ) , but this is currently a much <i>smaller</i> business ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , a <i>bigger</i> reason for the negative net income is the enormous amount of spending on innovation and growth .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For example , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> spent over $ 9 billion on research and development ( R&D ) in 2014 , and the company <b>could</b> have easily generated significantly positive net income simply by cutting back on its R&D spending . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , spending on R&D , innovation and <b>risky</b> long-term growth opportunities is in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's DNA - it 's the reason value investors hate <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and growth investors love it . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Jeff Bezos concludes the body of his most recent Annual Letter to Shareholders as follows : Marketplace , Prime , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services are three big ideas . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We 're lucky to have them , and we 're determined to improve and nurture them - make them even <i>better</i> for customers .  (Surprise) </span>You can also count on us to work hard to find a fourth.We've already got a number of candidates in work, and as we promised some 20 years ago, we'll continue to make bold bets.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With the opportunities unfolding in front of us to serve customers <i>better</i> through invention , we assure you we wo n't stop trying . ''  (Surprise) </span>The quote indicates that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> clearly intends to continue its bold pursuit of growth and innovation , both within the big three and beyond . For reference : Marketplace is Amazon.com 's fixed-price online marketplace that allows sellers to offer new and used items alongside <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's regular offerings . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Prime is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's $ 99 annual membership service that offers a <b>variety</b> of benefits including free expedited shipping , instant video streaming of movies and TV episodes , music , and books , to name a few . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services ( AWS ) is a collection of remote computing services that make up a cloud-computing platform offered by Amazon.com . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With regard to these three big ideas , Marketplace and Prime have been the major drivers of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's <b>roughly</b> 20 % annual revenue growth over the last several years ( mainly because they are much <i>larger</i> businesses ) . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>However, this is changing quickly.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>AWS has a much <i>higher</i> revenue growth rate and a much <i>higher</i> operating margin than the other two , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> recently began including AWS in its segment breakout information : As AWS continues to grow at a <i>faster</i> pace ( and with <i>higher</i> margins ) than Marketplace and Prime , it is increasingly becoming a <i>more</i> meaningful driver of value creation for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's second quarter press release highlights some specific examples of AWS expansion including : The opening of a new AWS region in India in 2016 , which will enable customers to run workloads in India and serve Indian end-users with even <i>better</i> latency . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The launch of 350 significant AWS features and services year-to-date (ahead of last year's pace).The release of AWS Educate, a free program that helps educators and students use real-world cloud technology in the classroom to prepare students for the cloud workforce.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The construction and operation of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Solar Farm U.S. East and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Wind Farm U.S. East to generate <b>approximately</b> 170,000 megawatt hours ( MWh ) of solar power and 670,000 MWh of wind energy on an annual basis to be delivered into the electrical grids that power both current and future AWS data centers . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The release of AWS Device Farm, a new service that helps mobile app developers quickly and securely test their apps on smartphones, tablets and other devices to improve the quality of their Android and Fire OS apps.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With regard to the North America and international segments ( see table above ) , North America has been growing at a <i>faster</i> pace , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime has been a big driver of this growth . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>An RBC Capital Markets survey <b>suggests</b> about 40 % of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> customers are Prime members today , up from about 25 % in 2013 . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The survey also suggests there <b>may</b> be as many as 50 million Prime members in the US and as many as 60 to 80 million globally , up from an estimated 30-40 million and 50 million , respectively , a year ago .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And the survey not only indicates that customers are willing to pay for Prime , but that Prime members spend <i>more</i> money too .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And while North America has been growing at a <i>faster</i> pace , there are clearly opportunities to increase international growth .  (Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> highlights some of its international growth initiatives in its second quarter press release including the expansion of Prime Now one-hour delivery in London and expansion of the Fire HD Kids Edition tablet to the UK and Germany , for example . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Additionally , there are opportunities to expand international Prime memberships ( and overall business ) to a level <i>closer</i> to that of North America .  (Surprise) </span>We use a discounted cash flow model to value <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> at $ 712 per share . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>assume</b> the company will continue to grow at a fast-pace over the next five years based on the opportunities presented by Marketplace , Prime and AWS , and after five years we <b>assume</b> the company 's growth rate will level off but it will also benefit from a reduction in R&D spending .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>More</i> specifically , we <b>assume</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can grow its cash flow from operations by 22 % per year for the next five years before reverting to a <i>more</i> market-normal growth rate of 2.5 % . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( We use 22 % as a conservative estimate ; it 's <i>less</i> than the growth rate in 2013 and 2014 , and significantly <i>less</i> than the trajectory through the first half of 2015 , see investor presentation .  (Surprise) </span>Also worth noting , the 40 analysts surveyed on Yahoo Finance estimate , on average , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's overall earnings will grow by 35.5 % per year for the next five years ) . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We also <b>assumed</b> the company will increase its capital expenditures to $ 6 billion in each of the next five years and then increase capex by 2.5 % per year thereafter .  (Uncertainty) </span>For reference, cash capex was only $4.9 billion, $3.4 billion, $3.8 billion and $1.8 billion in 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively (Annual Report, p.22, Google Finance ).We use a required rate of return of 8.3% (WACC, CAPM).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One of the biggest <b>assumptions</b> in our valuation is that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will dramatically slow its rate of innovation and capex spending after AWS has finished `` ramping up '' in five years . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>This is contrary to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's `` never stop inventing '' attitude , but it 's a conservative way to value the company . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continues to grow aggressively after five years then the stock is worth even <i>more</i> than our valuation <b>suggests</b> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the other hand , if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is not successful , and the company never gets out of this negative net income stage of its latest j-curve , then the company is just destroying value , and stockholders would be well-served to sell now . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are a myriad of other scenarios that could play out for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , and this is part of the reason the stock price is so <b>volatile</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For example , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> spin off its high-margin AWS business leaving current stockholders with shares of two separate companies ( the low margin marketplace/prime business and the high margin AWS business ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Or , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>may</b> figure out how to reduce costs , increase margins and dramatically increase its stock price by using drones , for example , to efficiently deliver orders ( <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Air ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Or , as Jeff Bezos hopes , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> may invent a fourth big idea which <b>could</b> dramatically change the valuation altogether . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The possibilities are endless , and this is a big contributor to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's stock price <b>volatility</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are a variety of risk factors that <b>could</b> negatively impact <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For example , cloud competition <b>could</b> deprive AWS of future market share .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Thus far , it seems AWS may be finding a niche with <i>smaller</i> and <i>newer</i> companies , but Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) , for example , has a strong foothold at the <i>larger</i> enterprise level and <b>could</b> prevent AWS from achieving large scale growth .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft conveniently points out some of their advantages over AWS here : Microsoft Azure vs. <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services ( AWS ) . And Microsoft is only one source of completion.Others include IBM (NYSE: IBM ), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Another risk is that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> simply overspend on research and development without ever achieving significant profitability . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>This has been a common complaint from value investors as the company continues to generate very little profit relative to its massive revenues.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> recently increased its debt to help fund growth opportunities ( not necessarily a bad idea in this low interest rate environment ) . Specifically, long-term debt has grown from $255 million in 2011 to $8.25 billion as of June 30, 2015 (and it was as high as $9.9 billion at the end of 2014).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Another risk is that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's management <b>could</b> start making bad decisions on how it spends its free cash flow . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For example , if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is n't able to grow organically then management <b>could</b> start destroying shareholder value with bad acquisitions . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> highlights this risk nicely on pages 9 and 10 of its most recent annual report giving specific examples of how their `` business <b>could</b> suffer if we are unsuccessful in making , integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments . '' (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has demonstrated a propensity to make significant acquisitions ( for example <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> paid $ 842 million in cash for Twitch in 2014 , $ 1.2 billion for Zappos in 2009 , and an estimated $ 330 to $ 500 million for Elemental Technologies in 2015 ) . Interestingly , the majority of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's voting rights are not owned by insiders ( there is only one class of stock , and CEO Jeff Bezos ( and other directors ) only own 18.2 % ) . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Therefore , there <b>could</b> be significant activist pressure on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to start focusing on the bottom line and returning cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends if the company 's revenue growth rate slows down significantly within the next few years . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is risky and <b>volatile</b> , but there is a feasible growth path that makes it worth significantly <i>more</i> than its already enormous $ 250 billion market capitalization . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Following its current wave of growth initiatives , if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> were unable to identify additional growth opportunities then the company would likely have <i>more</i> than enough cash to return to shareholders ( via dividends and share repurchases ) to make it worth $ 700-plus per share . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , for the foreseeable future ( and to the chagrin of many value investors ) , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will continue to focus <i>more</i> on growth than on profitability .
