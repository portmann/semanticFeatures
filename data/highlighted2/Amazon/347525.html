Again, the Fitbit Blaze starts at $199, while the Apple Watch only after its recent price cut starts at $299.We're getting closer to an even comparison but we're not there yet.Additionally, the Blaze is a new product versus the Apple Watch which is basically a year old.Of course, Apple Watch sales are going to tail off a bit as consumers wait for the second edition to be launched.Had the Apple Watch launched in the past month or two, this would be a valid comparison, but again, we are comparing apples to oranges, no pun intended.So can we please stop with the invalid comparisons between Fitbit and the Apple Watch?Yes, Fitbit sells more units, but at a fraction of the price.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple <b>probably</b> generated more Watch revenues in the last four months of 2015 than Fitbit did in the entire year .  (Uncertainty) </span>Additionally, comparing the brand new Blaze to the year old Watch is misleading.The Apple Watch is clearly winning in terms of revenues, so anyone telling you that Apple is a big loser here is quite mistaken.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: Investors are always reminded that before making any investment, you should do your own proper due diligence on any name directly or indirectly mentioned in this article.Investors should also consider seeking advice from a broker or financial adviser before making any investment decisions.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Any material in this article should be considered general information , and not <b>relied</b> on as a formal investment recommendation .
