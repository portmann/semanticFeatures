( NASDAQ : AAPL ) | Seeking Alpha Fitbit 's Q4 sales were at a much <i>lower</i> price point .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Apple Watch is generating much <i>more</i> revenues .  (Surprise) </span>One thing I never like is when I see an apples to oranges comparison.If you want to compare two products, they need to be extremely similar.Unfortunately, I keep seeing a lot of comparisons between the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Watch and Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ), many of which are extremely misguided.Another article on this site recently detailed how the Apple Watch stumbled in Q4 2015 and Fitbit is the clear winner in wearables.This line of thinking is well off the mark.(Fitbit Blaze vs. Apple Watch via abcnews article) We don't quite know the exact sales numbers for the Apple Watch as the company is keeping them a secret for now.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Once the product is a little <i>more</i> established , I 'm sure we 'll get some unit sales numbers .  (Surprise) </span>For now, let's take a look at what IDC reported for Q4 2015, detailed in the table below.SA contributor Bull & Bear Trading talked about how Fitbit took away market share from Apple during Q4.While that is true to a point if you look at pure unit shipments, it misrepresents the situation.Let's take a look at page 45 of Fitbit's 10-K filing for 2015.Fitbit reported an average selling price of $85 for the whole year, and the number was at $84 through the first three quarters of the year.So in Q4 2015, Fitbit averaged around $86 per device sold.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , the Apple Watch starting price was $ 349 , with a number of models/pairs going for much <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Even if we <b>assume</b> that the <i>cheaper</i> models represented a <i>higher</i> percentage of sales , Apple 's average selling price was likely $ 400 or <i>more</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At that figure , Apple was generating <b>almost</b> 5 times as much revenue per device than Fitbit .  (Uncertainty) </span>Did Fitbit really win Q4 2015 then?Using the numbers from IDC and my ASPs above, Fitbit would be around $700 million in revenues and Apple Watch about $1.6 billion.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Sure , Fitbit <b>may</b> sell twice as <i>more</i> units , but at around 5 times the price , Apple Watch generates <i>more</i> than twice as much revenue .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In fact , Fitbit for the entire 2015 year only reported revenues of $ 1.86 billion , so the Apple Watch <b>may</b> have actually generated <i>more</i> revenues in about 3.5 months .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Fitbit has been around since 2007 and didn't get to $2 billion in annual revenues last year.Based on IDC's yearly numbers the Apple Watch was close to $5 billion last year and the product didn't start selling until late April (and that was only select markets).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The article I linked above goes on about how the new Fitbit Blaze is selling way <i>better</i> than the Apple Watch on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Again, the Fitbit Blaze starts at $199, while the Apple Watch only after its recent price cut starts at $299.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We 're getting <i>closer</i> to an even comparison but we 're not there yet .  (Surprise) </span>Additionally, the Blaze is a new product versus the Apple Watch which is basically a year old.Of course, Apple Watch sales are going to tail off a bit as consumers wait for the second edition to be launched.Had the Apple Watch launched in the past month or two, this would be a valid comparison, but again, we are comparing apples to oranges, no pun intended.So can we please stop with the invalid comparisons between Fitbit and the Apple Watch?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Yes , Fitbit sells <i>more</i> units , but at a fraction of the price .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Apple <b>probably</b> generated <i>more</i> Watch revenues in the last four months of 2015 than Fitbit did in the entire year .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Additionally, comparing the brand new Blaze to the year old Watch is misleading.The Apple Watch is clearly winning in terms of revenues, so anyone telling you that Apple is a big loser here is quite mistaken.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: Investors are always reminded that before making any investment, you should do your own proper due diligence on any name directly or indirectly mentioned in this article.Investors should also consider seeking advice from a broker or financial adviser before making any investment decisions.Any material in this article should be considered general information, and not relied on as a formal investment recommendation.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Personal Computers</div></body></html>
