class='textDiv'>Amazons Shipping Strategy And Why It Must Work Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Why the company is experimenting with a variety of delivery options It seems just about every few days theres another story on how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN is going to take steps to address the rising costs of shipping especially in light of the fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime is the future of the company and it will struggle if it cant deal with the shipping costs which are eating into margin and earnings In shipping costs jumped percent while revenue growth came in at percent It doesnt take a genius to see that this cant continue on if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>wants to retain investor trust Among the variety of ways <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is reportedly dealing with the issue is to offer an Ubertype of delivery service rather than UPS and other delivery services The assumption is the current delivery operators are the cause of the problem in regard to higher costs so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is taking steps to deal with the issue on its own terms It remains to be seen whether or not it will successfully carry out its strategy It appears that in order to compete profitable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will have to go outside of normal delivery channels to achieve that goal The other option would be to raise the price of its products and services along with the annual <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime membership I dont think it wants to do so this soon after it did so last year Consumers would probably rebel at the notion of a higher <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime until the company can add value to the point its still considered a bargain click to enlarge source StockChartscom Variety of delivery options on the table Along with service where everyday drivers would pick up and deliver packages for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>other delivery options include bike messengers in larger cities aerial drones USPS deliveries on Sundays and sameday contracts for its Fresh grocery service This isnt all the delivery services <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is thinking of but a few that have been reported on At a glance the option with the opportunity to make the biggest impact would be its use of amateur drivers How that would probably work is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would rent out space in local retail stores or other businesses have the packages delivered there by its current delivery companies and from there have it picked up and delivered by local drivers who know the area Thats an assumption of course but it makes the most sense Another possibility would be to build smaller facilities which it would deliver to from its regional fulfillment center and from there have them picked up by the locals Whatever the details end up being it would be surprising if that isnt a part of its delivery system in the future What Amazons delivery future will look like My belief is Amazons delivery strategy will eventually evolve into a multifaceted one where it includes a variety of delivery options across the world While that is already happening it will roll that out to numerous regions once it has the logistics in place to run the complicated affair Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is already an expert in logistics its only a matter of deciding which delivery systems will be offered in specific locations From there it will only be a matter of setting them up and operating them Even there it could include more than one type of delivery option for each customer in the area allowing for choices to be made Either way it would result in lower shipping costs for the retail giant Another reason for a variety of delivery options Since shipping costs have risen so quickly there can be no doubt one of the reasons <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is letting it be known its experimenting with a variety of shipping options is in order to use it as a bargaining chip with those services When sales rise at a percent clip and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>isnt close to keeping up with the boost in prices from its existing delivery services it must do something in order to rein in those costs Thats a major reason were hearing about all the delivery options <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is considering But I dont believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is bluffing here at all It has to find ways to cut shipping costs If it cant negotiate down some of the costs it will forced to develop other means of delivery Further out it will probably continue to use UPS NYSE UPS FedEx NYSE FDX and others but it wont be at the prior levels it had been Thats something to consider for those holding these type of stocks as over time the crowd sourced business model will compete against the delivery majors and that will cut into some of their earnings As mentioned earlier <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime is the core business at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and its success will determine the performance of the company While there are a lot of numbers thrown around as to how much Prime members buy in comparison to nonPrime members there is no way of knowing how accurate those numbers are One thing that is a surety is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime members do spend a significant amount more than nonPrime members do and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>must find a way to make that a profitable business as it scales it out With day shipping being the key element attracting consumers to Prime the company will have to cut shipping costs in order to keep from having to increase <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime annual fees I think if it had to increase it above a year it would be a psychological barrier to many and it would result in higher churn going forward Make no mistake about it shipping costs are of major importance to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>at this time and it will do whatever it takes to lower costs And these shipping concerns are directly correlated to its popular <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>cant afford to incur losses in this program as it is the future of the company Nothing else comes close in value at this time and wont far into the future So whenever the issue of shipping comes up in regard to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>think of it in relationship to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and how it may impact the service That means from it being a bargaining chip in negotiations with larger carriers to providing a variety of lowcost delivery alternatives under different regional scenarios My outlook is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will eventually end up with several major different shipping alternatives with several more that will be operated on a smaller scale in concert with the local requirements and conditions When I say smaller scale I dont mean it wont have it in a significant number of communities or possibly even countries I mean it may have a smaller presence and impact on specific localities but still be spread around the US or the world Obviously the way to measure its progress in this area is to look at the shipping numbers Earnings of course will also be a significant measure although it will take at least a couple of years for this to play out and be visible to investors That means in the shorter term <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may struggle in these areas until if finds a sustainable lowcost shipping solution In shipping costs climbed to billion an increase of billion or percent of total sales In shipping costs accounted for percent of all sales Source Amazons Shipping Strategy And Why It Must Work Disclosure
