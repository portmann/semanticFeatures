( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Why the company is experimenting with a <b>variety</b> of delivery options . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>seems</b> just about every few days there 's another story on how <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) is going to take steps to address the rising costs of shipping ; especially in light of the fact <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime is the future of the company , and it will struggle if it ca n't deal with the shipping costs which are eating into margin and earnings . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>In 2014 shipping costs jumped 31 percent, while revenue growth came in at 19.5 percent.It does n't take a genius to see that this ca n't continue on if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> wants to retain investor trust . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Among the <b>variety</b> of ways <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is reportedly dealing with the issue , is to offer an Uber-type of delivery service , rather than UPS and other delivery services . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The <b>assumption</b> is the current delivery operators are the cause of the problem in regard to <i>higher</i> costs , so <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is taking steps to deal with the issue on its own terms . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It remains to be seen whether or not it will successfully carry out its strategy.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>appears</b> that in order to compete profitable <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will have to go outside of normal delivery channels to achieve that goal . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The other option would be to raise the price of its products and services , along with the annual <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime membership . I don't think it wants to do so this soon after it did so last year.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Consumers would <b>probably</b> rebel at the notion of a <i>higher</i> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime until the company can add value to the point it 's still considered a bargain . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>( click to enlarge ) source : StockCharts.com <b>Variety</b> of delivery options on the table Along with service where everyday drivers would pick up and deliver packages for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , other delivery options include bike messengers in <i>larger</i> cities , aerial drones , USPS deliveries on Sundays and same-day contracts for its Fresh grocery service . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>This is n't all the delivery services <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is thinking of , but a few that have been reported on . At a glance the option with the opportunity to make the biggest impact would be its use of amateur drivers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>How that would <b>probably</b> work is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> would rent out space in local retail stores or other businesses , have the packages delivered there by its current delivery companies , and from there have it picked up and delivered by local drivers who know the area . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That 's an <b>assumption</b> of course , but it makes the most sense .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Another <b>possibility</b> would be to build <i>smaller</i> facilities which it would deliver to from its regional fulfillment center , and from there have them picked up by the locals .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Whatever the details end up being , it would be <b>surprising</b> if that is n't a part of its delivery system in the future .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's delivery future will look like My belief is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's delivery strategy will eventually evolve into a multifaceted one , where it includes a <b>variety</b> of delivery options across the world . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>While that is already happening, it will roll that out to numerous regions once it has the logistics in place to run the complicated affair.Since <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is already an expert in logistics , it 's only a matter of deciding which delivery systems will be offered in specific locations . From there it will only be a matter of setting them up and operating them.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Even there it <b>could</b> include <i>more</i> than one type of delivery option for each customer in the area , allowing for choices to be made .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Either way , it would result in <i>lower</i> shipping costs for the retail giant .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Another reason for a <b>variety</b> of delivery options Since shipping costs have risen so quickly , there can be no doubt one of the reasons <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is letting it be known it 's experimenting with a <b>variety</b> of shipping options is in order to use it as a bargaining chip with those services . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>When sales rise at a 19 percent clip and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is n't close to keeping up with the boost in prices from its existing delivery services , it must do something in order to rein in those costs . That 's a major reason we 're hearing about all the delivery options <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is considering . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But I do n't <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is bluffing here at all . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>It has to find ways to cut shipping costs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If it ca n't negotiate down some of the costs , it will forced to develop other means of delivery .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Further out it will <b>probably</b> continue to use UPS ( NYSE : UPS ) , FedEx ( NYSE : FDX ) and others , but it wo n't be at the prior levels it had been .  (Uncertainty) </span>That's something to consider for those holding these type of stocks, as over time the crowd sourced business model will compete against the delivery majors, and that will cut into some of their earnings.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As mentioned <i>earlier</i> , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime is the core business at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , and its success will determine the performance of the company . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>While there are a lot of numbers thrown around as to how much Prime members buy in comparison to non-Prime members, there is no way of knowing how accurate those numbers are.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>One thing that is a surety is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime members do spend a significant amount <i>more</i> than non-Prime members do , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> must find a way to make that a profitable business as it scales it out . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>With 2-day shipping being the key element attracting consumers to Prime , the company will have to cut shipping costs in order to keep from having to increase <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime annual fees . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I think if it had to increase it above $ 100 a year , it would be a psychological barrier to many , and it would result in <i>higher</i> churn going forward .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Make no mistake about it , shipping costs are of major importance to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> at this time , and it will do whatever it takes to lower costs . And these shipping concerns are directly correlated to its popular <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime service . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ca n't afford to incur losses in this program , as it is the future of the company . Nothing else comes close in value at this time, and won't far into the future.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So whenever the issue of shipping comes up in regard to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , think of it in relationship to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime and how it <b>may</b> impact the service . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>That means from it being a bargaining chip in negotiations with <i>larger</i> carriers , to providing a <b>variety</b> of low-cost delivery alternatives under different regional scenarios .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>My outlook is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will eventually end up with several major different shipping alternatives , with several <i>more</i> that will be operated on a <i>smaller</i> scale in concert with the local requirements and conditions . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>When I say <i>smaller</i> scale , I do n't mean it wo n't have it in a significant number of communities , or <b>possibly</b> even countries .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I mean it <b>may</b> have a <i>smaller</i> presence and impact on specific localities , but still be spread around the U.S. or the world .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Obviously, the way to measure its progress in this area is to look at the shipping numbers.Earnings of course will also be a significant measure; although it will take at least a couple of years for this to play out and be visible to investors.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>That means in the <i>shorter</i> term <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>may</b> struggle in these areas until if finds a sustainable low-cost shipping solution . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In 2014 shipping costs climbed to $8.7 billion, an increase of $2.07 billion, or 9.8 percent of total sales.In 2013, shipping costs accounted for 8.9 percent of all sales.Source : <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Shipping Strategy And Why It Must Work Disclosure : I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned , and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .
