(Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Thus , should Netflix demand a <i>higher</i> valuation than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> due to <i>higher</i> next year 's EPS growth rate ? (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Looking to Netflix 's graph above , one can see that the stock price bounced below resistance and zoomed to support due to the <b>disappointing</b> subscriber numbers .  (Surprise) </span>Drawing my own (black) lines on top of the computer generated technical graph, the price movement has also formed a descending triangle with a price target of $27 above or below the breakout point.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>assume</b> that the stock will bounce off of support and break above resistance , leading to a target price of about $ 124 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But if the stock breaks below support , target <b>could</b> be about $ 58 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , a move all the way down to $ 58 <b>seems</b> unlikely , as the stock would have to cross below the $ 68 long term support line .  (Uncertainty) </span>Also, note that the $68 support line falls on the 200-day moving average .The 200-day moving average provides another level of support at $68.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The graph below seems to show that prices <b>could</b> likely bounce back soon .  (Uncertainty) </span>The Stochastic %K , the W%R , and the RSI (Relative Strength Index) are in or near oversold (bullish) territory.The MFI (Money Flow Index) is halfway between overbought (bearish) and oversold territory.One time when all four technicals (the MFI, RSI, Stochastic %K, and W%R) were at similar levels as indicated by the purple line, the price fell.But another time when all four technicals (the MFI, RSI, Stochastic %K, and W%R) were at similar levels as indicated by the orange line, the price rose.The MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence Oscillator) formed a bearish downward cross sell signal on July 18.In the MACD, a crossover of the red line below the black line indicates a buy signal, while a crossover of the red line above the black line indicates a sell signal.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Could</b> it make a bullish upward cross buy signal soon ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Conclusion : Overall , Netflix <b>seems</b> to have a bright future , and the pullback <b>seems</b> a buying opportunity .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Even though a week has passed since the plunge , shares are still very low and <b>could</b> be ready to head <i>higher</i> .
