class='textDiv'>eBay Takes A Step In The Right Direction eBay Inc NASDAQEBAY Seeking Alpha eBay had a severe flaw when compared to Amazoncom A flaw I had already highlighted in a previous article However an incoming change is bound to eliminate this flaw Five months ago I wrote an article titled Why Does Amazoncom Keep Cleaning eBays Clock In this article I explained one of the reasons why eBay NASDAQ EBAY kept on losing to Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN The reason I identified was that Amazoncom listed its wares starting from a product page paradigm whereas eBay listed them on an offer paradigm perhaps due to its roots in auctions The obvious problem with eBays approach was that each different offer by each different seller was a different listing So while Amazoncom might have sellers selling the same product in a single product page eBay would have different pages with offers on that same product Obviously this made specific product offers difficult to find If you searched for a given product and ordered the results by price for instance youd see tens of pages of similar products by different sellers This created a neverending chore to find the right offer which made buying less agreeable On top of that of course it also made it harder to cleanly compare different offers on the same product by different sellers If you missed a term in the description youd simply not get all available offers perhaps even hiding the best bargains for that product Also importantly since there were no product pages it became hard for eBay to carry reviews on those same products And thus reviews become an Amazoncom advantage People want to see reviews people flock to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>This created the risk that upon seeing the reviews lazy as consumers are theyd simply buy the product there Which in turn led to it being easier to sell at more expensive prices on Amazoncom Which in turn attracted the sellers wanting to access those higher selling prices That is while many times it was cheaper to buy on eBay since it was harder to find the bargains many consumers didnt even try And eBay threw away a possible competitive advantage Seeing what I described above I said that eBay could do something about it it could substitute its offerbased paradigm with a productpage paradigm similar to Amazoncoms I also said that it shouldnt be too hard that sellers used to also selling on Amazoncom would quickly get used to it As it were eBay is taking a step in doing exactly what I said it ought to do As per ChannelAdvisor from June Monday next week eBay will be requiring product identifiers The relevant quote from ChannelAdvisor is this eBay forewarned of this in the seller release but starting June product identifiers including brand name manufacturer part number MPN and different global trade item numbers GTINs such as UPC EAN or ISBN will be required for new listings of branded items in new and manufacturerrefurbished condition within many categories It might seem a small change but this is all that eBay needs to create product pages just like Amazoncoms And I am certain such will happen right after the listings carry the relevant information In quick succession this will help product discovery It will also quickly enable a decent review system which should rapidly be populated by eBays large customer base And finally it will be a boon to consumers trying to find the best bargains eBay has done what I said it ought to do and this is a positive for eBay I expect the June change to bring about product pages better search and a better review system As a result I expect eBays competitiveness to increase versus Amazoncom all other things being equal Indeed this should also allow eBays greater price competitiveness cheaper goods to shine through whereas those were previously hidden below thousands of similar offers In short this is a positive for eBay Source eBay Takes A Step In The Right Direction Disclosure I
