( NASDAQ : EBAY ) | Seeking Alpha eBay had a severe flaw when compared to Amazon.com . A flaw I had already highlighted in a previous article.However, an incoming change is bound to eliminate this flaw.Five months ago , I wrote an article titled '' Why Does Amazon.com Keep Cleaning eBay 's Clock ? '' .In this article , I explained one of the reasons why eBay ( NASDAQ : EBAY ) kept on losing to Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The reason I identified was that Amazon.com listed its wares starting from a product page paradigm , whereas eBay listed them on an offer paradigm , <b>perhaps</b> due to its roots in auctions . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The obvious problem with eBay's approach was that each different offer by each different seller was a different listing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So while Amazon.com <b>might</b> have 100 sellers selling the same product in a single product page , eBay would have 100 different pages with offers on that same product . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Obviously, this made specific product offers difficult to find.If you searched for a given product and ordered the results by price, for instance, you'd see tens of pages of similar products by different sellers.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This created a never-ending chore to find the right offer which made buying <i>less</i> agreeable .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On top of that , of course , it also made it <i>harder</i> to cleanly compare different offers on the same product by different sellers .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you missed a term in the description , you 'd simply not get all available offers , <b>perhaps</b> even hiding the best bargains for that product .  (Uncertainty) </span>Also importantly, since there were no product pages, it became hard for eBay to carry reviews on those same products.And thus reviews become an Amazon.com advantage . People want to see reviews , people flock to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This created the <b>risk</b> that upon seeing the reviews , lazy as consumers are , they 'd simply buy the product there .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Which in turn led to it being <i>easier</i> to sell at <i>more</i> expensive prices on Amazon.com . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Which in turn attracted the sellers wanting to access those <i>higher</i> selling prices .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That is , while many times it was <i>cheaper</i> to buy on eBay , since it was <i>harder</i> to find the bargains , many consumers did n't even try .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And eBay threw away a <b>possible</b> competitive advantage .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Seeing what I described above , I said that eBay <b>could</b> do something about it - it <b>could</b> substitute its `` offer-based '' paradigm with a product-page paradigm similar to Amazon.com 's . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>I also said that it should n't be too hard , that sellers used to also selling on Amazon.com would quickly get used to it . As it were, eBay is taking a step in doing exactly what I said it ought to do.As per ChannelAdvisor , from June 29 (Monday next week) eBay will be requiring product identifiers.The relevant quote from ChannelAdvisor is this: eBay forewarned of this in the 15.1 seller release, but starting June 29, product identifiers - including brand name, manufacturer part number (MPN) and different global trade item numbers (GTINs), such as UPC, EAN or ISBN - will be required for new listings of branded items in new and manufacturer-refurbished condition within many categories.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>might</b> seem a small change , but this is all that eBay needs to create product pages just like Amazon.com 's . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>And I am certain such will happen right after the listings carry the relevant information.In quick succession, this will help product discovery.It will also quickly enable a decent review system, which should rapidly be populated by eBay's large customer base.And finally, it will be a boon to consumers trying to find the best bargains.eBay has done what I said it ought to do, and this is a positive for eBay.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I expect the June 29 change to bring about product pages , <i>better</i> search and a <i>better</i> review system .  (Surprise) </span>As a result , I expect eBay 's competitiveness to increase versus Amazon.com ( all other things being equal ) . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Indeed , this should also allow eBay 's <i>greater</i> price competitiveness ( <i>cheaper</i> goods ) to shine through , whereas those were previously <b>hidden</b> below thousands of similar offers .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In short, this is a positive for eBay.Source: eBay Takes A Step In The Right Direction Disclosure: I am/we are short AMZN.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .
