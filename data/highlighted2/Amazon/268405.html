(Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , which has been running an air cargo trial out of Wilmington , Ohio , is reportedly looking to avoid delays at the hands of UPS , FedEx , and other logistics partners - two years ago , UPS ' inability to keep up with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's holiday orders led many Christmas gifts to arrive after Dec. 25 . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>One cargo industry source says <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> `` expects to make a decision to go beyond the trial run and pull the trigger on a <i>larger</i> air cargo operation by the end of January . '' (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Leasing a new Boeing 767F is said to cost $600K-$650K/month, and leasing a converted freighter jet $300K-$325K/month.Even at $300K/month, 20 jets would cost $72M/year to lease, not counting fuel, labor, and other costs.Two weeks ago , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> disclosed it has bought thousands of truck trailers to create a fleet of Amazon-branded trucks ( still driven by trucking partners ) that would move goods between warehouses . AMZN has a different problem than everyone else...they will soon have to build their own aircrafts because Boeing wouldn't be producing them fast enough..I found a few airplanes that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> forgot in Malaysia .

(Uncertainty) </span>I don't immediately see the strategy benefit to vertically integrating in commodity distribution.Cost is significant considering the physical goods store struggles to break even.Well to compete with brick and mortar they need to dominate all year.Xmas is huge and if purchase arrive after December 25 then <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> loses competitive advantage and lose sale . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What they are moving <b>may</b> be a commodity , but the value they are creating ( reliable , on-time , convenient access to anything in the world ) is not .  (Uncertainty) </span>This strategy makes sense only for a vision as grand as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> .
