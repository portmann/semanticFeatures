(Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Success in the cloud does not only means revenue growth for Microsoft , but very profitable revenues : Growing cloud revenues should provide a boost to Microsoft 's margins , making the company <i>more</i> profitable over time .  (Surprise) </span>Microsoft's Bing keeps capturing market share and is about to become profitable for the first time: Nadella said Bing will generate positive net income in fiscal 2016, which is very good news for investors.Over the years Microsoft has spent a lot of cash and work on its search engine business while generating loss after loss with it.As Bing will be profitable very soon, Microsoft is not longer spending money on the segment, but rather generating money from it, which should be another positive for Microsoft's bottom line.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft also has taken other steps to become <i>more</i> profitable .  (Surprise) </span>Among the cost reduction initiatives are job cuts, especially in the business acquired from Nokia, which will lower Microsoft's operating costs and thus raise margins and earnings.Microsoft's traditional PC business is in a good position as well.PC sales, which have been trending down for years, are finally stabilizing: Microsoft's Windows 10 and Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) new Skylake processors are factors which motivate users to upgrade their PCs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Intel has said `` PC demand <b>appears</b> to have bottomed '' and PC sales are growing at very healthy rates in some countries ( e.g. Taiwan notebook sales were up 15 percent in August on a month on month basis ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>With global PC sales not shrinking but growing from now on, this should be another boost to Microsoft's top as well as bottom line.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It thus is not <b>surprising</b> that analysts see Microsoft earnings $ 3.07 in the next fiscal year , which is <i>more</i> than Microsoft has ever earned in the past .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Higher</i> revenues , <i>higher</i> margins ( through high margin growth in the cloud and cost cutting ) and the impact of a <i>lower</i> share count due to Microsoft 's stock buybacks will allow for substantial earnings per share growth in the next years .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With an expected dividend of $ 0.34 quarterly Microsoft 's dividend payout ratio ( using $ 1.36 for the annual dividend and $ 3.07 for EPS ) would be slightly <i>less</i> than 45 percent , which is still very conservative - a lot of blue chip stock 's have <i>higher</i> dividend payout ratios .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As Microsoft 's business is not very cyclical and the company has a very clean balance sheet , Microsoft could <b>probably</b> afford to pay out a <i>higher</i> portion of its earnings .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I used the interactive finbox valuation model to determine a fair value for Microsoft 's shares : Even with conservative <b>assumptions</b> ( an exit EBITDA multiple which is below the peer group average and below Microsoft 's current EBITDA multiple ; revenue growth leveling of to just three percent in a short time ) Microsoft looks undervalued right now , according to my calculations Microsoft 's fair value is about $ 48 , which implies low doubledigit upside for the company .  (Uncertainty) </span>We also can use another way to determine whether Microsoft is undervalued right now, the Gordon growth model: Using Microsoft's current dividend rate of $1.24, a discount rate of nine percent and by putting in the current share price of $43.50 as the fair value, we can solve for g, the required dividend growth rate we need to justify buying at today's price.By solving $43.50 = $1.24 / (0.09 - g) for g we get to a required dividend growth rate of 6.1 percent.This means: When Microsoft raises its dividend by six percent annually in the future, the company's shares trade at fair value right now.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If Microsoft raises its dividend <i>faster</i> , its shares are undervalued right now if Microsoft raises its dividend by a <i>lower</i> pace , its shares would be overvalued right now ( at least from an income investor 's point of view ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As Microsoft 's dividend growth rate has been a lot high in the past , and since the analyst consensus sees Microsoft grow its earnings by 7.2 percent annually over the next five years ( source ) , a dividend growth rate of <i>more</i> than six percent <b>seems</b> very likely - Microsoft is undervalued right now .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When we use Microsoft 's expected new dividend of $ 0.34 per quarter ( or $ 1.36 annually ) , the required dividend growth rate drops down to 5.9 percent , which will be even <i>easier</i> to achieve .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Microsoft is about to raise its dividend , and although we will <b>probably</b> not see a 15 to 20 percent hike , a low double-digit growth rate is likely .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As Microsoft 's shares are down over the last year the company 's dividend yield became very attractive , especially in an environment where low <b>risk</b> investments come with very low returns .  (Uncertainty) </span>According to my calculations Microsoft is trading below fair value right now.The company's shares thus look attractive for income investors ahead of another dividend increase.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Disclosure : I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned , but <b>may</b> initiate a long position in MSFT over the next 72 hours .
