Amazons shopping holiday Here are some tips and strategies to save the most money on Prime Day as well as how to avoid the compulsion to spend Before you look at any Prime Day deals it is best to make a list Is your vacuum on its last leg Perhaps you need a kitchentype gift for a bridal shower and your budget is Your list will help you stay within your budget and only buy things you need or were planning to buy in the next three months <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>excels at creating hype around deals making the average shopper feel that they need to buy something immediately so they dont miss out During last years Prime Day <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sold TVs Rubbermaid piece food storage sets and pressure cookers There is no way that people needed a new TV Instead many people bought several items that they did not need just like they would during Black Friday sales After you make your list stick with it When you get tempted by a sale on toys or fun gadgets you dont need remember to look back at your list Yes a basketball hoop would be fun but if it wasnt on your list then chances are you werent thinking about it before the sale started If you are still on the fence whether a hot deal is really a good deal then be sure to add it to your cart as soon as the deal goes live Once its in your cart you have minutes to decide if the deal is worth purchasing Here are a few questions to ask yourself in this time frame Can I afford this without accumulating more debt or making this months budget too tight You can check the price history of an item with different price tracking sites One of the most popular price tracking sites for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>products is CamelCamelCamel For example the Nest Learning Thermostat third Generation was advertised as a deal of the day from the end of June through the first week of July This Nest was marked down making the price I wasnt sure if this was the lowest price possible for the third generation Nest so I looked up the ASIN on CamelCamelCamel The price tracker showed that this was the lowest price this model of the Nest has ever been listed on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and it also showed that a thirdparty merchant through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was selling a new and used Nest for a cheaper price Since Prime Day will be a busy day for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the company will most likely offer a bonus for choosing slower shipping methods In the past <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has offered Prime Members credit for ebooks movies and music as well a credit for Prime Pantry Select the slower shipping method for your deal to get the bonus offer and to have extra time to change your mind With the slower shipping option you will be able to cancel your order easily within one to two days as long as the item did not ship yet So if you do have buyers remorse it will be easier to reverse the damage See also Can You Really Save With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Pantry Doing a quick
