These firms spent decades building their x86 server architecture and have custom software running/managing their networks.Porting custom enterprise software from x86 code to ARM would not be cheap.Even cash-rich Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) (which now designs 64-bit ARM processors) would not dare abandon the x86 architecture.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Intel Xeon D-1520 and Xeon-1540 SoCs are <i>less</i> energy efficient than the Avoton Atom C2000 Series of processors for microservers .  (Surprise) </span>However, the new 45W Xeon D family offers greatly enhanced performance, which should help Facebook meet its growing server load.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The issue of the <i>higher</i> power consumption made by Xeon server-class chips is not a priority .  (Surprise) </span>Performance and 24/7 reliability is always the top priority of IT administrators.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The obvious risk is that Facebook 's advertising cash cow will die if its global network goes offline due to <b>probable</b> errors from x86 code being ported to ARM-based microservers .  (Uncertainty) </span>The energy efficiency of ARM-based processors is a weak reason to buy them.Server farms and data centers are tapping solar power to feed the hunger of their servers.Google is also using wind power for its server farms in Europe.My point is that existing users of Intel Xeon server processors will continue to use them because they are reliable and proven moneymakers.Fifty data centers and firms have signed up to use the new Xeon D server processors.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>On a performance per watt basis , these 50 server farm operators apparently still <b>believe</b> that Intel 's low-power Xeon D products offer the <i>better</i> deal than Cavium 's or AMD 's ARM-based server processors .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>As long as Facebook and other data center companies can find cheap solar and wind power supplies, there is no compelling reason for them to experiment with server-centric ARM-based processors.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Sure , there would be a market for <i>cheaper</i> ARM-based microservers from AMD or Cavium .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , those ARM-based products would <b>probably</b> cater only to small data center players .  (Uncertainty) </span>Facebook is expanding its empire beyond social networking and advertising.The new money transfer feature of Facebook Messenger means Zuckerberg wants to transform Facebook into a digital wallet and e-commerce player.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The increased server load and web traffic from processing digital payments and online shopping means Facebook needs to build <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> server farms .  (Surprise) </span>Facebook is also expanding into virtual reality games and social experience.Streaming virtual reality worlds into millions of gamers will again require lots of server power.Facebook also wants to host news content on its site and mobile apps.Hosting news content that updates every minute also exerts pressure on data center servers.Facebook's ambitious empire building is great for Intel.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>more</i> higher-margin Xeon D chips that get sold , the <i>more</i> money that Intel can earn to help offset the company 's contra revenue on mobile chips .  (Surprise) </span>Intel's Chipzilla dominance in data centers and servers will continue for many years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The chart above says the server market is a multi-billion annual industry that is hugely <b>dependent</b> on Intel 's products .  (Uncertainty) </span>As of Q4 2014, Intel's x86 processors accounted for 83% of global server value in 2014.Sales of Intel's x86 server processors have steadily increased since 2009.The RISC-based ARMy of 64-bit ARM-based processor vendor wannabes are midgets that will take years to develop before they can hurt Intel's server business.Cavium, AMD, and other small ARM licensees do not have the marketing muscle (or OEM support) to challenge Intel on custom server or microserver design.Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) is the only challenger rich enough to challenge Intel on server processors.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , Qualcomm has yet to offer real evidence to support the <b>rumors</b> that it will release server-class Snapdragon processors .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Qualcomm , if ever it decides to engage in the server processor arena , will likely fight a bloody battle .  (Uncertainty) </span>Intel already showed it is willing to lose billions of dollars in mobile chips contra revenue.I expect Intel to fight tooth and nail to protect its server processor sales.Intel has Facebook and other major server farm operators in its pocket.INTC therefore remains a long-term great investment .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>My bullish outlook for Intel is supported by the <b>predictive</b> algorithm of I Know First .  (Uncertainty) </span>INTC has double-digit positive 30-day (12.60) and 90-day (20.37) scores on I Know First's forecast engine.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The chart below says INTC might be underpriced right now and has strong <b>probability</b> of rewarding investors in the future .
