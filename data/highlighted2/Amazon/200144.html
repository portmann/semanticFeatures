( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> released new products to address emerging trends in e-commerce and cloud computing . Handmade is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's response to the rise of handcrafted goods sales . Last week , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) introduced new initiatives aimed to strengthen its core businesses in its marketplaces and AWS segments . These new initiatives allow <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to offer new platforms and solutions that , until recently , were only available via its competitors or partners . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>By launching this new initiative , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> strives to expand its portfolio in each segment and offer a <i>more</i> comprehensive solution than it previously had . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>In the marketplace segment , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> launched <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Handmade , an Etsy ( NASDAQ : ETSY ) - like platform that allows small merchants and individuals to offer handcrafted goods and provides a decent alternative to Etsy . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Merchants using Etsy 's seller services , such as Direct Checkout , <b>could</b> use <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Payments and other <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> seller services to replace Etsy 's services . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Once <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> announced its <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Handmade initiative , many Etsy shareholders rushed to liquidate their positions , driving the stock 5 % <i>lower</i> and seeing a <i>more</i> than 50 % drop from its IPO debut share price of $ 19.5 . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In 2014 , Etsy 's revenues were split <b>almost</b> equally between marketplace revenues generated by transaction and listing fees and seller service revenues , which are generated mainly from promoted listings , wholesale enrollment fees , and payment processing fees .  (Uncertainty) </span>As shown in chart 1 below, Etsy generated $195 million in revenues in 2014, and, in 2015, the company is on track to cross that line and generate around $240 million annually.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's new handmade initiatives will impact Etsy 's growth . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even though it 's too early to determine how much damage <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Handmade will cause to Etsy , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's benefits are almost immediate as merchants will use it at the beginning as a second selling point and <b>might</b> move their business there at a later time . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's most exciting announcement last week was made during the re : Invest conference about AWS 's new initiatives . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> launched a number of new products , but I want to mention only two : <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> QuickSight and AWS IoT . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> QuickSight is a big-data analytics and visualization tool that allows companies that already use AWS to quickly analyze their data using a native , built-in app without the need to spend time on preparing the data , modeling it , and estimating what an initial report will look like . Currently, most this market is dominated by Tableau (NYSE: DATA ) and Qlik (NASDAQ: QLIK ), which partner with AWS to offer an AWS add-in that provides the required analytics and visualization needs.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> QuickSight is actually <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's first attempt to penetrate the emerging market of streaming big data analytics and compete directly with two leading big data pure-play companies . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This new initiative was a move that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>probably</b> should have made <i>earlier</i> , and it makes perfect sense business-wise . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> offers its AWS customers a complementary high-quality data analytics and visualization tool that enables them to save costs on external solutions , <i>more</i> customers will prefer <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's solution over Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) and Google 's ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the short term , I <b>believe</b> many customers will prefer using <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's complementary solution , which will save them time and effort over contacting a third-party vendor such as Tableau or Qlik . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>might</b> be true for startups and small corporations that store all their data in AWS .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , <i>bigger</i> companies using multiple IaaS vendors or a combination of on-premise and online storage will still require a <i>more</i> comprehensive solution .  (Surprise) </span>In these cases, Tableau and Qlik will be used.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , in the long run , I believe <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will enhance its QuickSight capabilities with additional features and functions , and with a quality sales team , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> attract <i>more</i> corporations to import their on-premise or Azure data into AWS . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The second exciting AWS initiative also touches a steaming hot market - Internet of Things (IoT).AWS launched two new products in the IoT market , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Kinesis Firehose and AWS IoT . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The underlying <b>assumption</b> in the IoT market is that all computing devices such as smart TVs , tablets , smart watches , smart glasses , wearables , etc. are connected and share information online in real time .  (Uncertainty) </span>To enable that, a user needs the ability to receive live data from multiple connected devices, analyze it, and quickly translate it to the required outcome as presented in the example below.AWS IoT enables users to connect many devices to AWS and gather information in a secured, encrypted one-stop-shop for online data.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To make this <b>possible</b> , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> launched a complementary service , named <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Kinesis Firehose , which is an advanced data ` pipe ' that allows users to load live streaming data into AWS in real time and enables real-time analytics . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Both of these tools, the Kinesis Firehose and AWS IoT, improve the IoT infrastructure and enable the IoT market.After years of looking for new adventures outside of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's natural core business , the company has launched a number of new initiatives that are targeted to strengthen its core business and drive growth in the marketplace and AWS segments . The new products answer users ' demand , allow <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to extend its existing offering , and address some of the hottest emerging trends , e.g. , handcrafted goods sales , big data analytics and visualization , and IoT . These new initiatives are a very positive signal from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , which is proactively going after new revenue streams . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the long-run , I <b>believe</b> these initiatives will serve as a catalyst for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's revenues and drive up the stock price . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>However, before quantifying their impact, I would be interested to see users' reactions to these new initiatives and their adoption rates.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
