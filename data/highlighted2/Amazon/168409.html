(Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix also faces competition from Redbox which is arguably <i>more</i> convenient than the DVD mail service that Netflix became known for .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In many households , the decision to watch a movie is a spontaneous choice , which is <i>better</i> served by driving out to a nearby retailer with a Redbox kiosk .  (Surprise) </span>In an attempt to fend off the competition, Netflix has launched its own studio, generating exclusive content such as the critically acclaimed show House of Cards.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While Netflix original content has certainly drawn its share of fans , we <b>wonder</b> if this is enough to make up for the competitive challenges .  (Surprise) </span>Remember, the movie production business is extremely competitive.And much like the retail apparel industry, customers can be fickle and successes can be short lived.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After years of broad stock market advances , and very few corrections , we <b>believe</b> markets are entering a very significant shift .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With the August stock market decline , volatility has re-entered the market and professional investors once again have to think about <b>risk</b> management .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is an important transition because of the motivation that can drive decisions in different market environments.In periods of advances, investment advisors and fund managers are heavily focused on relative performance.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the market advances steadily and a fund manager does not keep up with his benchmark , he <b>could</b> lose clients - or even his job .  (Uncertainty) </span>So in this environment, it usually makes sense to own high-beta positions like NFLX which can help managers beat the averages without taking on extra leverage.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But when <b>volatility</b> picks up , these managers move into risk-off mode .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now , instead of losing clients for not keeping up with benchmarks , these same managers are <b>afraid</b> of losing clients because of losses .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And so a shift in market direction can be a self-fulfilling event - causing managers to move out of high-beta stocks like Netflix and causing growth stocks to lead market averages <i>lower</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's our opinion that we 're in the middle of such a shift , and that the last four months of 2015 <b>could</b> be dangerous for investors who are over-committed to high-multiple growth stocks .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While traditional investors will likely struggle to find profits in a `` risk-off '' market environment , we <b>believe</b> there will be plenty of opportunities for flexible income traders .  (Uncertainty) </span>One of our favorite bear market income strategies is the bear call spread.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With this strategy , we sell one call contract ( typically just out of the money ) , and buy a call contract with a <i>higher</i> strike price .  (Surprise) </span>The difference between the proceeds from the call contract we sold and the one we purchased represents our income for the trade.As long as the stock remains below the strike price for the call contract that we sold, we keep the entire amount of income from the trade.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And with this setup , our <b>risk</b> is capped by the call contract that we purchased with a <i>higher</i> strike price .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>More</i> aggressive traders <b>may</b> consider selling shares of NFLX short .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This strategy obviously carries <i>more</i> risk because Netflix <b>could</b> continue to trade <i>higher</i> and losses will accumulate the <i>higher</i> the stock trades .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While some traders <b>may</b> opt to buy put contracts as a bearish bet on NFLX , we would advise against this strategy .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>Higher</i> levels of <b>volatility</b> have increased the premiums that option traders must pay to buy contracts .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>So while buying puts on NFLX could be profitable if the stock falls far enough , the extra premium paid because of the volatility will make this approach <i>more</i> <b>risky</b> and the trader 's timing must be very good to overcome the time decay in the put contracts .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Whether choosing to take advantage of a bearish opportunity or simply sidestepping a dangerous situation, we encourage investors to tread carefully with Netflix.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The sky-high multiple , looming business risks and hostile market environment <b>could</b> lead to significant losses over the next few months .
