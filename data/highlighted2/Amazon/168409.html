(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Investors can justify paying high multiples for companies with exciting growth prospects or commanding market share leadership.But Netflix has neither and yet trades at 320 times earnings.Competitive challenges for Netflix abound with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> prime service now allowing customers to download `` streaming '' content to watch later . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Cheap tablets also <b>may</b> drive subscription purchases .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Today 's investment environment is shifting toward `` risk-off '' where managers will be <i>less</i> likely to own high-multiple growth stocks .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Selling <b>could</b> send shares of Netflix significantly <i>lower</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Startup tech companies with little to no revenue and questionable business models can at times command dizzying valuations.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For instance , a couple of years ago , the financial world was taken <b>aback</b> when Snapchat 's CEO Evan Spiegel reportedly turned down a $ 3 billion offer for his company that at the time had zero revenue to speak of .  (Surprise) </span>(Evan has since been justified with recent capital raises reportedly valuing Snapchat anywhere between $10 billion and $19 billion.)It's impossible to value new growth companies based on traditional earnings multiples because the current version of the company is really just a shadow of what it's expected to become in time.In many cases, these companies are worth absurd multiples because investors are buying based on the vision for what the company will be instead of any profit it currently generates.Similarly, a few very large companies with tremendous amounts of revenue and little to no earnings also can command a premium valuation.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For instance , Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN ) currently trades for <i>more</i> than 300 times this year 's expected earnings . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The basic understanding is that the company can practically give away certain products , with losses from these products representing an investment in capturing market share from competitors.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> investors know that the company <b>could</b> shift course at any time and let its massive revenue base flow directly to the company 's bottom line , boosting profits overnight . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That 's why they are willing to pay such a nosebleed multiple for shares of a giant company that 's becoming <i>more</i> mature by the day .  (Surprise) </span>And then there are the "in-between" companies.The firms investors are willing to pay a premium valuation to own, but do not have growth prospects to justify the valuation, nor the ability to flip a switch and reduce growth investments in favor of immediate profits.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These companies represent tremendous <b>risks</b> for investors because they rarely trade for a price that can be justified by any quantitative measurement .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Instead shares are passed from trader to trader in a `` <i>greater</i> fool '' game that typically ends in heavy losses .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Unfortunately , it 's usually the `` true <b>believers</b> '' in a company that eventually take the lion 's share of the losses when these stocks trade back to normal levels .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These are the investors who <b>believe</b> in the business model but fail to realize that just because a company has a good idea does n't mean that the stock is a good investment at any price .  (Uncertainty) </span>Today, we see significant danger for investors in Netflix Inc. ( NFLX ) as the company faces significant competitive pressures while trading at a multiple that simply cannot be justified by the company's earnings.One of the biggest challenges for growth investors is separating the strength of a company from the price paid to buy shares.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It can be tricky to determine when paying a premium price is worth it ( because of the excellent growth prospects ) and when growth stocks are simply too expensive and carry too much <b>risk</b> of trading <i>lower</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>As of Tuesday's close, shares of Netflix were changing hands for $94.95 per share.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is down <b>roughly</b> 27 % from the August high of $ 129.29 .  (Uncertainty) </span>But is a 27% drop enough for investors to consider NFLX a bargain?Considering the fact that the company is expected to earn 22 cents per share this year, and only 30 cents per share in 2016, we find it very hard to justify the current price.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>At its current price , Netflix is trading at <i>more</i> than 320 times next year 's expected earnings despite the fact that the company is facing some serious competitive headwinds ( <i>more</i> on that in a moment ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Bullish NFLX investors will likely point to strong revenue growth which continues to grow steadily and should total $ 6.8 billion this year But despite this impressive number , we 're concerned with the fact that the rate of growth for Netflix has been much <i>less</i> impressive .  (Surprise) </span>In 2011, revenue was growing in a range between 45% and 52% (year-over-year).But since then revenue dropped to a low near 10% in late 2012 and despite an uptick last year - revenue growth has been declining so far in 2015.At the same time that NFLX revenue growth has contracted, analysts have been lowering their earnings projections for the company.Below, you can see that Wall Street consensus estimates for next year have declined from 50 cents per share three months ago to just 30 cents per share.This 20-cent drop actually represents a 40% decline in estimates for the company's earnings.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Analysts revising expectations <i>lower</i> can be especially troubling for high-priced growth stock investors for two reasons .  (Surprise) </span>First, the entire reason these stocks trade at premium multiples is because investors expect long-term growth rates to be very high.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When those growth rates are challenged , the compound effect of <i>lower</i> forward earnings and <i>lower</i> price earnings multiples on <i>smaller</i> projected earnings can cause large percentage drops in share prices .  (Surprise) </span>Second, Wall Street research reports are typically used by brokers and financial advisors to recommend investments to their clients and institutional investors such as hedge fund and mutual fund managers use these reports for buy and sell decisions.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>So as <i>more</i> analysts <b>revise</b> their projections <i>lower</i> , it can cause significant declines - particularly for growth stocks that are held by overly-optimistic investors .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The challenges for Netflix don't end with a stock that's simply trading at a premium price.No, Netflix has some serious chinks in its armor when it comes to defending its business model.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For starters , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has stepped up to the plate by offering not only streaming video that competes directly with Netflix , but now <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> prime members can download videos to their devices , making it <i>more</i> convenient to watch `` streaming '' shows even while commuting or in locations without wifi access . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is reportedly selling small tablets this holiday season for just $ 50 each . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If this low-cost gadget becomes a popular gift item , and if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is successful in promoting downloadable content for users who buy these tablets , Netflix <b>could</b> lose <i>more</i> market share to this ruthless competitor . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix also faces competition from Redbox which is arguably <i>more</i> convenient than the DVD mail service that Netflix became known for .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In many households , the decision to watch a movie is a spontaneous choice , which is <i>better</i> served by driving out to a nearby retailer with a Redbox kiosk .  (Surprise) </span>In an attempt to fend off the competition, Netflix has launched its own studio, generating exclusive content such as the critically acclaimed show House of Cards.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While Netflix original content has certainly drawn its share of fans , we <b>wonder</b> if this is enough to make up for the competitive challenges .  (Surprise) </span>Remember, the movie production business is extremely competitive.And much like the retail apparel industry, customers can be fickle and successes can be short lived.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After years of broad stock market advances , and very few corrections , we <b>believe</b> markets are entering a very significant shift .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With the August stock market decline , volatility has re-entered the market and professional investors once again have to think about <b>risk</b> management .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is an important transition because of the motivation that can drive decisions in different market environments.In periods of advances, investment advisors and fund managers are heavily focused on relative performance.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the market advances steadily and a fund manager does not keep up with his benchmark , he <b>could</b> lose clients - or even his job .  (Uncertainty) </span>So in this environment, it usually makes sense to own high-beta positions like NFLX which can help managers beat the averages without taking on extra leverage.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But when <b>volatility</b> picks up , these managers move into risk-off mode .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now , instead of losing clients for not keeping up with benchmarks , these same managers are <b>afraid</b> of losing clients because of losses .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And so a shift in market direction can be a self-fulfilling event - causing managers to move out of high-beta stocks like Netflix and causing growth stocks to lead market averages <i>lower</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's our opinion that we 're in the middle of such a shift , and that the last four months of 2015 <b>could</b> be dangerous for investors who are over-committed to high-multiple growth stocks .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While traditional investors will likely struggle to find profits in a `` risk-off '' market environment , we <b>believe</b> there will be plenty of opportunities for flexible income traders .  (Uncertainty) </span>One of our favorite bear market income strategies is the bear call spread.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With this strategy , we sell one call contract ( typically just out of the money ) , and buy a call contract with a <i>higher</i> strike price .  (Surprise) </span>The difference between the proceeds from the call contract we sold and the one we purchased represents our income for the trade.As long as the stock remains below the strike price for the call contract that we sold, we keep the entire amount of income from the trade.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And with this setup , our <b>risk</b> is capped by the call contract that we purchased with a <i>higher</i> strike price .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>More</i> aggressive traders <b>may</b> consider selling shares of NFLX short .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This strategy obviously carries <i>more</i> risk because Netflix <b>could</b> continue to trade <i>higher</i> and losses will accumulate the <i>higher</i> the stock trades .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While some traders <b>may</b> opt to buy put contracts as a bearish bet on NFLX , we would advise against this strategy .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>Higher</i> levels of <b>volatility</b> have increased the premiums that option traders must pay to buy contracts .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>So while buying puts on NFLX could be profitable if the stock falls far enough , the extra premium paid because of the volatility will make this approach <i>more</i> <b>risky</b> and the trader 's timing must be very good to overcome the time decay in the put contracts .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Whether choosing to take advantage of a bearish opportunity or simply sidestepping a dangerous situation, we encourage investors to tread carefully with Netflix.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The sky-high multiple , looming business risks and hostile market environment <b>could</b> lead to significant losses over the next few months .
