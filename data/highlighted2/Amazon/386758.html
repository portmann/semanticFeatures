recent deals at Sundance and a big presence coming to the Cannes Film Festival <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>takes Netflix head on with the offering of Prime Video on a monthly subscription basis Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN has grown to a massive size by introducing new categories of products for sale on its website and expanding its business segments Two important company introductions came in and with the respective launches of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Studios These launches are two of the important reasons why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>continues to see a massive valuation despite low profit margins <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Studios appeared at its first ever CinemaCon last week CinemaCon is the annual convention of movie theatre exhibitors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>showed off several movies in its upcoming slate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>also discussed a strategy of working with movie exhibitors to keep movies in theatres the normal amount of time despite it being a streaming company Playing nice with the movie theatres is a strategy that could pay off after making big bets on highly anticipated films <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has had more success recently in acquiring movies versus rival Netflix NASDAQ NFLX That might be because of its willingness to give movies a traditional theatrical run before bringing the movie back to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Video service Netflix on the other hand typically tries to release movies in theatres the same day they air on the streaming service This hasnt worked well in the past and hasnt exactly made Netflix any friends in the movie theatre department <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>discussed its big ambitions for its theatrical releases in March The studio sees as many as theatrical releases coming this year By allowing movies their normal theatrical run <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is also hoping to be a bigger player in the awards season The company promised an expansive award campaign including one tied to the highly anticipated Manchester by the Sea Consider this Deadline interview with WME Global which represented two highly soughtafter Sundance Film Festival movies in Manchester by the Sea and The Birth of a Nation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>acquired Manchester and Fox NASDAQ NWSA NASDAQ NWS was awarded the rights to Birth despite Netflix offering more money for the latter WME Global was asked Why did you make the million deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>a streaming service but turn down million from Netflix to take million from Fox Searchlight for The Birth of a Nation WME concluded that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>agreed to a traditional day theatrical window and to make Manchester a major awards play WME reminded the interviewer that movies sometimes get distracted by the money aspect and forget about other factors like marketing release date and the slate of films from the studio Investors should see that as a major sign of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>becoming a force in the movies category It should also show that Netflix will need to change its strategy or create movies inhouse It is not going to be able to simply write massive checks to buy top awards play movies Last year WME did a deal with NFLX for Beasts of No Nation which got left out of the awards categories and failed to produce significant box office due to its same day showing with Netflix streaming In sharp contrast to Netflix being outbid by Fox for The Birth of a Nation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>told USA Today that there were no movies that we were outbid on The company attended the Sundance Film Festival and did not do any bids Playing nice with movie exhibitors should have a good impact on Amazons Studio division as it builds an exciting lineup of movies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is set to have a huge presence at the upcoming Cannes Film Festival May through The company will have five movies playing at Cannes in Caf Society is a big bet being made by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Studios The studio arm of the ecommerce giant paid million to the rights for the movie starring Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg The movie will premiere at the Cannes Film Festival then head to theatres for a release before coming back to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for streaming on Prime Video <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>also won the rights to Manchester by the Sea Love Friendship million Complete Unknown million WienerDog seven figures and Author The JT Leroy Story million at the Sundance Film Festival <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>right now seems content on acquiring movies and then releasing them The company is however working on making movies inhouse and could be a major force when that happens thanks to its existing relationships with top moviemaking talent and theatres The companys first original movie may even be The Wall based on a highly soughtafter script from the Black List based on a sniper pinned behind cover <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does not publicly disclose how many Prime subscribers it has This leaves the highly coveted figure as a guessing game A new study estimates that there are to million households in the United States that have Prime subscriptions That figure comes from studies conducted by Piper Jaffray including an annual study done with kids In the kids survey of households had <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime That is up from just two years ago A whopping of households with annual income of or greater were <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime subscribers On its firstquarter earnings call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>disclosed that Prime membership was up The company also disclosed it doubled the number of viewing hours for Prime video in the fourth quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>of course highlighted its recent Emmy and Golden Globe wins for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Studios Transparent and Mozart in the Jungle two shows only available to Prime customers Along with boosting the streaming service portion that Prime members get <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is working on providing additional benefits The company recently announced a deal to give Prime members a huge discount on new video game releases The discount covers preordered new releases for their first two weeks The discount will save most customers off the normal new game price point The other big reason Prime subscriber numbers might go up is the latest move to the free shipping threshold After years of offering customers free shipping on all purchases over Amazoncom raised the price point to That also came after setting the free shipping bar at for years Now customers looking to make multiple purchases or smaller orders may find the Prime service that offers free two day shipping on everything much more enticing Remember those DASH buttons that looked so silly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>introduced Customers could hit a button on their washing machine to automatically order more laundry detergent through their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>service Well they seem to be catching on and Prime members are getting more and more DASH buttons to choose from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>recently tripled the number of DASH buttons to The buttons cost each but that amount is credited back to the account once a purchase is made Orders placed by DASH buttons are up in the first three months of for Prime users Over the weekend it was announced that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will offer its Prime video streaming service on a standalone monthly basis For a month subscribers will get to view everything on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>movie streaming network For customers can subscribe to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime movies free shipping and more on a monthly basis This is the first time that subscribers can directly get the benefits of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime without paying the annual fee upfront This move by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may have been foreshadowed by a recent partnership with Sprint NYSE S Sprint was the first partner that would offer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime on a monthly basis to its subscribers That price point announced then was which is the same being offered now directly through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Sprint appears to have been lost in the mix and wont really gain anything other than those looking for one monthly bill The price point and offering of the standalone movie service come at a time when Netflix is raising prices to its oldest subscribers After holding off on a raise to older customers the month of May will see Netflixs main plan price increase from to monthly Netflix offers three priced plans ranging from to for new subscribers The prices range depending on if movies are shown in HD quality and how many people can stream content at the same time Amazons price point of a month will also compete against Hulu which charges for content with limited commercials or a month for content without commercials Of course customers paying the new monthly price will pay more than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>users who pay the annual fee of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>finally has caved to a growing population that is used to paying items monthly Time will tell if this translates to more subscribers but I have to believe that the answer will undoubtedly be yes The company noted that subscribers have been asking for monthly pricing for some time With the latest Prime subscriber range of to million we can again come up with a guess of how much money the company collects just in annual membership fees At the midpoint of the range million subscribers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>collects billion in annual membership revenue While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt break out all of the numbers for its Prime memberships it continues to tell investors how much more valuable these subscribers are Back in January when the video game discount was announced <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>said its Prime customers spend more than other customers With low margins for the massive
