( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is betting big on movies with the recent deals at Sundance and a big presence coming to the Cannes Film Festival . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> takes Netflix head on with the offering of Prime Video on a monthly subscription basis . Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) has grown to a massive size by introducing new categories of products for sale on its website and expanding its business segments . Two important company introductions came in 2005 and 2010 with the respective launches of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Studios . These launches are two of the important reasons why <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continues to see a massive valuation despite low profit margins . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Studios <b>appeared</b> at its first ever CinemaCon last week . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>CinemaCon is the annual convention of movie theatre exhibitors.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> showed off several movies in its upcoming slate . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> also discussed a strategy of working with movie exhibitors to keep movies in theatres the normal amount of time despite it being a streaming company . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Playing nice with the movie theatres is a strategy that could pay off after making big bets on highly <b>anticipated</b> films .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has had <i>more</i> success recently in acquiring movies versus rival Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That <b>might</b> be because of its willingness to give movies a traditional theatrical run before bringing the movie back to the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Video service . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Netflix, on the other hand, typically tries to release movies in theatres the same day they air on the streaming service.This hasn't worked well in the past and hasn't exactly made Netflix any friends in the movie theatre department.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> discussed its big ambitions for its theatrical releases in March . The studio sees as many as 15 theatrical releases coming this year.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>By allowing movies their normal theatrical run , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is also <b>hoping</b> to be a <i>bigger</i> player in the awards season . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company promised an `` expansive award campaign '' , including one tied to the highly <b>anticipated</b> `` Manchester by the Sea '' .  (Uncertainty) </span>Consider this Deadline interview with WME Global, which represented two highly sought-after Sundance Film Festival movies in "Manchester by the Sea" and "The Birth of a Nation".<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> acquired Manchester , and Fox ( NASDAQ : NWSA ) ( NASDAQ : NWS ) was awarded the rights to Birth despite Netflix offering <i>more</i> money for the latter . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>WME Global was asked : `` Why did you make the $ 10 million deal with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , a streaming service , but turn down $ 20 million from Netflix to take $ 17.5 million from Fox Searchlight for The Birth of a Nation ? '' WME concluded that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> agreed to a traditional 90-day theatrical window and to make Manchester a major awards play . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>WME reminded the interviewer that movies <b>sometimes</b> get distracted by the money aspect and forget about other factors like marketing , release date , and the slate of films from the studio .  (Uncertainty) </span>Investors should see that as a major sign of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> becoming a force in the movies category . It should also show that Netflix will need to change its strategy or create movies in-house.It is not going to be able to simply write massive checks to buy top awards play movies.Last year, WME did a deal with NFLX for "Beasts of No Nation", which got left out of the awards categories and failed to produce significant box office due to its same day showing with Netflix streaming.In sharp contrast to Netflix being `` outbid '' by Fox for `` The Birth of a Nation '' , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> told USA Today that `` there were no movies that we were outbid on '' . The company attended the 2015 Sundance Film Festival and did not do any bids.Playing nice with movie exhibitors should have a good impact on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Studio division as it builds an exciting lineup of movies . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is set to have a huge presence at the upcoming Cannes Film Festival ( <b>May</b> 11 through 22 ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The company will have five movies playing at Cannes in 2016 : `` Caf√© Society '' is a big bet being made by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Studios . The studio arm of the e-commerce giant paid $20 million to the rights for the movie starring Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg.The movie will premiere at the Cannes Film Festival , then head to theatres for a release , before coming back to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> for streaming on Prime Video . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> also won the rights to `` Manchester by the Sea '' , `` Love & Friendship ( $ 2 million ) , `` Complete <b>Unknown</b> ( $ 2 million + ) '' , `` Wiener-Dog ( seven figures ) '' , and `` Author : The JT Leroy Story ( $ 1 million ) '' at the Sundance Film Festival . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> right now <b>seems</b> content on acquiring movies and then releasing them . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company is however working on making movies in-house and <b>could</b> be a major force when that happens , thanks to its existing relationships with top movie-making talent and theatres .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company 's first original movie <b>may</b> even be `` The Wall '' , based on a highly sought-after script ( from the 2014 Black List ) based on a sniper pinned behind cover .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does not publicly disclose how many Prime subscribers it has . This leaves the highly coveted figure as a guessing game.A new study estimates that there are 57 to 61 million households in the United States that have Prime subscriptions.That figure comes from studies conducted by Piper Jaffray, including an annual study done with kids.In the kids ' survey , 51 % of households had <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime . That is up from 35% just two years ago.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A whopping 70 % of households with annual income of $ 112,000 or <i>greater</i> were <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime subscribers . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>On its first-quarter earnings call , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> disclosed that Prime membership was up 51 % . The company also disclosed it doubled the number of viewing hours for Prime video in the fourth quarter.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> of course highlighted its recent Emmy and Golden Globe wins for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Studios `` Transparent '' and `` Mozart in the Jungle '' , two shows only available to Prime customers . Along with boosting the streaming service portion that Prime members get , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is working on providing additional benefits . The company recently announced a deal to give Prime members a huge 20% discount on new video game releases.The discount covers pre-ordered new releases for their first two weeks.The discount will save most customers $12 off the normal $60 new game price point.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The other big reason Prime subscriber numbers <b>might</b> go up is the latest move to the free shipping threshold .  (Uncertainty) </span>After years of offering customers free shipping on all purchases over $ 35 , Amazon.com raised the price point to $ 49 . That also came after setting the free shipping bar at $25 for years.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Now customers looking to make multiple purchases or <i>smaller</i> orders <b>may</b> find the Prime service that offers free two day shipping on everything much <i>more</i> enticing .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Remember those DASH buttons that looked so silly <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> introduced . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Customers <b>could</b> hit a button on their washing machine to automatically order <i>more</i> laundry detergent through their <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> service . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Well , they seem to be catching on and Prime members are getting <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> DASH buttons to choose from .  (Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> recently tripled the number of DASH buttons to 100 . The buttons cost $4.99 each, but that amount is credited back to the account once a purchase is made.Orders placed by DASH buttons are up 75% in the first three months of 2016 for Prime users.Over the weekend , it was announced that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will offer its Prime video streaming service on a stand-alone monthly basis . For $ 8.99 a month , subscribers will get to view everything on the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> movie streaming network . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For $ 10.99 , customers can subscribe to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime ( movies , free shipping , and <i>more</i> ) on a monthly basis . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>This is the first time that subscribers can directly get the benefits of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime without paying the annual fee ( $ 99 ) upfront . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This move by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>may</b> have been foreshadowed by a recent partnership with Sprint ( NYSE : S ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Sprint was the first partner that would offer <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime on a monthly basis to its subscribers . That price point announced then was $ 10.99 , which is the same being offered now directly through <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sprint <b>appears</b> to have been lost in the mix and wo n't really gain anything , other than those looking for one monthly bill .  (Uncertainty) </span>The price point and offering of the stand-alone movie service come at a time when Netflix is raising prices to its oldest subscribers.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>After holding off on a raise to <i>older</i> customers , the month of <b>May</b> will see Netflix 's main plan price increase from $ 7.99 to $ 9.99 monthly .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Netflix offers three priced plans ranging from $7.99 to $11.99 for new subscribers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The prices range <b>depending</b> on if movies are shown in HD quality and how many people can stream content at the same time .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's price point of $ 8.99 a month will also compete against Hulu , which charges $ 7.99 for content with limited commercials or $ 11.99 a month for content without commercials . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Of course , customers paying the new monthly price will pay <i>more</i> than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> users who pay the annual fee of $ 99 . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> finally has caved to a growing population that is used to paying items monthly . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Time will tell if this translates to <i>more</i> subscribers , but I have to <b>believe</b> that the answer will undoubtedly be yes .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The company noted that subscribers have been asking for monthly pricing for some time.With the latest Prime subscriber range of 57 to 61 million, we can again come up with a guess of how much money the company collects just in annual membership fees.At the midpoint of the range ( 59 million subscribers ) , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> collects $ 5.8 billion in annual membership revenue . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does n't break out all of the numbers for its Prime memberships , it continues to tell investors how much <i>more</i> valuable these subscribers are . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Back in January when the video game discount was announced , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> said its Prime customers spend 140 % <i>more</i> than other customers . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>With low margins for the massive e-commerce leader, multiple and repeat transactions matter.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology</div></body></html>
