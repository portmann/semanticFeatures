from the iOS ecosystem as well as streaming media content The ban of the device by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a transparent attempt to salvage something of the failed device strategy exemplified by Fire Phone Apples NASDAQ AAPL next generation Apple TV is due to go on sale soon and will feature the processor from the iPhone and a new operating system dubbed tvOS that will feature apps and games as well as streaming video and music Already it has been subjected to a preemptive ban by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN that is clearly intended to foster sales growth for the new Fire TV by removing competing devices from Amazons online store Far from being a bold strategic move the ban is an act of desperation that reflects Apples stronger competitive position Surprisingly much of the reaction to Amazons move has failed to take into account the fate of the Fire Phone The Fire Phone was only recently discontinued as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>finally worked through its inventory of Fire Phones in August According to the Wall Street Journal WSJ subscription required at link <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is curtailing the development of consumer devices and has laid off engineers who worked on the Fire Phone Clearly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is attempting to salvage what it can from its devices strategy and the new Fire TV is at the center of the new strategy Amazons decision to pull both Apple TV and Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Chromecast is indicative of how disadvantaged the Fire TV is The recent article on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>ban by Alcaraz Research misses this context and makes two bold assertions Alcaraz asserts that the ban is going to hurt sales of Apple TV and that Apple TV will continue to lag behind the Fire TV Its not exactly clear what is meant by lag but Ill assume lag in unit sales There is some divergence of opinion regarding how well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is doing relative to Apple TV Apple Insider recently published a report by Parks Associates that claims that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>had higher market share than Apple in in the US Statista has a completely different take on streaming devices market share in the US in which Fire TV and Fire TV Stick are lumped into the Other category Frost Sullivan also published a report and was widely reported in June showing that Apple had the lead in global market share in Apple also reported in January during the December quarter earnings call that it had shipped to date million Apple TVs Adobe NASDAQ ADBE has a report on streaming media user share that indicates that Apple TV and other Apple devices including iPhone iPad and Macs command the lions share of users of streaming media devices If you sum up all the Apple devices Apples share of streaming media device users dwarfs all other device categories as the chart below shows The Apple Device category can be broken down further by devices to show their individual contributions to the overall usage share for Apple as shown in the chart below According to Adobe even the lowly iPod Touch has more users than the Fire TV The idea that Apple lags behind <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in unit sales of streaming devices is not well supported by the available facts The above charts demonstrate what is meant by ecosystem advantage Apple offers a wide array of devices with different operating systems Mac OS X iOS and now tvOS for the latest gen Apple TV Even though the devices and operating systems are different theres a commonality of user interface that makes it easy to move from one device to the other Given that Apple continues to grow Mac and iPhone user sales Apples installed base of devices continues to grow as well This installed base forms the base of first adopters for devices such as the new Apple TV The installed base is very comfortable making purchases through Apples brick and mortar and online retail stores worldwide so I doubt theyll miss not being able to buy through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Apples online store actually provides many more localized versions than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>certainly sells more stuff but Apple has more global reach Another important aspect of ecosystem advantage lies in the variety of games that the Fire TV will be able to offer compared to the new Apple TV <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>advertises that the Fire TV Gaming Edition offers over games According to Statista Apple currently offers games on the iOS App Store Currently developers are working on porting as many of those to tvOS as fast as they can Since tvOS is based on iOS and the new Apple TV will use the processor from the iPhone A the process of conversion is pretty straightforward I expect there to be hundreds of games available when the new Apple TV launches later this Fall with many more to follow Most of the current iOS game catalog could be ported to tvOS eventually Given the ecosystem advantages and Apples global retail presence I dont see how the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>ban will affect sales of the new Apple TV Apple TV certainly faces significant competition but it will succeed or fail in its own right regardless of what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does Apple constrained the next gen Apple TV to be a streaming media and gaming platform almost exclusively somewhat to my disappointment considering that it packs the iPhone processor But what it does it does well and it should do well in the market place I continue to expect initial sales of about million units per month with quarterly revenue of about million This could accelerate if Apple succeeds in finalizing a live streaming TV content package from the major broadcast networks which many expect some time in
