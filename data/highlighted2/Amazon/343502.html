Committee hearing titled Protecting Mobile Privacy Your Smartphones Tablets Cell Phones and Your Privacy on Capitol Hill in Washington in this file picture taken A New York City Police NYPD officer stands across the street from Apple Store on th Avenue in New York in this file picture taken March As Apple IncAAPLO feuds with the US government over iPhone privacy protections the tech giant is also grappling with internal conflicts over privacy that could pose challenges to its longterm product strategy Unlike GoogleGOOGLO AmazonAMZNO and FacebookFBO Apple is loathe to use customer data to deliver targeted advertising or personalized recommendations Indeed any collection of Apple customer data requires signoff from a committee of three privacy czars and a top executive according to four former employees who worked on a variety of products that went through privacy vetting Approval is anything but automatic products including the Siri voicecommand feature and the recently scaledback iAd advertising network were restricted over privacy concerns these people said Many employees take pride in Apples stance and CEO Tim Cook has called it a matter of principle Customers expect Apple and other technology companies to do everything in our power to protect their personal information Cook wrote in a letter explaining the companys opposition to a government demand that it help unlock the iPhone of one of the shooters in the December attacks in San Bernardino California Such policies also have a business rationale Apples apparent willingness to sacrifice some profit for the sake of privacy bolsters its image as a company that protects customers Its an easier stand for Apple to take than say Facebook or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Apples chief business to date has been selling devices rather than advertising or ecommerce But now amid stagnant iPhone sales Apple executives have flagged services such as iCloud and Apple Music as prime sources for growth which could test the companys commitment to limiting the use of personal data Inside Apple the trio of experts known among employees as the privacy czars are both admired and feared Jane Horvath a lawyer who previously served as global privacy counsel at Google is the groups legal and policy wonk often channeling the views of Apples board and citing regulatory requirements said former employees who have worked with her She was hired to formalize privacy practices after the locationgate scandal in which iPhones were found to be gathering information about users whereabouts Horvath works alongside Guy Bud Tribble a member of the original Macintosh team who is venerated by employees as one of the few who had been to the mountain with Moses as one former employee put it referring to Tribbles ties to the late Steve Jobs Tribble has broad responsibilities as vice president of software technology but he devotes substantial time to privacy often working with closely with engineers The meetings can be tense but Tribbles skill and easy personality make him a popular figure people who have worked with him said The third czar a rising star named Erik Neuenschwander scrutinizes engineers work to ensure they are following through on the agreements even reviewing lines of code Following a popular philosophy in Silicon Valley known as privacy by design product managers start collaborating early with the privacy engineering and legal teams former Apple employees said For complicated matters the privacy taskforce steers the issue to a senior vice president and particularly sensitive questions may rise to Cook Key principles include keeping customer data on their devices rather than in the cloud on Apple servers and isolating various types of data so they cannot be united to form profiles of customers Such privacy guidelines can cut against engineers instincts to collect all the data because sometime down the road it may be useful said Albert Gidari director of privacy at Stanford Universitys Center for Internet and Society Debates over new uses of data at Apple typically take at least a month and have dragged on for more than a year former employees said Most tech companies now have privacy review processes Facebook Google Twitter and Snapchat entered into consent orders with the Federal Trade Commission that require them At Facebook and Google the privacy teams also insert themselves early and often in product development spokesmen for the companies said A spokesperson for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>declined comment The consensus among privacy experts is that privacy enforcement is more stringent at Apple because of the companys business model Some of the dataintensive companies have very rich privacy practices said Deirdre Mulligan an associate professor at UC Berkeley who studies privacy But theres a lot more negotiating and disagreement than you might find in a company that is not trying to make their money off data The biggest casualty of Apples privacy stance may be iAd a service launched in that aimed to deliver ads inside iPhone apps with revenue to be split between Apple and app developers Although Apple was a late entrant it had a tantalizing asset iTunes one of the industrys richest troves of consumer data That database however was off limits Whenever employees wanted to use iTunes data to sharpen targeting they had to appeal to the privacy team according to two former Apple employees who worked on iAd The iAd team fought hard to give advertisers greater visibility into who saw their ads those employees said Their hope was to create anonymous identifiers so advertisers could discern which users had seen their ads But despite about a dozen similar pitches the most executives would allow was a count of how many users had seen an advertisement according to the former employees It was so watered down it wasnt even useful one of the former employees said As a result iAd struggled to entice advertisers who will pay a premium for detailed data on their customers In January Apple announced it would discontinue the iAd app network We always heard from the iAd team that they would love to get more data to help them optimize campaigns for marketers and that was sometimes difficult said Peter Hamilton CEO of TUNE a popular mobile marketing platform which worked with marketers on iAd campaigns In other cases Apples privacy stance forced tough workarounds Siri a company Apple acquired in was the foundation for the voicecontrolled digital assistant built into the iPhone the following year But during the integration privacy leaders insisted that voice data on what users say to Siri should be stored separately from personally identifiable information according to a former Apple employee who attended some of the meetings That was a major backend surgery the former employee said During an update of the Spotlight search feature for the edition of Mac software the privacy and engineering teams had to work closely to come up with a way to keep users search logs on Apple servers that would give engineers the data they wanted without raising privacy concerns The obvious reaction Id have as a data person is This is insane said a former employee who worked on the project But the experience also underscored the extent of the companys commitment to protect consumer data the former employee said Apple must strike the right balance as it intensifies its push into services said Bob ODonnell an analyst with TECHnalysis Research In January Apples earnings report showed billion in services revenue for the most recent quarter up percent from the previous year The value of a service is the ability to personalize it ODonnell said The only way you can personalize it is with knowledge about an individuals preferences Thomson Reuters is the worlds largest international multimedia news agency providing investing news world news business news
