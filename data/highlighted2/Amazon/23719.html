Brian Wu Intel is planning to acquire Altera an FPGAmaker The company appears to be trying to capitalize on a trend where CPUFOGA hybrids are being used in datacenters more frequently The recent news that Intel NASDAQ INTC is looking to acquire Altera NASDAQ ALTR a leading manufacturer of fieldprogrammable gate arrays or FPGAs in what will turn out to be Intels largest acquisition ever has caught the semiconductor world by storm Altera is the worlds secondlargest manufacturer of FPGAs with Xilinx NASDAQ XLNX being the largest Xilinx has a share of this market while Altera is having a share The other FPGA player is Lattice Semiconductor NASDAQ LSCC The question that begs an answer is why Intel is suddenly so interested in a company like Altera that manufactures oldline FPGAs The acquisition certainly looks costly when you consider that Altera finished fiscal with a revenue of billion with rumors circulating that Intel might end up coughing more than billion or at least times Alteras annual sales for the company Why is Intel willing to go to such lengths to acquire a company that has remained under the radar of the semiconductor industry for so long Intel is the undisputed leader in the production of datacenter processors while ARMbased companies such as Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD Samsung OTCSSNLF and Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA dominate mobile processors ARM chips have been trying hard to get a proper foothold into the datacenter without much success ARM chips are used in microservers which the ARM camp has been pushing hard due to their low power consumption Power costs is the biggest cost element in datacenters In fact its estimated that datacenters consume roughly of the worlds total power Intels processors had traditionally focused on performance but not so much on power consumption In contrast ARM processors have always consumed less power than older Intel processors ARM processors with their significantly lower power footprint had a very real value proposition in the datacenter A crosssection of analysts projected that by as early as of all servers shipped would be microservers equipped with ARM chips But things have not turned out quite as expected in the ARM camp Microservers currently make up a tiny fraction of servers shipped Adoption of ARMbased servers has been severely limited by software compatibility issues A lot of the software that powers the web was designed with Intels Xeon processors which are built on x architectures in mind Intel was also quick to react to the ARM threat The company extended multicore Xeon devices to cores and built Atom processors for microservers which rivalled ARM processors on power and performance Intel even built the Xeon phi coprocessor that sports up to cores The ARM value proposition was therefore greatly diminished That is until FPGA makers Xilinx and Altera managed to produce something that jolted the industry Intel in particular Both companies started producing hybrid ProcessorFPGA chips that were based on ARM architecture Xilinx started producing Zynq on a commercial scale in early while Altera started shipping SoC FPGA later in the same year Xilinxs hybrid chip is known as Zynq while Alteras is known as SoC FPGA Marrying FPGAs with processors has been shown to increase performance dramatically while increasing power consumption only marginally Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT wrote a white paper titled The Catapult Project last year wherein it describes how a mediumscale FPGA deployment was able to increase ranking throughput in its Bing Search Engine by compared to a softwareonly deployment Microsoft added that marrying FPGAs to processors increased power consumption by only The Redmond giant added that it had been experimenting with CPUFPGA hybrids for years Meanwhile Intel followed up on the ARMFPGA advances by announcing last year that it had also managed to successfully produce a hybrid FPGAProcessor product with an unnamed FPGA company which is most likely Altera Its very likely that Intel acted so fast to counter the threat posed by ARMFPGA hybrids Xilinx and Altera had managed to successfully produce ARMFPGA hybrids and had already started shipping them According to Microsoft the performancespeed gain when using ProcessorFPGA hybrids is huge while the accompanying increase in power consumption is much lower This could turn out to be a very strong selling proposition for the ARM camp in the datacenter Its not hard to see companies like Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Facebook NASDAQ FB Netflix NASDAQ NFLX and others trying out FPGA hybrids Microsoft is not the only highprofile company experimenting with FPGA hybrids Baidu NASDAQ BIDU is using FPGAs on storage controllers large petabyte arrays that take in as much as a petabyte of data per day Even though FPGAs tend to be expensive they are actually at par with other accelerators when used in high volumes and their performance gain far outstrips that of GPUs for neural networks that are common in clouds Large companies such as cloud vendors that need large amounts of processors to build out their datacenters are therefore likely to be the early adopters of the technology on a large scale What this boils down to is that the FPGA market might very soon start seeing significantly more business The market for FPGAs is estimated to be worth just billion or of the semiconductor industry FPGAs are mainly used when prototyping ASICs Large financial institutions use FPGAs in network interface cards to accelerate static functions while a few companies use them on highfrequency trading systems The oil and gas industry has also been known to experiment with FPGAs But the real potential of the technology lies in the cloud If cloud companies start using FPGA hybrids on a large scale in their datacenters the opportunity for FPGA manufacturers such as Xilinx and Altera could be huge There are projections that the FPGA market will grow at a modest CAGR over the next five years to reach billion by If CPUFPGA hybrids however quickly become mainstream I believe the market can easily grow at or more considering its still quite small It appears that Xilinx is ahead of the curve as far as the production of cuttingedge FPGA hybrids go Xilinx recently announced that its upcoming FinFET Zynq UltraScale devices will be quadcore and sport bit ARM CortexA that will be tightly connected to highperformance FPGAs That will be a first for the ARM camp Ryft ONE a maker of FPGAbased servers that are used in data analytics recently told The Platform that they tested Xilinx and Altera FPGAs when building their own UI box that would minimize the need for clustering of analytics problems The companys VP of engineering at FPGA Patrick McGarry says they found Xilinx FPGAs to be better than Alteras because they allowed them to build custom interconnects and achieve impressive results Moreover the VP says that the company was able to crack one of the biggest hurdles towards a successful FPGA deployment programmability Maybe that explains why Xilinx has higher revenue than Altera and a bigger FPGA market share despite the companies being roughly the same size You can expect that the company is likely to start seeing significantly more business once CPUFPGA hybrids become mainstream in the datacenter Another small FPGA player that could benefit from the FPGA renaissance is Lattice Semiconductor Littleknown Lattice has a significant exposure to FPGAs though it also manufacturers CPLDs and SPLDs The company has been sailing in the red zone due to high operational expenses that seem to outstrip its revenue growth which is around about the same as Xilinxs and Alteras despite being times smaller If the market opens up maybe Lattice Semiconductor will finally be able to grow faster and become profitable and enter investors good books Editors Note This
