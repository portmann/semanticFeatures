Microsoft is not the only high-profile company experimenting with FPGA hybrids.Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) is using FPGAs on storage controllers - large 2,000 petabyte arrays that take in as much as a petabyte of data per day.Even though FPGAs tend to be expensive, they are actually at par with other accelerators when used in high volumes, and their performance gain far outstrips that of GPUs for neural networks that are common in clouds.Large companies, such as cloud vendors that need large amounts of processors to build out their datacenters, are therefore likely to be the early adopters of the technology on a large scale.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What this boils down to is that the FPGA market <b>might</b> very soon start seeing significantly more business .  (Uncertainty) </span>The market for FPGAs is estimated to be worth just $4.5 billion, or 2% of the semiconductor industry.FPGAs are mainly used when prototyping ASICs.Large financial institutions use FPGAs in network interface cards to accelerate static functions while a few companies use them on high-frequency trading systems.The oil and gas industry has also been known to experiment with FPGAs.But the real potential of the technology lies in the cloud.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If cloud companies start using FPGA hybrids on a large scale in their datacenters , the opportunity for FPGA manufacturers such as Xilinx and Altera <b>could</b> be huge .  (Uncertainty) </span>There are projections that the FPGA market will grow at a modest 8.1% CAGR over the next five years to reach $8.5 billion by 2020.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If CPU-FPGA hybrids , however , quickly become mainstream , I <b>believe</b> the market can easily grow at 15 % or more , considering it 's still quite small .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>appears</b> that Xilinx is ahead of the curve as far as the production of cutting-edge FPGA hybrids go .  (Uncertainty) </span>Xilinx recently announced that its upcoming FinFET Zynq UltraScale devices will be quad-core and sport 64-bit ARM Cortex-A53 that will be tightly connected to high-performance FPGAs.That will be a first for the ARM camp.Ryft ONE, a maker of FPGA-based servers that are used in data analytics, recently told The Platform that they tested Xilinx and Altera FPGAs when building their own UI box that would minimize the need for clustering of analytics problems.The company's VP of engineering at FPGA, Patrick McGarry, says they found Xilinx FPGAs to be better than Altera's because they allowed them to build custom interconnects and achieve impressive results.Moreover, the VP says that the company was able to crack one of the biggest hurdles towards a successful FPGA deployment - programmability.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Maybe that explains why Xilinx has 24 % higher revenue than Altera and a bigger FPGA market share , despite the companies being <b>roughly</b> the same size .  (Uncertainty) </span>You can expect that the company is likely to start seeing significantly more business once CPU-FPGA hybrids become mainstream in the datacenter.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Another small FPGA player that <b>could</b> benefit from the FPGA renaissance is Lattice Semiconductor .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Little-known Lattice has a significant <b>exposure</b> to FPGAs , though it also manufacturers CPLDs and SPLDs .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company has been sailing in the red zone due to high operational expenses that seem to outstrip its revenue growth (which is around 10%, about the same as Xilinx's and Altera's, despite being 10 times smaller).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the market opens up , <b>maybe</b> Lattice Semiconductor will finally be able to grow faster and become profitable , and enter investors ' good books .
