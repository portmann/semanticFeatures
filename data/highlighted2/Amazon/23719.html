(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The recent news that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) is looking to acquire Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ), a leading manufacturer of field-programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, in what will turn out to be Intel's largest acquisition ever, has caught the semiconductor world by storm.Altera is the world's second-largest manufacturer of FPGAs, with Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX ) being the largest.Xilinx has a 50% share of this market while Altera is having a 39% share.The other FPGA player is Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ: LSCC ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The question that begs an answer is why Intel is <b>suddenly</b> so interested in a company like Altera that manufactures old-line FPGAs ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The acquisition certainly looks costly when you consider that Altera finished fiscal 2014 with a revenue of $ 1.93 billion , with rumors circulating that Intel <b>might</b> end up coughing <i>more</i> than $ 14 billion , or at least 7 times Altera 's annual sales , for the company .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Why is Intel willing to go to such lengths to acquire a company that has remained under the radar of the semiconductor industry for so long?Intel is the undisputed leader in the production of datacenter processors while ARM-based companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) dominate mobile processors.ARM chips have been trying hard to get a proper foothold into the datacenter without much success.ARM chips are used in microservers, which the ARM camp has been pushing hard due to their low power consumption.Power costs is the biggest cost element in datacenters.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In fact , it 's estimated that datacenters consume <b>roughly</b> 5 % of the world 's total power .  (Uncertainty) </span>Intel's processors had traditionally focused on performance but not so much on power consumption.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In contrast , ARM processors have always consumed <i>less</i> power than <i>older</i> Intel processors .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>ARM processors , with their significantly <i>lower</i> power footprint , had a very real value proposition in the datacenter .  (Surprise) </span>A cross-section of analysts projected that by as early as 2016, 10% of all servers shipped would be microservers equipped with ARM chips.But, things have not turned out quite as expected in the ARM camp.Microservers currently make up a tiny fraction of servers shipped.Adoption of ARM-based servers has been severely limited by software compatibility issues.A lot of the software that powers the web was designed with Intel's Xeon processors, which are built on x86 architectures, in mind.Intel was also quick to react to the ARM threat.The company extended multi-core Xeon devices to 18 cores and built Atom processors for microservers which rivalled ARM processors on power and performance.Intel even built the Xeon phi co-processor that sports up to 61 cores.The ARM value proposition was therefore greatly diminished.That is until FPGA makers Xilinx and Altera managed to produce something that jolted the industry, Intel in particular.Both companies started producing hybrid Processor-FPGA chips that were based on ARM architecture.Xilinx started producing Zynq on a commercial scale in early 2013 while Altera started shipping SoC FPGA later in the same year.Xilinx's hybrid chip is known as ''Zynq'' while Altera's is known as ''SoC FPGA.''Marrying FPGAs with processors has been shown to increase performance dramatically while increasing power consumption only marginally.Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) wrote a white paper titled ''The Catapult Project'' last year wherein it describes how a medium-scale FPGA deployment was able to increase ranking throughput in its Bing Search Engine by 95% compared to a software-only deployment.Microsoft added that marrying FPGAs to processors increased power consumption by only 10%.The Redmond giant added that it had been experimenting with CPU-FPGA hybrids for 3 years.Meanwhile, Intel followed up on the ARM-FPGA advances by announcing last year that it had also managed to successfully produce a hybrid FPGA-Processor product with an unnamed FPGA company (which is most likely Altera).It's very likely that Intel acted so fast to counter the threat posed by ARM-FPGA hybrids.Xilinx and Altera had managed to successfully produce ARM-FPGA hybrids and had already started shipping them.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>According to Microsoft , the performance/speed gain when using Processor-FPGA hybrids is huge while the accompanying increase in power consumption is much <i>lower</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>could</b> turn out to be a very strong selling proposition for the ARM camp in the datacenter .  (Uncertainty) </span>It 's not hard to see companies like Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) , Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) and others trying out FPGA hybrids . Microsoft is not the only high-profile company experimenting with FPGA hybrids.Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) is using FPGAs on storage controllers - large 2,000 petabyte arrays that take in as much as a petabyte of data per day.Even though FPGAs tend to be expensive, they are actually at par with other accelerators when used in high volumes, and their performance gain far outstrips that of GPUs for neural networks that are common in clouds.Large companies, such as cloud vendors that need large amounts of processors to build out their datacenters, are therefore likely to be the early adopters of the technology on a large scale.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>What this boils down to is that the FPGA market <b>might</b> very soon start seeing significantly <i>more</i> business .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The market for FPGAs is estimated to be worth just $4.5 billion, or 2% of the semiconductor industry.FPGAs are mainly used when prototyping ASICs.Large financial institutions use FPGAs in network interface cards to accelerate static functions while a few companies use them on high-frequency trading systems.The oil and gas industry has also been known to experiment with FPGAs.But the real potential of the technology lies in the cloud.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If cloud companies start using FPGA hybrids on a large scale in their datacenters , the opportunity for FPGA manufacturers such as Xilinx and Altera <b>could</b> be huge .  (Uncertainty) </span>There are projections that the FPGA market will grow at a modest 8.1% CAGR over the next five years to reach $8.5 billion by 2020.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If CPU-FPGA hybrids , however , quickly become mainstream , I <b>believe</b> the market can easily grow at 15 % or <i>more</i> , considering it 's still quite small .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>appears</b> that Xilinx is ahead of the curve as far as the production of cutting-edge FPGA hybrids go .  (Uncertainty) </span>Xilinx recently announced that its upcoming FinFET Zynq UltraScale devices will be quad-core and sport 64-bit ARM Cortex-A53 that will be tightly connected to high-performance FPGAs.That will be a first for the ARM camp.Ryft ONE, a maker of FPGA-based servers that are used in data analytics, recently told The Platform that they tested Xilinx and Altera FPGAs when building their own UI box that would minimize the need for clustering of analytics problems.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company 's VP of engineering at FPGA , Patrick McGarry , says they found Xilinx FPGAs to be <i>better</i> than Altera 's because they allowed them to build custom interconnects and achieve impressive results .  (Surprise) </span>Moreover, the VP says that the company was able to crack one of the biggest hurdles towards a successful FPGA deployment - programmability.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Maybe that explains why Xilinx has 24 % <i>higher</i> revenue than Altera and a <i>bigger</i> FPGA market share , despite the companies being <b>roughly</b> the same size .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>You can expect that the company is likely to start seeing significantly <i>more</i> business once CPU-FPGA hybrids become mainstream in the datacenter .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Another small FPGA player that <b>could</b> benefit from the FPGA renaissance is Lattice Semiconductor .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Little-known Lattice has a significant <b>exposure</b> to FPGAs , though it also manufacturers CPLDs and SPLDs .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company has been sailing in the red zone due to high operational expenses that seem to outstrip its revenue growth ( which is around 10 % , about the same as Xilinx 's and Altera 's , despite being 10 times <i>smaller</i> ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If the market opens up , <b>maybe</b> Lattice Semiconductor will finally be able to grow <i>faster</i> and become profitable , and enter investors ' good books .
