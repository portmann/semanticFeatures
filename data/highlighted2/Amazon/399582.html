(NASDAQ:FOX) | Seeking Alpha Hulu's recent "slowdown" to only 33% subscriber growth has been called out by analysts.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In reality , Hulu is looking <i>more</i> promising than it has in years , with a long overdue platform revamp nearing completion .  (Surprise) </span>Its recent slowdown stems from lack of exclusive content, which can easily be remedied once its internal metrics show customers responding to the platform changes.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Hulu 's incumbent owners are too exposed to linear-TV 's demise to be good investments , but Hulu 's search for a fourth partner <b>might</b> offer a <i>more</i> pure-play entry point for investors .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After spending <b>almost</b> a decade in the shadow of Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Hulu , the joint venture of Comcast ( NASDAQ : CMCSA ) , Disney ( NYSE : DIS ) and 20th Century Fox ( NASDAQ : FOX ) is on the move lately . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With today 's confirmation that Hulu will indeed seek to offer live-streaming of its content partners channels in addition to on demand video , the day of Internet TV eclipsing linear TV draws ever <i>closer</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And for the first time , it looks like Hulu <b>may</b> actually play a substantial role in the transition .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While the recent commentary on Hulu 's recent subscriber numbers has been <b>surprisingly</b> negative , I actually thought they were rather good , and I 'm becoming <b>optimistic</b> on Hulu for the first time in years .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Hulu has long been almost the forgotten also-ran to its <i>more</i> well known brethren despite , or <b>perhaps</b> because of , its <i>more</i> establishment origins and connections .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Launching on March 12th, 2008, when even Netflix was just beginning to probe the depths of Internet TV's potential, Hulu failed to catch fire as Netflix did and spent years toiling in the rear.While Netflix rose steadily to 48 million subscribers in April 2014, Hulu had only 6 million , despite offering in-season content of current shows.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The fact that some of Netflix 's subscribers were overseas was little consolation - the U.S. subscriber count alone was <b>almost</b> six times their own .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Last year it suffered the humiliation of watching <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Video , which did n't even launch until three years after Hulu did , streak past it in downstream internet traffic , and <b>presumably</b> usage as well . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Part of the problem was that its partners were major stakeholders in the very linear-TV ecosystem Internet TV is meant to disrupt , unlike Netflix and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> which have no compunction about tearing that system down . They insisted on making Hulu look a lot like linear TV, with all the annoying features - most especially, ads - that people use Internet TV to get away from .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>What 's <i>more</i> , when it became clear Internet TV was taking off , Hulu 's content partners began throwing up <i>more</i> obstacles for Hulu customers , including instituting an eight-day waiting period for new episodes , while preserving next-day or even next-hour access for cable/satellite VOD systems .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>These restrictions on Hulu were waived for cable/satellite customers , threatening to make Hulu <i>less</i> of an Internet TV app and <i>more</i> of a cable-TV portal .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Hulu 's biggest problem , however , <b>may</b> have been its content deals .  (Uncertainty) </span>When Hulu launched its partners agreed to make it their exclusive home for online content from ABC, NBC, and FOX.But in 2011 that exclusivity was not renewed , and Hulu's content started popping up on its parents' home websites, diverting lots of potential traffic.Over the last two years, Netflix has not really slowed down, but Hulu has started to speed up.From 6 million it rose to 9 million last April and 12 million now.It has begun to address many of the "not as good as Netflix" flaws its owners saddled it with, inking deals for exclusive TV content and expanding its movie library with a non-exclusive deal with Epix.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The single most important thing , however , <b>might</b> be the move it made six months ago .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Hulu now offers a commercial-free option for just $ 4 <i>more</i> a month , $ 12 compared to $ 8 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If that $ 4 saves the viewer even 30 minutes of commercials - which would require watching about six episodes of TV a month - customers are paying <i>less</i> than the minimum wage to buy back their time .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Despite this , analyst feedback over the last few days has been <b>surprisingly</b> negative .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Analysts have pointed out that Hulu 's growth is already slowing , despite still being <i>less</i> than a quarter of Netflix 's size .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>They were <b>disappointed</b> that 2015 , which CEO Mike <b>Hopkins</b> had called Hulu 's breakout year , did not bring <i>more</i> eyeballs .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I am not concerned.I have had a lot of problems with Hulu bulls over the years, but this is not one of them.The comparisons with Netflix are not entirely accurate because Hulu has what I would call a sequencing issue.When Netflix first launched what would become the most revolutionary TV offering in decades, it began with the engine and then bought fuel.From the beginning, it offered consumers a low price, an excellent recommendation engine, complete device portability, and most importantly, no ads.It began with a collection of mostly B-level movies and one good contract with Starz.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Over time it cut deals with most of the major studios , putting <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> fuel in the engine so it <b>could</b> drive the car <i>farther</i> and <i>farther</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Hulu essentially started at the other end.It's partners/owners basically handed it whole tanks of fuel, and told them to build an engine.They came out of the gate with an exclusive lock on some of TV's most compelling content, but a very poor platform.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They were required to show ads , and they charged <i>more</i> than their ad-free competitor .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Content <b>could</b> only be viewed on computers , not mobile devices .  (Uncertainty) </span>The dark days were when exclusivity expired and the platform was still terrible.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Now there was still no engine , and a lot <i>less</i> fuel .  (Surprise) </span>Since then, Hulu has begun to finish the engine.It has full device portability and an ad-free option is now available.Now for the fuel.So far it only has a few exclusive content agreements, which is a problem.No one likes paying twice for anything.If Hulu is only offering content that people can get elsewhere , there is little reason for people to pay its $ 12 fee on top of Cable/Netflix/Amazon . Hulu shares the Epix movie slate with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , it shares several of its CBS library shows with Netflix and it shares most of its in-season TV shows with its owners/providers . The good news is that problem, unlike a bad platform, can be solved, and quickly too.Hulu has begun to launch original content , as Netflix and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> already have . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is working on <i>more</i> exclusive content deals , which should bring <i>more</i> people to the site to find shows they ca n't watch anywhere else .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Hulu should feel comfortable spending money on these shows because if they are put on a strong platform , they will yield quick results and allow it to tap the same virtuous cycle Netflix has : <i>more</i> content brings <i>more</i> eyeballs , brings <i>more</i> money , brings <i>more</i> content .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The only problem with Hulu for investors is that they can't invest.Hulu is a joint venture of Comcast, Disney, and Fox, with no publicly traded shares.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of the three , all are so heavily invested in linear-TV that whatever benefits Hulu brings to their bottom line <b>may</b> well be cancelled out by the damage done to their other businesses .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Disney has ESPN , Comcast is America 's largest cable company , and Fox has no <i>fewer</i> than 15 RSNs , the channels loaded with expensive sports contracts little <i>less</i> than ESPN .  (Surprise) </span>However, there are periodic reports of interest in Hulu from other parties, either joining the Big Three in the existing configuration or in some combination of a sale/IPO.TimeWarner (NYSE: TWX ) was rumored to be bidding not too long ago, although so far nothing has come of it.The price was said to value Hulu at $5 billion.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>My recommendation is to hold off on the three incumbents , but to buy any new partners who enter the business with <i>less</i> deadweight .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>CBS ( NYSE : CBS ) would profit the most from Hulu , since with such strong content they have <i>less</i> to <b>fear</b> than most from the demise of the old system .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They could milk Hulu 's profits without <b>fear</b> of cannibalizing themselves .  (Uncertainty) </span>For Hulu it would round out their broadcast TV lineup nicely.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Discovery Communications ( DISC ) or Univision ( Pending : UVN ) would also be good candidates to go long if they <b>could</b> get their foot in the door .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Best of all of course would be an IPO , but that <b>seems</b> <i>less</i> likely right now .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>To me, the fact that Hulu has gone from 6 to 12 million in two years with as little exclusive content as it has says a lot about its potential, not its shortcomings.To be clear, Hulu has a long way to go.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Too much of its library is still non-exclusive , and it <b>probably</b> still charges too much considering Netflix ( $ 10 ) and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( $ 9 ) prices , especially considering that they offer two streams at a time instead of one . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>But after years of wallowing in the shadows it has begun to move.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix today sports a market cap of <b>almost</b> $ 50 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>If Hulu can get to even half of that it will yield a very nice return for someone who can buy in at 10% of that valuation.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Services</div></body></html>
