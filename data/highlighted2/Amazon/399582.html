(Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Hulu should feel comfortable spending money on these shows because if they are put on a strong platform , they will yield quick results and allow it to tap the same virtuous cycle Netflix has : <i>more</i> content brings <i>more</i> eyeballs , brings <i>more</i> money , brings <i>more</i> content .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The only problem with Hulu for investors is that they can't invest.Hulu is a joint venture of Comcast, Disney, and Fox, with no publicly traded shares.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of the three , all are so heavily invested in linear-TV that whatever benefits Hulu brings to their bottom line <b>may</b> well be cancelled out by the damage done to their other businesses .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Disney has ESPN , Comcast is America 's largest cable company , and Fox has no <i>fewer</i> than 15 RSNs , the channels loaded with expensive sports contracts little <i>less</i> than ESPN .  (Surprise) </span>However, there are periodic reports of interest in Hulu from other parties, either joining the Big Three in the existing configuration or in some combination of a sale/IPO.TimeWarner (NYSE: TWX ) was rumored to be bidding not too long ago, although so far nothing has come of it.The price was said to value Hulu at $5 billion.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>My recommendation is to hold off on the three incumbents , but to buy any new partners who enter the business with <i>less</i> deadweight .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>CBS ( NYSE : CBS ) would profit the most from Hulu , since with such strong content they have <i>less</i> to <b>fear</b> than most from the demise of the old system .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They could milk Hulu 's profits without <b>fear</b> of cannibalizing themselves .  (Uncertainty) </span>For Hulu it would round out their broadcast TV lineup nicely.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Discovery Communications ( DISC ) or Univision ( Pending : UVN ) would also be good candidates to go long if they <b>could</b> get their foot in the door .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Best of all of course would be an IPO , but that <b>seems</b> <i>less</i> likely right now .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>To me, the fact that Hulu has gone from 6 to 12 million in two years with as little exclusive content as it has says a lot about its potential, not its shortcomings.To be clear, Hulu has a long way to go.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Too much of its library is still non-exclusive , and it <b>probably</b> still charges too much considering Netflix ( $ 10 ) and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( $ 9 ) prices , especially considering that they offer two streams at a time instead of one . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>But after years of wallowing in the shadows it has begun to move.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix today sports a market cap of <b>almost</b> $ 50 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>If Hulu can get to even half of that it will yield a very nice return for someone who can buy in at 10% of that valuation.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Services</div></body></html>
