reality Hulu is looking more promising than it has in years with a long overdue platform revamp nearing completion Its recent slowdown stems from lack of exclusive content which can easily be remedied once its internal metrics show customers responding to the platform changes Hulus incumbent owners are too exposed to linearTVs demise to be good investments but Hulus search for a fourth partner might offer a more pureplay entry point for investors After spending almost a decade in the shadow of Netflix NASDAQ NFLX and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Hulu the joint venture of Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA Disney NYSE DIS and th Century Fox NASDAQ FOX is on the move lately With todays confirmation that Hulu will indeed seek to offer livestreaming of its content partners channels in addition to on demand video the day of Internet TV eclipsing linear TV draws ever closer And for the first time it looks like Hulu may actually play a substantial role in the transition While the recent commentary on Hulus recent subscriber numbers has been surprisingly negative I actually thought they were rather good and Im becoming optimistic on Hulu for the first time in years Hulu has long been almost the forgotten alsoran to its more well known brethren despite or perhaps because of its more establishment origins and connections Launching on March th when even Netflix was just beginning to probe the depths of Internet TVs potential Hulu failed to catch fire as Netflix did and spent years toiling in the rear While Netflix rose steadily to million subscribers in April Hulu had only million despite offering inseason content of current shows The fact that some of Netflixs subscribers were overseas was little consolation the US subscriber count alone was almost six times their own Last year it suffered the humiliation of watching <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Video which didnt even launch until three years after Hulu did streak past it in downstream internet traffic and presumably usage as well Part of the problem was that its partners were major stakeholders in the very linearTV ecosystem Internet TV is meant to disrupt unlike Netflix and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>which have no compunction about tearing that system down They insisted on making Hulu look a lot like linear TV with all the annoying features most especially ads that people use Internet TV to get away from Whats more when it became clear Internet TV was taking off Hulus content partners began throwing up more obstacles for Hulu customers including instituting an eightday waiting period for new episodes while preserving nextday or even nexthour access for cablesatellite VOD systems These restrictions on Hulu were waived for cablesatellite customers threatening to make Hulu less of an Internet TV app and more of a cableTV portal Hulus biggest problem however may have been its content deals When Hulu launched its partners agreed to make it their exclusive home for online content from ABC NBC and FOX But in that exclusivity was not renewed and Hulus content started popping up on its parents home websites diverting lots of potential traffic Over the last two years Netflix has not really slowed down but Hulu has started to speed up From million it rose to million last April and million now It has begun to address many of the not as good as Netflix flaws its owners saddled it with inking deals for exclusive TV content and expanding its movie library with a nonexclusive deal with Epix The single most important thing however might be the move it made six months ago Hulu now offers a commercialfree option for just more a month compared to If that saves the viewer even minutes of commercials which would require watching about six episodes of TV a month customers are paying less than the minimum wage to buy back their time Despite this analyst feedback over the last few days has been surprisingly negative Analysts have pointed out that Hulus growth is already slowing despite still being less than a quarter of Netflixs size They were disappointed that which CEO Mike Hopkins had called Hulus breakout year did not bring more eyeballs I am not concerned I have had a lot of problems with Hulu bulls over the years but this is not one of them The comparisons with Netflix are not entirely accurate because Hulu has what I would call a sequencing issue When Netflix first launched what would become the most revolutionary TV offering in decades it began with the engine and then bought fuel From the beginning it offered consumers a low price an excellent recommendation engine complete device portability and most importantly no ads It began with a collection of mostly Blevel movies and one good contract with Starz Over time it cut deals with most of the major studios putting more and more fuel in the engine so it could drive the car farther and farther Hulu essentially started at the other end Its partnersowners basically handed it whole tanks of fuel and told them to build an engine They came out of the gate with an exclusive lock on some of TVs most compelling content but a very poor platform They were required to show ads and they charged more than their adfree competitor Content could only be viewed on computers not mobile devices The dark days were when exclusivity expired and the platform was still terrible Now there was still no engine and a lot less fuel Since then Hulu has begun to finish the engine It has full device portability and an adfree option is now available Now for the fuel So far it only has a few exclusive content agreements which is a problem No one likes paying twice for anything If Hulu is only offering content that people can get elsewhere there is little reason for people to pay its fee on top of CableNetflixAmazon Hulu shares the Epix movie slate with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>it shares several of its CBS library shows with Netflix and it shares most of its inseason TV shows with its ownersproviders The good news is that problem unlike a bad platform can be solved and quickly too Hulu has begun to launch original content as Netflix and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>already have It is working on more exclusive content deals which should bring more people to the site to find shows they cant watch anywhere else Hulu should feel comfortable spending money on these shows because if they are put on a strong platform they will yield quick results and allow it to tap the same virtuous cycle Netflix has more content brings more eyeballs brings more money brings more content The only problem with Hulu for investors is that they cant invest Hulu is a joint venture of Comcast Disney and Fox with no publicly traded shares Of the three all are so heavily invested in linearTV that whatever benefits Hulu brings to their bottom line may well be cancelled out by the damage done to their other businesses Disney has ESPN Comcast is Americas largest cable company and Fox has no fewer than RSNs the channels loaded with expensive sports contracts little less than ESPN However there are periodic reports of interest in Hulu from other parties either joining the Big Three in the existing configuration or in some combination of a saleIPO TimeWarner NYSE TWX was rumored to be bidding not too long ago although so far nothing has come of it The price was said to value Hulu at billion My recommendation is to hold off on the three incumbents but to buy any new partners who enter the business with less deadweight CBS NYSE CBS would profit the most from Hulu since with such strong content they have less to fear than most from the demise of the old system They could milk Hulus profits without fear of cannibalizing themselves For Hulu it would round out their broadcast TV lineup nicely Discovery Communications DISC or Univision Pending UVN would also be good candidates to go long if they could get their foot in the door Best of all of course would be an IPO but that seems less likely right now To me the fact that Hulu has gone from to million in two years with as little exclusive content as it has says a lot about its potential not its shortcomings To be clear Hulu has a long way to go Too much of its library is still nonexclusive and it probably still charges too much considering Netflix and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>prices especially considering that they offer two streams at a time instead of one But after years of wallowing in the shadows it has begun to move Netflix today sports a market cap of almost billion If Hulu can get to even half of that it will yield a very nice return for someone who can buy in at of that valuation Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself
