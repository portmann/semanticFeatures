(Uncertainty) </span>Windows 10 will be the catalyst for the company's cloud growth.Investors can expect Microsoftâ€™s 'commercial other' business to continue growing revenue at its current rate of 44% over the next three years.Given the success in the cloud business, the stock is likely to increase 50% from this inflection point over the next three years.Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is growing its 'cloud' business at an opportune time.There is high demand for enterprise cloud expansion and the new Windows 10 operating system adds capabilities in virtualization and portability that few other competitors can achieve.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Additionally , the shift to a <i>more</i> cloud-based business means <i>higher</i> revenue generation in comparison to individualized software licensing , which has <i>lower</i> expected growth rates in the near term .  (Surprise) </span>The company is positioned perfectly for this business shift and, following the rollout of the Windows 10 operating system, the company has been marketing its cloud initiative superbly.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft 's Mike Schutz , General Manager of Cloud Platform Marketing , recently discussed the cloud business at the Deutsche Bank 2015 Technology Brokers Conference , which provided <i>more</i> insight for investors on the value opportunity in the cloud business .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Cloud is revolutionizing Microsoft 's business and will be the key business segment that makes the company <i>more</i> competitive over the next three years .  (Surprise) </span>For investors, this transition to cloud-based growth initiatives will likely lead to a 50% increase in the company's share value by 2018.The Windows 10 operating system has been in the spotlight in recent weeks, as the company released the new operating system and made free upgrades available for users.What hasn't been as widely publicized is how Windows 10 is revolutionizing Microsoft's cloud offerings.Schutz's comments at the Deutsche conference provided some timely key insights for investors on just how the cloud business transformation will take place.Investors know Microsoft's main cloud offerings extremely well, most notably Azure, Dynamics CRM and Office 365.What many investors don't realize is the behind-the-scenes transformation that has been taking place in the cloud business as the Windows 10 operating system has been revealed.The company's key product offerings - Azure, Dynamics CRM and Office 365 - will continue to form the base for cloud growth.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The use of these product offerings will become even <i>more</i> streamlined as a result of Windows 10 's new capabilities .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In addition to these core products , Microsoft also has over 40 services that can combine to make the company 's user experience <i>more</i> efficient and customized .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With the new Windows 10 operating system , Microsoft now has the capabilities to <i>more</i> seamlessly put these services to work in the cloud for an even <i>higher</i> quality customer experience .  (Surprise) </span>As a first milestone , Windows 10 's added capabilities will now allow Microsoft 's cloud offerings to surpass the capabilities of the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Service and Google 's cloud services , catapulting its market share in the short term . The company 's unique ability to hyperscale its cloud services in the current environment , in comparison to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) and Google ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) , is a key differentiator in the space . According to Mike Schutz , Microsoft is one of only three hyperscale platforms and , with 19 data centers in 19 regions , it is purely outscaling <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Google in its cloud capabilities . Additionally , its security layer capabilities are also a key differentiating factor , as the company seeks to provide superior services above and beyond those of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Google . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In progression , the <i>more</i> competitive capabilities of Windows 10 can also be seen in Microsoft 's Windows Server , which is a well-known server that has been a steady revenue generator for the company .  (Surprise) </span>Windows Server greatly contributes to the company's 'commercial and licensing' business, which brought in $41 billion for the firm in 2015.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It also greatly helps the marketing of the Windows operating system , as Windows is used on <b>approximately</b> 80 % of the world 's commercial enterprise servers .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Migration to the use of Windows 10 on these servers will be a substantial first step for Microsoft and its push right now around its Windows 2016 wave will incorporate <i>more</i> compatible capabilities of the Windows 10 operating system into the Windows Server enterprise base , which then will extend into the company 's cloud server capabilities .  (Surprise) </span>At this inflection point, investors are going to begin to see customers transitioning from the Windows Server solution to a hybrid solution and then potentially to a pure cloud solution that utilizes Microsoft's Azure cloud capabilities with Windows 10 - and that's where growth in the 'commercial other' revenue is really going to take off.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>could</b> already be seen in the 2015 numbers with the company 's ` commercial other ' business growing 44 % in 2015 , led by sales from Azure , Dynamics CRM and Office 365 offerings .  (Uncertainty) </span>Now, with the incorporation of Windows 10 operating system capabilities, investors are going to see the 'commercial other' business continue to grow at a steady annual rate of 40% over the next three years.These projections come from Satya Nadella himself in comments following the fourth-quarter earnings release: I'm proud of these steps and I'm proud of the results we delivered in tandem.In cloud alone, our annualized commercial cloud run-rate surpassed $8 billion this quarter, and the revenue grew 88% year over year.We are on a strong trajectory towards our goal of $20 billion in fiscal year 2018."<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Some of the key features that Windows 10 can provide for include <i>greater</i> virtualization capabilities and <i>greater</i> portability of applications .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For customers , this means <i>more</i> innovation in the workplace around virtualization .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It also means customers can <i>more</i> easily add Microsoft-compatible applications to their platforms through the use of Windows 10 on either the server , cloud or a hybrid of both .  (Surprise) </span>Microsoft has ideally timed the introduction of its Windows 10 operating system with the transformation of its cloud business and in my opinion now is an opportune time for investors to buy the shares in the leading technology company.Cloud revenue is going to grow substantially, while licensing revenue growth tapers off.This was seen in 2015 and is going to continue to be the case through 2018.In 2015, 'devices and consumer licensing' revenue was down 23% versus revenue growth of 44% in 'commercial other'.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With the new Windows 10 innovation , ` commercial other ' is going to continue growing even <i>more</i> substantially while ` devices and consumer licensing ' also gains marginally purely from new software licensing sales .  (Surprise) </span>If the new technological innovations and sales projections are not compelling enough, investors can also see Microsoft's upside potential in the firm's fundamental operating capabilities and the stock's P/E trading multiple.Over the past five years, the company has generated return on shareholder equity of 28.59%.Additionally, its five-year average gross margin leads the industry at 72%, further evidencing its capability to consistently generate profit.For 2016, analysts are projecting a revenue of $95.9 billion and EPS of $3.17.Over the three-year period, analysts are projecting average annual revenue and EPS growth of 14% and 41%, respectively.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Meanwhile , the firm trades below the <i>broader</i> market 's forward P/E multiple at 15 versus the S&P 500 's forward P/E multiple of 16 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The strong outlook and <i>lower</i> P/E multiple further exemplify Microsoft 's upside potential in the current market environment .  (Surprise) </span>Lastly, the firm is at no loss for free cash flow, which increases its latitude for development around its already-strong cloud initiative.For the trailing twelve months, it had free cash flow of $23.1 billion or $3 per share.Also impressive is its free cash flow to revenue comparison of 32% over the past five years.Overall, there are a number of exciting things going on with Microsoft, and its cloud business initiative is superbly timed.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In my opinion , growth in the cloud business is going to lift the stock to the mid - $ 70 range over the next three years , as shown in the discounted cash flow illustration below and the added benefit from its 2.84 % dividend yield gives it an upside potential of <b>nearly</b> 50 % .
