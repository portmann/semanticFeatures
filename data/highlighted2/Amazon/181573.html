In progression, the more competitive capabilities of Windows 10 can also be seen in Microsoft's Windows Server, which is a well-known server that has been a steady revenue generator for the company.Windows Server greatly contributes to the company's 'commercial and licensing' business, which brought in $41 billion for the firm in 2015.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It also greatly helps the marketing of the Windows operating system , as Windows is used on <b>approximately</b> 80 % of the world 's commercial enterprise servers .  (Uncertainty) </span>Migration to the use of Windows 10 on these servers will be a substantial first step for Microsoft and its push right now around its Windows 2016 wave will incorporate more compatible capabilities of the Windows 10 operating system into the Windows Server enterprise base, which then will extend into the company's cloud server capabilities.At this inflection point, investors are going to begin to see customers transitioning from the Windows Server solution to a hybrid solution and then potentially to a pure cloud solution that utilizes Microsoft's Azure cloud capabilities with Windows 10 - and that's where growth in the 'commercial other' revenue is really going to take off.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>could</b> already be seen in the 2015 numbers with the company 's ` commercial other ' business growing 44 % in 2015 , led by sales from Azure , Dynamics CRM and Office 365 offerings .  (Uncertainty) </span>Now, with the incorporation of Windows 10 operating system capabilities, investors are going to see the 'commercial other' business continue to grow at a steady annual rate of 40% over the next three years.These projections come from Satya Nadella himself in comments following the fourth-quarter earnings release: I'm proud of these steps and I'm proud of the results we delivered in tandem.In cloud alone, our annualized commercial cloud run-rate surpassed $8 billion this quarter, and the revenue grew 88% year over year.We are on a strong trajectory towards our goal of $20 billion in fiscal year 2018."Some of the key features that Windows 10 can provide for include greater virtualization capabilities and greater portability of applications.For customers, this means more innovation in the workplace around virtualization.It also means customers can more easily add Microsoft-compatible applications to their platforms through the use of Windows 10 on either the server, cloud or a hybrid of both.Microsoft has ideally timed the introduction of its Windows 10 operating system with the transformation of its cloud business and in my opinion now is an opportune time for investors to buy the shares in the leading technology company.Cloud revenue is going to grow substantially, while licensing revenue growth tapers off.This was seen in 2015 and is going to continue to be the case through 2018.In 2015, 'devices and consumer licensing' revenue was down 23% versus revenue growth of 44% in 'commercial other'.With the new Windows 10 innovation, 'commercial other' is going to continue growing even more substantially while 'devices and consumer licensing' also gains marginally purely from new software licensing sales.If the new technological innovations and sales projections are not compelling enough, investors can also see Microsoft's upside potential in the firm's fundamental operating capabilities and the stock's P/E trading multiple.Over the past five years, the company has generated return on shareholder equity of 28.59%.Additionally, its five-year average gross margin leads the industry at 72%, further evidencing its capability to consistently generate profit.For 2016, analysts are projecting a revenue of $95.9 billion and EPS of $3.17.Over the three-year period, analysts are projecting average annual revenue and EPS growth of 14% and 41%, respectively.Meanwhile, the firm trades below the broader market's forward P/E multiple at 15 versus the S&P 500's forward P/E multiple of 16.The strong outlook and lower P/E multiple further exemplify Microsoft's upside potential in the current market environment.Lastly, the firm is at no loss for free cash flow, which increases its latitude for development around its already-strong cloud initiative.For the trailing twelve months, it had free cash flow of $23.1 billion or $3 per share.Also impressive is its free cash flow to revenue comparison of 32% over the past five years.Overall, there are a number of exciting things going on with Microsoft, and its cloud business initiative is superbly timed.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In my opinion , growth in the cloud business is going to lift the stock to the mid - $ 70 range over the next three years , as shown in the discounted cash flow illustration below and the added benefit from its 2.84 % dividend yield gives it an upside potential of <b>nearly</b> 50 % .
