contact your network administrator Click to print Opens in new window Theres obviously some disruption afoot in the TV marketplace of late Broadcast and cable networks continue to think that they represent TV Netflix <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and an upandcoming generation of cordcutters seem to disagree And yet for all money the young whippersnapper businesses seem to get from the young whippersnapper audiences at least one member of the old guard thinks its all so much chaff in the wind Alan Wurtzel who heads up research and media development for NBCU is stillunconcerned about his streaming competition as Adweek explains Theres a big TV hoopla for a couple of weeks every January called the Television Critics Association Press Tour usually shorthanded to the TCAs This week during TCA Wurtzel took the chance to haul out math to claim that Netflix is not yet any threat to the big behemoths of broadcasting Except that his numbers may paint a much less rosy picture for the Comcastowned network than he seems to think The reports of our death have been greatly exaggerated Wurtzel told press at the TCAs adding I dont believe theres enough stuff on Netflix that is broad enough and consistent enough to affect us in a meaningful way on a consistent basis So what is Wurtzel basing his assessment on Netflix is a datadriven business They know perfectly well exactly who many people are watching what series when where and on what devices Getting that data if you arent inside Netflix though is notoriously difficult While approximate Nielsen numbers for broadcast and cable TV have been publicly available for years ratings for streaming TV are much harder to come by Neilsen itself began collecting streaming ratings privately through audio sampling back in and a company called Luth Research claimed in that they too had gotten decent Netflix numbers through scraping data from a percentage of viewers using Netflix apps The company NBC worked with to get data Symphony goes with the same general audiosampling tactic Neilsen does Basically someone who is participating in the sample puts an app on their phone That phone listens to whatever it hears in the room and can identify programming from the sound so it can hear if youre watching Game of Thrones or Modern Family or Jessica Jones The app can then report back not just what youre viewing as long as youre not using a headset but when That makes it fairly easy to go through the data and identify if youre viewing content live as it airs or after the fact and by matching it with knowledge about what services carry which content to tell up to a point what service youre using Netflix and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>originals are of course only on Netflix and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>respectively so their sources are easy to identify According to Wurtzel the data from Symphony showed that in its first month on Netflix Jessica Jones averaged million viewers in a key demographic with Master of None drawing million and Narcos pulling million For comparison in that same key demographic NBC workhorse Law and Order SVU brought in about million viewers this week but their Heroes Reborn pulled fewer than four million Netflixs programming is right in the middle of the pack ratingswise for broadcast TV programming and higher than many successful cable shows ratings So why is Wurtzel not concerned Because no one binges forever Although you certainly could if you wanted He told the crowd that Symphonys data showed that viewers do indeed watch an entire season of a new show when its made available to stream on demand but when its over they still need new TV from somewhere And at that point they apparently turn back to the classics By the third week after a major Netflix or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>release Wurtzel said people are watching TV the way that God intended The impact goes away Putting two and two together he concluded I dont believe theres enough stuff on Netflix that is broad enough and consistent enough to affect us in a meaningful way on a consistent basis Perhaps thats why Netflix is doubling its volume of original content in Click to print Opens in new window Why CordCutters Arent Getting The Holy Grail TV Of Streaming Services Just
