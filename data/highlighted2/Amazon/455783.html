commercial rollouts IWear manufacturing and quality issues have been addressed and have been given a clean bill of health by the International Drone Racing Associations IDRA The recent cash raise will provide ample working capital to fund M inventory and Vuzix next generational products set to debut over the H of and into Ive been following Vuzix NASDAQ VUZI closely for over months and the investment story has never been this exciting Intel NASDAQ INTC corporate invested m in Vuzix in January which provided Vuzix with critical capital to develop new augmented reality products and expand manufacturing capacity Intels investment and involvement in Vuzixs next generation augmented reality hardware called the M image featured above is a game changer for the company and the enterprise companies that Vuzix supports The M CPU board featured on the bottom in the image above is much slimmer than its predecessor the M but will deliver a remarkable improvement in overall computing power According to Vuzixs June investor presentation the M powered by Intel Inside will deliver times the computing power of the M An announcement on Thursday also highlighted handsfree voice recognition technology that will also play a critical role for Vuzixs enterprise end users Consistent with the Q conference call in May Vuzix has begun shipping M units to VIP customers The initial M engineering units will come with varying degrees of support in exchange for between and per unit which represents a significant premium from the list price Intels m investment also went towards building Vuzixs new square foot manufacturing facility The manufacturing facility is focused on waveguide development as well as the final staging process for other products including the Vuzix iWear On June th Vuzix announced that the company has entered into a collaboration agreement with a global consumer electronics and mobile firm to develop and supply Vuzix seethrough optics technologies Vuzix is expected to receive a minimum of for the companys effort to develop functioning prototypes leading to potential commercialization for volume production by the customer for mid This agreement is significant for Vuzix for several reasons First and foremost the agreement validates Vuzixs waveguide technology as a goto market option for the consumer smart glass marketplace Second of all this agreement with a major Tier OEM if it ultimately leads to volume production has the potential to drive figure annual revenue amounts beginning as early as the middle of Lastly all signs continue to point towards Vuzix delivering waveguide technology to a leading Tier Korean based OEM most likely Samsung or LG under this agreement which is consistent with my Seeking Alpha article dated March th Intels m investment in Vuzix in January was predicated on advancing Vuzixs waveguide optics and displays for fashion based smart glasses Intels deal with Vuzix closely followed a multiyear agreement with Luxottica NYSE LUX owner of the Oakley brand in December to deliver fashionable smart glasses In March the Wall Street Journal published a r eport that Intel would likely offer its augmented reality smart glass design to other manufacturers and hinted that Intel and collaborating with Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT on the project One person briefed on Intels headset plans said it is collaborating with Microsoft a spokesman for the software company declined to comment WSJ March During Vuzixs QA portion of the presentation at LD Micro Main Event conference in December Vuzixs CEO Paul Travers referred to Intel as potential OEM in reference to waveguides Travers comments on Intel should not come as a big surprise after Vuzixs November Q highlighted over worth of waveguide display engine shipments to a related third party Intel Intel invested in Vuzix to further the development of the companys waveguide technology Intel has a multiyear agreement with Luxottica focused on fashion and smart glasses Intel purchased over from Vuzix in the September ending quarter Intels augmented reality project includes collaborations from Microsoft and the reference design is being shopped to potential OEMs according to the Wall Street Journal From my vantage point an OEM deal between Vuzix with Intel is on the table however the other company on the other end of the table remains up in the air Vuzix Iwear High Quality Superior Optics And Fit For Drones Vuzixs iWear video headphones which were destined to arrive and ship into various markets was delayed several times and production is still below full capacity based on my visit to Rochester manufacturing facility on June th That being said the number of iWear units being reviewed for quality and final staging at the Rochester facility has increased from a few dozen in early April to over units as of June th The iWear is now selling on Vuzixs website without delays and is also listed for sale on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and FPVaces The image below taken on June th depicts hundreds of iWear units being reviewed in the final staging on the left hand portion of manufacturing area The delay in the commercial rollout of the Vuzix iWear may have had unintended consequences that might actually turn out to be bullish for Vuzixs bottom line Vuzixs initial target market for the iWear was video games and movie lovers since the iWear is an easy plug and play with virtually any device ranging from a Bluray player to your smartphone The manufacturing and quality issues that plagued the iWear have resulted in even crisper optics and a partnership with the International Done Racing Association IDRAco that was announced on July th The partnership with the IDRA will begin to bear immediate fruit as Vuzixs iWear is set to be front and center at the US Drone Racing Championship held in New York City August th and th Ive had an opportunity to speak directly with both cofounders of the IDRA Charles Zablan Vice President of Marketing and Justin Haggerty CEO First and foremost the IDRA takes their business very seriously and is focused on developing a business model centered on an experience for fans viewers and participants like no other Justin Haggerty CEO of the IDRA is already deep in the planning process and is working diligently to finalize the IDRA racing events for to maximize the impact for fans drone racing competitors as well as the IDRA brand and business results The Vuzix iWear is a game changer in drone racing Combined with Amimon Connexs ProSight p HD camera and transmitter the iWear erases the latency and poor transmission issues that many drone goggles experience With milliseconds of latency and crystal clear vision iWear will make pilots faster races quicker and a more immersive experience for online viewers Justin Haggerty Founder and CEO of the International Drone Racing Association Source Vuzix Press Release Vuzixs iWear technology is a perfect partner for drone flyers and drone racing competitors When paired with Amimon Connexs Prosight p HD camera and transmitter Vuzixs iWear is heads and shoulders above other drone goggles The number of registered drone pilots is growing at an incredible pace with the number of pilots increasing over in less than a year from to The national spotlight that IDRA will bring to the sport and business of drone racing in August will be a big win for Vuzix in terms of brand recognition and in terms of follow through orders for Vuzix iWear Are Wall Street Analysts Expectations Too Conservative For Vuzix The two Wall Street analysts that cover Vuzix remain upbeat on the companys product roadmap but remain largely conservative in their estimates for I believe their cautious approach is well warranted after Vuzixs disappointing finish in that resulted in a hangover for first half of as well Vuzixs results were impacted by the painful rollout of the Vuzix iWear video headphones that have been delayed almost a year versus expectations set out in the spring of The announcement of Vuzixs second generation M cannibalized sales of the M as many of Vuzixs customers delayed implementations resulting in anemic sales over the past few quarters Chardan sees Vuzix delivering between and m of revenue from the M this year which is equivalent to approximately and units sold On the iWear side of the business Chardan sees Vuzix shipping between m and in or between and units In terms of quarterly sales Chardan is forecasting m in Q m in Q and m in Q Rodman and Renshaw forecasts Vuzix delivering m of revenue in Q m in Q and m in Q Q sales estimates are bolstered by expectations surrounding the iWear however revenue by product was not provided in the analysts report Chardan for months now has been calling out the elephant in the room Vuzixs cash balance Over the last several months the report has read something along these lines only a few quarters of runway at the current burn The Elephant In The Room Vuzixs Cash Balance After Vuzix reported disappointing Q results and telegraphed Q results that will be stronger than Q the biggest eyesore on Vuzixs balance sheet was the cash position Vuzixs Q cash balance was down to m or enough to fund operations for through the end of assuming sales did not ramp up over the remainder the year and the company failed to convert over m of iWear and M inventory into sales and cash In a surprising move Vuzix announced an offering for m shares of common stock at with an additional shares available for overallotment The deal is expected to bring the company approximately m of net cash assuming the allotment shares are sold According to an interview with Wall Street Analyzer on July th Vuzixs CEO Paul Travers indicated that the recent financing led by Oppenheimer was way oversold which leads me to believe the overallotment of shares will be sold as well Some investors that I have spoken to were upset with the equity offering One of the main discussion points was the price and investors have short memories that VUZI was trading below after the conference call in May Vuzixs average closing share price over the last trading days prior to equity offering was and over the last trading days it was The offering which was priced at falls within the average daily close over the past and trading days Other investors were upset about the offering itself Why would Vuzix proceed with an offering if the companys management has been adamant that cash was sufficient to fund operations Management expected cash on hand plus the conversion of inventory to be sufficient to fund operations I still believe Vuzix could have proceeded without raising cash but why would the Board of Directors place financial handcuffs on the management team Vuzix is in the midst of two very exciting product deployments with a rd one set to come online before the end of the year The company made the right choice to raise cash even if shares took a shortterm hit after the financing news was announced I asked Vuzixs CFO Grant Russell about the cash position during the Q conference and Grant responded that if the business exploded there may be a need for some additional working capital Ultimately if the business exploded because its finally running up the hockey stick that were all hoping for There may be a need for some additional working capital Vuzix Q CC Transcript via Seeking Alpha The equity offering resulted in less than a dilution for all shareholders including the management team which owns over of the company The m of cash that will be coming in after the deal closes on July th will provide liquidity to fund M inventory waveguide capital expenditures and financial resources for the launch of Vuzixs monocular waveguide based M and the binocular waveguide based B smart glasses in Vuzixs book of business boasts over customers including over Fortune companies Over the last several months Ive had meaningful discussions with several of Vuzixs biggest partners including APX Labs XOEye Apprentice Field Suites and Pristine as well as Vuzixs newest board member Paul Boris head of Manufacturing Industries General Electric NYSE GE Digital Vuzixs partners are seeing pilot programs being converted into commercial rollouts Pilot programs play a critical role to validate the return on investment NYSE ROI for potential customers Pilot programs can vary in terms of number units or the length of the program and each pilot program is different and customer specific XOEye deployed Vuzix M smart glasses to Lee Company HVAC over the last to months and has already seen a demonstrated ROI of for every invested in smart glasses Given our large deployment with Lee Company early this year we are now starting to see what ROI looks like over hundreds of smart glass users over a meaningful amount of time So far Lee is seeing a ROI per dollar invested in our technology This is a good start and we expect to see this number improve over the remainder of the year Aaron Salow CEO and CoFounder of XOEye Forrester Research published a research report in April focused on How Enterprise Smart Glasses Will Drive Workforce Enablement The report outlines todays smart glasses hardware manufacturers including Vuzix as well as the key software players in enterprise smart glasses Most if not all of the key software players in the enterprise smart glasses industry are Vuzix partners and several of these companies I have had meaningful discussions with over the last several months including APX Labs Pristine and XOEye The top enterprise software players in enterprise smart glasses are not household names and are likely unknown by anyone outside of the industry However a closer look at the collective book of business for a handful of Vuzixs partners is downright impressive if not unbelievable APX Labs A Virginia USAbased company that boasts relationships with out of the largest companies by market cap including over a dozen Fortune companies APX Labs customers include General Electric Boeing NYSE BA Tesla NASDAQ TSLA Merck NYSE MRK Johnson Johnson NYSE JNJ Baker Hughes NYSE BHI Applied Materials NASDAQ AMAT Jabil Circuit NYSE JBL and Shell RDSA RDSB Jabil Circuit is the manufacturer of Vuzixs M smart glasses and is also a customer of APX Labs which I thought was noteworthy and interesting as well I spoke with APX Labs CEO Brian Ballard and checked in on what he is seeing in the industry GEs involvement as an investor in APX Labs as well as his thoughts on Vuzixs M smart glasses Customer awareness levels continue to grow and many of our customers are in various cycles within the deployment process Behind the scenes large organizations are working closely with procurement software developers and smart glasses hardware providers to move from pilots to deployments As you know Paul Boris of GE recently joined the Vuzix Board and GE Ventures is an investor in APX labs Can you tell me what it is like to work with GE GE Ventures has been an incredible partner and has helped our business in countless ways In particular they do so much for their own businesses by having access to a broad network of startups that are relevant to what GE produces Vuzix will be launching its next generation smart glasses the M in just a few months What are your thoughts on new Vuzix hardware We have no greater dependence than on the quality of our hardward partners and they all are evolving their products with feedback from customers I am particularly very excited about ergonomic design and mounting options of the Vuzix M Lastly how big is the smart glasses industry for APX Labs and the other hardware and software players in the market The enterprise market for smart glasses is enormous and reflecting that opportunity it takes a lot of work to bring a new market into play Brian Ballard APX Labs Founder CEO XOEye A Tennessee USAbased company that focuses on HVAC oil and gas and automotive customers and field service workers XOEye worked with Vuzix and Lee Company to deploy a unit order to help HVAC workers improve customer satisfaction and engagement as well as building a howto repair video database for reference in the field Aaron Salow CEO and CoFounder at XOEye described for me the closed network for the smart glasses and how every image taken is cataloged and linked to a service technician Aaron was kind of enough to share his thoughts on what XOEye is seeing within the enterprise smart glasses industry We are seeing midmarket business leaders in field service investing in smart glasses due to a serious need when it comes to a growing skilled trades gap and need to differentiate from their competition These markets are ripe for disruption but typically slow to act so the speed at which they are deploying such leading edge technology is evidence of the massive problem they have and their need to solve it quickly We are happy to partner with these underserved customers by partnering with them to provide a simple robust wearable technology solution that really worksAaron Salow CEO and CoFounder of XOEye Pristine A Texas USAbased company focused on insurance inspection and audits field services life sciences as well as industrial and manufacturing environments Pristines CEO Peter Evans is closing several deals a month and has seen planned commercial rollouts increase from units to over units for several customers that operate in various industries Apprentice Field Suite A New Jersey USAbased company that focuses on Pharmaceutical Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing The company boasts relationships with out of the top BioPharma companies of the top CMOs contract manufacturing organization and major pharma equipment manufacturer During Vuzixs June th annual shareholder meeting Apprentice Field Suite announced that the company is set to deploy Vuzixs M smart glasses with Fortune BioPharma companies Ubimax A Bremen Germanybased company that focuses on industrial wearable computing solutions across a plethora of industries UbiMax solutions address serviceable markets including logistics manufacturing remote support construction and service and maintenance and health care UbiMax customers include DHL Daimler Volkswagen Ricoh Samsung SICK AG and several others UbiMax announced last week via the companys twitter account that they were rolling out four smart glasses projects for four major Fortune companies around the globe Another customer that not only prefers Vuzix over Google Glass but is now using Vuzixs augmented reality smart glasses at their Homburg Germany facility is Bosch A November article highlighted the preference of Bosch a multinational engineering and electronics company for Vuzix smart glasses over Google Glasses From our perspective this Vuzix is the best smart glass for logistics Google glasses are made for consumers Vuzix glasses are more stable made for industry use which is important in a warehouse Bosch via Glass App Source Boschs affinity for Vuzix hardware was centered around logistics and the warehouse in However a special on Bosch featuring Vuzixs augmented reality smart glasses within an automotive manufacturing facility was broadcasted on the national news in Germany on July The link to the BoschVuzix smart glasses story can be found here Vuzix has over qualified volume opportunities expected to close in and has over active leads in the funnel According to one of my industry contacts Vuzix will easily sell thousands of M from pilot programs alone in Vuzix is scheduled to produce M units in with volume production beginning as early as August or as late as September The first group of customers that will receive M EVT units are VIP accounts M EVT shipments began in late June and carry a price tag between and per unit The next group of customers will receive M DVT units beginning in July and continuing into August The DVT units will carry a premium versus the cost of M production units list price but will be priced well below the EVT unit cost Vuzix is finally executing on its promises after a painful year for investors that featured delays and manufacturing issues surrounding the iWear and disappointing smart glass sales associated with the legacy M device Vuzixs iWear is now being manufacturing in volume with high quality with specifications and performance that are enamored by the International Drone Racing Association Vuzixs M manufacturing is on track EVT units have begun shipping to VIP customers and key software partners continue to see a steady flow of new deals as well as planned commercial volume deployments The secondary offering announced last week that will close on July th will provide Vuzix with ample liquidity to fulfill M orders Vuzixs waveguide OEM agreement announced in June that is expected to run through a leading Tier Korean based company This OEM agreement validates Vuzixs technology and puts the company on the map as a supplier for consumer based smart glasses Vuzixs relationship with Intel could blossom into a second waveguide OEM agreement at any time Vuzixs relationship with Intel should not be discounted by investors as an arms length relationship surrounding Intels go to augmented reality gotomarket strategy that should involve Vuzixs waveguide Shares of VUZI are trading below their recent highs but the momentum building in the enterprise sector for augmented reality hardware and solutions is picking up steam The elephant in the room has now been addressed and with ample liquidity a refined iWear manufacturing process coupled with a Tier M manufacturing partner which will significantly reduce the risk of another serious operational hiccup like we witnessed over the past several months I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from
