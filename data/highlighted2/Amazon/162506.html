(Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The answer is Computer Sciences Corp. ( NYSE : CSC ) Having someone who knows government contracting , like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , willing to represent it to government agencies is potentially a very big deal , for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> if not for CSC . Computer Sciences has long been one of the biggest players in U.S. government computer contracting.Government contracting has a completely different set-up than private contracting.There are huge costs up-front, not just in schmoozing bureaucrats but in demonstrating capabilities.All these investments must be made up on the back-end, which is the real reason costs are so high.It's not the graft, it's the system.CSC understands this system, lives inside it, and really has difficulty working outside it.But it is being pressured on costs just like everyone else , and so it has brought in a low-cost cloud partner , specifically <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , in order to stay in the game . These relationships change government contracting in profound ways.Deals made through IBM and other traditional vendors usually involved sales of equipment, with the main contractor taking a cut off the top.IBM sold the hardware and software, in other words, and CSC installed and managed the system as general contractor.Cloud deals have compelling economics , and CSC has now brought <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's nose under the domestic contracting tent , much as the CIA brought it under the defense contracting tent . The latest deal is a good example.Unlike the CIA deal, this one involves application services, not just big data manipulation.Thus a third partner was added, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ).Each partner has a defined role.AWS offers the low-cost cloud infrastructure.Microsoft offers the software applications layer.CSC does the system integration job and works to get the business.This does not make CSC itself a buy.CSC is not a growth stock.Federal government contracting has not been a growth business during the current Administration, not the way it was in the previous one.CSC sales have been marching slowly downward, there are quarters where it's completely unprofitable.But it pays a steady dividend, currently 23 cents, and the market cap is just two-thirds of annual revenue, which is ridiculously cheap for a company involved in technology.The deal keeps Microsoft at the FAA, but it must be galling for the company to be a third party here, since it also owns a cloud, Azure.Microsoft is a hold on this news , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> a buy , and CSC , for now , is an ignore . Should the political winds change , and contracting grow rapidly again , CSC is in a great position to take advantage due to the low-cost structure <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has provided it . If Jeb Bush becomes President, in other words, buy CSC.As it is, taxpayers are the primary beneficiaries of this deal.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Their government will be operating at <i>lower</i> cost .  (Surprise) </span>Government had been an IBM-dominated field for decades.Now it faces low-cost cloud competition shepherded by a company that knows how to get contracts.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This is just one <i>more</i> reason why , despite IBM now selling at 9.66 times earnings , and <i>less</i> than 1.5 times its annual sales , I would not touch it , if for no other reason than it was left out of the FAA contract .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>As the cloud rises IBM falls , companies like CSC and Microsoft fight to hang on , while pure cloud plays like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continue to benefit thanks to their low cost structure .
