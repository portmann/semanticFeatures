quarter are down which may give investors reason to bid down the price Apple will release new products this fall that will produce record highs in earnings and profit for investors Apples stock will climb to by the end of which is over appreciation in the stock price Reading different news and financial website you can find three stories a day telling you to buy Apple and at the same time find three articles to sell the stock On any given day I hear the next price of Apple AAPL to be per share and another for it to drop more I understand why investors are confused and dont know where to go As an analyst I reviewed Apples first quarterly financial report and I liked most of what I saw Then the naysayers in the marketplace ripped Apples drop in overall earnings and their projections with a massive amount of press reporting to encourage the drop in stock price from on April to a close on April of I want to review the facts and reassess the strength and quality of the company and why investors should be buying this stock as it is at sale price Some analysts compared this years quarterly revenue of billion to last years same quarter of billion and cried the loss of billion of revenue I remember Apple just released its S series iPhones in the US in the fall of and customers were still trying to update into first quarter of Apple also expanded sales to other countries that were not able to get them in Fast forward a year and Apple is preparing to release its next iPhone this fall but sales exceeded expectations for this quarter Although the revenue was down this is part of the cycle of a new product last year and this year we are seeing the prerelease waiting period This was not a bad quarter for Apple just some analysts did not bring in all the facts for their readers The net profit was down this quarter as well Read the paragraph above but let us put this into perspective The company reported net income of billion in days Not too many companies are doing that consistently Looking back at the year between releases for Apples product line had a similar result with revenue of billion and a net profit of billion See the second quarterly report from for this comparison as well Apples diluted per share profit in was whereas in it was When we compare years between product releases Apple showed an improvement in profit per share Company A has a book price of per share while company B has a book share of Company A has a earnings per share EPS where company B has a EPS Company A has a pricetoearnings PE rate of while company B has a PE of A third company has a book price of the EPS is and PE rate is Company A is Apple Company B is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN and Company C is Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Apples earnings per share is better than both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Microsoft as this is actually company data from their financial reports Earning to is much better than or per share Apple wins Apples PE rate is compared to the overinflated rate for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>of and Microsofts is over x as high as Apple What we see here is Apple is much more conservatively priced I do not want to take anything away from either company as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>reported its quarterly report with net sales of billion and net income of million for a per diluted share Refer to the above Apples revenue of billion and billion of net income <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is not in the same ballpark Even the earnings per share Apple reported while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was Apples gross margin was percent this quarter compared to percent in the yearago quarter Still strong even with the reduced earnings level There were some cost savings with the reduction of billion as the company controlled costs better than anticipated to keep the gross margin that high with the loss on income Apple also is increasing their returns to investors as the company authorized an increase of billion to the companys program to return capital to shareholders Under the expanded program Apple plans to return a cumulative total of billion of cash by the end of March The company also increased its share repurchase authorization to billion from the billion level announced last year As the stock price has dropped Apple will probably increase the shares it is buying now with a price under The company will have the option to release these shares at a later date when the price moves higher As the company buys these shares off the market now at the lower prices it will help support a higher price as investors wanting to buy Apple stock will bid the price up and create a higher demand Secondly with less shares on the market the earnings per share will increase as the profits are dividend by less shares outstanding Apple increased the quarterly dividend by to per share payable on May to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May Apple did provide its guidance for its fiscal third quarter Revenue between billion and billion gross margin between percent and percent operating expenses between billion and billion and other incomeexpense of million with a tax rate of percent This last paragraph may have been the target for many analysts to lower their targets on the stock price but Apple has shown the ability to keep the gross margin strong even as earnings slip With this estimate we see the earnings at billion expenses at billion and net profit over billion for the rd quarter I do understand the numbers are trending downward but not without the understanding of the cycle the company is in The fiscal third quarter will be the quarter right before or during the release of the new products The new iPhones tablets watches and laptops will all drives the sales and earning to new highs beating records for earnings and profits Apple has said they will try to release all products to a wider audience with the initial release Apple is a strong company with quality products a growing consumer base that wants the next product from the company Apple has good financials with a billion profit this quarter like the last and multiple quarters before that It has a future release of next generation products coming out this fall that will beat all past sales numbers earnings and net earnings for the company With Apples conservatively priced stock in the mids now and excellent PE and EPS we see Apple with a potential for the stock price to appreciate at least this year meaning the stock price will climb to by the end of Some analysts are calling for and with the record sales of the next generation products out this fall it is likely is conservatively priced Apple is a buy at the price under Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote
