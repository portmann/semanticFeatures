(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>`` As a combined automotive and power storage and power generation company , the potential is there for Tesla to be a trillion-dollar market cap company , '' - Elon Musk Let 's explore the idea that Tesla <b>could</b> be worth $ 1 trillion .  (Uncertainty) </span>The last company to make a serious run at the elusive "Trillion Dollar Valuation" was Apple.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And , of course , it is often said by the Knights Teslar that Tesla <b>could</b> be the next Apple .  (Uncertainty) </span>The Knights Teslar compare Elon Musk to Steve Jobs.The Roadster is the original Mac.The Model 3 will be the iPhone.Just as Apple "disrupted" the personal computing and cell phone industry, so is Tesla disrupting the auto industry (and, now, energy storage, and solar power generation).Comparisons between these companies are difficult, particularly if one is trying to be fair.Apple is a 40-year-old business; Tesla is 13.Apple has a huge ecosystem of complementary product lines, services, and revenue streams; Tesla has a tiny handful.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple had <b>approximately</b> $ 234 billion in 2015 revenues .  (Uncertainty) </span>Tesla had 1/60th that amount.Apple actually benefits to some degree from a depressed share price as it is actively engaged in repurchasing its own stock; Tesla survives only because of its inflated share price and its investors' willingness to accept continued dilution.Taking all that into consideration, it is the approach to a few key ways of doing business that really highlight the differences between Apple and Tesla, and help determine whether Tesla has a chance to be the next Apple.To my mind, the most important comparisons to be made (that are fair to Tesla) are: (1) approach to manufacturing, (2) approach to product development and innovation, and (3) approach to synergistic partnerships.Because there is a great deal of ground to cover on each of these topics, I've decided to focus on only the first of those in this article.As Apple's largest revenue stream comes from the iPhone, and Tesla's from its vehicles, we will primarily focus on these products as the basis for comparison.As most people know, Apple doesn't actually manufacture the iPhone.Apple designs the iPhone, and Apple determines what components will be included in the iPhone.But Apple outsources the actual manufacture of the phone and its components.( Great article here for anyone interested) Apple doesn't even build its own processors.Apple designs its processors, carefully and specifically to run its software, and outsources their production to a capable supplier.Tesla is just the opposite.Not only does Tesla assemble its own final product, but Elon Musk has gone on record that Tesla will strongly consider manufacturing many of the components its final products require.Apple doesn't need, in fact never needed, to develop a manufacturing infrastructure for phones or components.As it turns out, such an infrastructure is a VERY expensive proposition, and a problematic one for makers of consumer goods, be they smartphones or cars.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Demand for consumer goods is , to a large extent , subject to <b>fluctuations</b> in the <i>greater</i> economy and a number of forces outside a manufacturer 's control .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>However, in order to maximize profit, a manufacturer must have the capacity to meet demand when it is peaking.The need for capacity in boom times creates the problem of excess capacity when demand later slacks off.There are fixed costs associated with running any business, and this is particularly true in manufacturing.Apple is able to push this problem across the table to its suppliers and to Foxconn ( OTC:FXCOF ), its manufacturer, ensuring healthy profits for itself even in difficult economic times.As long as Apple can forecast demand with a reasonable level of accuracy, it can maximize its profits and avoid the costs associated with idle factories when demand slows.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Tesla has done the opposite , choosing to take the cost of infrastructure <b>risk</b> on itself .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Granted , the risk to a company the size of Tesla is <b>somewhat</b> small .  (Uncertainty) </span>It is far from efficient at building cars, so excess capacity isn't really a near-term issue.But that will change if the economics of Tesla vehicles ever make sense for the masses and Tesla has to expand capacity.Tesla will have to answer questions like: What will demand be in five years?How many factories do I need to meet that demand?How quickly can they be ramped?What will our product mix look like then?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These are not easy questions to answer , and a wrong bet <b>could</b> seriously cripple a young company .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But there are other reasons Tesla appears to have assumed this <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>First , it is much <i>easier</i> to sell a growth story when you can claim you are supply constrained .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Further , it is much <i>easier</i> to sell the supply-constrained story when you are n't a mature manufacturer .  (Surprise) </span>Second, Elon Musk is a control freak.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>doubt</b> even he would object to that characterization .  (Uncertainty) </span>The idea of delegating something important when the delegation can be avoided is (in his mind) unthinkable.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of course , Elon has never shied away from <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But it is n't just Elon who assumes said <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is everyone employed by and invested in Tesla that takes this <b>risk</b> with him .  (Uncertainty) </span>And it will become a significant one as Tesla matures.We've already discussed that Apple doesn't build either its final product or the components contained therein.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It turns out there is a very good reason for that , beyond just managing capacity <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>As a very interesting case study, Samsung is Apple's largest competitor in the high-end smartphone space.Samsung is also one of Apple's key suppliers (batteries, chipsets and processors, etc.) for the iPhone.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Oddly enough , even though Samsung produces many of the components that go into both its own phones and Apple 's phones , Samsung 's costs to build its flagship models ( S series ) are <i>higher</i> than Apple 's !  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As a result , its margins are quite a bit <i>worse</i> , and its profits significantly <i>lower</i> .  (Surprise) </span>What does this prove?Well, it proves there is no inherent cost advantage in being your own supplier.In fact, maximizing profits is a function of exceptional supply chain management and use of the most efficient resources available for execution.Elon Musk has indicated a willingness and, even, a desire to "vertically integrate" Tesla.While an egregious misuse of the phrase, he even used vertical integration as the excuse to bail out SolarCity.All this despite the example set by all of Tesla's peers in the automotive industry and by the richest and most successful company on the planet.3.The Importance of Core Competency What has Tesla demonstrated to be its strengths?Well, Tesla has shown it is great at designing desirable products.About that there is little question, and in this way it is very much like Apple.Tesla has also shown a remarkable ability to form an emotional connection with its core customer base.This type of connection is the goal of just about every company in the world.In this way, again, Tesla is very much like Apple.Frankly, however, Tesla has shown that it is pretty bad at manufacturing vehicles.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While this <b>might</b> sound like harsh criticism , I assure you it is not .  (Uncertainty) </span>It is hard to manufacture a car.Exceedingly hard.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Elon has confessed as much on <i>more</i> than one occasion .  (Surprise) </span>It would be unreasonable to expect Tesla to be good at it after such a short period of time.But it would also be unreasonable to expect Tesla to get really good at it anytime soon.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It will <b>almost</b> surely get <i>better</i> over time , but it does n't need to get incrementally better .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It needs to get significantly <i>better</i> if it wants to compete for real against the BMW 's ( OTCPK : BAMXY ) , Mercedes ( OTCPK : DDAIF ) , and Audi 's ( OTCPK : AUDVF ) of the world among <i>more</i> than just the wealthiest members of the early adopter crowd .  (Surprise) </span>Manufacturing is not Tesla's core competency, nor is it Apple's.But only one of them chooses to do it in spite of that fact.A REAL Path to Profitability for Tesla?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The manufacturing problems and product defects Tesla has survived with the Model S and Model X simply will not fly for the <i>larger</i> public , and there is no evidence to support the idea that Tesla is becoming an exceptional , or even average , manufacturer of cars .  (Surprise) </span>For Tesla to have any chance of becoming the next Apple over a twenty-year horizon, Tesla would have to focus on what it does well (marketing and design) and leave behind what it does poorly (actually building the cars).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of course , this is unlikely to happen , and it 's <b>almost</b> certainly not going to happen under the leadership of Elon Musk .  (Uncertainty) </span>Rather, Musk is moving the company in the opposite direction.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Tesla is taking on <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> responsibility for the manufacture of its own components , and has even begun talking about increasing its manufacturing capacity by opening new factories overseas .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I 'll save the Knights Teslar the trouble : `` Oh sure , UBR , you know <i>more</i> about this than Elon , right ? ''  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Here is my counter : regardless of who is <i>smarter</i> ( and I 'm not saying it is me , by the way ) , we have different motivations .  (Surprise) </span>As evidenced by the recent proposal to acquire troubled SolarCity by further diluting TSLA investors, Elon views investors as a means to an end, not a group to be protected and served.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>By contrast , as an investor , I <b>believe</b> the primary job of company leadership is to protect and reward shareholders , not push a personal agenda or protect self-interest .  (Uncertainty) </span>And that, dear readers, is yet another difference between Tesla and Apple.A Path to Winning for Tesla Shareholders?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Interestingly enough , one of the bull arguments for going long on TSLA is the idea that the company <b>might</b> one day be a ripe takeover target for another company , such as Apple .  (Uncertainty) </span>In fact, Apple and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) are about the only two names that even seem to make sense from a buyout perspective, as they both have deep pockets and automotive industry aspirations.The arguments that support this are, interestingly enough, that Tesla has a terrific brand image, intensely loyal customer base, and a head start on BEV technology.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite the recent SolarCity announcement , NHTSA safety reporting controversy , and reduced reliability marks from Consumer Reports , let 's <b>assume</b> Tesla 's brand image is solid and untarnished .  (Uncertainty) </span>Given Apple's preference for supply chain management and outsourced manufacturing, what would make Tesla an attractive target for acquisition?The brand?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Does Tesla have a <i>stronger</i> brand than Apple ?  (Surprise) </span>Than Google?Certainly not.At least not according to Forbes.Or Business Insider.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Or Fortune , Statista , BranDirectory , Interbrand , Millward Brown , or any other brand ranking that I <b>could</b> find through a Google search .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In fact , Tesla does n't even have a <i>more</i> valuable brand than Toyota , the only automaker in most top 10 's .  (Surprise) </span>The idea that some white knight will come riding in to purchase Tesla at a premium over its present day valuation is absurd.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The only interest these companies <b>might</b> have in Tesla is picking the meat off the carcass in bankruptcy proceedings .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 'm going to save most of my `` conclusions '' for the Part 2 of this article , which I <b>hope</b> to finish soon .  (Uncertainty) </span>That said, there are two important points for investors to understand today.First, Tesla doesn't operate in an industry that supports the type of margins Apple is able to achieve.Tesla has chosen a production path that further reduces its potential margins, and there is no sign that this is going to change.Rather, Elon Musk will stubbornly ride this train into the abyss before admitting failure and changing course.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Second , no one is coming in to save the day if things start to go <i>worse</i> for Tesla .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Investors who bought TSLA stock in the $ 30 range <b>could</b> end up ok if things start to get rocky .  (Uncertainty) </span>Investors who buy at today's valuation will be in serious trouble.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For anyone in between those extremes ... it <b>might</b> be time to ` get out while gettin 's good ' .  (Uncertainty) </span>This makes Tesla, to use a phrase Elon loves, a "no brainer" long-term short.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The stock 's <b>volatility</b> makes it a dangerous short-term play on either side .  (Uncertainty) </span>On the other hand, Apple is a phenomenal long-term investment.The fortress balance sheet, low near-term earnings expectations based on an underwhelming iPhone 7, already brewing excitement about iPhone 8, unfathomably low PE ratio, and currently depressed share price that can accelerate the company's share buyback give AAPL 20-40% potential upside over the next 18-36 months, with minimal short-term downside from here.In any event, the comparison of Tesla to Apple is like comparing cars to fruit, and investors should understand that the Tesla of today is absolutely not the Apple of tomorrow.Author's note: All of the opinions expressed in this article are mine and are not intended to serve as investment advice.These opinions drive my own investing strategy, and mine alone.Please do your own due diligence and consult with a professional advisor before making any investment decision.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Special thanks to Seeking Alpha contributor Montana Skeptic for his assistance with the `` word-smithing '' and styling of this contribution , and to members of his `` brain trust '' for sharing their criticisms and <b>suggestions</b> prior to submission .
