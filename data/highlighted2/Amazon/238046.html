Cable companies must build out the physical network infrastructure and connect each customer's home to their cable network as well as pay content licensing fees to the major media companies to carry their channels.Netflix on the other hand is able to piggyback on existing networks to deliver substantially similar content.For example, in its last fiscal year Netflix had 57M streaming customers and spent $69M on capital expenditures.Comcast on the other hand had 27M customers but spent $7.4B on capital expenditures.The difference is even more stark when you take into account that Netflix is a fast growing company so its capital investment levels are likely being spent with an eye toward providing additional capacity for future growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We think that this arrangement will not continue <b>indefinitely</b> and the recent moves by Comcast are a precursor to a future where cord cutting , streaming users are forced to shoulder the costs of the required network infrastructure spending .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>could</b> be data surcharges like Comcast looks to want to begin to implement .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>could</b> be lobbying to weaken net neutrality rules and then force streaming providers to pay surcharges to have their traffic delivered with those streaming services likely being forced to pass on those charges to customers .  (Uncertainty) </span>Whatever the future looks like we don't see how Netflix and others can continue to essentially freeload on the billions of dollars of infrastructure spending done by incumbent telcos.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This raises the question of what the costs of streaming versus cable <b>might</b> look like in the future .  (Uncertainty) </span>We put together a table below that shows the cost comparisons for a mid-tier Comcast cable package versus a cord cutter streaming "bundle".<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We are <b>assuming</b> for the cable package that you get some type of movie channel package for free and are a good enough negotiator or complainer to get the cable company to keep providing that to you for free .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We also <b>assumed</b> a $ 10/month charge for a DVR capable cable box .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For the cord cutter we <b>assumed</b> you 'd want Hulu for current TV shows , Netflix for its large back catalog and movies , and the ESPN streaming service for live sports .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> the table below is as about an apples to apples comparison as you can get .  (Uncertainty) </span>As you can see the costs are quite comparable if there is a data surcharge.If things continue as they are and the streaming players are able to essentially use the telco's infrastructure for free the cord cutter "bundle" is only as about half as expensive.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Right now it 's really no <b>surprise</b> that streaming is eating into traditional cable 's market share .  (Surprise) </span>You can get pretty much the same exact content for just about half the price.The reason?You basically aren't being billed for the billions of dollars the telcos are spending on infrastructure.If you're a Netflix shareholder or even a Netflix user it is worth thinking long and hard about how much longer this cost arrangement will hold.Additionally, the major media companies seem to finally have united behind Hulu as their tool to force competition into the streaming market and raise prices on content costs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix 's days as a low-cost streaming provider <b>may</b> soon be numbered and the company 's expenses and charges for its service <b>may</b> soon start to rise .
