( NASDAQ : NFLX ) | Seeking Alpha Ben Strubel , Strubel Investment Management ( 167 clicks ) Nov. 16 , 2015 5:10 PM ET | About : Netflix , Inc. ( NFLX ) , Includes : CBS , CMCSA , CMCSK , DIS , FOX , FOXA , TWX , VIA , VIAB by : Ben Strubel Time Warner 's potential investment in Hulu means <i>stronger</i> competition for Netflix .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Content costs are still rising and the <i>deeper</i> Hulu 's pockets get the <i>more</i> costs are likely to continue to go up .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Comcast 's push toward data caps <b>could</b> make streaming as expensive as traditional cable .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Two recent news items , one from Hulu and one from Comcast ( NASDAQ : CMCSA ) ( NASDAQ : CMCSK ) , should give pause to Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) shareholders and give traditional media company investors some reasons for <b>optimism</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Comcast just announced it was expanding its usage of caps on broadband usage and news leaked that Time Warner ( NYSE : TWX ) <b>may</b> invest in Hulu .  (Uncertainty) </span>Last Friday several news reports leaked that Time Warner was interested in buying a 25% stake in Hulu that would value the company around $5B or $6B.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In a recent article we argued that Hulu is worth <i>closer</i> to $ 8B , but the $ 5-6B number is certainly a huge jump over the last transaction in 2012 , which valued the company at only $ 2B .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The transaction would give Hulu even <i>more</i> content firepower as the company would be owned by four of the top six media conglomerates : Disney ( NYSE : DIS ) , Twenty-First Century Fox ( NASDAQ : FOX ) ( NASDAQ : FOXA ) , NBC-Universal/Comcast and Time Warner .  (Surprise) </span>Of the major media companies only Viacom (NASDAQ: VIA ) (NASDAQ: VIAB ) and CBS (NYSE: CBS ) wouldn't hold an equity stake in Hulu.Most importantly, however, is the deal should finally signal to investors that the major media companies are serious about their commitment to Hulu and using it as a tool to compete with Netflix.Too often in the past media companies have been hesitant to embrace change and new methods of content delivery, but this time it looks like they finally have their act together to unite behind a successful, consumer-friendly platform.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The chart below is what should <b>scare</b> Netflix and Netflix investors .  (Uncertainty) </span>Highlighted in yellow are the total content library balances as a percent of revenues and the YoY revenue growth compared to YoY content cost growth.All figures are taken from the company's 10-Ks .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We can see that content costs have been growing <i>faster</i> than revenues have been growing for the past three years .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , you will notice that the difference is slowing and , as the business becomes <i>larger</i> , content costs are increasing a <i>slower</i> rate .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So , Netflix on the surface may seem like nothing to <b>worry</b> about .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A business becoming <i>more</i> profitable as it scales up .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Except now we <b>may</b> have an even <i>more</i> well-funded Hulu competing for content with Netflix and driving up prices .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Remember that Hulu just recently outbid Netflix for both Seinfeld and Empire.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With Hulu now <b>possibly</b> having Time Warner 's financial backing it 's likely we will see content costs increase as bidding becomes <i>fiercer</i> and Hulu 's pockets become <i>deeper</i> and <i>more</i> entwined with the traditional media companies .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Perhaps even <i>more</i> <b>worrying</b> to Netflix than Hulu is the ongoing efforts of the telecommunication companies to restrict data usage .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Recently Comcast announced it was dramatically expanding its 300GB per month data cap on broadband internet.The new data caps will now apply to many of Comcast's customers in the company's southern markets.Users will now be required to pay $10 per extra 50GB used per month or pay an additionally surcharge of $30-$35 per month to get truly unlimited data.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If or when data caps like this expand to <i>more</i> markets it <b>may</b> dramatically change the demand for streaming services .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Right now Netflix , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime , Hulu , and other streaming services have an enormous cost advantage over traditional television . Cable companies must build out the physical network infrastructure and connect each customer's home to their cable network as well as pay content licensing fees to the major media companies to carry their channels.Netflix on the other hand is able to piggyback on existing networks to deliver substantially similar content.For example, in its last fiscal year Netflix had 57M streaming customers and spent $69M on capital expenditures.Comcast on the other hand had 27M customers but spent $7.4B on capital expenditures.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The difference is even <i>more</i> stark when you take into account that Netflix is a fast growing company so its capital investment levels are likely being spent with an eye toward providing additional capacity for future growth .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We think that this arrangement will not continue <b>indefinitely</b> and the recent moves by Comcast are a precursor to a future where cord cutting , streaming users are forced to shoulder the costs of the required network infrastructure spending .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>could</b> be data surcharges like Comcast looks to want to begin to implement .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>could</b> be lobbying to weaken net neutrality rules and then force streaming providers to pay surcharges to have their traffic delivered with those streaming services likely being forced to pass on those charges to customers .  (Uncertainty) </span>Whatever the future looks like we don't see how Netflix and others can continue to essentially freeload on the billions of dollars of infrastructure spending done by incumbent telcos.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This raises the question of what the costs of streaming versus cable <b>might</b> look like in the future .  (Uncertainty) </span>We put together a table below that shows the cost comparisons for a mid-tier Comcast cable package versus a cord cutter streaming "bundle".<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We are <b>assuming</b> for the cable package that you get some type of movie channel package for free and are a good enough negotiator or complainer to get the cable company to keep providing that to you for free .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We also <b>assumed</b> a $ 10/month charge for a DVR capable cable box .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For the cord cutter we <b>assumed</b> you 'd want Hulu for current TV shows , Netflix for its large back catalog and movies , and the ESPN streaming service for live sports .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> the table below is as about an apples to apples comparison as you can get .  (Uncertainty) </span>As you can see the costs are quite comparable if there is a data surcharge.If things continue as they are and the streaming players are able to essentially use the telco's infrastructure for free the cord cutter "bundle" is only as about half as expensive.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Right now it 's really no <b>surprise</b> that streaming is eating into traditional cable 's market share .  (Surprise) </span>You can get pretty much the same exact content for just about half the price.The reason?You basically aren't being billed for the billions of dollars the telcos are spending on infrastructure.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If you 're a Netflix shareholder or even a Netflix user it is worth thinking long and hard about how much <i>longer</i> this cost arrangement will hold .  (Surprise) </span>Additionally, the major media companies seem to finally have united behind Hulu as their tool to force competition into the streaming market and raise prices on content costs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix 's days as a low-cost streaming provider <b>may</b> soon be numbered and the company 's expenses and charges for its service <b>may</b> soon start to rise .
