( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is expanding its business loan services to its online vendors in eight new countries . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To avoid liability <b>risk</b> , vendors are chosen by invitation only , based on past sales and inventory data which <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has on each vendor . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Alibaba has opened a new online bank that will make business loans to its small and medium business vendors on Tmall and Taobao.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Alibaba chairman Jack Ma has called for <i>more</i> US vendors to sell through Alibaba 's sites to Chinese consumers , who want <i>more</i> overseas goods .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has n't been successful in China , but it <b>could</b> have <i>better</i> opportunities in India if it moves quickly and strongly now . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) is opening up its regular online vendor business loan service in eight new countries . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Up until now only US - and Japan-based <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> vendors <b>could</b> take out a business loan with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>I think this is an excellent way to support and encourage current online vendor members to expand their business , which in the end raises their sales volumes and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's revenues . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Also , I can see this move making <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <i>more</i> attractive to new business owners looking to set up an online shop . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has built a huge online space where vendors everywhere can find customers , but now equally huge companies like Alibaba ( NYSE : BABA ) are stepping up their game and expanding <i>more</i> internationally . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>In Q1 2015 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's North America net sales and operating income grew 24 % and 78 % , respectively . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , international segment net sales slipped 1.75 % and the operating loss grew <i>larger</i> from a minus $ 33 million to a minus $ 76 million .  (Surprise) </span>Of course , some of that decline is due to the strong dollar , but it does show <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> needs to shore up its international business . One way to incentivize vendors to join <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is to have the option of getting business loans once online sales are good enough . The company has to start now to solidify the potential growth in vendor numbers so that they will be there in the future.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> vendors in the UK , France , Germany , Spain , Italy , Canada , India and China can now apply for a business loan . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's not dumb - it still has to separate out the real business opportunities to avoid taking on unnecessary <b>risk</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>It does this by only offering lending to select vendors by invitation only.When <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> started making business loans in 2012 , it was always <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> choosing and approaching suitable vendors - not the other way around . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If a vendor had increasing sales and good inventory turnover , they would catch the attention of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , and get an email from the company saying the vendor is eligible for a loan up to a certain amount . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Up until now it has been successful.Among the new countries, the big ones for me are China and India based on sheer retail volume potential.These will also be the hardest fought, in my opinion.Alibaba is the largest e-commerce company in China , similar to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in scale and current market cap ( <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> - $ 201.3 billion vs Alibaba - $ 207.8 billion ) . In early June, Alibaba chairman Jack Ma did a series of speaking engagements in a number of major US cities to call for US vendors to sell into China through Alibaba's two e-commerce sites, Tmall and Taobao.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>He said he was n't planning to `` take over the US '' , but just the same , I think <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> management was listening intently , and <b>probably</b> decided to accelerate its vendor business loan service expansion to start getting ready to compete <i>more</i> in these eight countries as well as the US . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If I just confine my argument here to concerning China 's internet market alone , that would still be considered massive .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Already , the number of Chinese internet users is closing in on 700 million , which is <i>more</i> than double the users in the US , and that 's with only <i>less</i> than 50 % internet penetration of the total Chinese population .  (Surprise) </span>If you think the US internet market is big, imagine potentially 3-4 times that just within China in the future.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has n't really been successful in taking a sizeable market share of China 's e-commerce sector . The two biggest operators, Alibaba and JD.com, pretty much dominate that market.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As a sign of their overwhelming control , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has even opened a store on Alibaba 's Tmall site to reach <i>more</i> Chinese consumers . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Another event that will make it even <i>more</i> difficult for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in China is Alibaba has just announced opening a 100 % online bank called MYbank that will concentrate on lending to small and medium businesses as well as entrepreneurs . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of course , these vendors will first have to be selling on Tmall and Taobao - and successfully at that - to show they are good credit <b>risks</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Alibaba 's financial arm , Ant Financial , has been offering business loans to Alibaba vendors for years , and to-date has financed over $ 64 billion in loans to <i>more</i> than 1.6 million small businesses .  (Surprise) </span>Similar to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Ant Financial and the new online bank look at the financial , transaction and inventory ordering data it has on a vendor to assess their creditworthiness . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For the most part , it has been successful , with Ant Financial 's bad-debt ratio at <i>less</i> than 1.5 % , comparatively low for Chinese banking .  (Surprise) </span>My view is that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is going to keep on struggling in China . Just like in a classic Chinese chess, or Go, game, before you try to take too much territory space in your opponent's area, you first consolidate firm control of your own.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Chairman Jack Ma fought an <i>earlier</i> battle with eBay ( NASDAQ : EBAY ) to protect Alibaba 's territory as the e-commerce auction site attempted to expand into China .  (Surprise) </span>In the end, eBay acquiesced in its failed business expansion there.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> should n't give up on the China market altogether , though . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are millions of consumers who are looking for and appreciate overseas goods that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> potentially supply . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Unfortunately, that's exactly why Alibaba chairman Jack Ma was visiting the US- to invite and assemble those US vendors to his sites to satisfy that Chinese demand.Whether <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has a big chance of success in India is whole other ballgame . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>China 's big e-commerce sites will be moving to take market share in India as well , but at least they 're not the home team , either , so <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has a <i>better</i> chance to compete . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>India has <b>almost</b> matched the number of US internet users .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>There <b>could</b> be much <i>more</i> business potential for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> because only 20 % of India 's population have internet presently and e-commerce is not as developed and pervasive yet . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> should push into India as much as <b>possible</b> to capture market share . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>I think it would create a solid base for further growth in the region as the rest of Southeast Asia develops and modernizes along with India.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Source : <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> : Business Loans To Online Vendors In China <b>May</b> Not Be So Fruitful Disclosure : I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned , and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours .
