style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is expanding its business loan services to its online vendors in eight new countries To avoid liability risk vendors are chosen by invitation only based on past sales and inventory data which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has on each vendor Alibaba has opened a new online bank that will make business loans to its small and medium business vendors on Tmall and Taobao Alibaba chairman Jack Ma has called for more US vendors to sell through Alibabas sites to Chinese consumers who want more overseas goods <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>hasnt been successful in China but it could have better opportunities in India if it moves quickly and strongly now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN is opening up its regular online vendor business loan service in eight new countries Up until now only US and Japanbased <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>vendors could take out a business loan with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>I think this is an excellent way to support and encourage current online vendor members to expand their business which in the end raises their sales volumes and Amazons revenues Also I can see this move making <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>more attractive to new business owners looking to set up an online shop <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has built a huge online space where vendors everywhere can find customers but now equally huge companies like Alibaba NYSE BABA are stepping up their game and expanding more internationally In Q Amazons North America net sales and operating income grew and respectively However international segment net sales slipped and the operating loss grew larger from a minus million to a minus million Of course some of that decline is due to the strong dollar but it does show <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>needs to shore up its international business One way to incentivize vendors to join <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is to have the option of getting business loans once online sales are good enough The company has to start now to solidify the potential growth in vendor numbers so that they will be there in the future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>vendors in the UK France Germany Spain Italy Canada India and China can now apply for a business loan But Amazons not dumb it still has to separate out the real business opportunities to avoid taking on unnecessary risk It does this by only offering lending to select vendors by invitation only When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>started making business loans in it was always <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>choosing and approaching suitable vendors not the other way around If a vendor had increasing sales and good inventory turnover they would catch the attention of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and get an email from the company saying the vendor is eligible for a loan up to a certain amount Up until now it has been successful Among the new countries the big ones for me are China and India based on sheer retail volume potential These will also be the hardest fought in my opinion Alibaba is the largest ecommerce company in China similar to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in scale and current market cap <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>billion vs Alibaba billion In early June Alibaba chairman Jack Ma did a series of speaking engagements in a number of major US cities to call for US vendors to sell into China through Alibabas two ecommerce sites Tmall and Taobao He said he wasnt planning to take over the US but just the same I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>management was listening intently and probably decided to accelerate its vendor business loan service expansion to start getting ready to compete more in these eight countries as well as the US If I just confine my argument here to concerning Chinas internet market alone that would still be considered massive Already the number of Chinese internet users is closing in on million which is more than double the users in the US and thats with only less than internet penetration of the total Chinese population If you think the US internet market is big imagine potentially times that just within China in the future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>hasnt really been successful in taking a sizeable market share of Chinas ecommerce sector The two biggest operators Alibaba and JDcom pretty much dominate that market As a sign of their overwhelming control <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has even opened a store on Alibabas Tmall site to reach more Chinese consumers Another event that will make it even more difficult for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in China is Alibaba has just announced opening a online bank called MYbank that will concentrate on lending to small and medium businesses as well as entrepreneurs Of course these vendors will first have to be selling on Tmall and Taobao and successfully at that to show they are good credit risks Alibabas financial arm Ant Financial has been offering business loans to Alibaba vendors for years and todate has financed over billion in loans to more than million small businesses Similar to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Ant Financial and the new online bank look at the financial transaction and inventory ordering data it has on a vendor to assess their creditworthiness For the most part it has been successful with Ant Financials baddebt ratio at less than comparatively low for Chinese banking My view is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is going to keep on struggling in China Just like in a classic Chinese chess or Go game before you try to take too much territory space in your opponents area you first consolidate firm control of your own Chairman Jack Ma fought an earlier battle with eBay NASDAQ EBAY to protect Alibabas territory as the ecommerce auction site attempted to expand into China In the end eBay acquiesced in its failed business expansion there <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shouldnt give up on the China market altogether though There are millions of consumers who are looking for and appreciate overseas goods that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could potentially supply Unfortunately thats exactly why Alibaba chairman Jack Ma was visiting the US to invite and assemble those US vendors to his sites to satisfy that Chinese demand Whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a big chance of success in India is whole other ballgame Chinas big ecommerce sites will be moving to take market share in India as well but at least theyre not the home team either so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a better chance to compete India has almost matched the number of US internet users There could be much more business potential for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>because only of Indias population have internet presently and ecommerce is not as developed and pervasive yet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>should push into India as much as possible to capture market share I think it would create a solid base for further growth in the region as the rest of Southeast Asia develops and modernizes along with India Source <span
