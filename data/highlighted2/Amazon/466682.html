class='textDiv'>Ocado Overvalued Overbought Ocado Group PLC OTCMKTSOCDGF Seeking Alpha Ocado is trading at an excessively high valuation and at an overbought level The company faces increased competitive threats price pressure and higher costs which is likely to put downward pressure on margins The rate of revenue and EBITDA growth are likely to slow down as competition limits Ocados market share growth and profitability United Kingdombased online grocery delivery company Ocado OTCOCDGF faces increased competition from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN who will be initially operating its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fresh grocery delivery service in east and central London postcodes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will begin operating in these limited areas to optimize the service before expanding throughout the UK Even without <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>expanding into the grocery delivery market in the UK Ocado competes with Tesco OTCPKTSCDY WalMarts NYSE WMT ASDA Sainsbury OTCQXJSAIY Morrisons OTCPKMRWSY The Cooperative and Waitrose for online grocery delivery Tesco is the largest grocery store chain operator in the UK ASDA and Sainsbury are neck and neck between nd and rd largest UK grocers The latest data from Statistacom shows that Sainsbury has a percentage point market share lead over ASDA Ocado is included in the Other category in the chart Although the companys market share is low Ocado did grow revenue at in over the prior year More recent results for H showed a revenue increase Although Ocado is achieving strong doubledigit revenue growth the problem for the company is shrinking margins As the grocery market becomes more competitive especially with discount grocers expanding in the market the pricing pressure will continue to shrink margins Ocados pace of revenue growth is also likely to slow down with increased competition Grocery discount chains Aldi and Lidl have been gaining market share Together Aldi and Lidl comprise of Great Britains grocery market Their combined market share increased from a year ago Aldi now sells wine and special buys online in Great Britain Lidl hasnt announced online offerings or delivery service yet but I think it is likely that the company will eventually add delivery service in order to remain competitive with the other players in the market The growth of Aldi and Lidl in the grocery market is putting additional pricing pressure on their competitors including Ocado Consumers who value savings over the convenience of delivery are likely to physically shop at a lowpriced grocery store such as Aldi and Lidl for overall savings on their purchases This is likely to cause Ocados margins to narrow as they lower prices to become competitive with the lowcost grocers Source Company financial statements While Ocado is achieving increased revenue yearoveryear and the company is on pace to achieve an increase in revenue for the full year in the reversal in EBITDA margin has already begun The reversal in EBITDA margin began in and is continuing in The company did state in its H conference call that Ocado lowered prices and increased promotional activity to remain competitive The good news is that Ocado is achieving strong doubledigit increases in revenue However profitability is likely to continue to be squeezed through the pressure of maintaining low prices due to competition With discounters Aldi and Lidl expanding and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>increasing its presence in the UK grocery market Ocado will face increased margin pressure I would like to point out that Ocado did form an agreement with grocery competitor Morrisons Under the agreement which began in January Morrisons will use Ocados Dordon facility for the order fulfillment of Morrisons grocery products Ocado was paid an initial fee of m along with some other startup fees from Morrisons Ocado will continue to receive service costs from Morrisons on an annual basis This agreement does relieve some of the competitive pressure from Ocado However there have not been similar deals from other grocers to use Ocados technology So far the other competitors are using their own technology for online grocery fulfillment Ocado has an agreement with Waitrose through to sell Waitrose branded products on Ocadocom However Waitrose is not using Ocados proprietary equipment Ocado pays Waitrose a sourcing fee under the agreement Ocado has proprietary technology for the online grocery business The technology is known as the Ocado Smart Platform OSP which is a combination of software and order fulfillment equipment One of the companys goals is to have this system installed in other retailers warehouses under an agreement where Ocado would service and maintain it Ocado markets the OSP as a scalable system giving the customer significant operational cost benefits However Morrisons is the only company that has partnered with Ocado thus far There was a rumor in April speculating that Ocado was making a deal with USbased supermarket chain Publix However no official deal has been announced It is not clear that other companies will want to use Ocados OSP Ocado has great visions that the OSP will be used by many companies However there is no backlog of companies lining up to use it Ocados stock is overbought as indicated by the stochastic oscillator at a level above on the chart So the stock is likely to pull back in the shortterm Ocado is trading significantly higher than its competitors with a PE of TTM and an EVEBITDA of Here is how the company compares to its publicly traded competitors Data source Company financial statements Capital IQ Ocados EVEBITDA is nearly x higher than the average EVEBITDA of for WalMart Tesco Sainsbury and Morrisons and significantly higher than the SP s median average I left out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>from the grocers average because the stock has been an anomaly in the market and the company currently has a low market share in the UK grocery market Ocado is being valued similar to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>with a high tripledigit PE ratio However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been increasing net sales at over per year for the past years and has grown into a global largecap online retail leader with revenue of over billion billion for Ocado has achieved strong doubledigit revenue growth below per year for the past five years Ocado is still a smallcap company with revenue of billion Ocado is not likely to achieve the global success that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has with the fierce competition in the grocery market Ocado could be challenged to maintain its pace of revenue growth with increased competition from a large company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>already has an established network of logistics partners that it will use to deliver groceries to customers in the UK Therefore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will just need to build buy or rent distribution fulfillment centers to expand its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fresh business in the UK <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has proven to expand quickly and effectively over time One potential risk to the investment thesis would be a potential takeover of Ocado There have been rumors earlier this year that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was interested in acquiring Ocado <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>already has millions of existing Prime customers in the UK to extend grocery products to So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt necessarily need to acquire Ocado for its customers as reported in the H report <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could consider acquiring Ocado for its distribution facilities Ocado currently has fulfillment centers in operation with another one being built <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could build the million square feet equivalent of Ocados three distribution centers that are currently in operation for approximately per square foot This is based on the cost of Ocados cost to build the new square foot Erith facility for million That would cost about million much less than Ocados market cap of billion Even if we include the Erith facility for a total of million square feet the cost would be less than billion This is still less than Ocados market cap We could even estimate a higher cost per square foot of and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could build million square feet worth of grocery fulfillment centers for less than billion That is still lower than Ocados market cap The fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is introducing its Fresh concept in the UK which includes items such as meat seafood bread bakery yogurts deli cheese etc shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is interested in expanding organically beyond its Pantry concept which offers dry goods such as cereals snacks soft drinks coffee beautygrooming products cleaning products etc Overall I dont see a clear reason why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would want to acquire Ocado Amazons money would be better spent on expanding its own online grocery business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has proven to successfully expand its business organically in recent years Amazons acquisitions primarily took place early in the companys history Therefore I think there is a low probability of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>acquiring Ocado So I dont think the acquisition possibility of Ocado is a significant risk for the investment thesis Since Ocados valuation is significantly higher than average I dont think that other companies would be interested in acquiring the company either Although it may not make sense for other companies to acquire Ocado there might be interest in forming an agreement similar to the OcadoMorrisons deal However no deals with other companies have been announced According to the H report Ocado has m in current liabilities and m in current assets giving the company a current ratio of or X more current liabilities than current assets With more current liabilities than current assets Ocado is weak in terms of its shortterm obligations The company is more at risk of not being able to pay off its shortterm obligations if the business faced a downturn Ocado is more likely to borrow against its future earnings to pay off the shortterm obligations The problem with this is the competitive pressures in the grocery market could cause Ocados rate of growth to slow Therefore if Ocados revenue and EBITDA growth plateaued or declined then the borrowings may not be sustainable and the company would be at risk of bankruptcy Ocado has been running with negative free cash flow FCF in recent years Although the company was left with a positive m in FCF for H it is not clear if Ocado will achieve positive FCF for the full year or in future years The company has high CapEx which has exceeded its operating cash flow for the past few years Ocado is likely to continue to have high CapEx as the company continues to grow If FCF continues to be negative on an annual basis there will be no funds for share repurchases or to implement a dividend The company stated in early that it doesnt have any intentions of implementing a dividend for the foreseeable future This makes sense as Ocado is more interested in investing its operating cash flow to grow the business Since Ocado has a high valuation share repurchases wouldnt be prudent With the increased competitive pressure Ocado may not be able to sustain the strong revenue growth that it has in recent years Add in the pressure to maintain competitive pricing and margins are likely to narrow Therefore the companys operating cash flow may grow at a slower pace going forward That is not a positive scenario for investors since the company might be limited on the available funds used for CapEx to continue the expansion efforts CEO Tim Steiner stated on the H conference call that the company faces increased input costs This includes increased costs for food fuel and other items Steiners statement is consistent with the situation among UK retailers who have hedged against currency risk insuring against a decline in the pound These hedges will begin to unwind next year Since the UK imports of its food the cost of the UKs food supply is likely to increase The percentage of imported food is expected to rise in the UK over time Therefore the combination of increased input costs puts further pressure on the prices that Ocado and its competitors charge The industry players will have to increase prices or allow their margins to be squeezed further An unexpected takeover of the company at a premium of the current price Ocado could find ways of increasing productivity and reducing costs to offset the effect of narrowing margins as a result of increased competition and input costs The competitive environment may not affect Ocado enough to significantly hurt its revenue margins or EBITDA Ocado could establish agreements with one or more of its competitors for its proprietary technology which could help the business of all parties under the deals Ocados valuation is still high with more room to fall further Although Ocado achieved strong revenue growth in recent years the increased competition from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fresh and others looking to expand online grocery services is likely to cause further pressure that will limit Ocados growth Therefore the rate of Ocados growth is likely to slow down Ocado also faces margin pressure from discount grocers in the market which has caused the company to offer lower prices to remain competitive Increased input costs will squeeze the margins further There hasnt been widespread adoption for Ocados OSP Potential companies are most likely not seeing a benefit to using Ocados technology over their own All told Ocados stock is likely to be under further downward pressure The stock is overbought in the shortterm and it is priced for perfection The stock will be under continued downward pressure over the longterm as increased competition is likely to slow the pace of revenue growth and squeeze margins thus slowing the EBITDA growth rate going forward Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this
