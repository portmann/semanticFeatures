Dollar stores have taken their toll on Wal-Mart as well but it's hard to imagine them getting into stuff like clothing or automotive, and Wal-Mart is meeting them on their turf, as I mentioned.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Wal-Mart is still a significant contributor to several other expensive blue chip companies ' bottom lines like Coca Cola and P & G and this is an opportunity to gain <b>exposure</b> to those at a decent valuation as well .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even though the market has n't fallen dramatically , <b>fear</b> and malaise out there can be observed in gold and treasuries pushing up against new 52 week highs for several weeks and hitting them again today .  (Uncertainty) </span>So called "defensive" sectors, utilities and consumer staples are following close behind.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I <b>believe</b> even if Wal-Mart takes <i>longer</i> to get its turnaround going , whether its 3 , 6 or 9 months , it is reasonably priced right now for long term investors to start accumulating .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Of course you missed the crash but the stock still trades for <i>less</i> than it did a year ago .  (Surprise) </span>Cash flow generation, investor friendly but conservative dividend and buyback policies and resilience through economic cycles are all reasons that I point too.Plus, you still have double digit returns of equity being generated.Personally rather than putting out $7132 today for 100 shares I'd rather commit to picking it up for 12% off in the next three months.The September 16 $62.50 puts have a delta of -0.13 right now which means that buying them today for 60 cents will result in a gain of 13 cents for a 1 dollar decline in the value of the stock, all else being equal.Cash securing these means you earn $60 on $6250 for 3 months or 4% annualized.With an IV of 16% and 67 or so trading days until these expire, we know that the market is pricing in a $6 move over the next three months (11.61 over the next year).So we would be giving ourselves a 68% chance of success just keeping the money.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If the stock was surfing 52 week lows and <b>volatility</b> was really high then I would advocate selling <i>closer</i> to the money puts as there would be a lot <i>better</i> cash up front available .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Unfortunately the market is not presenting such an opportunity right now and I think this represents the best way to get in.Nothing wrong with being patient and waiting to buy Wal-Mart where it was just one month ago.Based on the chart, I think WMT goes sideways or up.I don't see another big drop in the cards.But even if there was, its not a bad time to start buying a company which still takes up a huge chunk of US and international retail activity every day, despite its many faults and controversial reputation.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Author payment: $35 + $0.01/page view.Authors of PRO articles receive a minimum guaranteed payment of $150-500.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Become a contributor Tagged : Investing Ideas , Long Ideas , Services , Discount , <b>Variety</b> Stores , Momentum , Pullback , Relative Valuation  (Uncertainty) </span></div></body></html>
