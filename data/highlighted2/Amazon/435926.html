WalMart Dead Money WalMart Stores Inc NYSEWMT Seeking Alpha WalMart is down more than from its January all time high as slowing sales and increased competition worry investors The US market is still being led by FANGs but simple quality cash flow generating businesses are getting respect if you look at pork and tobacco stocks recent performance I make the case that the companys size performance and dividend make it worth accumulating as a long term valueoriented hold in any market preferably using cash secured puts There are a lot of people dumping on WalMart NYSE WMT lately Its longstanding opponents who call it an evil wagesuppressing supplierbullying smalltown killing behemoth will never run out of ammunition Just today the company announced it was automating a bunch of jobs It has also fallen out of favor with the investor community This I suspect may be in the midst of turning around The stock is up almost since May earnings but at has still been a bummer for long term investors who got in at the all time high of in January As I will show it has done in past corrections the stock basically did nothing through January and February The real pain was from August to November when the stock dropped by due to factors we will discuss The pros and cons of the stock are wellknown but lets just take a moment to reiterate them Return on Assets has been under for straight quarters and out of the last after oscillating between and for the years before that Dividends have increased in years averaging a penny per year in the last three years Share count has been reduced by in that period Same Store sales have risen above for the first time in three years This metric might be as important as PE in retail stocks As many readers will now one of the main reasons for WalMart stocks slow decline is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Forget Target and Costco which cater to totally different markets despite seeming to stretch over a similar amount of North American big box space WalMart is bigger then the four global competitors that follow it combined Target Costco Tesco and Carrefour I do know that the company has tried to keep up that underdog from Bentonville ethos alive and well and are determined to meet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>every step of the way despite Amazons refusal to take its foot off the gas for one second Drones a primestyle delivery service and new private label product innovations are all in WalMarts wheelhouse They also are attempting to claw back some of the market share dollar stores have grabbed from them with their neighborhood market format In terms of generating cash to either return to shareholders in some form or invest in future strategy execution WalMart is trading at price to cash flow with a price to book and a dividend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is trading at times price to cash flow with a price to book value and zero dividend How much more growing can this growth stock do That is the irrational face value market perception comparison The problem is that if we are talking apples to apples and this is a tortoise vs hare race WalMart is clearly at a disadvantage I thought its B of cash on the balance sheet was encouraging <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has almost B I thought the B of long term debt was manageable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has just under B So clearly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is in a much better position to finance its future plans has lower legacy costs and will probably have an easier time raising debt or equity if it needs to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>also usually ekes out quarterly profits of pennies per share and misses can been severely punished in the past This is reflected in Amazons Beta of vs Walmarts of People like to talk about the return <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has generated since its IPO Well if youre getting in at I commend you on your extreme bullishness This stock has taken shorter term investors for a ride in the first weeks of and since February WalMart meanwhile peaked at in and stayed in a range between around and for over years before going on the run that led to its all time high from early to early Throughout and the stock barely moved despite crazy volume The company touches a lot of raw nerves and is controversial The Walton familys wealth is controversial Their lowwage army is controversial although they gave a bunch of them a raise And they irked investors and small town residents this year by closing stores for the first time stores which had previously decimated downtown commerce in these small communities Plus they have tried to enter markets and failed Germany and everyone knows Sams Club does not inspire the same loyalty or popularity as Costco An academic study by Wayne Cascio in showed that Costco generates more profit per square foot despite its high wages because of lower employee turnover That hasnt changed Its true that there is nothing new on Wall Street Alas portfolios are not popularity contests and I think that this company can be counted on to generate a lot of cash over the next several years despite Amazons aggressive moves Dollar stores have taken their toll on WalMart as well but its hard to imagine them getting into stuff like clothing or automotive and WalMart is meeting them on their turf as I mentioned WalMart is still a significant contributor to several other expensive blue chip companies bottom lines like Coca Cola and P G and this is an opportunity to gain exposure to those at a decent valuation as well Even though the market hasnt fallen dramatically fear and malaise out there can be observed in gold and treasuries pushing up against new week highs for several weeks and hitting them again today So called defensive sectors utilities and consumer staples are following close behind I believe even if WalMart takes longer to get its turnaround going whether its or months it is reasonably priced right now for long term investors to start accumulating Of course you missed the crash but the stock still trades for less than it did a year ago Cash flow generation investor friendly but conservative dividend and buyback policies and resilience through economic cycles are all reasons that I point too Plus you still have double digit returns of equity being generated Personally rather than putting out today for shares Id rather commit to picking it up for off in the next three months The September puts have a delta of right now which means that buying them today for cents will result in a gain of cents for a dollar decline in the value of the stock all else being equal Cash securing these means you earn on for months or annualized With an IV of and or so trading days until these expire we know that the market is pricing in a move over the next three months over the next year So we would be giving ourselves a chance of success just keeping the money If the stock was surfing week lows and volatility was really high then I would advocate selling closer to the money puts as there would be a lot better cash up front available Unfortunately the market is not presenting such an opportunity right now and I think this represents the best way to get in Nothing wrong with being patient and waiting to buy WalMart where it was just one month ago Based on the chart I think WMT goes sideways or up I dont see another big drop in the cards But even if there was its not a bad time to start buying a company which still takes up a huge chunk of US and international retail activity every day despite its many faults and
