( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Who would have thought that a wand <b>could</b> wave away <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's potential profits ? (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The Dash button <b>seems</b> like a great innovation for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , but it has unintended consequences . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>If you have n't heard of Amazon.com 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Dash products , you soon will . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company is constantly innovating and trying to make it <i>easier</i> for customers to order <i>more</i> from the site .  (Surprise) </span>The original Dash is essentially like a magic wand for groceries, and the Dash button is an on the spot re-ordering system.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If these sound like sure fire hits , they likely will be .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , there are 3 reasons to believe that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>may</b> have just made its path to profitability even <i>more</i> difficult . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Dash has the potential to unhinge the traditional grocery model . Dash is only available on a limited basis , and the customer must be subscribed to AmazonFresh . Dash is a small device that can create a customer's grocery list by them either scanning the bar code of a product, or by voice search.The customer then can edit this list on AmazonFresh before they place their order . Clearly this is not good news for a companies like Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) or Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST ).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Wal-Mart gets <i>more</i> than half of its sales from groceries at its namesake chain , and Sam 's Club is tied heavily to grocery sales as well .  (Surprise) </span>A big part of Costco's business is groceries too.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Given that Wal-Mart 's overall sales growth was <i>less</i> than 3 % annually last quarter , and Costco witnessed net sales growth of just 1 % , these companies do n't need any <i>more</i> headwinds to their topline growth .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Dash sounds great , but there is one big problem , Dash <b>may</b> be too expensive to make sense .  (Uncertainty) </span>Dash itself does n't cost anything , but in order to use Dash , the customer must subscribe to AmazonFresh which costs $ 299 per year . By comparison, Costco membership costs about $55 a year and Sam's Club membership costs about $45 per year .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>AmazonFresh is 440 % <i>more</i> than Costco , and 560 % <i>more</i> than Sam 's Club . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Ultimately, customers will have to choose how valuable this service is to them.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In addition , Dash <b>could</b> lead to <i>smaller</i> <i>more</i> frequent orders from AmazonFresh . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>These types of orders would mean increased shipping and fulfillment costs for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Considering shipping costs have been a significant drag on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's profitability , <b>possible</b> <i>faster</i> growth in this line item is not good news for investors . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The second piece of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Dash product lineup is the Dash button . If a customer uses Tide, they can hang a Tide Dash button on their washer.When they realize they are running low on detergent, they can just press the button and it will instantly reorder their pre-selected Tide option.They set up the size and quantity of their order, and each time they press the Dash button their order gets filled.There are two huge problems with this idea.First , this button eliminates a way that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has been growing its sales in the past . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Dash orders exactly what the customer wants and nothing <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Part of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's growth has come from a customer looking on the site to order one thing , and then finding other items to order at the same time . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The Dash button eliminates this additional browsing and <b>could</b> limit <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's sales growth . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Part of the reason Wal-Mart or Costco build stores of the size that they do is so customers will be forced to browse other items before they get to what they want to buy.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This browsing can lead to the purchase of <i>higher</i> margin items .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Higher</i> margin ancillary purchases are part of why Walmart 's operating margin is 5 % and Costco 's margin is 3.1 % .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Unfortunately , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's operating margin is just over 1 % , and a big reason is the company 's shipping and fulfillment expenses have been growing <i>faster</i> than sales . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The way the Dash button is designed , means <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is <b>almost</b> certainly going to get a lot of <i>smaller</i> orders instead of the <i>larger</i> <i>more</i> profitable orders the company should be courting . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The third issue with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's future profitability is the company 's real bottom line is n't improving as some investors might <b>believe</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Just for point of comparison, in their most recently quarters, Costco generated $357 million in core free cash flow (net income + depreciation - capex), and Wal-Mart produced over $3 billion in cash flow.During this same timeframe , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> generates about $ 500 million in core free cash flow . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , there is <i>more</i> to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's cash flow story . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The company uses significant capital leases to acquire equipment.These are real cash expenses but aren't reported the same as traditional capex.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Including these capital leases , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's most recent quarter showed <b>roughly</b> $ 1.2 billion in negative free cash flow . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>What 's even <i>more</i> troublesome is this number represented a 50 % increase over last year .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Between Dash only being available for AmazonFresh users at $ 299 a year , the Dash button placing <i>smaller</i> orders , and significant capital leases that <b>may</b> be overlooked , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has some challenges that make profits a prime problem .
