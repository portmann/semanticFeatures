Ways Amazons Dash Could Make Profits A Prime Problem Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Who would have thought that a wand could wave away Amazons potential profits The Dash button seems like a great innovation for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but it has unintended consequences If you havent heard of Amazoncoms NASDAQ AMZN Dash products you soon will The company is constantly innovating and trying to make it easier for customers to order more from the site The original Dash is essentially like a magic wand for groceries and the Dash button is an on the spot reordering system If these sound like sure fire hits they likely will be However there are reasons to believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may have just made its path to profitability even more difficult Amazons Dash has the potential to unhinge the traditional grocery model Dash is only available on a limited basis and the customer must be subscribed to AmazonFresh Dash is a small device that can create a customers grocery list by them either scanning the bar code of a product or by voice search The customer then can edit this list on AmazonFresh before they place their order Clearly this is not good news for a companies like WalMart NYSE WMT or Costco Wholesale NASDAQ COST WalMart gets more than half of its sales from groceries at its namesake chain and Sams Club is tied heavily to grocery sales as well A big part of Costcos business is groceries too Given that WalMarts overall sales growth was less than annually last quarter and Costco witnessed net sales growth of just these companies dont need any more headwinds to their topline growth Dash sounds great but there is one big problem Dash may be too expensive to make sense Dash itself doesnt cost anything but in order to use Dash the customer must subscribe to AmazonFresh which costs per year By comparison Costco membership costs about a year and Sams Club membership costs about per year AmazonFresh is more than Costco and more than Sams Club Ultimately customers will have to choose how valuable this service is to them In addition Dash could lead to smaller more frequent orders from AmazonFresh These types of orders would mean increased shipping and fulfillment costs for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Considering shipping costs have been a significant drag on Amazons profitability possible faster growth in this line item is not good news for investors The second piece of Amazons Dash product lineup is the Dash button If a customer uses Tide they can hang a Tide Dash button on their washer When they realize they are running low on detergent they can just press the button and it will instantly reorder their preselected Tide option They set up the size and quantity of their order and each time they press the Dash button their order gets filled There are two huge problems with this idea First this button eliminates a way that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been growing its sales in the past Dash orders exactly what the customer wants and nothing more Part of Amazons growth has come from a customer looking on the site to order one thing and then finding other items to order at the same time The Dash button eliminates this additional browsing and could limit Amazons sales growth Part of the reason WalMart or Costco build stores of the size that they do is so customers will be forced to browse other items before they get to what they want to buy This browsing can lead to the purchase of higher margin items Higher margin ancillary purchases are part of why Walmarts operating margin is and Costcos margin is Unfortunately Amazons operating margin is just over and a big reason is the companys shipping and fulfillment expenses have been growing faster than sales The way the Dash button is designed means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is almost certainly going to get a lot of smaller orders instead of the larger more profitable orders the company should be courting The third issue with Amazons future profitability is the companys real bottom line isnt improving as some investors might believe Just for point of comparison in their most recently quarters Costco generated million in core free cash flow net income depreciation capex and WalMart produced over billion in cash flow During this same timeframe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>generates about million in core free cash flow However there is more to Amazons cash flow story The company uses significant capital leases to acquire equipment These are real cash expenses but arent reported the same as traditional capex Including these capital leases Amazons most recent quarter showed roughly billion in negative free cash flow Whats even more troublesome is this number represented a increase over last year Between Dash only being available for AmazonFresh users at a year the Dash button placing smaller orders and significant capital leases that may be overlooked <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has some challenges that make profits
