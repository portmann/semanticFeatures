At least in the case of an iPhone or a Mac, there were elements of IP to sue Samsung and others over.Netflix is nothing but a digital version of a travelling vaudeville show.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It 's enjoyable , and you 'll pay money for it , but its value is fleeting , and it is <i>more</i> than <b>probable</b> that the manner in which one consumes media will significantly shift before the share price has been rewarded with sufficient dividend cash flows .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For <i>more</i> on that , see my model which is hosted free on GoogleDocs .  (Surprise) </span>Netflix is on the inception of an international expansion.There are 20 million subscribers, and the goal is about 100 million - so significant inroads have been made.Similarly, there are significant growth opportunities to be exploited as the footprint grows.And while this is good news for shareholders, the team at Netflix is not supported by a corporate parent like Time Warner where the lessons from decades of international media distribution can be utilized and leveraged.The collection of companies within Time Warner include Warner Brothers, Turner, HBO, Cinemax, TNT and CNN.Their ability to blend cable and digital delivery to a global audience is demonstrated.And while the TWX companies suffer from legacy costs and a large debt load, TWX has built-in diversification and a deep team as compared to Netflix.Now, clearly the Netflix team is top-notch.But, the team is cutting their teeth on international growth.There will be teething pains!That's not pessimism, it is realism.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The launch of HBO streaming service has been sold to investors as a complement to Netflix , and it <b>may</b> well be , but it <b>may</b> also compete for the marginal subscriber .  (Uncertainty) </span>And in the event that a % of marginal new subscribers choose HBO first, then those are competitors to Netflix.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They <b>may</b> one day be wooed to have both HBOGO and Netflix , but it still implies a stall to the growth of Netflix when a potential customer first chooses HBO instead of Netflix .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>( ditto for Hulu , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , etc. ) The following overview of the accounting policies at Netflix is intended to identify the sources of potential income <b>variability</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>I will provide an overview of the various estimates that are implicit in the financial statements, and explain that they're all standard GAAP policies.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The accounting for film costs and licensed content costs is governed by ASC 920 and ASC 926 , and ASC 450 <b>Contingencies</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>920 and 926 are industry-specific accounting standards are used to guide the implementation of GAAP for Netflix, and they're filled with estimates which I will get into.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>ASC 450 traditionally deals with loss contingencies , and in the case of Netflix , they are applied to measure <b>contingent</b> obligations to acquire content or `` future titles '' as well as licenses with Performance Rights Organizations ( PROs ) associated with future public performances .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The accountants define three types of contingencies : <b>Probable</b> : Put it on the Balance Sheet These definitions are not specific to Netflix , they 're GAAP .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What Netflix does is report the minimum known amount of <b>contingent</b> liabilities which will arise from agreements to obtain content in the future .  (Uncertainty) </span>As of 3/31/15, $5.5 billion was presented.That's the MINIMUM KNOWN AMOUNT!Again, this isn't specific to Netflix, it is standard GAAP.If we look at the notes, there are about $8.6 billion of content liabilities coming due in the next three years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix has $ 3 billion in cash and short term investments Netflix has negative cash flows from operations ( this year , <b>maybe</b> next and part of 2017 ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If the <b>contingent</b> liability increases exceed the growth in operating cash flows , Netflix will have to raise <i>more</i> money , either via debt or equity , and those issuances will impact current shareholders .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Earnings Volatility from Changes in Estimates At the inception of a film deal , Netflix adds up the cash paid up front along with the guess of <b>probable</b> outflows .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is accounted for as follows : For the outflows related to this title which are `` <b>possible</b> '' , those do not hit the balance sheet ( yet ) ; rather they are listed in Note 9 .  (Uncertainty) </span>- It's why there's $4.3 billion of content liabilities on the balance sheet and $9.8 billion in the notes.At the quarter's end, Netflix's accountants have to estimate the current value of this asset and liability.(They will do it for each title, or group of titles).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the case of the asset , it is carried at <i>lower</i> of unamortized cost or realizable value .  (Surprise) </span>This means it cannot be marked up to generate phantom gains.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the case of the liabilities , the change of a contingency from possible to <b>probable</b> implies that the liability should be increased .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As best I can tell from GAAP , that means the entry would be ( DR : Expense , CR : Liability ) In other words , that $ 5.5 billion of contingencies will fall directly to the P&L as and when they become `` <b>possible</b> '' .  (Uncertainty) </span>This accounting entry will create downward pressure on margins in the short term.The CONVERSE applies also.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One can generate income from reducing the estimate of the <b>contingent</b> obligation which currently resides on the balance sheet .  (Uncertainty) </span>The nicest way to comment on this policy is that it leaves a lot of wiggle room for managing earnings.But again, this is GAAP, it's not some specific Netflix approach.According to the Investor Relations website: We follow the guidance in ASC 926, Entertainment - Films for the costs associated with the production of original content.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We follow the guidance of ASC 920 , Entertainment - Broadcasters , which provides the accounting framework for licensees of films and TV shows as applicable to our business Keep in mind that these discussions only apply to the <b>PROBABLE</b> amounts !!  (Uncertainty) </span>the title is accepted and available for streaming ASC 920 requires that we capitalize the entire amount, and record a corresponding liability, except for the up-front prepayment (that's not a liability, it is cash out the door).Netflix records the gross amount of the content asset and liability (not the present value - this is disclosed in the notes to the 10-K).According to a PWC paper, "ASC 920-405-30-1 states that it is an accounting policy election whether to record the gross nominal cash payments as an asset and liability on the balance sheet or to discount the payments in determining the asset and liability under an effective interest rate model.If material, this accounting policy election should be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements."www.pwc.com/en_US/us/industry/entertainm... In the 10-K, there's a disclosure that reads: "The Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount" Source Dec 31, 2014 10-K The accounting policy is further explained the notes: This accounting approach is explained the 2013 10-K, "New titles recognized in the content library are classified in the line item "Additions to streaming content library" within net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And while this explicit disclosure does not <b>appear</b> in the 2014 annual report , the revision is : `` The acquisition of streaming content rights and the changes in related liabilities , are classified within cash used in operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . ''  (Uncertainty) </span>The wording is changed slightly, but the meaning has not changed - if content is acquired, the cash outflows and liabilities incurred are presented on the cash flow statement and the balance sheet.In-house Content would be recorded in a similar fashion; that is, film costs are capitalized and held on the balance sheet.The range of items that are eligible for capitalization of in-house content includes production overhead, acquisition costs, and direct production costs.Film cost is listed as a non-current asset, because the film is not yet available for viewing.One other requirement of ASC 926 is that "cash outflows for film costs, participation costs, exploitation costs, and manufacturing costs as operating activities in the statement of cash flows" Source: law.resource.org/pub/us/code/bean/fasb.h... So, as the film is being created, it grows as a non-current asset on the balance sheet.Once the film is available for viewing, a portion of the asset is re-classified as current vs non-current, and the capitalized film costs are amortized over the life of the film.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the case of Netflix , the accounting policy for original content is : '' the Company amortizes on an accelerated basis over the amortization period , which is the <i>shorter</i> of four years or the license period , beginning with the month of first availability .  (Surprise) </span>If a subsequent season is added, the amortization period is extended by a year."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Source 12-31-2014 10-K The reason for providing some accounting background is to set a few ground rules : It does not <b>appear</b> that there 's anything funky going on in the accounting .  (Uncertainty) </span>There are complexities and a lot of estimates, but that's just GAAP As estimates change, they will impact the reported earnings.As Netflix continues to create its own content, the in-house capitalized content will grow.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If they have a flop , it will result in earnings <b>volatility</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>As they release new in-house titles, their upfront cost will increase because the amortization is accelerated whereas other content is amortized on a straight line basis.This will have a short term (2 year) effect of depressing profit margins because of the accelerated depreciation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I learned the hard way last week that Netflix is a stock prone to <b>sudden</b> gaps for no good reason .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Primarily it 's the fact that the shares are n't that actively traded , and the valuation estimates have gotten so distanced from reality that the stock trades on pure <b>speculation</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>In addition, the heavy short interest on the stock results in price swings purely related to supply/demand squeezes as happened last week.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So , shorting the stock is n't for the faint of heart or for the <b>risk</b> adverse .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One must have an objectively defined target valuation , and a pre-defined <b>risk</b> management approach .  (Uncertainty) </span>I've seen a DCF valuation model from one of the sell-side banks with a target price of $505.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>One of the conceptual issues I have with using the DCF approach is that it does n't measure how much the shareholder will receive on their investment in the form of future cash flows - except from selling the stock ( hence the `` <i>greater</i> fool '' comment ) .  (Surprise) </span>As a value-based investor, I've run my own numbers based on prospective dividend flows, and found a range of $460 - $600.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And to be clear , that price <b>assumes</b> that everything goes swimmingly well for the next 40 years .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Add a healthy dose of risk discounting , and the stock is <b>somewhere</b> around $ 250 .  (Uncertainty) </span>The truth is that you can punish these models to come up with whatever value you'd like to see.The principal conclusion I draw from modeling and evaluating the range of prospective values (using both the enterprise valuations and the discounted dividends) is that the share price is currently overbought.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In terms of an objective <b>risk</b> management approach , I 've implemented approaches : Pre-committed stop loss discipline must be in place !  (Uncertainty) </span>Set your maximum pain point and close the position at that point.Don't make excuses, don't talk yourself into some reason the market is insane, just get out and re-evaluate the trade again.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Put Options - if you 're going to short a <b>volatile</b> stock like Netflix , you can sell some of your prospective gains by writing puts on the stock .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's not identical to a covered call because the <b>risk</b> profile from the short stock remains open-ended ( whereas a covered call has a max .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>loss ) ; however , it does allow the long-term short position to harvest some <b>volatility</b> over the life of the trade .
