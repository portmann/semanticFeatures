Netflix domestic subscriptions have continued to grow at a constant rate despite the growth of Netflix competitors.Partly this is a result of the fact that the market is still unsaturated, and partly this is a result of the fact that the services are not necessarily mutually exclusive.The services are so inexpensive that a consumer can have several for the price of a minimal cable package.Disruptive technology companies automatically seem to have inflated valuations, although Netflix is in a class by itself with a P/E of 380.6 (according to Google Finance ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> this is partly the result of the very high institutional ownership of 83 % ( also according to Google Finance ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>The very high institutional ownership in effect creates a scarcity of the stock for retail investors.The disruptive character of Netflix, combined with high expectations for future growth make assessing the "true" value of the company pointless.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>About all one can say with confidence is that Netflix <b>probably</b> is n't worth what the P/E implies .  (Uncertainty) </span>Should momentum investors in Netflix even care if it isn't worth the P/E implication?<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Right now , I think most of them do n't ( including the institutions , who <b>probably</b> take a <i>more</i> cynical view of Netflix ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>But there's a very immediate reason for Netflix investors to be concerned about the stock's momentum, and that's the trend in Netflix operating income since it peaked in 2014 Q2: Also shown in the chart is net income before taxes.The trend, especially since the beginning of 2015 is been downward.What's been forcing operating income down has not been decline in revenue, of course, but increasing operating costs for things like Marketing, R&D, etc.That's not the worst problem that Netflix faces.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It could be argued that Netflix could trim back operating expenses once it 's finished with its global expansion , whenever that <b>might</b> be .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>more</i> serious problem in my view is that Netflix added dramatically to its debt costs in 2015 , so that it pays about $ 35 million in interest every quarter .  (Surprise) </span>This is reflected in net income before taxes.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix 's total long-term debt of $ 2.3 billion is now <i>greater</i> than its equity of $ 2.2 billion .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As of the latest earnings report , Netflix management indicated that they intend to borrow even <i>more</i> money in the coming year , further depressing net income .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the income trend continues , Netflix will begin to lose money in about a year .  (Uncertainty) </span>It's clear that there's a race on to expand globally, achieve the highest level of subscribers, and produce the most compelling content.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's also clear that Netflix has no <b>hope</b> of winning this race if it does n't spend heavily , necessitating the borrowing .  (Uncertainty) </span>There's a belief among Netflix investors that near term profitability can be sacrificed to achieve the long term goal of global domination of the market.Certainly, Netflix is very sticky.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I still have a subscription , although I find I use it <i>less</i> and <i>less</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Yes , some of the Netflix original content is marvelous , but everyone has started developing original content , so I doubt that will be a positive discriminator <b>indefinitely</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Recent concerns about ratings , and the lack thereof , <b>probably</b> amount to just the tip of the iceberg of concerns that the institutions are starting to have about the long-term viability of Netflix .  (Uncertainty) </span>In effect, they want to know if the money being spent on original content is actually achieving a reasonable return.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The original content being produced by Netflix is <b>probably</b> unique in the entertainment industry in that there 's no visibility for investors into how well the content is actually doing financially .  (Uncertainty) </span>In traditional TV and movie production, there's fairly rigorous cost accounting that provides visibility to the relative success of the productions to investors.There are also other feedback mechanisms such as ratings and theater ticket sales that investors can look at.With Netflix, investors get none of that.It can be argued that the point of the original content is to increase the overall appeal of Netflix and not to earn a profit on a particular program or series.Given the financial structure of Netflix, it's not clear that program profitability can even be meaningfully defined.But even at the big picture level, Netflix profitability doesn't look all that great, as I point out above.What Netflix investors need to be concerned about is the question of when do the institutions start to pull out, because that's a really significant increase in the supply of shares hitting the market.What would be the trigger for the institutions to cut back ownership?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Probably</b> when net income before taxes goes negative .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Probably</b> that will happen in the coming year , if the current trend continues .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At the point that the institutions start dumping their shares , it <b>may</b> already be too late for retail investors .  (Uncertainty) </span>Therefore I consider Netflix a sell at the very least.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There 's <b>probably</b> a short opportunity here as well .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With the stock so highly valued and the potential for a very rapid deflation of the stock based on an institutional sell-off , shorting the stock <b>could</b> be highly profitable .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This will depend on a continuation of the downward trend in income , and <b>probably</b> short interest will grow throughout the year .  (Uncertainty) </span></div></body></html>
