Netflix likes to talk a lot about how they see HBO as their biggest competitor, but HBO's catalog of content is very small and the one thing consumers have shown us is that they want a lot of choice.Netflix's content catalog offers real depth and breadth of choice, whereas HBO's is very limited.What I'd really like to know is what methodology Netflix is using to judge the impact of their original content strategy on their business.They keep saying it helps their business, but we have no details on the direct impact.Does original content produce new subscribers, or is it simply a way to reduce churn?I think the latter, but until Netflix gives out some viewing statistics, which I don't see them doing any time soon, we have no real way to measure it.But, they would not be spending $100M to create one season of House Of Cards if they didn't see positive results on their business, so one has to simply trust that they know how to properly measure the impact of original content creation, good and bad, on their business.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix has gotten so big now , with a market cap of <b>almost</b> $ 49B , that it <b>almost</b> guarantees that they will remain independent .
