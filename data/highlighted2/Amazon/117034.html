class='textDiv'>Netflix Investors Be Wary Of Chinas Potential Costs Netflix Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Netflix is expanding into the worlds secondlargest economy China Investors should not assume that this move will be beneficial for the company however There are a multitude of factors that can negatively impact Netflix in China going forward Netflix NASDAQ NFLX is a global entertainment powerhouse boasting over million subscribers in over countries around the world The firm has plans to enter several more markets in late and and recently announced its intentions to enter the Chinese marketplace While many Netflix shareholders might be cheered by the news as China is home to the worlds thirdlargest entertainment market there are some significant questions investors should ask themselves about Netflixs Chinese endeavor How will Chinese consumers react to Netflixs model The entertainment industry in China is largely dependent on advertising revenues That is the content itself is free but there are advertisements to cover costs and make a profit Netflixs business model however is not free The company has different subscription plans at different rates but all might fall victim to the same reality China might not be receptive to a paid subscription service And speaking of Chinese consumers its worthy of note that the Chinese middle class the segment most likely to tune in to Netflix when it arrives isnt exactly a huge part of Chinese society Michael Pachter a technology analyst at Wedbush Securities forecasts Netflixs total subscriber base in China to reach just million to million over several years and said You need to think of China as having a middle class thats roughly the same size of the entire US Its growing but not by more than singledigits percentage range The middleclass income there is about half of that in the US and theres no indication that Netflix will charge less for its service in China For a nation with a billion people having a middle class roughly the same size as a nation with million people is indicative of the challenges Netflix may face there Perhaps the single biggest question mark about NFLXs Chinese adventures is how the government will respond Chinas government is very controlling of media content and has outright banned Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Facebook NASDAQ FB from operating in the country via the Great Firewall of China Its likely that the Chinese government would have to screen anything Netflix wants to show in the country which is timeconsuming and potentially costly to the company especially if a film or TV show is censored Compliance with Chinas labyrinth of red tape could decrease NFLXs profitability big time Not only that but also the Chinese government has a history of funding homegrown companies and competitors in a bid to maintain its tight control on content and increase Chinese innovation Which leads me to the next question Even if the company can successfully remain operational within China with relative freedom and that is doubtful there are several potential competitors that may undercut Netflix in China Netflix needs to see strong growth in China to continue propping up its burgeoning share price but that may become difficult if the likes of Alibaba NYSE BABA and Letv have anything to say about it According to QZcom The Chinese internet behemoth Alibabahas struck a deal with Lionsgate the production house behind the Hunger Games and Twilight young adult film franchises and the iconic TV series Mad Men for a subscriptionbased streaming television service in its home marketAlibaba has its finger in just about every pie in China Its not just the countrys <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but also its Dropbox PayPal Uber Hulu ING Direct and more To that list we can now add Netflix Alibaba has spent more than billion since March on content initiatives according to Reuters as part of an aggressive push into home entertainment This should be especially troubling news for Netflix as Alibaba is the jackofalltrades Internet company in China with big investments in Internet industries across the board Alibaba has a huge head start on Netflix While Netflix may be able to chip away at Alibabas lead BABA is heavily invested in the entertainment industry already and can most likely easily undercut Netflix through market competition But Alibaba could be the least of Netflixs concerns in China Letv is also a big player in the Chinese entertainment scene and as Wired Magazine reports When I describe Letv as the Netflix of China Mark Li corrects me Its the other way around he says Netflix is the Letv of the US He has a point Letv launched its Internet video streaming service three years before Netflix versus It was producing original movies and series long before Netflix rolled out House of Cards And in recent years the Chinese behemoth has expanded in ways Netflix hasnt It sells TV settop boxes and smart TVsdevices that can help you watch all that video We want to control the screens too says Li the exGoogler who is head of data analytics at Letv a company with a billion market cap Whats more the company soon will move into the US encroaching on Netflix Li will lead the effort bringing Letvs video streaming service its original programming its AppleTVlike settop boxes its smart TVs and now smartphones Alibaba and Letv could pose serious challenges to Netflix And that leads me to the bottom line question that summarizes the above analysis Will China cost Netflix more than the money gained from new subscribers Many people may assume that Netflixs expansion into China is a good thing But ultimately if NFLX is embroiled in the same type of situation as Google and Facebook two companies banned from China then the costs would far outweigh the benefits Netflix investors should be happy that the company is seeking out new areas to continue fueling growth but maybe should take pause at what I view as a premature move on Netflixs part Netflix remains a highly priced yet strong stock But China could prove to be a negative catalyst rather than a positive one if the challenges
