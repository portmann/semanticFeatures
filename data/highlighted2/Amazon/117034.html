To that list we can now add Netflix.Alibaba has spent more than $3 billion since March on content initiatives, according to Reuters, as part of an aggressive push into home entertainment.This should be especially troubling news for Netflix, as Alibaba is the "jack-of-all-trades" Internet company in China, with big investments in Internet industries across the board.Alibaba has a huge head start on Netflix.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While Netflix <b>may</b> be able to chip away at Alibaba 's lead , BABA is heavily invested in the entertainment industry already and can most likely easily undercut Netflix through market competition .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But Alibaba <b>could</b> be the least of Netflix 's concerns in China .  (Uncertainty) </span>Letv is also a big player in the Chinese entertainment scene, and as Wired Magazine reports: When I describe Letv as the Netflix of China, Mark Li corrects me."It's the other way around," he says."Netflix is the Letv of the US."He has a point.Letv launched its Internet video streaming service three years before Netflix (2004 versus 2007).It was producing original movies and series long before Netflix rolled out House of Cards .And in recent years, the Chinese behemoth has expanded in ways Netflix hasn't: It sells TV settop boxes and smart TVs-devices that can help you watch all that video."We want to control the screens too," says Li, the ex-Googler who is head of data analytics at Letv, a company with a $12 billion market cap.What's more, the company soon will move into the US, encroaching on Netflix.Li will lead the effort, bringing Letv's video streaming service, its original programming, its Apple-TV-like settop boxes, its smart TVs, and, now, smartphones.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Alibaba and Letv <b>could</b> pose serious challenges to Netflix .  (Uncertainty) </span>And that leads me to the "bottom line" question that summarizes the above analysisï¿½ Will China cost Netflix more than the money gained from new subscribers?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Many people may <b>assume</b> that Netflix 's expansion into China is a good thing .  (Uncertainty) </span>But ultimately, if NFLX is embroiled in the same type of situation as Google and Facebook, two companies banned from China, then the costs would far outweigh the benefits.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix investors should be happy that the company is seeking out new areas to continue fueling growth , but <b>maybe</b> should take pause at what I view as a premature move on Netflix 's part .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix remains a highly priced, yet strong stock.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But China <b>could</b> prove to be a negative catalyst rather than a positive one if the challenges cut into NFLX 's growth rather than increase it .
