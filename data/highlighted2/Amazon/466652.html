Inc. ( NASDAQ : YHOO ) | Seeking Alpha Verizon <b>appears</b> to be the winner in the drawn out Yahoo auction . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Nintendo shares close down 10%, ending a tough week as short interest climbs.PayPal shares stumble into the weekend too, after reporting earnings.Early reports say yes .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Provided that this is true , the move comes as little <b>surprise</b> , honestly .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Earlier</i> this week , we outlined that of the five remaining buyers for Yahoo ( NASDAQ : YHOO ) , only a few would get a chance at a final offer .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Reportedly Verizon ( NYSE : VZ ) was the only company offering <i>less</i> than $ 4 billion , but the company was n't looking to buy its real estate or patents either .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Recent updates suggest that Verizon spent <b>roughly</b> $ 5 billion on the deal , which includes real estate , but no patents .  (Uncertainty) </span>So why is it fitting that it's Verizon?There's the fact that Verizon has already acquired AOL Inc., showing a history of this type of acquisition.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But before that deal , it was rumored that a tie-up between AOL and Yahoo! ( YHOO ) <b>could</b> be in the works , exacerbated further when AOL CEO Tim Armstrong and Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer were spotted together late one night at a bar .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They <b>could</b> just be friends , right ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Either way, the irony is all too real with Tim Armstrong (now with Verizon via the acquisition) leading the charge on the Yahoo auction.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Seeing the details from the sale will be interesting , but <b>perhaps</b> even <i>more</i> so it will be nice to have this saga put in the past .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The over-the-counter-traded Nintendo ( OTCPK:NTDOY ) hasn't fared too well over the past few days, falling over 20% since Monday's closing price.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On Monday , we reported that shares of Nintendo were up <i>more</i> than 100 % over the past month , with its market cap soaring to ~ $ 36 billion .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But not everyone is a believer in the hype , even while some analysts may be predicting billions in revenue ( $ 3 billion of which <b>could</b> be headed toward Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>According to the most recent updates , short interest has <i>more</i> than tripled to a not-so-robust 2.57 % of the float .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's <b>unclear</b> what shorts are betting against though .  (Uncertainty) </span>Is it the fact that Nintendo doubled in market cap and were clearly overbought?Or the fact that the company only owns a 32% stake in the Pokémon Company, which alongside Niantic - a spinoff of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) - developed Pokémon Go.In other words, all that profit isn't simply flowing into Nintendo's Zelda-themed treasure chests.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>My guess is that is was <b>probably</b> both .  (Uncertainty) </span>Side Note: Pokémon Go has finally launched in Japan and also has become the most downloaded game in its first week ever , according to Apple.The e-commerce juggernaut is in practically every other business, so why not banking?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Well , it 's not technically banking , because it does n't <b>appear</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) will be loaning any money . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Specifically, the company has reportedly entered into a partnership with Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ), "in which the bank will offer interest rate discounts to select 'Prime Students.'"Students who are shopping for current loans (or looking to refinance old ones) will be able to shave off a half percentage point from that loan, provided that they are a qualifying Prime Student.So what does this deal really mean?It shows that CEO Jeff Bezos & Co. truly understands his customer.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>For students , a half percentage point off their loans <b>could</b> <i>more</i> than pay for the annual membership of Prime .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> so , the company is either helping to retain subscribers or bring new ones in .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The hope , I 'm <b>assuming</b> , is n't that students will only take advantage of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's online offerings , but also stick with the company over the long-haul . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , always a hotly contested stock here on Seeking Alpha largely due to its valuation , has amassed a market cap of <i>more</i> than $ 350 billion and is a stone 's throw from its 52-week high . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Goldman Sachs analysts say there <b>could</b> be 20 % <i>more</i> upside , while some users question if Investors Have Missed Their Chance or if The Stock Has Stalled .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ) posted 15.2% revenue growth (20% ex-currency), 7% year-over-year EPS growth, active account growth of 11% along with increased transactions per account, and a 25% increase in transactions.Sorry for the numbers blitz.Despite all of this however shares are down some 7% Friday.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That 's got to be <b>disappointing</b> , especially after the company 's full-year guidance was raised too .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Albeit , full-year EPS estimates are <b>roughly</b> in-line with expectations , if not ever-so-slightly <b>disappointing</b> , although revenue guidance is slightly above consensus .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>could</b> be attributed to the fact that 12 % of the company 's revenues come from the U.K. and revenue growth in this regard is concerning investors .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> likely than not though , it 's the company 's deal with Visa ( NYSE : V ) that 's got investors dumping shares of PayPal .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , the situation lacks clarity and already there <b>seems</b> to be some disagreements .  (Uncertainty) </span>Wells Fargo downgraded the stock, while Wedbush Securities has called it "a phenomenal move for PayPal," although its analyst did question the short-term impact.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It <b>probably</b> did n't help that going into the report the stock was hovering near 52-week highs , which as usual , tends to drag expectations <i>higher</i> as well .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Editor 's Note : This article discusses one or <i>more</i> securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Please be aware of the <b>risks</b> associated with these stocks .
