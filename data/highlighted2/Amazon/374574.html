What people don't realize about Netflix is part of that the reason why the company is spending billions on its on content is that it can build up its library in case the studios and networks decide to stop supplying it to them.Nobody is buying Netflix now just for its library of acquired content … people are buying it to watch House of Cards or Daredevil.Netflix is protecting its own business model in a very smart way.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the <i>larger</i> picture , what it all comes down to is getting the profit shared around all the major players .  (Surprise) </span>The question though comes back to that $150 price point.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Will a consumer pay that much money for the entry point when a year-long subscription to Netflix costs <i>less</i> ?  (Surprise) </span>To change the game everyone who currently profits need to be taken care of or they'll cause a stir.What's smart about Screening Room is that its founders Sean Parker (yes, that Sean Parker from Napster) and Prem Akkaraju (from STX Entertainment) are reassuring studios and theaters from the start they'll be compensated.Of course that compensation requires a sacrifice or two as Screening Room is also supposedly looking to be an exclusive content partner, which means Sony and Universal would be abandoning its rights to (for a period) utilize its own IP through the PlayStation of Comcast network of outlets.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That 's a <b>possible</b> point of contention that will further come under scrutiny .  (Uncertainty) </span>This whole battle over changing the traditional model isn't going away as new challengers are entering the field every day.However it remains to be seen just how much the average consumer will spend for what they perceive as convenience.Screening Room is specifically targeting middle-aged audiences who are not able to go to the movies because of family responsibilities.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To them the question is what makes <i>more</i> sense ?  (Surprise) </span>Spending $150 upfront and then $50 per title to see the latest films as they come out or spending under a $150 total per year at no extra cost?It really doesn't seem like a complicated answer from a financial perspective, but if the studios and theaters are getting a piece of the profits, they seem willing to play along … for now.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Services , Music & Video Stores, Expert Insight</div></body></html>
