looking to enter the space The service would allow consumers to download movies dayanddate of release in their home for a price While the service has its critics it is also finding surprising advocates that had previously fought against similar concepts These new allies are supporting the service because unlike when a company such as Netflix tries a dayanddate launch the theaters also share in the profits The question becomes if a consumer will pay a high price for the benefits of the service or if subscribing to a service such as Netflix makes more financial success Netflix NASDAQ NFLX is a disrupter Yet just as how streaming networks challenged cable TV and cable TV challenged broadcast outlets something will eventually challenge the streamers That something is slowly bubbling up and it is called Screening Room Screening Room is a proposed new service that would allow consumers to get movies beamed into their home the same day they hit theaters for a hefty price Customers would need to buy a box and then pay for each film The download would then be available for hours Heres the twist while many in the entertainment industry are as expected balking at the idea others are not Media heavyhitters such as AMC Theaters NYSE AMC Universal NASDAQ CMCSA Fox NASDAQ FOX NASDAQ FOXA and Sony NYSE SNE are showing interest and film directors Peter Jackson Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg are backing the project It has been reported that of that rental fee would go right to the theaters with another going to the studios and the remaining going to the Screening Room itself The added element is that each purchase would come with two free tickets to the theater so after watching the movie on your TV if you were so inclined to witness it on the big screen you could and pay for the concessions that often come with the experience In many major cities the price of a ticket can range from to depending on when you see it and what type of theater you see it in Now add in concessions and a night out for two at the movies can easily hit the same mark If youre a family of four or five being able to download that movie in the comfort of our own home may make life a lot easier and cheaper Although my personal opinion is while the theory is certainly valid getting people to pay that flat fee for the hardware is where Screening Room is going to run into trouble I understand the box is necessary become of its highly advance encryption software but thats a big sunk cost up front for a unproven concept Its also coming a time when people are looking to battle back against the cost of settop boxes in general Alternate methods of viewing entertainment content is nothing new but the irony here is that Screening Room essentially eliminates windowing which has been the sticking point across the board A film window is the traditional period of time between when a film hit theaters and is put out for SVODhome entertainment Eliminating windowing is exactly what Netflix has been trying to do all along but when Netflix tries it the industry turned its back on them Its not hard to see why Netflix doesnt return any profits to the theaters or the studios and thats why its seen as a threat to the industry Despite the free tickets with Screening Room both services basically move audiences away from theaters but only Screening Room pays back the theaters for the lost revenue Theaters are paranoid about windowing and many wont work with anyone advocating for the practice Universal tried to create a deal in that would have seen its Tower Heist made available to DirecTV subscribers three weeks after it hit theaters for a fee The studio was attacked by theaters and the plan was scratched Viacom NASDAQ VIA NASDAQ VIAB hit a similar snag last year when its film division Paramount revealed two of its films from the fall would challenge the traditional model as well The movies would open in theaters but then leave quicker to move to SVOD As expected many chains boycotted them however those that did exhibit the films were cut into the profits from that SVOD revenue The streamers arent immune either as <span style='background-color:

Netflix <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is fine with not doing a dayanddate release on its servers and instead giving theaters a extended window Yet that still didnt help and presents a real problem for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and any fellow streamer looking to woo filmmakers expecting to get their films into an top theater chain What people dont realize about Netflix is part of that the reason why the company is spending billions on its on content is that it can build up its library in case the studios and networks decide to stop supplying it to them Nobody is buying Netflix now just for its library of acquired content people are buying it to watch House of Cards or Daredevil Netflix is protecting its own business model in a very smart way In the larger picture what it all comes down to is getting the profit shared around all the major players The question though comes back to that price point Will a consumer pay that much money for the entry point when a yearlong subscription to Netflix costs less To change the game everyone who currently profits need to be taken care of or theyll cause a stir Whats smart about Screening Room is that its founders Sean Parker yes that Sean Parker from Napster and Prem Akkaraju from STX Entertainment are reassuring studios and theaters from the start theyll be compensated Of course that compensation requires a sacrifice or two as Screening Room is also supposedly looking to be an exclusive content partner which means Sony and Universal would be abandoning its rights to for a period utilize its own IP through the PlayStation of Comcast network of outlets Thats a possible point of contention that will further come under scrutiny This whole battle over changing the traditional model isnt going away as new challengers are entering the field every day However it remains to be seen just how much the average consumer will spend for what they perceive as convenience Screening Room is specifically targeting middleaged audiences who are not able to go to the movies because of family responsibilities To them the question is what makes more sense Spending upfront and then per title to see the latest films as they come out or spending under a total per year at no extra cost It really doesnt seem like a complicated answer from a financial perspective but if the studios and theaters are getting a piece of the profits they seem willing to play along for now Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within
