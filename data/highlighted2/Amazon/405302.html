the ranks of DISH and PlayStation While the new bundle will certainly add value to Hulus service it isnt much different than anything currently on the market Netflix still remains the leader in the field and has no reason to look at offering live programming as it doesnt need any addons to keep customers What Netflix does is continue to show value by expanding its offerings through adding multicamera sitcoms a new talk show with Chelsea Handler and reality series Ultimate Beastmaster Hulu recently revealed it will become the latest entrant to the streaming skinny bundle derby as it looks to join the same field as DISH NASDAQ DISH and Sonys NYSE SNE PlayStation Of course theres also the rumor mill that has places like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN and Apple NASDAQ AAPL looking to get involved some time soon as well Yet the one name you arent hearing and likely wont is Netflix NASDAQ NFLX The leader in streaming entertainment Netflix has every reason to look at live programming and also every reason to throw it right back on the back burner Yet that wont stop analysts and reporters from touting Hulus move as a gamechanger While for Hulu as a company it may well be a gamechanger for the streaming industry overall it is less of a big deal Before going into the Netflix side of things let me elaborate a little because thats a important designation Hulus skinny bundle service still lacks the same flaw that DISHs Sling and PlayStation Vue have in that it wont have ALL the major networks in all the overall markets The first streaming skinny bundle to get all of the local ABC CBS NBC and Fox stations and programming essentially wins Until then youre asking audiences to choose between favorites as well as live versus delayed viewing Unless the only other option is no TV at all then they arent going to break with the pack PlayStations Vue comes the closest until you look at the fine print The service recently went national with its slim service but of those markets only a handful has local markets covered off as well Slim plans are only available in the newly launched markets and will offer all of the same live cable channels as the standard PlayStation Vue plans However ABC FOX and NBC will offer videoondemand VODonly content It goes on to explain that in those markets ABC Fox and NBC programming will be available ondemand hours later while PlayStation is still in negotiation with CBS which has its own separate service Again not as clear cut as youd expect from the graphic on the main page So back to Netflix and how this impacts the company Simply put Netflix has a solid and sizable base with a simple streaming business model in other words it doesnt have to rely on gimmicks The Hulu news is the next logical step for the Hulu brand and it does give the companys subscribers more value but it doesnt bring a gamechanging element to the proceedings Hulu is playing a version of catchup And I dont want to sell short what Hulu did because with this and its rise in successful scripted programming The Path the network is moving in the right direction but this is only a preview of whats to come Look at Netflix though and youll see the difference This week Netflix is launching its new Chelsea Handler talk show which will be Netflixs first attempt a semidaily program as well as its first talk show Chelsea will run three days a week and post minute commercial free installments every Wednesday Thursday and Friday Around episodes a year are expected to run on average and they will be shot in front of live studio audience but not air live Chelsea doesnt have to air live especially since Jimmy Fallon Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colberts latenight talkers dont air live either Yes the LIVE With Kelly Michaels and The Views of the world do air live but here the live aspect is a footnote to a bigger picture What Netflix is doing is continuing to expand its mark into series TV and it is an everevolving process Remember the justlaunched and just renewed comedies Fuller House and The Ranch were the networks first multicamera ie laughtrack series It was a subtle change but it showed range The network also just signed Ultimate Beastmaster its first realitycompetition series which is being produced by Sylvester Stallone The American Ninja Warrioresque obstacle course battle will unfold over episodes that will be available all at once which again goes against type for this genre That expansion is part of the reason why Netflix has no qualms about staying the course On a recent earnings call CCO Ted Sarandos even addressed the matter And other people doing live I think its great Its about the further expansion of internet television to include live We dont have to do everything to be part of that expansion Now other people may point to that as shortsightedness on Netflixs part as a live element could further lure over cordcutters and give them more of a competitive advantage Yet Netflixs model isnt broken and it doesnt need to add things just to add things Remember Netflix had the chance to bid on the NFLs recent Thursday night broadcast and streaming right packages and didnt make a big effort Thats because it knew it wouldnt bring much value to it The streaming package alone is watered down as it is as CBS NBC and Verizon already have share limited rights Hulu needed some type of differentiator and this works for it It is right in its wheelhouse and the pieces were already in place Netflix doesnt need to counter with anything in kind because its own moves will speak for itself Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and
