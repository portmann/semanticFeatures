Yet the one name you aren't hearing and likely won't is Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ).The leader in streaming entertainment Netflix has every reason to look at live programming and also every reason to throw it right back on the back burner.Yet that won't stop analysts and reporters from touting Hulu's move as a game-changer.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While for Hulu as a company it <b>may</b> well be a game-changer , for the streaming industry overall it is <i>less</i> of a big deal .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Before going into the Netflix side of things, let me elaborate a little because that's a important designation.Hulu's skinny bundle service still lacks the same flaw that DISH's Sling and PlayStation Vue have in that it won't have ALL the major networks in all the overall markets.The first streaming skinny bundle to get all of the local ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox stations and programming essentially wins.Until then, you're asking audiences to choose between favorites as well as live versus delayed viewing.Unless the only other option is no TV at all, then they aren't going to break with the pack.PlayStation's Vue comes the closest until you look at the fine print.The service recently went national with its "slim" service, but of those 200+ markets, only a handful has local markets covered off as well.Slim plans are only available in the newly launched markets and will offer all of the same live cable channels as the standard PlayStation Vue plans.However, ABC, FOX and NBC will offer video-on-demand (VOD)-only content.It goes on to explain that in those markets ABC, Fox and NBC programming will be available on-demand 24 hours later, while PlayStation is still in negotiation with CBS which has its own separate service.Again, not as clear cut as you'd expect from the graphic on the main page.So back to Netflix and how this impacts the company.Simply put, Netflix has a solid and sizable base with a simple streaming business modelâ€¦ in other words, it doesn't have to rely on gimmicks.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Hulu news is the next logical step for the Hulu brand and it does give the company 's subscribers <i>more</i> value , but it does n't bring a game-changing element to the proceedings .  (Surprise) </span>Hulu is playing a version of catch-up.And I don't want to sell short what Hulu did, because with this and its rise in successful scripted programming (11.22.63, The Path), the network is moving in the right direction, but this is only a preview of what's to come.Look at Netflix, though, and you'll see the difference.This week Netflix is launching its new Chelsea Handler talk show which will be Netflix's first attempt a semi-daily program as well as its first talk show.Chelsea will run three days a week and post 30 minute commercial free installments every Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.Around 90 episodes a year are expected to run on average and they will be shot in front of live studio audience, but not air live.Chelsea doesn't have to air live, especially since Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert's late-night talkers don't air live either.Yes, the LIVE!<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With Kelly & Michael 's and The View 's of the world do air live , but here the `` live '' aspect is a footnote to a <i>bigger</i> picture .  (Surprise) </span>What Netflix is doing is continuing to expand its mark into series TV and it is an ever-evolving process.Remember the just-launched (and just renewed) comedies Fuller House and The Ranch were the network's first multi-camera (i.e. laugh-track) series.It was a subtle change, but it showed range.The network also just signed Ultimate Beastmaster, its first reality-competition series which is being produced by Sylvester Stallone.The American Ninja Warrior-esque obstacle course battle will unfold over 10 episodes that will be available all at once, which again goes against type for this genre.That expansion is part of the reason why Netflix has no qualms about staying the course.On a recent earnings call, CCO Ted Sarandos even addressed the matter.And other people doing live, I think it's great.It's about the further expansion of internet television to include live.We don't have to do everything to be part of that expansion.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Now other people may point to that as short-sightedness on Netflix 's part as a `` live '' element <b>could</b> <i>further</i> lure over cord-cutters and give them <i>more</i> of a competitive advantage .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Yet, Netflix's model isn't broken and it doesn't need to add things just to add things.Remember, Netflix had the chance to bid on the NFL's recent Thursday night broadcast and streaming right packages and didn't make a big effort.That's because it knew it wouldn't bring much value to it.The streaming package alone is watered down as it is, as CBS, NBC and Verizon already have share limited rights.Hulu needed some type of differentiator and this works for it.It is right in its wheelhouse and the pieces were already in place.Netflix doesn't need to counter with anything in kind because its own moves will speak for itself.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Services , Music & Video Stores, Expert Insight</div></body></html>
