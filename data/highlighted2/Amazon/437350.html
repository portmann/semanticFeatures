class='textDiv'>WalMarts Revolutionary Delivery Service WalMart Stores Inc NYSEWMT Seeking Alpha Grocery Pickup was a great program that showed how much customers like the convenience of having groceries brought to the car The next step was getting orders brought to the customers house By partnering with ridesharing services WalMart gained access to a fleet of drivers Customers already paying for delivery from WalMart might as well add other items to their orders WalMart NYSE WMT announced a brilliant new initiative earlier in June This is one that got limited coverage and I think many investors dont realize just how powerful this initiative could be On the WalMart blog there was a post by the COO of WalMarts Global eCommerce segment He explained that WalMart started a new program with Uber Private UBER Lyft Private LYFT and Deliv It wasnt too long ago that WalMart announced their introduction of grocery pickup This program allowed customers to buy their goods from WalMarts website and then schedule a time to drive into the parking lot so their groceries could be loaded into the car This was an incredible service for parents that didnt want to drag multiple kids through the store The program was free to customers and allowed WalMart to encourage more customers to learn to use their website As I demonstrated recently their website is designed well The big challenge for home delivery has been the concept of the last mile Shipping to a location near a customer wasnt a major problem it was getting the goods to actually reach the customer WalMart and Target NYSE TGT have an incredible infrastructure for getting products near the customers but the retail giants were threatened by the possibility of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN getting clearance to use drones to do delivery In theory those drones would be a very efficient way to cover the last mile but that is still a work in progress and I believe WMT and TGT would be quick to implement drones if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is able to create the legal framework While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>deals with that challenge WalMart looked at a way to capitalize on the already existing technology Companies like Uber have done an incredible job of mobilizing drivers to create a dramatic improvement to the old taxi system WalMart is able to utilize that now by bringing in drivers to deliver orders from the website In this scenario WalMart acts as the customer to the other companies and pays the drivers WalMart shoppers would be responsible for paying WalMart a charge in the range of to and WalMart would take it from there The reason this is huge is because WalMart is able to do it well before drones become a big thing This provides a huge incentive for customers to learn to use WalMarts site and set up an account there It also allows WalMart to offer same day deliveries in cities where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>cant offer it Further it allows WalMart to benefit from huge economies of scale on the delivery Using drones is a great concept but using them to deliver pounds of cold groceries is a logistical nightmare If a customer is already buying their groceries from WalMart and paying the delivery charge they might as well add on other items they want delivered at the same time The popular commentary is that retail is dead While I do believe many retail stores are facing very serious risk of going under I believe WalMart may kill more of them than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>WalMart is redesigning the rules of competing in retail by introducing concepts like grocery pickup and have it delivered by an Uber driver that small retailers wont be able to match I expect Target and Costco NASDAQ COST to announce their versions of the program within the year While the market capitalization of the retail sector may shrink as less efficient companies go under and as Target and WalMart buyback shares at a rapid pace the market capitalization of the retail sector shouldnt be the measure of what investors should hold in their portfolio WalMart announced a solution to the last mile Their use of existing technologies to solve the problem represents an innovation in the way retail companies compete The strategy should drive small and inefficient companies out of business but it should also protect WalMart Target and Costco from the threat of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>coming in to take their lunch Depending on how WalMart accounts for these sales it could distort their same store sales figures with their online sales Disclosure I amwe are long WMT TGT I wrote this article
