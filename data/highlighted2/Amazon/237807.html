(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Pim Keulen , Follow me on Twitter (110 clicks) Netflix's international subscribers growth will be lifted by developments in Australia.Going forward, Netflix should think of alternative ways to diversify its content and service.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A Seeking Alpha contributor already <b>suggested</b> Netflix going into sports .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) trades well above $110 per share today after a temporary slowdown last week.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Investors seem to be happy about <i>better</i> than expected subscriber numbers in Australia .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix 's international success follows some <b>doubts</b> regarding its domestic subscriber growth in the most recent third quarter .  (Uncertainty) </span>Much has already been said about Netflix's future and I agree, it does look bright.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>One of the <i>better</i> articles I read on Netflix was written by Seeking Alpha contributor Alex Cho .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Cho argued that Netflix , besides pricing leverage , <b>might</b> explore the opportunity to broadcast sports in the future .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is a nice out-of-the-box idea which <b>could</b> really fit Netflix business model going forward .  (Uncertainty) </span>Further, Netflix is investing heavily in exclusive content.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I find that this is a wise development as it lowers the company 's <b>dependence</b> on content licensing deals with other parties .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Earlier</i> this month , Time Warner ( NYSE : TWX ) stated that it is considering to hold on to their broadcast rights <i>longer</i> before granting a license to streaming services .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although I consider Netflix 's business model and original content strong enough to withstand the growing constraint in content from third parties at this point , this development might become a <b>risk</b> for the company 's business model in the future .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>To limit the <b>risk</b> of <i>less</i> available content in the future , Netflix should diversify in this early stage .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>That is why I find Cho's idea about Netflix expanding into sports an interesting one.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is another risk that <b>could</b> threaten Netflix 's business model and growth in the future .  (Uncertainty) </span>The number of 'full package' streaming services is growing.With 'full package' I mean services that offer a collection of streaming services.The best example of such a service is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Prime . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A Prime subscription includes both TV and music streaming , eBooks , online storage and <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span>As strong as Netflix's business model with original content is, it remains a streaming service focused on television (movies, series, etc.).<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With or without the expansion to sports , this is relatively limited and comes with a <i>higher</i> <b>risk</b> than <i>more</i> balanced services that offer a <i>broader</i> range of services , for example <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>One way or the other , I <b>believe</b> that Netflix 's growth scenario would become <i>more</i> solid when the company decides to diversify into a service that offers <i>more</i> than ` just ' television streaming services .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>A while ago, I wrote a blog arguing that Netflix and music streaming service Spotify would actually be a good match.I am not saying that Netflix should buy Spotify immediately as its price tag would be quite high.But just consider the potential going forward.First of all, Netflix will add another high growth streaming market to its streaming business.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Further , Netflix creates an opportunity for cross selling : music streaming subscribers <b>could</b> add a television streaming subscription or the other way around .  (Uncertainty) </span>Last but not least , Netflix will face the increased competition from full package services like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime . The combination of a full service television and music streaming service would also mean that subscribers do not have to switch services if they want to change from a movie to listening to music.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This makes life <i>easier</i> and it should be a real plus for ( potential ) subscribers to choose Netflix over other stand-alone television or music streaming services .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In my opinion , it is not a question of why Netflix should to it , but <i>more</i> a question of when Netflix should do it .  (Surprise) </span>At this point, the company is investing in original content and international expansion.A major acquisition or startup of a second streaming service will take a significant amount of the available cash from investments in the television streaming service.Therefore, it makes sense it Netflix will wait for a move into another market (for example music).Let me be clear.Netflix is a strong company and the growth of its television streaming, both nationally and internationally, is far from over.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , Netflix <b>could</b> deliver additional growth and pricing power if the company decides to diversify and offer other non-television streaming services in the future .
