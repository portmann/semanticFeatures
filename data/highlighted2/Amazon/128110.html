in AWS revenue Combined AWS and supplemental income likely including Prime become of AMZN revenue up from in Q Prime ecosystem expanding internationally retail likely becoming the gateway to recurring revenue even as it continues to be AMZNs bread and butter Its still early in the earnings season but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN blew investors away with an earnings report that sent the stock up in postearnings trading largely due to EPS that trounced estimates as well as improving revenue projections Yet arguably the most important aspect of the earnings report for the last quarter might not have to do with the number of products <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was able to move but rather its recurring service business such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime which not only had some of the biggest gains yearoveryear but has grown its share of the overall revenue signaling how important this branch has become and will become as the quarters and years go on One aspect that many analysts are excited for is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services a cloud data storage system for businesses that generates its revenue through subscriptions According to the companys filings AWS has become of TTM sales and is now significant enough to be separated in the earnings report For Q net sales increased YOY to billion with operating income at million up from the million operating loss in This is a significant area of growth for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>because unlike its inventory and thirdparty sales in goods this is revenue that can be continually generated and is significantly more predictable Cloud data services are growing in importance as companies look to outsource its data analytics at an often cheaper rate than building the infrastructure inhouse and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is positioning itself to be a goto destination for offsite data storage As this segment grows expect AWS to make up a larger share of Amazons sales and become a more pivotal part of the companys operations In the shopping and streaming ring of Amazons products <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime has increased in importance to the companys top line According to the transcript republished on Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>executives noted how Prime is growing internationally at a faster rate than in the US with oneday shipping arriving in London and Italy coming up soon While hard Prime figures are still hard to come by and has not been separated out like AWS has executives emphasized that digital services for Prime such as movie streams and access to original content have helped drive retention rates and freetrial conversions which is helping to keep the Prime Flywheel turning While the actual numbers of new subscribers werent released looking at the companys supplemental income hints at a significant increase in subscriptions as well as other service improvements Supplemental income increased by YOY in North America offsetting a decrease worldwide to show a million improvement for the quarter News that Prime Now added three more cities to its network and its first international location also confirms that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is committed to growing the ecosystem to include even more than just shipping and streaming and with over billion in free cash flow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has the resources to make good Supplemental income assuming this includes services like Prime as well as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services have increased their share of Amazons revenues as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>continues to aggressively invest in subscriptionbased services and providing value for money In Q of these two services combined for only of Amazons revenues at billion out of billion in revenue Last quarter this share improved to of revenues at roughly billion out of billion in revenue As this rate of growth improves retail will become secondary or as in the case of Prime Day a vehicle to hook new customers into Amazons ecosystem Hence the main takeaway from this quarter should be that Amazons future growth is dependent on increases in subscriptions for business and personal services rather than retail figures even as retail continues to be Amazons breadandbutter Expect Prime subscription data to be separated in earnings reports very soon simply because it will
