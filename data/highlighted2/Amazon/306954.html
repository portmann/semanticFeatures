Gaiam Brands has a ton of doors in chains like Target (NYSE: TGT ) and Kohls (NYSE: KSS ).Growth and margin expansion are not pipe dreams.It grew revenue 24% last quarter and 16% YTD.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In my analysis I 'm only <b>assuming</b> 13 % and 0 % respectively .  (Uncertainty) </span>The overall company has had >40% gross margins for 10 years, and while I think the long-term numbers are generally not representative, I do think Brands has consistently done >40% gross margin.Typical SG&A for a consumer products company at scale is as much as 20-25%, so the Brands should be capable of 15-20% at scale or as a division of a bigger company like LULU.As a standalone now with all of Gaiam's heavy corporate overheard included, it is doing 5% margins, and that improved to 6.25% in Q3.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think 10 % is very feasible in a few years even as a standalone , and could prove conservative if it 's bought , which I think is <b>possible</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>To a large consumer products company looking to penetrate the yoga/spiritual demographic, Gaiam Brands must look pretty attractive.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Previously I mentioned the <b>pending</b> spinoff of Gaiam TV , but I only dedicated one sentence to it .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is actually a big deal.The way I see it now, this is a catalyst regardless and a heads I win, tails I don't lose much situation regarding the various outcomes.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Shareholders have been waiting patiently ( <b>perhaps</b> impatiently based on the recent stock move ? )  (Uncertainty) </span>for over a year for the spinoff.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apparently , the spinoff <b>may</b> not ultimately be approved by the Board .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>seems</b> like what the company is trying to do is sell Gaiam TV .  (Uncertainty) </span>It's worth much more to a 100% holder than in the public market as a standalone.With only $14mm of run-rate revenue right now, public company costs would be >10% of revenue and it wouldn't have the resources to grow at the rates it wants to.As a small piece of a big buyer, that story changes entirely.A sale would fetch a good price and the cash would be here and now rather than a few years from now.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That 's the optimal outcome , but it 's <b>probably</b> not very likely at this point .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The other outcomes are that Gaiam keeps it and cancels the spinoff , which is a good outcome and what I <b>assume</b> in my valuation .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The worst outcome is them actually doing the spinoff , but while this would be structurally unattractive long-term for the reasons I mentioned above , it <b>could</b> trade at a frothy multiple in the public market as a standalone temporarily because of comps like Netflix in this market environment .  (Uncertainty) </span>Readers should note that the way I'm framing Gaiam is as it is now and how I expect it to be in the next few years, that is, profitable, but this business has a history of large losses, changes in strategy, and wasteful capital allocation.For a long time the company seemed to have a demographic and vision, but not a monetizable business strategy, and certainly not one they stuck to.There's always the chance the strategy changes again, the operations are neglected and revert to losses, capital allocation does more damage, etc.It is certainly worth doing a survey of this company's history and taking that into consideration.To some extent, the argument that Gaiam has been a value trap / dead money before is unfair because various factors have changed that make the stock more attractive here.For one, the company's businesses haven't both been growing at greater than 20% in the past: The company hasn't always been so focused.The company had forays into solar, non-theatrical video production, real estate (the office building in Boulder), etc.With the spinoff and expected sale of the building, we get something that's been a long-time coming for Gaiam - two focused, pure-play businesses.Whatever happens, it doesn't make sense for Gaiam to trade lower and lower as we get closer to closure regarding the spinoff and as business performance in both segments improves dramatically.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I still have my <b>doubts</b> - what if they do something really stupid on the capital allocation front ?  (Uncertainty) </span>It wouldn't be the first time.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That combined with Gaiam TV actually being spun off and not perceived well by the market could still create a bad outcome , but I 'm more comfortable now with my way of assessing reasonable outcomes here and I think they look pretty good in terms of expected returns and downside <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>With the recent decline, Gaiam is a at a multi-year low and I think now is a good opportunity to take a small position and begin following it more intensely.</div></body></html>
