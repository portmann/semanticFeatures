Gaiam Brands has a ton of doors in chains like Target (NYSE: TGT ) and Kohls (NYSE: KSS ).Growth and margin expansion are not pipe dreams.It grew revenue 24% last quarter and 16% YTD.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In my analysis I 'm only <b>assuming</b> 13 % and 0 % respectively .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The overall company has had <i>></i> 40 % gross margins for 10 years , and while I think the long-term numbers are generally not representative , I do think Brands has consistently done <i>></i> 40 % gross margin .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Typical SG&A for a consumer products company at scale is as much as 20-25 % , so the Brands should be capable of 15-20 % at scale or as a division of a <i>bigger</i> company like LULU .  (Surprise) </span>As a standalone now with all of Gaiam's heavy corporate overheard included, it is doing 5% margins, and that improved to 6.25% in Q3.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think 10 % is very feasible in a few years even as a standalone , and could prove conservative if it 's bought , which I think is <b>possible</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>To a large consumer products company looking to penetrate the yoga/spiritual demographic, Gaiam Brands must look pretty attractive.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Previously I mentioned the <b>pending</b> spinoff of Gaiam TV , but I only dedicated one sentence to it .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is actually a big deal.The way I see it now, this is a catalyst regardless and a heads I win, tails I don't lose much situation regarding the various outcomes.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Shareholders have been waiting patiently ( <b>perhaps</b> impatiently based on the recent stock move ? )  (Uncertainty) </span>for over a year for the spinoff.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apparently , the spinoff <b>may</b> not ultimately be approved by the Board .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>seems</b> like what the company is trying to do is sell Gaiam TV .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's worth much <i>more</i> to a 100 % holder than in the public market as a standalone .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With only $ 14mm of run-rate revenue right now , public company costs would be <i>></i> 10 % of revenue and it would n't have the resources to grow at the rates it wants to .  (Surprise) </span>As a small piece of a big buyer, that story changes entirely.A sale would fetch a good price and the cash would be here and now rather than a few years from now.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That 's the optimal outcome , but it 's <b>probably</b> not very likely at this point .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The other outcomes are that Gaiam keeps it and cancels the spinoff , which is a good outcome and what I <b>assume</b> in my valuation .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The worst outcome is them actually doing the spinoff , but while this would be structurally unattractive long-term for the reasons I mentioned above , it <b>could</b> trade at a frothy multiple in the public market as a standalone temporarily because of comps like Netflix in this market environment .  (Uncertainty) </span>Readers should note that the way I'm framing Gaiam is as it is now and how I expect it to be in the next few years, that is, profitable, but this business has a history of large losses, changes in strategy, and wasteful capital allocation.For a long time the company seemed to have a demographic and vision, but not a monetizable business strategy, and certainly not one they stuck to.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There 's always the chance the strategy changes again , the operations are neglected and revert to losses , capital allocation does <i>more</i> damage , etc. .  (Surprise) </span>It is certainly worth doing a survey of this company's history and taking that into consideration.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To some extent , the argument that Gaiam has been a value trap / dead money before is unfair because various factors have changed that make the stock <i>more</i> attractive here .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For one , the company 's businesses have n't both been growing at <i>greater</i> than 20 % in the past : The company has n't always been so focused .  (Surprise) </span>The company had forays into solar, non-theatrical video production, real estate (the office building in Boulder), etc.With the spinoff and expected sale of the building, we get something that's been a long-time coming for Gaiam - two focused, pure-play businesses.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Whatever happens , it does n't make sense for Gaiam to trade <i>lower</i> and <i>lower</i> as we get <i>closer</i> to closure regarding the spinoff and as business performance in both segments improves dramatically .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I still have my <b>doubts</b> - what if they do something really stupid on the capital allocation front ?  (Uncertainty) </span>It wouldn't be the first time.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>That combined with Gaiam TV actually being spun off and not perceived well by the market could still create a bad outcome , but I 'm <i>more</i> comfortable now with my way of assessing reasonable outcomes here and I think they look pretty good in terms of expected returns and downside <b>risk</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With the recent decline , Gaiam is a at a multi-year low and I think now is a good opportunity to take a small position and begin following it <i>more</i> intensely .  (Surprise) </span></div></body></html>
