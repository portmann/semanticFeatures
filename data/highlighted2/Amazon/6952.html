online requires a toolbox and that toolbox needs to have tools that can actually generate income <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Mechanical Turk is just such a tool Its possible to generate funds with Mechanical Turk Mturk but there is a small learning curve involved Heres what it is how it works and how to use it to make money The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Mechanical Turk sometimes called Mturk is an online portal that connects people and businesses requesters to a crowdsource workers When requesters need a task accomplished that isnt possible through automation they put the request on Mturk Users then choose the tasks they are qualified for and complete them When a user completes a task they earn money These tasks are HITS Human Intelligence Tasks Signing up for Mechanical Turk is a simple process All it requires is to go to mturkcom and sign up as a worker with a name email address and password After the account approval it is possible to get to work and earn money right away You can sign up with your regular <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>account to make it easy The source of making money is through HITS These tasks have a wide range and not everyone can do every task Here are some examples of HITS Write a word article about something for Write a short podcast transcript for Add tags to images for a penny per tag There are a number of HITS available and they vary in length price and expertise needed For those seeking to make money it is certainly possible to use these HITS to generate casual break time income or full time money with some speed and dedication In order to choose a hit from the dashboard its as simple as clicking Accept HIT to start and Submit HIT when finished HITS often come in groups so its not as if someone will become stuck with just one HIT from one group Since they come in batches a lot of the time its possible to become good at doing one and then following through with many others in quick succession Not all HITS are open to everyone Some HITS require that the person show some degree of expertise To do this they must go through a qualification HIT The HIT itself will show if someone qualifies or not and there is a link to request the qualification For more general qualifications it is possible to go to the Qualifications tab on the dashboard There is a long list of possible qualifications listed there hundreds and hundreds of them A worker only needs to peruse them to find which look interesting Some require nothing more than a request Some others may require a test which is similar to a HIT For workers that submit consistently high quality work it is possible to join the rank of Mechanical Turk Masters who receive exclusive access to some really good HITS Making Money with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Mechanical Turk Because the HITS range in value it is important that workers figure out how to leverage the system to make the most money out of it There is no one way to do it since it all depends on the skills of the individual worker In general the faster someone can complete a task the better Some people are better at typing at high speeds some are good at filling out surveys quickly Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Mechanical Turk offers so much variety the only real way to find out the earning potential is to get in there and experiment with a few HITS After getting the hang of the system and finding where their strengths lay a worker can then begin to recognize which HITS will pay the most for their time and which will take up too much of their time For example writing a word article may take one person all day long so its probably not a good idea for them to try to handle those HITS However for some others writing a clean readable word essay can take about ten minutes So if that HIT pays and there is a large group of them then that worker stands to make around per hour Its important to look at HITS from that perspective for those that really want to make money In addition some requesters will also pay out bonuses at their discretion Payments work through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Payment As HITS become approved the payments go to the earnings section of the profile From there it is possible to transfer the earned amount to an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Payments account From there it is possible to transfer the funds to a bank account or change them to an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>gift card For those seeking another way to earn money then Mechanical Turk is definitely a good avenue to pursue Its important to remember that Mturk should represent another tool in the moneymaking toolbox Its difficult for some to make full time pay from the service That is to say it is possible to make good money but its not something that will happen immediately Mturk will not make you rich quick It requires dedication With that said keep in mind that Mechanical Turk does have everything going for it to help those that really want to leverage it It can help you earn extra money on the side but it probably wont be life changing money unless you figure out a way to complete a large number of HITS each and every day Mturk is flexible in that there are no minimum requirements or payment thresholds Most HITS require little to no skill but theres room to develop a talent and grow For those interested in making money from home <span
