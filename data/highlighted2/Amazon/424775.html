Global satellite provided internet access could unlock the final potential billion plus internet users in developing countries and rural areas Industry players are positioning themselves to capture this internet user market the rewards can be huge Several groups are moving in to be the first to provide affordable global access to the billion potential internet users that have so far been left behind due to cost and access issues Capturing the second half of the worlds internet users can be rewarding for those that succeed hence most of the big players are involved In this article I will focus on the plans to start a global satellite world wide web that will be accessible to all and at an affordable price It should not be forgotten that many have tried and failed before Teledesic was a failed project funded in part by Microsoft that ended up costing more than billion Teledesics idea was to create a broadband satellite constellation of hundreds of loworbiting satellites providing inexpensive internet access with download speeds of up to Mbits The project was abandoned in In September Eutelsat launched the first internetready satellite for consumers By ViaSats launched the ViaSat satellite and in the HughesNets Jupiter was launched ViaSat through its Exede brand and EchoStar through subsidiary HughesNet still operate today Qualcomm QCOMM also launched Globalstar The current satellite services are typically very expensive and have a limited throughput of data Global satellite provided internet access would unlock the final potential billion plus internet users in developing countries and remote areas By launching satellites into lower space companies plan to meet this huge need Currently there are around b internet users globally out of b people on the planet That represents around of the planet is online Or viewed another way or more than half are not yet connected Excluding the very young and the very old say m there is a market to add around b internet users globally Facebook FB Price USD Facebook started about two and a half years ago when founder Mark Zuckerberg setup Internetorg which was to complement the original mission of Facebook to make the world more open and connected Facebook made Africa the front stage for this mission and has commenced using Spacecom satellites to provide internet to countries in Africa initially via an Express Wifi service where a local entrepreneur provides WiFi access to the local town or village Facebook are already live in India and Indonesia with Express WiFi and are looking to expand further into rural Asian areas of the Philippines and Myanmar Arguably satellite internet may allow Facebook to access rural China one day Even if that does not occur the table below shows the huge potential in emerging countries such as India to increase internet access Facebook currently has a market cap of USD b a PE of or NYSE E PE of and a PEG ratio of Startup internet satellite constellation operator OneWeb LLC based in Britains Channel Islands already has million in funding from big players that include satellite fleet operator Intelsat NYSE I Bharti Enterprises Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM CocaCola NYSE KO and Hughes Network Systems It was founded by Greg Wyler Their board of directors include Sir Richard Branson Their goal is to boost internet access to the percent or billion of the worlds population who still do not have reliable access to the World Wide Web OneWeb plans to launch satellites to encircle the Earth from a lower orbit similar to the Musk plan Then small lowcost user terminals that communicate to the satellites in the sky will emit LTE G and WiFi to the surrounding areas providing highspeed internet access for everyone at an affordable price You can read more about them at their website here In April OneWeb Satellites announced a joint venture between OneWeb LLC and Airbus to build a factory just outside the gates of NASAs Kennedy Space Center in Florida to build its satellite constellation That will ultimately see the company churning them out at satellites a week following a cofunding agreement with the state of Florida Their satellites will be launched into space by Richard Bransons Virgin Galactic OneWeb hopes to start manufacturing in with the first satellite launch scheduled for late or early The full constellation is expected to be in orbit by the end of Investors cannot yet invest in OneWeb as it is still a private company But they could consider to invest in their early financial partners mentioned above who would own shares in the company Inelsat SA is a satellite services company It has a current price of USD a market cap of m no PE The company has recently had to restructure a lot of debt Looks risky Qualcomm manufactures digital wireless communications equipment including the snapdragon modems used in Apple smartphones and many internet of things IoTs devices Its stock price suffered recently due to a slowdown in smartphone sales and in particular Apples smartphone sales as Apple represented of Qualcomms revenue in Qualcomm could benefit as a early share holder and also by selling modems to future OneWeb customers It has a current market cap of b a PEG ratio of and a PE of Analyst consensus target is USD with a buy recommendation You can read more here Strong upside potential should OneWeb become the dominant internet provider for the developing and rural world Airbus Group NYSE AIR price EUR Airbus has a market cap of USD b a PE of and PE of Alphabet Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Space X privately owned by Elon Musk GOOGL Price USD Back in January Google announced a USD b investment into Elon Musks SpaceX for the purpose of creating a global satellite network to provide global internet access for all Previous satellite provided internet has been expensive and had latency lag issues Musk plans to solve this with a series of around low orbit satellites just miles from earth The explicit focus of this approach is to create a large network of relatively simple devices as opposed to the current big satellite model in which extremely complex heavy and expensive satellites are lofted into orbit to share signal across much of the planet but at substandard latencies and very high costs Musk envisions this as a longterm plan with launches beginning in five years and the network only coming fully online in years The advantage Space X has over others that tried and failed previously is it has developed very low cost space launches with reuseable rockets such as the Falcon Investors cannot currently buy shares in SpaceX however they can buy Google So if you are a fan of Google then this can be an additional reason to buy them Obviously this is a long term project so revenues may some time away but there is large potential Alphabet Googles main businesses are Google search Google adwords Youtube Google maps and android Other businesses include Calico Nest Private CLOUD and Google Fiber as well as its investing arms such as Google Ventures and Google Capital and incubator projects such as Google X Alphabet Google has a market cap of USD b and a PE of PE is better at just The existing satellite providers ViaSat NASDAQ VSAT EchoStar NASDAQ SATS and GlobalStar NYSEMKT GSAT are really niche providers servicing those that can afford higher rates or for military aircraft marine and remote mining operations It has been said that the current mobile phone conglomerates could provide global internet coverage using existing satellite capacity Obviously they cannot do it economically otherwise they would have done it by now SpaceX in particular has drastically cut the costs of launching satellites into space and one would expect Virgin to follow this lead The cable providers All the cable internet companies are competitors However the cable companies have not yet successfully rolled out cable to reach remote areas or the least developed countries as it is not economically viable for them to do so Industry players are positioning themselves to capture a potential billion new internet user market using satellite internet the rewards can be huge In fact Facebook is already doing it in Africa and Asia Currently internet users are growing by around million pa see table earlier in the article However if affordable global satellite internet becomes available that rate is set to increase dramatically We could see the internet grow even more rapidly from the current billion users now to around or billion users as soon as the end of the decade or shortly thereafter That will create a very strong tailwind for the major internet players such as the smart phone companies Apple NASDAQ AAPL Samsung OTCSSNLF Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY search engines companies Google Baidu NASDAQ BIDU online retailers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Alibaba NYSE BABA and the social media companies Facebook Twitter NYSE TWTR The three best funded and most likely future providers of affordable satellite internet are Facebook OneWeb and GoogleSpaceX At this time Facebook and OneWeb appear to be more advanced and likely to succeed Investors cannot buy directly into SpaceX Virgin Galactic or OneWeb as they are private companies however investors can buy into Facebook Google Qulacomm Airbus or Inelsat My top would be Facebook Google and Qualcomm Facebook is already using satellite internet to access new users in Africa and Asia Google seems well placed to benefit given their early mover investments Qualcomm being a smaller company has a greater potential for impact but more risk I am not an investment analyst or satellite expert therefore I welcome comments from those that have knowledge and expertise in this
