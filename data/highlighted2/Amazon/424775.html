(Uncertainty) </span>Industry players are positioning themselves to capture this internet user market - the rewards can be huge.Several groups are moving in to be the first to provide affordable global access to the 3 billion potential internet users that have so far been left behind due to cost and access issues.Capturing the second half of the world's internet users can be rewarding for those that succeed, hence most of the big players are involved.In this article, I will focus on the plans to start a global satellite world wide web, that will be accessible to all, and at an affordable price.It should not be forgotten that many have tried and failed before.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Teledesic , was a failed project funded in part by Microsoft that ended up costing <i>more</i> than $ 9 billion .  (Surprise) </span>Teledesic's idea was to create a broadband satellite constellation of hundreds of low-orbiting satellites, providing inexpensive internet access with download speeds of up to 720 Mbit/s.The project was abandoned in 2003.In September 2003, Eutelsat launched the first internet-ready satellite for consumers.By 2011 ViaSat's launched the ViaSat-1 satellite, and in 2012 the HughesNet's Jupiter was launched.ViaSat , through its Exede brand, and EchoStar , through subsidiary HughesNet still operate today.Qualcomm (QCOMM) also launched Globalstar .The current satellite services are typically very expensive and have a limited throughput of data.Global satellite provided internet access would unlock the final potential 3 billion plus internet users in developing countries and remote areas.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>By launching satellites into <i>lower</i> space companies plan to meet this huge need .  (Surprise) </span>Currently there are around 3.4b internet users globally, out of 7.4b people on the planet.That represents around 46% of the planet is online.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Or viewed another way 56 % , or <i>more</i> than half are not yet connected .  (Surprise) </span>Excluding the very young and the very old (say 1m), there is a market to add around 3b internet users globally.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>1 ) Facebook ( FB ) - Price = USD 118.47 Facebook started about two and a half years ago when founder Mark Zuckerberg set-up Internet.org , which was to complement the original mission of Facebook to make the world <i>more</i> open and connected .  (Surprise) </span>Facebook made Africa the front stage for this mission, and has commenced using Spacecom satellites to provide internet to 11 countries in Africa, initially via an Express Wifi service where a local entrepreneur provides Wi-Fi access to the local town or village.Facebook are already live in India and Indonesia with Express Wi-Fi, and are looking to expand further into rural Asian areas of the Philippines and Myanmar.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Arguably satellite internet <b>may</b> allow Facebook to access rural China one day .  (Uncertainty) </span>Even if that does not occur, the table below shows the huge potential in emerging countries such as India to increase internet access.Facebook currently has a market cap of USD 339b, a PE of 73, or 2016 (NYSE: E ) PE of 33, and a PEG ratio of 1.05.Start-up internet satellite constellation operator OneWeb LLC, based in Britain's Channel Islands, already has $500 million in funding from big players that include satellite fleet operator Intelsat (NYSE: I ), Bharti Enterprises, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) and Hughes Network Systems.It was founded by Greg Wyler.Their board of directors include Sir Richard Branson.Their goal is to boost internet access to the 56 percent (or 4 billion) of the world's population who still do not have reliable access to the World Wide Web.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>OneWeb plans to launch 648 satellites to encircle the Earth from a <i>lower</i> orbit similar to the Musk plan .  (Surprise) </span>Then small, low-cost user terminals (that communicate to the satellites in the sky), will emit LTE, 3G and WiFi to the surrounding areas, providing high-speed internet access for everyone at an affordable price.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>You can read <i>more</i> about them at their website here .  (Surprise) </span>In April 2016, OneWeb Satellites announced a 50-50 joint venture between OneWeb LLC and Airbus, to build a factory just outside the gates of NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida to build its 900 satellite constellation.That will ultimately see the company churning them out at 15 satellites a week, following a co-funding agreement with the state of Florida.Their satellites will be launched into space by Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>OneWeb <b>hopes</b> to start manufacturing in 2017 , with the first 10-satellite launch scheduled for late 2017 or early 2018 .  (Uncertainty) </span>The full constellation is expected to be in orbit by the end of 2019.Investors cannot yet invest in OneWeb as it is still a private company.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But they <b>could</b> consider to invest in their early financial partners mentioned above , who would own shares in the company .  (Uncertainty) </span>Inelsat SA is a satellite services company.It has a current price of USD 3.53, a market cap of 416m, no PE.The company has recently had to restructure a lot of debt.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Looks <b>risky</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Qualcomm manufactures digital wireless communications equipment, including the snapdragon modems used in Apple smartphones, and many internet of things (IoTs) devices.Its stock price suffered recently due to a slowdown in smartphone sales and in particular Apple's smartphone sales, as Apple represented 45% of Qualcomm's revenue in 2015.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Qualcomm <b>could</b> benefit as a early share holder and also by selling modems to future OneWeb customers .  (Uncertainty) </span>It has a current market cap of 80.7b, a PEG ratio of 1.45, and a 2016 PE of 15.68.Analyst consensus target is USD 60, with a buy recommendation.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>You can read <i>more</i> here .

(Uncertainty) </span>Alphabet Google's main businesses are Google search, Google adwords, Youtube, Google maps, and android.Other businesses include Calico, Nest (Private: CLOUD ), and Google Fiber, as well as its investing arms such as Google Ventures and Google Capital, and incubator projects such as Google X. Alphabet Google has a market cap of USD 500b, and a PE of 30.25.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>2016 PE is <i>better</i> at just 22 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The existing satellite providers - ViaSat ( NASDAQ : VSAT ) , EchoStar ( NASDAQ : SATS ) , and GlobalStar ( NYSEMKT : GSAT ) are really niche providers servicing those that can afford <i>higher</i> rates , or for military , aircraft , marine and remote mining operations .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It has been said that the current mobile phone conglomerates <b>could</b> provide global internet coverage using existing satellite capacity .  (Uncertainty) </span>Obviously they cannot do it economically otherwise they would have done it by now.SpaceX in particular has drastically cut the costs of launching satellites into space, and one would expect Virgin to follow this lead.The cable providers - All the cable internet companies are competitors.However the cable companies have not yet successfully rolled out cable to reach remote areas or the least developed countries as it is not economically viable for them to do so.Industry players are positioning themselves to capture a potential 3 billion new internet user market using satellite internet - the rewards can be huge.In fact Facebook is already doing it in Africa and Asia.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Currently internet users are growing by around 200 million pa ( see table <i>earlier</i> in the article ) .  (Surprise) </span>However, if affordable global satellite internet becomes available, that rate is set to increase dramatically.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We <b>could</b> see the internet grow even <i>more</i> rapidly from the current 3.4 billion users now , to around 5 or 6 billion users as soon as the end of the decade or shortly thereafter .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>That will create a very strong tailwind for the major internet players such as the smart phone companies ( Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) , Samsung ( OTC : SSNLF ) Lenovo ( OTCPK : LNVGY ) ) , search engines companies ( Google , Baidu ( NASDAQ : BIDU ) ) , online retailers ( <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , Alibaba ( NYSE : BABA ) , and the social media companies ( Facebook , Twitter ( NYSE : TWTR ) ) . The three best funded and most likely future providers of affordable satellite internet are Facebook, OneWeb, and Google/SpaceX.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>At this time Facebook and OneWeb <b>appear</b> to be <i>more</i> advanced and likely to succeed .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Investors cannot buy directly into SpaceX, Virgin Galactic or OneWeb as they are private companies, however investors can buy into Facebook, Google, Qulacomm, Airbus, or Inelsat.My top 3 would be Facebook, Google, and Qualcomm.Facebook is already using satellite internet to access new users in Africa and Asia.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Google <b>seems</b> well placed to benefit given their early mover investments .
