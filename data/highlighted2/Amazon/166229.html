So we are making progress, but it’s a journey.Like most important thing is for me to stand up in front of you and say, we are much a communications company as a computing company as we get in to the IoT, Internet of Things, $50 billion devices by 2020, wearable technology, and we have some significant relationships with wearable right with Fossil, who does Michael Kors and Diesel with Oakley, with Tech Joy.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Christopher Danely - Citigroup Global Markets Kirk as a follow-up to that , <b>may</b> be just talk about the Altera acquisition , biggest acquisition in the company 's history .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Does this signal a shift to a little <i>more</i> focus on PLD and datacenter versus mobility as far as growth opportunities and where we would finally rank in there <b>may</b> be talk a little bit about that .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I think it’s a great acquisition for both datacenter as well as Internet of Things, right.There’s things like autonomous driving, they need purpose built acceleration, that’s what Altera can be great at.As I mentioned in the Cloud, as we are on a journey to continue to grow the datacenter business on a 15% compound annual growth rate, we need purpose build accelerators for those Cloud customers that have very purpose build workloads that want something customized.So those were the two primary rationale behind that as to continue those businesses growing at kind of 15% compound annual growth rates.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If I can stay flat , generally flat in the PC space , my job as the GM of the PC business is to do <i>better</i> than that and try to grow it low to mid-single digits unless the innovation is going to enable us to that .  (Surprise) </span>Christopher Danely - Citigroup Global Markets By the way after what happened this year in PCs has your long term growth forecast for PCs changed, have your thoughts changed on the long term growth of the PC market.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Are you taking a step back on man may be this thing is n't , it ca n't be flat going poor or do you think it 's just a bit of an <b>anomaly</b> this year .  (Uncertainty) </span>Well I think the focus for PC is Macro will be come back.We are back to a yearly cadence on Tower desktop, just remember that, because it’s a $10 billion business, people forget about it, it’s not a sexy business, there’s towers but you’re on a yearly cadence versus the twice yearly cadence.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I certainly <b>believe</b> that 's part of the slowdown .  (Uncertainty) </span>There are new, we just showed you that 2-in-1s are in 8 to 12 months pull-in on the traditional Notebook buyer, and then there’s some new markets for going in to Compute Sticks.We weren’t even in Compute Sticks a year ago.That has the ability to go everywhere.Things like we announced Unite at Computech.Unite is basically putting a PC in a conference room and you can connect anywhere you are connected to VPN in to the Unite box and display wirelessly in the conference room.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So you <b>could</b> be sitting here right now , get a six digit pin and if there was a Unite box in your conference room , you can dial in to there .  (Uncertainty) </span>That’s total market expansion because there aren’t PCs in conference rooms today.Christopher Danely - Citigroup Global Markets You talked a little bit about how within in Notebooks, if we add in 2-in-1s actually the volumes are growing.But as we look at the rollout of your new Core M product line and we think about 2-in-1s expanding their share within that Notebook space, what will that mean for your ASPs and ultimately for your revenues.Without going in to a ton of detail, there are two things we are doing on pricing for 2-in-1s.For certain screen sizes we compete and we give competitive discounting to go compete with premium tablets.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So traditionally in the <i>smaller</i> size detachables that are kind of a tablet first usage model where the screen detaches , we 'll give aggressive pricing .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But if we win business over for example an iPad where we do n't have any silicon , that 's all positive revenue to Intel because we did n't have that if it 's a conversion from an iPad over in a <i>larger</i> screen size , which is like a 13-15 inch conversion over our pricing is the same as it is on Core .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So it 's just a trade-off the OEMs are making , do they want a <i>thinner</i> fanless system versus a <i>thicker</i> fan system , but we do n't have a difference in pricing there .  (Surprise) </span>So it will be the same --.So as I showed you on the graph 56% of the people that buy a product like this, so this is tablet first, so its every bit of a PC.It has got a hard keyboard, I would contend some of you out there are using Microsoft Surface user, similar kind of devices but it is tablet first, right.So it will wireless connectivity, its touch, its twice in performance of those premium tablets.So people are buying this and placing the tablet because they don’t have to carry two devices.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And that 's what our data says is that <i>more</i> than half of the people would have walked out of the store with a premium tablet had they not bought a classic device like this .  (Surprise) </span>And so since we don’t have any silicon in a product like an iPad, when that buyer choses this class of device versus that, it’s obviously a positive revenue and units for us.Christopher Danely - Citigroup Global Markets Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an important resource for bloggers and journalists, and are excited to contribute to the democratization of financial information on the Internet.(Until now investors have had to pay thousands of dollars in subscription fees for transcripts.)<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So our reproduction policy is as follows : You <b>may</b> quote up to 400 words of any transcript on the condition that you attribute the transcript to Seeking Alpha and either link to the original transcript or to www.SeekingAlpha.com .
