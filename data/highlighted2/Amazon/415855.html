(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When the market gives an <b>unexpected</b> rally , it 's best to go with it .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The most hated sectors - oil , financials and technology have <b>suddenly</b> become leaders .  (Uncertainty) </span>The investor intelligence poll indicated that 35.4% of participants we-re bullish, 24% were bearish and the rest were calling for a correction.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>`` The idea that there could be this many bears just <b>seems</b> plain wrong .  (Uncertainty) </span>I think many people are caught on the wrong end of the seesaw here, and they are about to be sent flying by the bull," said Cramer.There are many soft sectors in the economy but there are positive indicators too, such as housing and job growth.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The banks are going <i>higher</i> as they are poised to rally in an interest rate hike environment .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The rate hike <b>could</b> come in June and banks will make <i>more</i> money on their deposits .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>"The banks are unbelievably cheap and unbelievably hated.The group is viewed as despicable by most managers.That is what you reach for when everyone is so bearish," said Cramer.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>He likes JPMorgan ( NYSE : JPM ) which will make money on <i>higher</i> rates , and Citigroup ( NYSE : C ) which is trading well below its tangible book value .  (Surprise) </span>Cramer thinks Citigroup can head to $60 and hence is buying for his trust.Oil is hovering near $50 and will trade sideways in Cramer's opinion.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Crude inventories came in <i>lower</i> on Wednesday and that is not because of the Canadian wildfires , in Cramer 's opinion .  (Surprise) </span>Another catalyst for oil is natural gas which has had a huge inventory for some time.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>warmer</i> weather means the air-conditioning season will start for most of the country .  (Surprise) </span>Cramer thinks the traders will close their short positions.Finally, the tech sector is rallying too.Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE ) and Computer Sciences Corporation (NYSE: CSC ) rallied on the news that HPE is spinning off its IT services business to be merged with the latter.Computer Sciences rallied 42% on the news.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>`` I love the deal , but what I really like is that investors are so turned on by a new combination and by the <i>better</i> earnings that HP Enterprise reported this morning .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This merger makes me think IBM 's ( NYSE : IBM ) stock <b>might</b> be too cheap , '' said Cramer .  (Uncertainty) </span>Even Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) rallied and Cramer thinks it's cheap.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has managed to take a lot of market share and hurt retailers this year . However, Tractor Supply, which is the farm and garden store that carries animal feed, lawnmowers, outdoor clothing and tools, has been doing well.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It has 1,500 locations in 49 states and their stock is up <i>more</i> than 11 % for the year while the rest of retail is down .  (Surprise) </span>"I think a major part of Tractor Supply's strength is that this company occupies a pretty unique niche in retail, one that doesn't have much in the way of competition," said Cramer.They are the largest rural lifestyle stores in the country and pride themselves on that title.Lots of the stuff they ship is heavy and can not be found on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . They also avoid competition from Lowe's (NYSE: LOW ) and Home Depot (NYSE: HD ) by targeting the rural market.The company also has a community feel which their customers love.They are also making good moves by getting into private label goods and taking advantage of the pet and sustainability themes.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They have set up a new inventory system to manage costs <i>better</i> .  (Surprise) </span>The company's last quarter was good with 10.5% revenue growth and an earnings beat.They trade at 23 times earnings but Cramer feels they deserve the premium considering their growth and the niche they serve.It's worthy of a buy on the next pullback.Netflix was up 134% last year, but has fallen 12% in the current year while some other tech stocks have led to a rally.This is not new for Netflix as such stories have been seen before.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>`` After months of underperformance , Netflix has been bouncing back over the last week , and I think it 's got <i>more</i> room to run , '' said Cramer .  (Surprise) </span>Historically, Netflix tends to pull back hard after a huge run.This is evident from similar moves in 2011 and 2014.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Investors have sold the stock on the belief that Netflix does n't care for profitability and its potential is <b>unclear</b> in the short term .  (Uncertainty) </span>The same thing happened last year but investors did not seem to care as the company was generating huge subscriber growth."Subscriber growth is the key metric for Netflix," said Cramer.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The spending <b>seems</b> justified when the company is generating subscriber growth .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>After good growth in 2014 and 2015 , they reported a quarter with 14.4 % subscriber growth and <i>higher</i> content costs .  (Surprise) </span>This led to the stock going down.In Cramer's opinion, Netflix has potential to expand overseas.They have 81.5M subscribers and they can make a lot of money if they raise their price even a little.The grace period for old users who are at the rate of $7.99 is about to expire, which means that the company can make an additional $900M in revenue from the domestic side.The company is making investments in content and generating strong programming.They have signed an exclusive deal with Disney (NYSE: DIS ) which will give them exclusive rights to offer movies from Disney, Marvel, LucasFilm and Pixar.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>`` This is huge , and while Netflix <b>may</b> be paying Disney $ 300 million a year for these rights , I think they will be worth every penny , '' said Cramer .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix is trading at 50 times 2018 earnings estimates but this is the cheapest it has been in five years.This makes the stock worth buying considering their growth opportunity.CEO interview - PVH Corp. (NYSE: PVH ) PVH Corp. is another retailer who did well when it comes to earnings at a time when others are struggling.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They reported a $ 0.06 earnings beat with <i>higher</i> than expected revenue and strength from Europe and China .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Their stock is up 20 % for the year , and Cramer interviewed Chairman and CEO Manny Chirico to hear <i>more</i> about what lies ahead .  (Surprise) </span>Chirico mentioned that their international business represents 50% of their business and 60% of the profits, which means that they are not hostage to the decline of mall-based retailers.Their omni-channel business is doing great."Some of our fastest growing businesses are our dotcom businesses, our Macy's dotcom business is on fire.So, it is critical given our brands, the nature of those brands, and how they resonate with our consumer.We need to be where the consumer shops and that's what we do," he added.In the omni-channel business , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is one of their biggest customers as they excel at providing basics like ties and underwear . These sell very well online, particular Calvin Klein which is the number one underwear brand.Chirico said that retailers are reacting to the evolving needs of customers.Having the right number of stores is the correct thing to do even if it is the unpopular choice.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Cramer thinks there is <i>more</i> upside to the stock .  (Surprise) </span>Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE: DKS ): The closure of Sports Authority led to rally in Dick's Sporting stock.Toyota Motors (NYSE: TM ): Cramer is not a fan of the motor cars and the Yen is affecting the Japanese motor companies.Viacom (NASDAQ: VIA ): Cramer will be a buyer of stock.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Jim Cramer 's Action Alerts PLUS : Check out Cramer 's multi-million dollar charitable trust portfolio and uncover the stocks he thinks <b>could</b> be HUGE winners .
