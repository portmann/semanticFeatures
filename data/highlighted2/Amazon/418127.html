misunderstood by the media and investors While it may appear Buffett has backed away from his consistent history of not investing in tech companies there is more to the story If youre a follower of Buffett dont take this as a reason to start changing course and playing in the tech space as Buffetts investment fundamentals have not changed A lot has been made from Berkshire Hathaways NYSE BRKA NYSE BRKB investments in IBM NYSE IBM and Apple NASDAQ AAPL Some people question if Warren Buffett the man who is notorious for avoiding tech companies has made a significant shift with these investments First of all it is most widely known that Berkshire Hathaways stake in Apple had little to nothing to do with Warren Buffett at all Nevertheless I am going to try and explain why investing in Apple and IBM signals no change in Buffetts investment philosophy and why it shouldnt open the floodgates for Buffett fans to start playing in the tech arena Apple has moved away from its technology identity in several different ways including their future growth innovation and of course valuation Yes in the broader sense Apple is still a technology company not looking to cause a debate among the people who this matters to However in comparison to its counterparts its identity has made one of the bigger shifts Investors have finally seen Apples growth stall in With the slowdown on the topline comes the typical crowd of investors yelling for the next revolutionary iPod type of product to boost sales again like its so easy But the fact is Apple is trading at a price due to its image being aligned as a consumer electronics company And that is one of the reasons why Berkshire Hathaway would like it If you look at Apple it shows all the signs of a stock that Warren Buffett would own cheap valuation strong cash flow strong dividend and share buybacks At a PE of Apple is trading below the consumer electronics industry average which is cheap given that the company has a history of maintaining a strong operating margin at around And Buffett loves strong cash flow because it is synonymous with a bigger and stronger dividend Currently Apple has a payout ratio of which seems a little low but it actually helps keep Apples face in the technology arena Reserving that cash is likely a better move for Apple than paying out a larger dividend which it can easily do For a company like Apple the bulk of its profits are better kept on hand and allocated to buybacks acquisitions RD etc rather than raising its payout ratio and distributing back to shareholders And even with a payout ratio of only investors are getting a dividend yield of not too bad IBM mirrors Apple in many ways cheap PE multiple strong cash flow margin solid dividend Sure its also facing issues across its topline but companies like Apple and IBM have great margins and high ROA So Wall Street doesnt see them as a tech company anymore big deal They produce enough cash flow to sustain their dividend with a payout ratio of Whats more the company has a longstanding history dating back over years Buffett likes his time tested companies IBM is an obvious Buffett play not because it is a tech company but because it is a high producing cash flow company at a PE of The chart below shows the steady increases in dividend by IBM and Apple as well as the low price to free cash flow ratios Look at Wells Fargo NYSE WFC for example Buffett loves Wells Fargo but why Its because its operations are worth multiples more than many of its competitors Now the difference with Wells Fargo is that it doesnt appear investors are getting a steep discount It trades at a very high price to tangible book value of Compare that to Bank of America NYSE BAC which trades at a ratio of only and Wells Fargo looks like its trading at a premium but its not Wells Fargo has a leading ROA of which is significantly higher than Bank of America Combine that with the fact that Wells Fargo has seen positive revenue growth over the last years compared to Bank of Americas negative growth and of course its going to trade at a price to tangible book ratio of more than double Bank of Americas Below you can see the comparison between Wells Fargo and Bank of Americas ROA and price to tangible book values So what does Wells Fargo have in common with Apple and IBM Same things youd expect from a Buffett company stable dividend high value operations strong cash flow and a timetested brand Warren Buffetts investments into technology isnt like investing in technology It is in my opinion a significantly lowrisk move compared to other opportunities in the tech space Rather than comparing it to the likes of Alphabet NASDAQ GOOGL NASDAQ GOOG or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN I think of it more like HP NYSE HPQ To me this shows no sign of strategy change or a shift towards the tech space I believe Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway still maintain the same fundamental investment principles as always and investments in Apple and IBM demonstrate that Too much has been made out of this by the financial media If youre a Warren Buffett follower then dont go jumping straight into the tech space Continue to seek out fair prices for great companies across all sectors For now Berkshire Hathaway hasnt made any new drastic moves When Buffett decides to invest in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>at a tripledigit PE ratio then wake me up Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
