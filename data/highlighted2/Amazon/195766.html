soon be answered Might the Bears start to cover some of their shorts when the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>site launches sell the rumor and buy the fact What if the <span

article titled <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is launching an Etsy killer After the article Etsys listings flatlined for about a month See chart below Etsys lull in listing growth lasted about a month as the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>site failed to launch Listing growth at Etsy has turned higher Listings have increased for three consecutive months as the holiday season approaches The chart below shows the increase in listings per month The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>seller forum has a thread that suggests

#A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will have a successful launch and Etsys vendors will flee This is given a low probability as over million buyers have found and purchased an item on the Etsy platform Buyers are not expected to migrate to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>site for the purchase of handmade items as the site is better known for general retail items rather than unique and custommade items Etsy faces challenges growing the site while maintaining its handmade roots Some Etsy forum threads have contained concerns over mass produced and counterfeit items This is expected
