( NASDAQ : AAOI ) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure : I am/we are long AAOI .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .  (Surprise) </span>I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.They have a unique manufacturing process within the optics industry.Applied Optoelectronics (NASDAQ: AAOI ) is a compelling investment because of their sustained revenue growth for the last five years.They are a top datacenter component provider and the strong dollar is a tailwind for their manufacturing costs in Taiwan and China.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>From what I can pull , their 10-k indicates they have customer concentration concerns or benefits , which is <b>depending</b> on your perspective .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To start , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) accounts for <i>greater</i> than 50 % of AAOI 's revenues and is their prime datacenter customer . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> being such a large customer is a positive because their web services division has grown revenues at a 78 % annualized rate and shows no signs of slowing datacenter spending . Also , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is experienced in burning cash to gain market share in any segment , whether they are trying to corner the toilet paper market or the cloud services segment . Heck , Jeff Bezos must have money bonfires because his AWS is funding all the other money , losing activities and pushing <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stock to heights never before seen . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> creates a scenario for AAOI to remain well positioned to capitalize on the continued datacenter spending because there is a worldwide shortage of 40g components and this leads me to why <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> selected AAOI as a supplier . They produce 40g, 100g optical transceivers which are manufactured using a proprietary process called Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE).This process is similar to 3D printing because it uses concentrated particles focused at a single point to create their optical components.This MBE process gives them a distinct advantage over their main competitors (Oclaro (NASDAQ: OCLR ), NeoPhotonics (NYSE: NPTN ) andFinisar (NASDAQ: FNSR )) because it is proprietary.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The operational advantages to this process are <i>longer</i> product life , <i>better</i> efficiency and <i>lower</i> operating temperatures .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Considering that cooling datacenters is a significant operating cost to the likes of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , a transceiver that radiates <i>less</i> heat creates significant cost savings . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This process also allowed their datacenter customer <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to certify their 100g product six months <i>quicker</i> than Oclaro did with their 100g cfp2 product . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With the transition to 100g products in the datacenter , this certification will allow them to deliver volume much <i>quicker</i> than competitors .  (Surprise) </span>Cisco is a cable TV customer and only represents 10% of their revenue, but this is important because they continue to deploy capital domestically to build the DOCSIS 3.1 network.US-based telecommunications providers are reluctant to deliver all fiber networks, so the best alternative is hybrid fiber cable networks.The cable TV market continues to accelerate to meet the data requirements of streaming content and 4K picture resolution.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It will become a <i>larger</i> percentage of overall revenue and reduce AAOI 's reliance on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to build datacenters . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The strong dollar helps their operating expenses AAOI has manufacturing facilities located in Ningbo, China, and Taipei, Taiwan.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The strong dollar helps AAOI produce their components for <i>less</i> because the currencies they pay manufacturing expenses in have depreciated significantly .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The Chinese renminbi and new Taiwan dollar account for <b>roughly</b> 50 % of their operating expenses , and depreciation of these currencies improves AAOI 's gross margins .  (Uncertainty) </span>With both currencies down 6-7% YOY, I see a slight improvement in their margins.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The other factor is that AAOI does n't hedge their foreign currency <b>exposure</b> , and in a rising rate environment I only see this improving AAOI 's margins further .  (Uncertainty) </span>They completed the construction of their flagship facility AAOI recently became vertically integrated by completing the construction of their manufacturing facility based out of Sugar Land, Texas.Supposedly, this facility is state of the art and this is significant because AAOI struggled in 2015 to meet customer demand for the 40gbs optical transceivers (a major revenue driver).This caused revenue a shortfall in Q1 and Q2 with a book to bill ratio close to two, but then caused a back loaded year with revenue beat in Q3.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So with their facility operational , I expect AAOI to meet their customers growing demand for 40g and 100g products and <i>smoother</i> revenue growth .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As noted <i>earlier</i> , AAOI is at the will of their customers , implying that if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> or another customer decides to cut spending AAOI will suffer erratic sales . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>This example can be seen in the case of Alliance Fiber Optic Products (NASDAQ: AFOP ), where their top datacenter customer Google cut spending and caused their revenue to decline from $25 million to $18 million.AAOI is a micro-cap stock that at times experiences a lack of liquidity in the shares traded.It is not uncommon to see a 20 cent bid-ask spread in the quotes and the stock to move two or three times compared to the broad market.Profitability is a new thing for AAOI - before they went public, they historically experienced losses.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Another component to the recent move down in AAOI shares is since 2015 investors have been experiencing long-term capital gains , and if you believe the mantra `` sell the winners '' the stock price <b>could</b> decline as low as $ 8 before investors do n't have any gains to realize .  (Uncertainty) </span>In conclusion, I find AAOI to be extremely undervalued at these levels.This company is selling 40g components like hotcakes and the growth will continue as they transition to their 100g products.The operational efficiencies of their production process and their currency tailwinds sets up 2016 for a boom year.From a closing price of $12.36 on 01/20/2016, my $21 price target indicates a potential return of 70%.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Technology</div></body></html>
