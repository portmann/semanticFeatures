This example can be seen in the case of Alliance Fiber Optic Products (NASDAQ: AFOP ), where their top datacenter customer Google cut spending and caused their revenue to decline from $25 million to $18 million.AAOI is a micro-cap stock that at times experiences a lack of liquidity in the shares traded.It is not uncommon to see a 20 cent bid-ask spread in the quotes and the stock to move two or three times compared to the broad market.Profitability is a new thing for AAOI - before they went public, they historically experienced losses.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Another component to the recent move down in AAOI shares is since 2015 investors have been experiencing long-term capital gains , and if you believe the mantra `` sell the winners '' the stock price <b>could</b> decline as low as $ 8 before investors do n't have any gains to realize .  (Uncertainty) </span>In conclusion, I find AAOI to be extremely undervalued at these levels.This company is selling 40g components like hotcakes and the growth will continue as they transition to their 100g products.The operational efficiencies of their production process and their currency tailwinds sets up 2016 for a boom year.From a closing price of $12.36 on 01/20/2016, my $21 price target indicates a potential return of 70%.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Technology</div></body></html>
