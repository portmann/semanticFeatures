opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article They have a unique manufacturing process within the optics industry Applied Optoelectronics NASDAQ AAOI is a compelling investment because of their sustained revenue growth for the last five years They are a top datacenter component provider and the strong dollar is a tailwind for their manufacturing costs in Taiwan and China From what I can pull their k indicates they have customer concentration concerns or benefits which is depending on your perspective To start <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN accounts for greater than of AAOIs revenues and is their prime datacenter customer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>being such a large customer is a positive because their web services division has grown revenues at a annualized rate and shows no signs of slowing datacenter spending Also <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is experienced in burning cash to gain market share in any segment whether they are trying to corner the toilet paper market or the cloud services segment Heck Jeff Bezos must have money bonfires because his AWS is funding all the other money losing activities and pushing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>stock to heights never before seen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>creates a scenario for AAOI to remain well positioned to capitalize on the continued datacenter spending because there is a worldwide shortage of g components and this leads me to why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>selected AAOI as a supplier They produce g g optical transceivers which are manufactured using a proprietary process called Molecular Beam Epitaxy MBE This process is similar to D printing because it uses concentrated particles focused at a single point to create their optical components This MBE process gives them a distinct advantage over their main competitors Oclaro NASDAQ OCLR NeoPhotonics NYSE NPTN andFinisar NASDAQ FNSR because it is proprietary The operational advantages to this process are longer product life better efficiency and lower operating temperatures Considering that cooling datacenters is a significant operating cost to the likes of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>a transceiver that radiates less heat creates significant cost savings This process also allowed their datacenter customer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to certify their g product six months quicker than Oclaro did with their g cfp product With the transition to g products in the datacenter this certification will allow them to deliver volume much quicker than competitors Cisco is a cable TV customer and only represents of their revenue but this is important because they continue to deploy capital domestically to build the DOCSIS network USbased telecommunications providers are reluctant to deliver all fiber networks so the best alternative is hybrid fiber cable networks The cable TV market continues to accelerate to meet the data requirements of streaming content and K picture resolution It will become a larger percentage of overall revenue and reduce AAOIs reliance on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to build datacenters The strong dollar helps their operating expenses AAOI has manufacturing facilities located in Ningbo China and Taipei Taiwan The strong dollar helps AAOI produce their components for less because the currencies they pay manufacturing expenses in have depreciated significantly The Chinese renminbi and new Taiwan dollar account for roughly of their operating expenses and depreciation of these currencies improves AAOIs gross margins With both currencies down YOY I see a slight improvement in their margins The other factor is that AAOI doesnt hedge their foreign currency exposure and in a rising rate environment I only see this improving AAOIs margins further They completed the construction of their flagship facility AAOI recently became vertically integrated by completing the construction of their manufacturing facility based out of Sugar Land Texas Supposedly this facility is state of the art and this is significant because AAOI struggled in to meet customer demand for the gbs optical transceivers a major revenue driver This caused revenue a shortfall in Q and Q with a book to bill ratio close to two but then caused a back loaded year with revenue beat in Q So with their facility operational I expect AAOI to meet their customers growing demand for g and g products and smoother revenue growth As noted earlier AAOI is at the will of their customers implying that if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>or another customer decides to cut spending AAOI will suffer erratic sales This example can be seen in the case of Alliance Fiber Optic Products NASDAQ AFOP where their top datacenter customer Google cut spending and caused their revenue to decline from million to million AAOI is a microcap stock that at times experiences a lack of liquidity in the shares traded It is not uncommon to see a cent bidask spread in the quotes and the stock to move two or three times compared to the broad market Profitability is a new thing for AAOI before they went public they historically experienced losses Another component to the recent move down in AAOI shares is since investors have been experiencing longterm capital gains and if you believe the mantra sell the winners the stock price could decline as low as before investors dont have any gains to realize In conclusion I find AAOI to be extremely undervalued at these levels This company is selling g components like hotcakes and the growth will continue as they transition to their g products The operational efficiencies of their production process and their currency tailwinds sets up for a boom year From a closing price of on my price target indicates a potential return of Tagged Investing Ideas Technology
