class='textDiv'>Etsy To Be Avoided At All Costs Etsy Inc NASDAQETSY Seeking Alpha Etsys ship has sailed It is no longer the leader in what it does and will soon be crushed by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Etsy is adding to its own troubles by overspending on advertising to try and drive business Etsy NASDAQ ETSY is a perfect example of a company that we think probably peaked before it even went public We dont mean this in the sense of sales growth revenue or amount of total items listed on its site We mean it from the perspective of where the companys model is going to sit in terms of being adopted by the public The Etsy fad may have already been past us by the time the company finally listed its shares publicly Usually when that happens you wind up with a postIPO stock price that looks like this On one hand we have to commend Etsy because it did rush quickly enough to IPO but on the other hand Etsy is very much like many IPOs we have seen before it We believe the company has hit Wall Street in a timely enough fashion for it to be shorted down to the levels where it should have went public at to begin with The markets price action on the company tells you exactly what you need to know The market is telling you that the companys initial public offering price was too high and the market is telling you that the companys business model is in jeopardy already The idea behind Etsy wasnt necessarily a bad one In this day and age where millennials are looking for all natural products organic glutenfree and farm fresh Etsy tried to take this concept and move it to arts and crafts This was a natural transition as many arts and crafts are already handmade and there are people out there we know them that just like to purchase small handmade items The thought process is that they are original they are oneofakind they cannot be duplicated and that you as the consumer are essentially treasure hunting But that has led to problems like this one Etsy Inc is facing fraud claims from investors after allegations that millions of items sold through its online crafts and specialty wares marketplace likely violate trademarks Investors filed a proposed class action against the Brooklyn NYbased company and its executives after an analyst said this week that more than percent of about million listings may be counterfeit or otherwise infringe wellknown brands Its not a bad idea which is why Etsy was able to file for an initial public offering in the first place The company had grown very well since being a startup and is looking now to reach a launching point where it can hopefully find its next stage of growth We commend the company for trying to do this but we do not believe that Etsy is going to be a success and we do not believe that Etsy as an investment is worthwhile All we have to do is think of examples of other companies that went public for the same reason Zynga NASDAQ ZNGA for instance went public at the height of the Farmville craze Investors did not seem to care that the company didnt have much else in the pipeline and once the intuitive Farmville didnt work out the company ran out of ideas the stock crashed and here is where we are today Etsy is also taking a page out of Angies List NASDAQ ANGI ANGI has been for the street hardly a success story It shares many characteristics with Angies List in the sense that the company is looking for a lot of its growth from advertising advertising expenses at Etsy have ramped up significantly Compare this to a company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN that does very little traditional advertising We believe that this shift to more advertising and marketing similar to the Wayfair NYSE W model shows that the company is having trouble driving organic growth Also <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the largest retailing force in the world is now competing directly with Etsy We would make the suggestion that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could potentially be a buyer of Etsy but we would have to wait for Etsy to fall lower or more for the multiples to make sense Even then were not convinced <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would buy them <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has started its own handmade section of its website to try and compete directly with Etsy and it has largely been a success <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is leveraging its massive already installed user base and enormous infrastructure to try and take a large share of Etsys market Etsys equity is priced at a large multiple to what the company is expecting to earn in the coming years The worst part about this is that we do not believe that Etsy stock deserves much of a multiple at all We think this is more of a show me story because we cannot believe that the companys business model is going to be safe moving forward So much of what has made the company a success to this point is that it was the leader and the only site doing what it did As other sites catch on namely <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>we believe that Etsy is in real risk of never getting off the ground Etsy sports a M enterprise value while doing M annually in sales The only decent metric it has right now is its EVsales of which would make it an attractive buyout candidate for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>We think AMZN wont even consider it unless Etsy gets much cheaper We think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has all of the leverage in this situation One positive is that Etsy doesnt have much debt just M to the M in cash it has and it is generating about million in cash per month period But the final word is that Etsy is a lightweight With too many questions about its model and poor fundamentals that were ignored in a forced IPO we think Etsy goes much lower before shareholders have anything to write home about The bankers and underwriters of the companys initial public offering will be long gone soon if they are not already and those
