<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN is gearing up for this years Prime Day with marketing efforts running at full throttle The event scheduled for July will see Prime members get a crack on deals on over items The company is promising a more engaging assortment this year after taking some criticism a year ago Last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>pulled in about M to M in revenue on Prime Day MKM Partnersestimates that mark could be doubled this year Analysis from JPMorgan suggests that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Day pulls forward some retail sales during a typically quiet period The shopping bonanza and boost to Prime stickiness could be a headwind for Target NYSE TGT WalMart NYSE WMT and Best Buy NYSE BBY This years event will also serve as a critical test for the Seattle ecommerce giant on the fulfillment front <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>carved out a new alltime high of on Friday Shares are now up over the last year which has led to no shortage of analysis and debate from Seeking Alpha contributors on the AMZN trade should be great improvement in the operation and offerings between year one and two i think the prediction of doubling will be low gonna predict over a billion this time many millions more prime members since last july and should be able to find things much easier this year man i hope so Honestly is there anything that can rival AMZN At this point and in into the foreseeable future they are unstoppable With the market place and AWS lots of growth to come I would love to buy more soon Their video and music offerings are very pedestrian like to the point where I dont bother accessing them That is about the only weakness I see for AMZN in the next five years The improved efficiency of robots in warehouses multiplied by AMZNs massive inventory huge savings in everyday operations They are a small company who learned to become big and still remembered how to refine themselves for further success <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been fairly aggressive in obtaining and creating video media with a lot of awardwinning original productions and the very recent deal with BBC for exclusive distribution as examples I dont watch many shows but have seen a couple of episodes of Transparent and The Man in the High Castle and at least those episodes were hardly pedestrian Apparently a lot of the other shows and original movies are generally considered to be worth watching Music does seem to be of less importance to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>than books or video but they do have some exclusive content there too If you look at what they have done with digital books and publishing I think you will see similar efforts in other media For instance they have a book contest each year that awards publishing contracts and they have reissued classics I could see them restoring and reissuing old films creating a music label etc Their video and music section is a pain to find the CD that you are looking for especially for classical music Most often I find the same CD at a substantial lower price at my brick and mortar store where I can check the physical condition of my purchase For the few times that I have ordered from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sometimes the CD case was damaged Its a pain to have to return them as sometimes it is the only copy that they have in stock Much better experience browsing at the record store and being able to talk to their knowledgeable staff and not to forget the health benefit of walking to it Prime day will be a bust but markets wont care <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could lose a Billion in one day stock still would bid higher Still holding my The most amusing thing is the numerous stories about WMT and BABA and name your favorite wannabe rolling out new programs and strategies to catch upovertake <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Anyone who believes that claptrap skipped class the day they taught the concept of that ship has sailed Question are in bed with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>stock holders This is a strange this to write about Why not do the same story on other retailers bc this is about amazon prime day and obviously it was started by amazon so this short piece is on amazon Walmart had better be careful They seem bent on starting a price war with AMZN Its a war that they will lose By AMZN will rule the world and jef bezos will the president of the USA He is absolutely iconic and fit for the job By then most shopping malls and brick and mortar stores will have gone BK helped by the crisis brewing at this point and just waiting to get out of its egg in the next few years and those spaces will be replaced by AMZN multiple warehouses Stock will trade around USD a share at current stock counts It seems outrageous but by then the PE ratio will be a mere as i said the company will have gobbled up ALL the global retail business Lots of book music and video stores have closed over the past twenty years or so but there is apparently still a need for them so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is filling that need by opening physical locations especially on near college campuses They are similar to the catalogue service centers that Sears used to have no inventory on site like a hybrid between BM and internet retail Katzung try it out buy a share and see where it goes Over the years since Ive taken some risks and some do well some dont But there always came a time to buy more at a better price Thats what is so nice about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Its been a great company for consumers and the stock has done extremely well for investors too Best of both worlds I am a Prime member and long AMZN I look at it like this if you dont like shopping on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>then dont shop on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>If you think AMZN stock is too expensive then dont buy AMZN stock ETF Screener Search and filter by asset class strategy theme performance yield and much more ETF Performance View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
