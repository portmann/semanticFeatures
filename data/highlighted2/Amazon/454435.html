( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Jul 9 2016 , 11:03 ET | By : Clark Schultz , SA News Editor <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) is gearing up for this year 's Prime Day with marketing efforts running at full throttle . The event scheduled for July 12 will see Prime members get a crack on deals on over 100,000 items.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company is promising a <i>more</i> engaging assortment this year after taking some criticism a year ago .  (Surprise) </span>Last year , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> pulled in about $ 375M to $ 400M in revenue on Prime Day . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>MKM Partners estimates that mark <b>could</b> be doubled this year .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Analysis from JPMorgan <b>suggests</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Day pulls forward some retail sales during a typically quiet period . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The shopping bonanza and boost to Prime stickiness <b>could</b> be a headwind for Target ( NYSE : TGT ) , Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) , and Best Buy ( NYSE : BBY ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>This year's event will also serve as a critical test for the Seattle e-commerce giant on the fulfillment front.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> carved out a new all-time high of $ 746.10 on Friday . Shares are now up 70% over the last year which has led to no shortage of analysis and debate ï¿½from Seeking Alpha contributors on the AMZN trade.should be great improvement in the operation and offerings between year one and two..<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>i think the prediction of doubling will be low , gon na <b>predict</b> over a billion this time .  (Uncertainty) </span>.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>many millions <i>more</i> prime members since last july and should be able to find things much <i>easier</i> this year ... .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>man i <b>hope</b> so .  (Uncertainty) </span>.Honestly, is there anything that can rival AMZN?At this point and in into the foreseeable future, they are unstoppable.With the market place and AWS, lots of growth to come.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I would love to buy <i>more</i> soon .  (Surprise) </span>Their video and music offerings are very pedestrian, like to the point where I don't bother accessing them.That is about the only weakness I see for AMZN in the next five years.The improved efficiency of robots in warehouses, multiplied by AMZN's massive inventory = huge savings in everyday operations.They are a small company who learned to become big and still remembered how to refine themselves for further success.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has been fairly aggressive in obtaining and creating video media , with a lot of award-winning original productions and the very recent deal with BBC for exclusive distribution , as examples . I don't watch many shows, but have seen a couple of episodes of Transparent and The Man in the High Castle and at least those episodes were hardly pedestrian.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Apparently</b> a lot of the other shows and original movies are generally considered to be worth watching .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Music does seem to be of <i>less</i> importance to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> than books or video , but they do have some exclusive content there , too . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you look at what they have done with digital books and publishing , I think you will see similar efforts in other media .  (Uncertainty) </span>For instance, they have a book contest each year that awards publishing contracts, and they have reissued classics.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>could</b> see them restoring and reissuing old films , creating a music label , etc. .  (Uncertainty) </span>Their video and music section is a pain to find the CD that you are looking for especially for classical music.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Most often , I find the same CD at a substantial <i>lower</i> price at my brick and mortar store where I can check the physical condition of my purchase .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For the few times that I have ordered from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , <b>sometimes</b> the CD case was damaged . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's a pain to have to return them as <b>sometimes</b> it is the only copy that they have in stock .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Much <i>better</i> experience browsing at the record store and being able to talk to their knowledgeable staff and not to forget the health benefit of walking to it .  (Surprise) </span>Prime day will be a bust, but markets won't care.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> lose a Billion in one day , stock still would bid <i>higher</i> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Still holding my 500 @ 142.The most amusing thing is the numerous stories about WMT , and BABA , and ( name your favorite wannabe ) rolling out new programs and strategies to catch up/overtake <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Anyone who <b>believes</b> that claptrap skipped class the day they taught the concept of `` that ship has sailed . ''  (Uncertainty) </span>Question , are in bed with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stock holders ? This is a strange this to write about.Why not do the same story on other retailers.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>bc this is about amazon prime day and obviously it was started by amazon so this short piece is on amazon Walmart had <i>better</i> be careful .  (Surprise) </span>They seem bent on starting a price war with AMZN.It's a war that they will lose.By 2025 , AMZN will rule the world and jef bezos will the president of the USA.He is absolutely iconic and fit for the job.By then most shopping malls and brick and mortar stores will have gone BK (helped by the 2008 crisis 2.0 brewing at this point and just waiting to get out of its egg in the next few years) and those spaces will be replaced by AMZN multiple warehouses.Stock will trade around 8.000/10.000 USD a share (at current stock counts).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>seems</b> outrageous but by then the P/E ratio will be a mere 10/15 as i said , the company will have gobbled up ALL the global retail business .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Lots of book , music , and video stores have closed over the past twenty years or so but there is <b>apparently</b> still a need for them , so <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is filling that need by opening physical locations , especially on near college campuses . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>They are similar to the catalogue service centers that Sears used to have, no inventory on site, like a hybrid between B&M and internet retail.Katzung- try it out- buy a share and see where it goes.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Over the years since 1980 - I 've taken some <b>risks</b> and some do well , some do n't .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But there always came a time to buy <i>more</i> at a <i>better</i> price .  (Surprise) </span>That 's what is so nice about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . It's been a great company for consumers and the stock has done extremely well for investors, too.Best of both worlds!I am a Prime member and long AMZN.I look at it like this , if you do n't like shopping on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , then do n't shop on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . If you think AMZN stock is "too expensive " then don't buy AMZN stock!<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>ETF Screener : Search and filter by asset class , strategy , theme , performance , yield , and much <i>more</i> ETF Performance : View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes  (Surprise) </span></div></body></html>
