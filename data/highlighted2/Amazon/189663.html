( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Oct 2 2015 , 09:26 ET | By : Clark Schultz , SA News Editor <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) will be the number two player in non-food consumables by 2018 , according to a new report from Cowen & Company . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The company is leveraging its powerful Prime platform to gain market share in the highly-competitive field by highlighting to consumers its advantages on pricing and delivery.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's gains <b>could</b> come at the expense of store traffic for Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) , Target ( NYSE : TGT ) , and Walgreens ( NASDAQ : WBA ) , notes Cowen . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Effect <b>could</b> also impact pricing in the personal care , household , pet , and baby products sectors - a wide swath of the consumer goods industry that impacts companies such as Procter & Gamble ( NYSE : PG ) , Avon Products ( NYSE : AVP ) , Revlon ( NYSE : REV ) , Kimberly-Clark ( NYSE : KMB ) , Carter 's ( NYSE : CRI ) , Colgate-Palmolive ( NYSE : CL ) , Ulta Salon ( NASDAQ : ULTA ) , Unilever ( UN , UL ) , and Church & Dwight ( NYSE : CHD ) as they negotiate deals . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Ulta , imo , has a growing moat which is why they are in the process of putting up 100 <i>more</i> salons .  (Surprise) </span>One thing I like about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is the accuracy of pricing . You pay the posted price always.Walmart is a crap shoot.Literally 1 out of 10 items are mispriced to Walmarts coffer enhancement.I am certain this is no accident.The computer system at Walmart which sets pricing has never been coordinated with their rapid price changes daily.The fact that this has gone on for decades with Obama's laughable Consumer Protection Agency or DOJ going after them remains a mystery.A friend and VP at Walmart admitted blithely the income to Walmart is in the low billions, the lack of coordination between computer pricing and advertised prices was actually an invention of Old Man Sam himself, and the losses to consumers over all these years has been staggering.There oughta be a law!Oh never mind there already are, but no one enforces them against this giant.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Fact is , with so many new distribution centers that have opened up over the past years , you can get most stuff in 3 days <b>depending</b> on your geographical location .
