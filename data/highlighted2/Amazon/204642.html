( NASDAQ : FOX ) | Seeking Alpha Ben Strubel , Strubel Investment Management ( 135 clicks ) Aug. 23 , 2015 9:36 PM ET | About : Twenty-First Century Fox , Inc. ( FOX ) , FOXA , Includes : CMCSA , DIS , NFLX by : Ben Strubel Hulu is growing <i>faster</i> than Netflix at a similar point in it 's life cycle .  (Surprise) </span>Hulu's dual revenue model offers superior profitability.One of the most undervalued assets in the media universe today is Hulu.Hulu is a digital streaming service that competes with Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Streaming . Hulu allows members to access some content for free and with a $7.99 per month membership gives them access to the service's entire library.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Hulu is joint venture between Twenty-First Century Fox ( NASDAQ : FOX ) ( NASDAQ : FOXA ) , Comcast ( NASDAQ : CMCSA ) ( NASDAQ : CMCSK ) 's NBCUniversal division , and Disney ( NYSE : DIS ) , all of whom own <b>approximately</b> one third of the company .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix sports a market cap of <b>almost</b> $ 53B as of the time of this writing , yet despite being very similar to Netflix , Hulu seemed to get no love from investors until recently .  (Uncertainty) </span>Business Insider published an article in 2012 proclaiming Hulu a failure and The Wrap said Hulu has an identity crisist Hulu in a 2013 article .<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Only recently has media commentary on Hulu started to turn positive but it still leaves investors <b>wondering</b> what the ultimate value of Hulu <b>might</b> be .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The financial statements for the three owners don't give investors any clues.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Disney does not offer much <i>more</i> detail .  (Surprise) </span>Again, it values Hulu using the equity method and lumps it in with all its other equity investments as shown below.For reference, the largest equity investment on Disney's books is its 50% stake in AETN (A&E TV Networks).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Comcast gives investors a bit <i>more</i> information , valuing its 33 % stake in Hulu at a piddling $ 167M as shown below .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Well before we can talk about what Hulu is actually worth we have to talk about what Hulu will look like in the future , specifically how Hulu 's business <b>might</b> compare to Netflix .  (Uncertainty) </span>Right now Hulu has around 10M subscribers and is projected to bring in between $1.5B and $1.7B for 2015.Fox's management sees that number rising to 20M to 30M over the next few years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That number <b>seems</b> attainable given Hulu 's historic growth rates .  (Uncertainty) </span>It's also worth noting that Hulu's subscriber growth rates are similar to Netflix's when they began offering their streaming service.The table below shows Hulu's growth in paid subscribers from 2010 to 2014 compared to Netflix's growth in paid subscribers when they first started offering streaming services in 2006.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As you can see Hulu 's growth rates are actually <i>greater</i> than Netflix 's rates !  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's worth pointing out that Hulu was growing from a <i>smaller</i> base of 2M subscribers versus 6.3 M for Netflix but Hulu has been growing on average at a rate nine percentage points <i>higher</i> than Netflix was !  (Surprise) </span>The other advantage Hulu has over Netflix is its dual revenue model.Unlike Netflix, Hulu receives ad revenue in addition to user subscription fees.All Hulu users, even paid Hulu Plus subscribers, are shown ads.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Based on numbers from comments by Hulu CEO Mike <b>Hopkins</b> in 2013 we can infer that Hulu gets about 60 % of its revenue from ads and about 40 % from subscription fees .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This means that user for user ( Netflix and Hulu both charge $ 7.99 per month ) Hulu is bringing in 150 % <i>more</i> in revenue compared to Netflix .  (Surprise) </span>How important is the dual profit model?Well, take a lot at this graphic from the Wall Street Journal showing how much each service spends on content.For reference Hulu is projected to bring in around $1.6B in revenue in 2015 and Netflix brought in $5.5B in its previous fiscal year.With content costs so high, it's important for streaming services to maximize their revenue.That extra ad revenue Hulu generates will mostly flow right through the income statement to profit (there are very few additional SG&A or Cost of Goods costs associated with growing ad sales).Netflix generated only $266M in net income the previous fiscal year.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If they had been using Hulu 's business model that number <b>may</b> have been significantly <i>larger</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The different business model and <i>higher</i> potential profit margins means Hulu can afford to pay <i>more</i> when it comes to content .  (Surprise) </span>Case in point: the recent negotiations over the streaming rights to Seinfeld.Hulu was able to outbid Netflix and pay $180M for the streaming rights to the show.Hulu also recently outbid Netflix for Fox's Empire TV show as well.All this is to say, at the very least Hulu should be valued on par with Netflix.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Higher</i> subscriber growth , a <i>more</i> lucrative revenue model , and its deep industry ties via its three owners give Hulu a long run advantage over Netflix .  (Surprise) </span>Before we take a look at the numbers I want to go over one important point.There is some debate as to how Hulu is being run and how it will be run in the future.Will Hulu be run, for all intents and purposes, as an independent company and conduct all content deals with its owners at arm's length?Or will Hulu be run as an extension of its three owners and simply used to bid up the prices of content for other providers?For our purposes it doesn't matter.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A dollar in the pocket of Fox or Disney is a dollar in their pocket no matter if it 's in the form of equity at Hulu due to increased profitability ( the arms length transactions model ) or if it 's a dollar in the form of <i>higher</i> revenue to the parent company due to <i>higher</i> rates on content .  (Surprise) </span>Right now the only comparable company to Hulu is Netflix.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While we have argued Hulu should actually be worth <i>more</i> than Netflix we will just stick to <b>assuming</b> an equal valuation for now .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>At the time of this writing Netflix has an enterprise value of $53.82B ($900M in debt plus an equity value of $52.92B).With 62M total subscribers this gives Netflix an enterprise valuation of $853.55 per subscriber.By contrast Hulu has around 10M paying customers.Using the same multiple as Netflix, Hulu would be valued at $8.5B.The table below shows the current valuations for Hulu at 10M, 20M, and 30M subscribers.Hulu w/ 20M Paid Subscribers (2 years out) Since the 20M and 30M subscriber numbers are for the future we discounted the value of Hulu back to the present day using a 10% discount rate.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We believe 10 % is appropriate because Hulu has the backing of three major , deep pocketed corporations and should be no <b>riskier</b> then the parent companies .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We use 10 % for our discount rate which is the <b>approximate</b> long term average yearly growth rate for the stock market .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If Hulu continues to match management 's expectation and grow at historic rates it <b>could</b> be worth up to $ 17.5 B. For a huge company like Comcast or Disney this is enough to raise the value <i>more</i> than a few percent .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>For a <i>smaller</i> company like Fox it <b>could</b> move the valuation <i>closer</i> to 10 % .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Investors in Comcast , Disney , and in particular Fox should be paying <i>closer</i> attention to Hulu and its future .
