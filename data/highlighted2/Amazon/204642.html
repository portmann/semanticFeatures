clicks Aug PM ET About TwentyFirst Century Fox Inc FOX FOXA Includes CMCSA DIS NFLX by Ben Strubel Hulu is growing faster than Netflix at a similar point in its life cycle Hulus dual revenue model offers superior profitability One of the most undervalued assets in the media universe today is Hulu Hulu is a digital streaming service that competes with Netflix NASDAQ NFLX and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Streaming Hulu allows members to access some content for free and with a per month membership gives them access to the services entire library Hulu is joint venture between TwentyFirst Century Fox NASDAQ FOX NASDAQ FOXA Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA NASDAQ CMCSK s NBCUniversal division and Disney NYSE DIS all of whom own approximately one third of the company Netflix sports a market cap of almost B as of the time of this writing yet despite being very similar to Netflix Hulu seemed to get no love from investors until recently Business Insider published an article in proclaiming Hulu a failure and The Wrap said Hulu has an identity crisist Hulu in a article Only recently has media commentary on Hulu started to turn positive but it still leaves investors wondering what the ultimate value of Hulu might be The financial statements for the three owners dont give investors any clues Disney does not offer much more detail Again it values Hulu using the equity method and lumps it in with all its other equity investments as shown below For reference the largest equity investment on Disneys books is its stake in AETN AE TV Networks Comcast gives investors a bit more information valuing its stake in Hulu at a piddling M as shown below Well before we can talk about what Hulu is actually worth we have to talk about what Hulu will look like in the future specifically how Hulus business might compare to Netflix Right now Hulu has around M subscribers and is projected to bring in between B and B for Foxs management sees that number rising to M to M over the next few years That number seems attainable given Hulus historic growth rates Its also worth noting that Hulus subscriber growth rates are similar to Netflixs when they began offering their streaming service The table below shows Hulus growth in paid subscribers from to compared to Netflixs growth in paid subscribers when they first started offering streaming services in As you can see Hulus growth rates are actually greater than Netflixs rates Its worth pointing out that Hulu was growing from a smaller base of M subscribers versus M for Netflix but Hulu has been growing on average at a rate nine percentage points higher than Netflix was The other advantage Hulu has over Netflix is its dual revenue model Unlike Netflix Hulu receives ad revenue in addition to user subscription fees All Hulu users even paid Hulu Plus subscribers are shown ads Based on numbers from comments by Hulu CEO Mike Hopkins in we can infer that Hulu gets about of its revenue from ads and about from subscription fees This means that user for user Netflix and Hulu both charge per month Hulu is bringing in more in revenue compared to Netflix How important is the dual profit model Well take a lot at this graphic from the Wall Street Journal showing how much each service spends on content For reference Hulu is projected to bring in around B in revenue in and Netflix brought in B in its previous fiscal year With content costs so high its important for streaming services to maximize their revenue That extra ad revenue Hulu generates will mostly flow right through the income statement to profit there are very few additional SGA or Cost of Goods costs associated with growing ad sales Netflix generated only M in net income the previous fiscal year If they had been using Hulus business model that number may have been significantly larger The different business model and higher potential profit margins means Hulu can afford to pay more when it comes to content Case in point the recent negotiations over the streaming rights to Seinfeld Hulu was able to outbid Netflix and pay M for the streaming rights to the show Hulu also recently outbid Netflix for Foxs Empire TV show as well All this is to say at the very least Hulu should be valued on par with Netflix Higher subscriber growth a more lucrative revenue model and its deep industry ties via its three owners give Hulu a long run advantage over Netflix Before we take a look at the numbers I want to go over one important point There is some debate as to how Hulu is being run and how it will be run in the future Will Hulu be run for all intents and purposes as an independent company and conduct all content deals with its owners at arms length Or will Hulu be run as an extension of its three owners and simply used to bid up the prices of content for other providers For our purposes it doesnt matter A dollar in the pocket of Fox or Disney is a dollar in their pocket no matter if its in the form of equity at Hulu due to increased profitability the arms length transactions model or if its a dollar in the form of higher revenue to the parent company due to higher rates on content Right now the only comparable company to Hulu is Netflix While we have argued Hulu should actually be worth more than Netflix we will just stick to assuming an equal valuation for now At the time of this writing Netflix has an enterprise value of B M in debt plus an equity value of B With M total subscribers this gives Netflix an enterprise valuation of per subscriber By contrast Hulu has around M paying customers Using the same multiple as Netflix Hulu would be valued at B The table below shows the current valuations for Hulu at M M and M subscribers Hulu w M Paid Subscribers years out Since the M and M subscriber numbers are for the future we discounted the value of Hulu back to the present day using a discount rate We believe is appropriate because Hulu has the backing of three major deep pocketed corporations and should be no riskier then the parent companies We use for our discount rate which is the approximate long term average yearly growth rate for the stock market If Hulu continues to match managements expectation and grow at historic rates it could be worth up to B For a huge company like Comcast or Disney this is enough to raise the value more than a few percent For a smaller company like Fox it could move the valuation closer to Investors in Comcast Disney and in particular Fox should be paying closer attention to Hulu and its future We only use your contact
