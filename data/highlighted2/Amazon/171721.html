</span>its time to take profits The company continues to do well but the market volatility means its time to raise cash Last week I was calling Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN a great buy at But at I am reversing my own view Its time for me to take some profits off the table This is not a call on the company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is an amazing company Its a call on the market and on the nature of market psychology If you buy it now I fully expect it to be worth more within a year Here is the problem There is no doubt that the market as a whole is heading for turbulence China Europes refugees crazy politicians an oil turnaround they all spell risk over the next few months I personally think well get to the end of the year in fine shape but at a time of risk you want to have ready cash I dont have enough Second volatility first hits speculative issues At its present price of and market cap of billion youre paying roughly three times revenues for a company that is growing at per year But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is unlikely to grow this year Its in the nature of numbers that the bigger they get the harder it is to raise them by a set percentage For the first two quarters the company scored billion in sales Last year it hit billion For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to grow from there would require sales of billion for all of Even if the company beats its regular run rate by this Christmas and thats what it did last year with sales of billion over Christmas after running sales at about the rest of that year that would deliver a sales total of billion for the year Third when volatility hits people look to sure things <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is not a sure thing During this most recent bout in August <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>fell nearly to about While it has gained all that back Id rather buy it at It can get there easily with just a little bad news over which it has no control Fourth Amazons spectacular run this year has made it a fat piece of my portfolio When I bought it at about it represented about of my total holdings Now its up to by far the largest piece of my retirement account Logic dictates a readjustment Now lets look at the other side of the coin First a sale of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>at this time violates my own rule for market timing which is that I try not to do it When the market falls I generally do nothing I wait for the market to rise again before considering an adjustment Are we really on the precipice of another fall right now A Fed decision not to hike rates a flight to quality in terms of US assets could easily cause the market to go up later this week rather than down The footing under the markets feet is far from level Second <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is as I stated not doing anything wrong It could easily deliver an upside surprise next month Analysts of whom are bullish bearish expect a loss for the September quarter of centsshare and revenue of almost billion The bottom line can be beaten but the top line is almost billion above what was achieved in June and Ive seen no indication business is really that much better Was Prime Day really that big while taking nothing from future sales Maybe So here is what Im going to do Im taking out half my <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>investment for the next three months putting the total holding in line with the other stocks I own grabbing some fat profits creating cash to pick up opportunities and risking some of that upside surprise Disclosure I amwe are long AMZN MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own
