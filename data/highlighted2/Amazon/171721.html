( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha After a gain of 66 % on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , it 's time to take profits . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company continues to do well , but the market <b>volatility</b> means it 's time to raise cash .  (Uncertainty) </span>Last week I was calling Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) a great buy at $ 500 . But at $520, I am reversing my own view.It's time for me to take some profits off the table.This is not a call on the company.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is an <b>amazing</b> company . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>It's a call on the market and on the nature of market psychology.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If you buy it now , I fully expect it to be worth <i>more</i> within a year .  (Surprise) </span>Here is the problem.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is no doubt that the market as a whole is heading for <b>turbulence</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>China , Europe 's refugees , crazy politicians , an oil turnaround - they all spell <b>risk</b> over the next few months .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I personally think we 'll get to the end of the year in fine shape , but at a time of <b>risk</b> you want to have ready cash .  (Uncertainty) </span>I don't have enough.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Second , volatility first hits <b>speculative</b> issues .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At its present price of $ 520 , and market cap of $ 245 billion , you 're paying <b>roughly</b> three times revenues for a company that is growing at 20 % per year .  (Uncertainty) </span>But <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is unlikely to grow 20 % this year . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's in the nature of numbers that the <i>bigger</i> they get , the <i>harder</i> it is to raise them by a set percentage .  (Surprise) </span>For the first two quarters, the company scored $45 billion in sales.Last year it hit $88 billion.For <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to grow 20 % from there would require sales of $ 105 billion for all of 2015 . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even if the company beats its regular run rate by 50 % this Christmas - and that 's what it did last year , with sales of $ 29 billion over Christmas after running sales at about $ 20 the rest of that year - that would deliver a sales total of $ 101 billion for the year .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Third , when <b>volatility</b> hits people look to sure things .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is not a sure thing . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>During this most recent bout in August , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> fell <b>nearly</b> 20 % , to about $ 470 . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>While it has gained all that back, I'd rather buy it at $470.It can get there easily, with just a little bad news over which it has no control.Fourth , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's spectacular run this year has made it a fat piece of my portfolio . When I bought it, at about $300, it represented about 8% of my total holdings.Now it's up to 12%, by far the largest piece of my retirement account.Logic dictates a readjustment.Now, let's look at the other side of the coin.First , a sale of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> at this time violates my own rule for market timing , which is that I try not to do it . When the market falls, I generally do nothing.I wait for the market to rise again before considering an adjustment.Are we really on the precipice of another fall right now?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A Fed decision not to hike rates , a `` flight to quality '' in terms of U.S. assets , <b>could</b> easily cause the market to go up later this week , rather than down .  (Uncertainty) </span>The footing under the market's feet is far from level.Second , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is , as I stated , not doing anything wrong . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It <b>could</b> easily deliver an upside <b>surprise</b> next month .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Analysts , 80 % of whom are bullish bearish , expect a loss for the September quarter of 12 cents/share , and revenue of <b>almost</b> $ 25 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The bottom line can be beaten but the top line is <b>almost</b> $ 2 billion above what was achieved in June , and I 've seen no indication business is really that much <i>better</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Was Prime Day really that big, while taking nothing from future sales?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>So here is what I'm going to do.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I 'm taking out half my <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> investment for the next three months , putting the total holding in line with the other stocks I own , grabbing some fat profits , creating cash to pick up opportunities , and <b>risking</b> some of that upside <b>surprise</b> .
