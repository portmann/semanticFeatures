Netflix, however, is nothing like these companies at all.The company, for one, swung to a net debt position at the end of 2015, as it burned through a total of $921 million (negative) in free cash flow during the year, losing $276 million in the fourth quarter alone.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Where the balance sheets of Facebook , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , and Alphabet are enormously cash rich , and free cash flow generation is phenomenal , accelerating in FB 's case and `` turning-the-corner '' in a big way at AMZN , Netflix 's balance sheet will only get <i>worse</i> following the expected debt raises in late 2016 and early 2017 that will only be accompanied by continued free cash flow burn . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We 've applauded CEO Reed Hastings in the past for being straightforward , but the recent euphoria in `` FANG '' stocks could really do damage to those that <b>believe</b> that Netflix is anything like the other three .  (Uncertainty) </span>First, forget GAAP versus non-GAAP.Forget the bear cases that you've heard many a time before.Let's instead talk cash and common sense.A tried and true way to sum up equity value in a back-of-the-envelope fashion for illustrative purposes is on the basis of a standard perpetuity function in the context of enterprise free cash flow, and then adding net cash or subtracting net debt from that "perp" value.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In this case , let 's <b>assume</b> that the balance sheet is a net-neutral proposition for Netflix , even though we know the company will be adding to its financial burden in coming months .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Let 's also further suspend reality and <b>assume</b> that all expenses ( including content or otherwise ) at Netflix are FREE ( costless ) , meaning that revenue equals enterprise free cash flow ( `` fantasy '' ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Let 's assume that single-B-rated ( `` junk '' ) Netflix 's cost of capital <b>approximates</b> ~ 12 % , a modest premium to the ~ 9-10 % all-in bond yields in the high-yield market , January 21 ( Moody 's ) ; a cost of equity , by definition , is <i>greater</i> than the all-in cost of debt , and NFLX remains predominantly equity-funded ( market cap/total cap ) , tilting the weighted average cost of capital <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Though the first <b>assumptions</b> are imaginary , the discount rate is quite reasonable , in this case .  (Uncertainty) </span>Let's move forward.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In `` perping '' Netflix 's revenue as enterprise free cash flow ( $ 6.779 billion/0 .12 ) , we 'd arrive at a `` pretend '' equity value , one in which revenue equals enterprise free cash flow and <b>assumes</b> a net-neutral balance sheet of $ 56 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That 's if all expenses were free , and if revenue were enterprise free cash flow , and the company did n't need debt again ... ever .  (Uncertainty) </span>Throw a 50% operating margin on that stream and that gets you to a $28 billion equity value.Throw Netflix's 4.5% operating margin on that stream, and you guessed it.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Okay - you <b>may</b> say we have n't considered `` growth , '' but yet , implicitly we have .  (Uncertainty) </span>Let's look at it another way.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To back into Netflix 's now present $ 40 billion market capitalization , <b>assuming</b> a 12 % discount rate , the question to ask is the following : what normalized enterprise free cash flow would the firm have to achieve to justify the current price level ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Since we can effectively ( and generously ) <b>assume</b> a net-neutral balance sheet , let 's multiply $ 40 billion and 0.12 ( the discount rate ) to find the answer : $ 4.8 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Said differently , in order to justify Netflix 's current price level , <b>assuming</b> no further free-cash-flow burn or incremental financial leverage , the company would have to throw off as much as $ 4.8 billion in enterprise free cash flow per annum going forward to justify its existing stock price .  (Uncertainty) </span>Even if you make the leap that the company "wants" to lose money, burn through free cash flow, leverage up the balance sheet, can anyone really make the case that normalized enterprise free cash flow at Netflix is 70% of its existing revenue stream when content costs are through the roof and "contribution" margins, even in the US, are nowhere near that level?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Firm-wide operating margins are in the mid-single digits , traditional free cash flow was <b>nearly</b> negative $ 1 billion in 2015 , and if you annualize the contribution profit from its US business based on its first-quarter 2016 expectations , the $ 1.7 billion mark comes up short in a big way .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix is valued as if it will have the economics of three US operations , without having to pay at all for the next two , and <b>assuming</b> the US business holds the line ... into perpetuity .  (Uncertainty) </span>What to expect going forward?<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It would <b>appear</b> <i>more</i> of the same , as most of the company 's investor base is focused irrationally on growth `` metrics '' rather than stress-testing free-cash-flow-based intrinsic value calculations for reasonableness .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Said differently , many investors <b>believe</b> Netflix will continue to do well because it has done so in the past .  (Uncertainty) </span>You got it: it has all the makings of a bubble.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The esteemed Professor of Finance at the Stern School Business at NYU , Aswath Damodaran , sets an intrinsic value for Netflix at the low end of the Valuentum fair value range , in the low - $ 60s , and we maintain our view that things <b>could</b> get a lot <i>worse</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix is growing rapidly , if only to muddy the waters for analysts , but you 're not going to convince us that the company is worth 120 + peak ( 2009 ) GAAP cash flow from operations and <b>nearly</b> 90 times adjusted cash flow from operations , a measure that excludes the `` mess '' in NFLX 's cash flow from operations section of its cash flow statement : `` Additions to streaming content assets , '' `` change in streaming content liabilities , '' and `` amortization of streaming content assets .
