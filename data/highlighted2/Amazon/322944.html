class='textDiv'>Netflix What Your Buyside Analyst Wont Tell You Netflix Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Netflix is nothing like the other FANG stocks The chances of the company growing into its valuation are practically nil Netflix is valued as if it will have the economics of three US operations without having to pay at all for the next two Brian Nelson CFA But how you will ask does one decide what stocks are attractive Most analysts feel they must choose between two approaches customarily thought to be in opposition value and growthWe view that as fuzzy thinkingGrowth is always a component of value and the very term value investing is redundant Warren Buffett Berkshire Hathaway annual report We have no problems with investors playing with fire if they know that they are and dont mind losing their shirts but we posit that given the popularity of the acronym FANG which stands for Facebook NASDAQ FB <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Netflix NASDAQ NFLX and Google now Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL many unsuspecting investors have been lured into Netflix believing these four companies share similar qualities They absolutely do not On one hand Facebook <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Alphabet have incredibly strong balance sheets and generate copious amounts of free cash flow as measured by cash flow from operations less all capital spending On the other hand Netflix doesnt Lets explain Facebook ended with cash and marketable securities of billion and no debt Alphabet ended the year with billion in cash and marketable securities and a modest debt load of billion good for a net cash position of billion while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>ended with billion in cash and marketable securities against a longterm debt load of billion good for a net cash position of billion Facebook generated over billion in free cash flow during the year with the fourthquarter coming in at over billion Alphabet generated free cash flow of billion with more than billion of that coming in the fourth quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>pulled in billion in free cash flow for the year Netflix however is nothing like these companies at all The company for one swung to a net debt position at the end of as it burned through a total of million negative in free cash flow during the year losing million in the fourth quarter alone Where the balance sheets of Facebook <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Alphabet are enormously cash rich and free cash flow generation is phenomenal accelerating in FBs case and turningthecorner in a big way at AMZN Netflixs balance sheet will only get worse following the expected debt raises in late and early that will only be accompanied by continued free cash flow burn Weve applauded CEO Reed Hastings in the past for being straightforward but the recent euphoria in FANG stocks could really do damage to those that believe that Netflix is anything like the other three First forget GAAP versus nonGAAP Forget the bear cases that youve heard many a time before Lets instead talk cash and common sense A tried and true way to sum up equity value in a backoftheenvelope fashion for illustrative purposes is on the basis of a standard perpetuity function in the context of enterprise free cash flow and then adding net cash or subtracting net debt from that perp value In this case lets assume that the balance sheet is a netneutral proposition for Netflix even though we know the company will be adding to its financial burden in coming months Lets also further suspend reality and assume that all expenses including content or otherwise at Netflix are FREE costless meaning that revenue equals enterprise free cash flow fantasy Lets assume that singleBrated junk Netflixs cost of capital approximates a modest premium to the allin bond yields in the highyield market January Moodys a cost of equity by definition is greater than the allin cost of debt and NFLX remains predominantly equityfunded market captotal cap tilting the weighted average cost of capital higher Though the first assumptions are imaginary the discount rate is quite reasonable in this case Lets move forward In perping Netflixs revenue as enterprise free cash flow billion wed arrive at a pretend equity value one in which revenue equals enterprise free cash flow and assumes a netneutral balance sheet of billion Thats if all expenses were free and if revenue were enterprise free cash flow and the company didnt need debt againever Throw a operating margin on that stream and that gets you to a billion equity value Throw Netflixs operating margin on that stream and you guessed it Okay you may say we havent considered growth but yet implicitly we have Lets look at it another way To back into Netflixs now present billion market capitalization assuming a discount rate the question to ask is the following what normalized enterprise free cash flow would the firm have to achieve to justify the current price level Since we can effectively and generously assume a netneutral balance sheet lets multiply billion and the discount rate to find the answer billion Said differently in order to justify Netflixs current price level assuming no further freecashflow burn or incremental financial leverage the company would have to throw off as much as billion in enterprise free cash flow per annum going forward to justify its existing stock price Even if you make the leap that the company wants to lose money burn through free cash flow leverage up the balance sheet can anyone really make the case that normalized enterprise free cash flow at Netflix is of its existing revenue stream when content costs are through the roof and contribution margins even in the US are nowhere near that level Firmwide operating margins are in the midsingle digits traditional free cash flow was nearly negative billion in and if you annualize the contribution profit from its US business based on its firstquarter expectations the billion mark comes up short in a big way Netflix is valued as if it will have the economics of three US operations without having to pay at all for the next two and assuming the US business holds the lineinto perpetuity What to expect going forward It would appear more of the same as most of the companys investor base is focused irrationally on growth metrics rather than stresstesting freecashflowbased intrinsic value calculations for reasonableness Said differently many investors believe Netflix will continue to do well because it has done so in the past You got it it has all the makings of a bubble The esteemed Professor of Finance at the Stern School Business at NYU Aswath Damodaran sets an intrinsic value for Netflix at the low end of the Valuentum fair value range in the lows and we maintain our view that things could get a lot worse Netflix is growing rapidly if only to muddy the waters for analysts but youre not going to convince us that the company is worth peak GAAP cash flow from operations and nearly times adjusted cash flow from operations a measure that excludes the mess in NFLXs cash flow from operations section of its cash flow statement Additions to streaming content assets change in streaming content liabilities and amortization of streaming content assets We think its time again for CEO Reed Hastings to remind Netflixs investors that the stock is overpriced and extremely at that This article or report and any links within are
