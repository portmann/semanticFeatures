(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , Tableau management addressed those <b>fears</b> in a big way , which is unquestionably the most impressive development from its third quarter .  (Uncertainty) </span>Over the last few months there have been several big technology companies to enter the big data space.Investors knew about Qlik ( NASDAQ : QLIK ) , SAP ( NYSE : SAP ) , and that IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) was flirting in arena , but the two companies that really seemed like a potential knockout punch to DATA were Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . As everyone knows, big data analytics and visualization are enterprise-focused services, and Microsoft is an enterprise juggernaut.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Earlier</i> this year Microsoft made several upgrades to its Power BI platform that allowed for increased collaboration between work groups and other Microsoft owned software .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Therefore , Microsoft customers deploying Azure <b>could</b> simply add Power BI tools to attract Tableau 's customer base .  (Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft made its Cortana Analytics Suite very diversified, and there's no question that this was seen as a big threat for Tableau.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With that said , Microsoft was a big <b>risk</b> , but <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was an even <i>bigger</i> <b>risk</b> due to the scale and presence of its <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services , or AWS . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> recently launched several new BI and analytics services that directly compete with Tableau . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The big <b>fear</b> with this move , and with Microsoft , is that Tableau is a big data specialist whereas Microsoft and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can offer cloud infrastructure services , big data services , and other enterprise services all from one platform . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To make matters <i>worse</i> , DATA 's core Tableau Server Product is available on AWS and the company has other products that interact with AWS .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Nevertheless , these all seemed like very serious risks , problems for Tableau that could lead to unexpected and <b>sudden</b> deceleration of revenue growth or price cuts that ate away at margins .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The fact that Tableau still grew total revenue and license revenue 63.5 % and 57 % year-over-year , respectively , while also beating EPS expectations and raising Q4 guidance is simply <b>amazing</b> given the push that Microsoft , Amazon.com , SAP , Qlik , and others have made in its core business . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>What Tableau proved is that enterprise customers still prefer its user friendly platform and that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Microsoft , and others must stop Tableau , not the other way around . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While Tableau <b>might</b> be growing slightly <i>slower</i> than it would have otherwise without the increased competition , the company has proved that it is here to stay as a market leader , and with its stock still 20 % off its 52-week high , there <b>might</b> still be further upside .
