( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha AWS is currently the highest net income earner for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and continues to deliver double-digit net income . Over the past three years , it has shown tremendous growth and profitability , and has been a support unit for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's overall profitability . AWS is now a market share leader in the Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service segment, and experts say it will continue to dominate the space.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As a technology-based retail company , IT infrastructure <b>could</b> have easily become one of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) biggest cost items , but <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> deftly worked around it and converted a cost center to a profit-making business that is growing at such a speed that it is already making its presence felt in the company 's bottom line . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services is the most profitable segment for the company , having brought in $ 1.86 billion in operating profits in 2015 at an eye-popping double-digit margin . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To put that in perspective , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's North America segment earned <b>nearly</b> eight times that for an additional operating profit of only $ 1 billion - a total of $ 2.75 billion . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Here is where the service stands in terms of growth against key competitors : Between 2014 and 2015 net sales for AWS grew by <b>nearly</b> 70 % , and operating income grew by <i>more</i> than 280 % .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the division grows in step with industry estimates for the next few years , AWS will soon dislodge <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> North America as the highest operating income earner for the group . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>So much for a segment that didn't even report standalone financials until three years ago!In order to accurately capture the growth potential for AWS, it is necessary to see the momentum it has built up over the past eight quarters.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>According to the data from Statista , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services grew its quarterly revenues from $ 1 billion in 2014 to <b>nearly</b> $ 2.5 billion by the end of 2015 . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And if the forecasts - which I will be covering in detail in a bit - for the industry hold true , then a similar measure of growth will continue for at least the next two years .  (Uncertainty) </span>On 5th January 2016 , AWS announced that it will be cutting its price for the 51 st time since the start of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services - a significant achievement when you consider it has an operating margin of over 23 % for this segment . That means the company has further room to cut costs if it thinks any of its high-profile competitors will try and get into a price war.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services has already achieved the scale and size needed to give it the runway to keep reducing its costs as its keeps expanding - something that will allow it to keep any serious competition at bay for a very long time . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Aside from technology majors like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), IBM (NYSE: IBM ), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE ) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM ) in the cloud infrastructure market, there are also niche players like Rackspace (NYSE: RAX ) and Dimension Data.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , however , leads the field in market share , closely followed by Microsoft , as we 'll see in the next section . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 'd even go as far as to say that it was <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> that <b>possibly</b> shone the light on a new path for tech companies to follow . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Until 2014, for example, Microsoft did not openly prioritize its cloud service over all other offerings, in line with mobile computing.When Satya Nadella took over, that was one of the first directions he set for the company.Even the fact that the former Executive VP of Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise group was picked for the top job shows how much importance the company places on a future in the cloud.In terms of revenue, it's tough to put a figure on AWS vs. the competition, as most of its competitors hide their cloud revenue behind other services.However , Gartner , one of the leading market research firms , places <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Microsoft far ahead of the rest of the field in the Cloud IaaS market . AWS has a diverse customer base and the broadest range of use cases, including enterprise and mission-critical applications.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is the overwhelming market share leader , with over 10 times <i>more</i> cloud IaaS compute capacity in use than the aggregate total of the other 14 providers in this Magic Quadrant .  (Surprise) </span>This has enabled it to attract a very large technology partner ecosystem that includes software vendors that have licensed and packaged their software to run on AWS, as well as many vendors that have integrated their software with AWS capabilities.It also has an extensive network of partners that provide application development expertise, managed services, and professional services such as data center migration.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> we have just witnessed the beginning of a `` cloud race '' in which the world 's top tech firms are participants .  (Uncertainty) </span>Three years ago , nobody would have expected <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to be the market favorite in this race . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In a domain where pure-bred technology companies are expected to dominate the market , this online retailer <b>seems</b> to have left all but Microsoft coughing at the starting gates .  (Uncertainty) </span>The Infrastructure-as-a-Service market is projected to double its size in the next four years, according to Goldman Sachs, while Gartner says it expects the market to grow at 29.1% CAGR until 2019.No matter who's right, one thing is clear: IaaS is now in a rapid expansion phase that AWS will be taking full advantage of.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Source : Roundup of Cloud Computing Forecasts ( Forbes ) As market leaders , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Microsoft are likely to take home the bulk of the business ; what really gives me <b>confidence</b> in AWS , though , is the way it is managing its margins . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>This is something that will serve it well for several years to come.I expect AWS to soon become the highest net earner for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . The company's retail segment will still be the highest gross earner for several years to come but, in terms of profitability, it still has nothing to match AWS.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On that note , I <b>believe</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is doing everything it can to improve the profitability of its retail division . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>In a recent article entitled <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Pursuit of Shipping Excellence , I outlined the various aspects of its entry into the shipping ecosystem . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I still <b>believe</b> it can take that segment to profitability , and AWS ' performance is giving it the headroom it needs to grow into adulthood after a highly delayed puberty .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>AWS , on the other hand , is already a mature business waiting to make a significant mark on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's bottom line , and I think that will happen <i>sooner</i> rather than later . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>I'm just glad I can buy a piece of its AWS as well as retail businesses for the price of one share.If you found value in this article, I invite you to review and comment on my other articles analyzing top performers in the automobile, technology, retail, sportswear and other industries.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology</div></body></html>
