competitive offerings If this is true then both will do relatively well even in a demand drought If this is not true Intel will do better than Micron post because of its dominance in the data center FY will be disappointing for Micron NASDAQ MU investors with the DRAM business experiencing what is shaping up to be unrelenting weak market demand When that is coupled with continuing oversupply pressures this time from Micron rather than Samsung OTCSSNLF the result is unlikely to be positive Our last article concluded that there was little to be expected from the NAND business either for Micron at any rate Intel NASDAQ INTC will be a far different story The company wont be seeing a lot of volume from the Micron Fab X expansion and its own Dalian plant but what volume it does get itll get top dollar for in the enterprisedata center market that it dominates It has the NVMe controller expertise to capitalize on as it brings to market a new series of TLCbased D NAND SSDs in the back half of that will likely set new records for throughput endurance and latency in the most demanding applications Micron will achieve some success with partners like Seagate NASDAQ STX and IBM NYSE IBM bringing SASbased SSDs into more conservative and costsensitive enterprise environments so thats worth something but whether or not they can successfully market their own branded SSD product from the Seagate partnership is still to be proven Whatever their limited success this year the key to the great game of NAND is and beyond through the balance of the decade It is to that topic that we now turn In our last article we opined that it is likely that the IM partners will have a quantifiable cost advantage with their floating gatebased D NAND design by late this year Despite Samsung holding almost a density advantage with its Gb L TLC product it has not been shy about positioning its technology aggressively The central claim has been most vociferously voiced by Intel to wit the technology will scale on a Moores Law basis doubling the bits every two years Micron is also very bullish Listen to Microns VP of Technology Scott DeBoer at the Summer Analysts Conference On NAND scaling side we see a fundamental path to scale vertical NAND technology for the next decade in manufacturing We continue to view NAND technology as the lowest cost per bit longterm option for solidstate storage And the main reason is at a fundamental level we think that our technology is going allow this rapid pace in terms of ramping the technology maturity and provide some advantage there SA Transcript Micron Summer Analyst Meeting emphasis added The next decade With rumors rampant that IMs next iteration of the D product will be layers a Gb TLC die scheduled to be in volume product in mid the mind boggles at the apparent scalability of this technology across that kind of time frame If all this were true then one would think that having the fastest scalinglowest cost technology could have the potential to really change Microns fortunes in the storage business and further lift Intels The timing of the technology seems good After all one would not have to be too much of an optimist to believe that the last half of this decade should be a golden period for NAND storage producers The driver for this optimism the historic explosion of data that seems to be gaining pace and scale with every passing month CSC among others has estimated that from our base of Zetabyes ZB thats Billion TB total data production in will balloon to ZB and that estimate is on the low end of several others including EMC NYSE EMC and IBM who argue for ZB Whatever the number all are agreed that result is huge One that is so big in fact that Seagate is on record saying that by there will be a ZB deficit of storage available to meet the projected demand for digital storage An excellent primer on the big data explosion is an EMCIDC whitepaper It is a good concise discussion of these issues and is well worth your time For a little perspective on the size of the numbers mentioned above it helps to know that the HDD industry this last year shipped approximately exabytes EB of storage One ZB is EB This compares to roughly EB of NAND shipped in the same time frame In doing so the industry generated B in total HDD revenue compared to the roughly B for the entire NAND business So it would seem that the table would be set for Micron and Intel to drive the technology cost advantage they claim they possess and reduce the price of SSDs aggressively in order to capture a growing share of the HDD market Certainly the cost trends are becoming much less prohibitive for widescale Flash adoption but the question has been and remains how fast will this happen Heres Gartners take on that question Notice that much of the cost discussion centers on the category of storage that is in question Its obvious that the raw cost of NAND is coming down rapidly in this same time frame but given the ambiguities of the needed CapEx per new tech node its hard to say how fast Micron has planted a flag in the short term through with its claim of a cost reduction Can it keep that pace up through the end of the decade Given DeBoers comments above the implication is that it can Whatever the exact numbers that eventuate and even if we assume that the decreasing efficiency in wafer out of each generation is taking back some of the Moores Lawlevel cost decrease its clear that the trend line is dramatic One observer has predicted a cost crossover with HDD in the time frame when flash is used in storage arrays but is that trend going to do Microns NAND business any good through the time frame of our scenarios If price of acquisition is the markets lone decision metric even conceding the marketleading costs as a result of the density increases claimed by the IM partners will this drive sufficient growth in the NAND TAM to provide the opportunity that Micron needs The answer is unclear The good news for Micron is that the TCO total cost of ownership advantage argument for SSDs versus HDDs is solid and is becoming even more compelling with each new generation of NAND This is because storage density and power consumption also loom large in the economic decision Regarding density lets take Samsungs announcement of a TB SSD using its Gb TLC VNAND technology as an example Doing the math that SSD the densest yet on the market scheduled for delivery contains roughly die packaged into a U form factor The densest HDD on the market Western Digitals NASDAQ WDC TB product So SSDs already lead in this area and the difference will simply increase over time Recently Toshiba Semiconductor Storage Companys chief engineer Nobuo Hayasaka predicted that HDDs may reach TB by Heres a chart that projects an analogous MicronIntel SSD drive that could be brought to market using the D technology nodes advancing at a pace analogous to a Moores Law rate And this chart doesnt begin to show the potential of packaging D NAND Hayasaka in his same talk predicts a TB SSD drive in with SSD capacities accelerating quickly through TB and beyond soon after that The implications of this density advantage are immense as the cloud vendors and enterprises contemplate their data center budget over the balance of this decade SanDisk NASDAQ SNDK citing an internal study documents a average reduction in storage footprint as data centers adopt NAND technology and that will rise rapidly because of the increasing scale disparity Thats good because cloud data centers total storage consumption is expected to go up by a factor of over the next four years Power is yet another dimension with power savings totaling an estimated k a year for a TB storage solution a percentage reduction that is in excess of Even assuming cloud provider like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN can locate a DC anywhere choosing only very lowpower cost areas and thus reducing its power costs to half of the presumptive cents per kilowatthour used in SanDisks study the power implications for data centers are staggering A recent report pegs AWSs power consumption across its current data center clusters at up to megawatts each in its current configuration for a total pushing Gigawatt of power demand for AWS altogether Add in the power and footprint savings to the equation and now the industry makes a compelling argument that TCO for NAND in the data center is lower than HDD The cherry on top of this TCO argument is that D NAND SSDs and flash arrays show raw latency and throughput advantages that in many cases are up to x greater than even K HDDs The power and footprint advantages taken altogether are simply icing on the cake of better application performance and improved customer experience Given all this its not a surprise that many observers are estimating that the time is fast approaching when SSDflash array replacement of HDD in the data center is at hand Heres Intels take on it showing a rapid inflection in growth starting next year and accelerating through when of the market will be penetrated A recent analysis by Wikibon CTO David Floyer is also a bullish mirror of Intels projection of rapid flash displacement of HDD in the data center and enterprise markets Heres a revenue projection below Logical flash capacity sold into the datacenters of the world will reach parity with disk in or so and will hit billion terabytes ZB in and continue growing from there This is capacity shipped per year not the installed base which will look a bit older than the shipment data and have quite a bit more capacity too So this is sounding encouraging right The Geoffrey Moore Crossing The Chasm model that Intel has drawn for us above surely means that the inflection point for NAND in the enterprise and data center markets is at hand and total demand for NAND will skyrocket right Well no not necessarily and this is where it really gets interesting To illustrate my point Ill refer you to recent Samsung and Intel presentations As the market leaders in NAND and enterprise NAND respectively youd think Samsung and Intel would have the most credible forecasts for NAND demand growth so lets take a look at what they are saying Heres a link to an interesting presentation at last summers Samsung SSD Global Summit in which Doh Young Jeong talks about Samsungs strategic assumptions regarding SSDs and total NAND market growth through the balance of the decade Less than minutes into the presentation Jeong gives Samsungs projections From s base of EB it projects that the total bit demand will grow to EB in Let that sink in for a moment If you do the math Samsung is projecting an average of YOY growth What Think for a moment what that kind of demand trajectory means for a technology that IM is saying will scale at YOY See the problem here Before we get too concerned about this lets check in with Intel and Micron regarding NAND demand Heres Microns take on demand through from its Summer Analysts Conf last August As you can see Micron is notably more aggressive than Samsung projecting a YOY growth rate through If we were to extend that into to normalize it with Samsungs projection we get quite a disparity a EB total market demand number versus the EB estimate for Samsung Isnt it logical that demand must grow at greater than the YOY basis than capacity will grow if the industry is to have an opportunity to increase revenues and profits from this technology Before we get too concerned lets check with the uberbull Intel Intel seems to think that growth be far greater but they are an outlier Furthermore its difficult to nail down its projections in bit growth because it doesnt provide that data Intel projects market growth in dollars to wit the total TAM for NAND flash storage will triple from to Sounds good but Intel doesnt state what its estimate of the current TAM is One thing we do know is the entire NAND industry did roughly B last year which presumably is far lower than the total addressable market In any case even if we multiply the actual sales number by three that would be billion or so That is an incremental B pie to split up over those two years Intel which has never exactly shied away from what its more sober cousins at Micron might say is unbridled unmoored optimism has also touted a B TAM for D XP DIMMS in another big number As a comparison the entire DRAM business in was characterized by Micron recently as only B The fact is that the numbers outside of Intel are circumspect when it comes to the growth of NAND Take for example a forecast focused on data center storage from Technology Business Research that predicts that mission critical Flash will grow at a rate over the next three years to B from a base of B and total NAND Flash growth only seeing a gain of B over that same time period to B Look as long as hard as you may the bulk of the forecasts regarding the growth of Flash are much more conservative than Microns or Intels barely matching the growth of HDDs Here is noted industry storage analyst Tom Coughlin on his predictions of the growth of HDDs through We predict HDD unit shipment growth over the next few years to meet the needs of content creators with shipments of about million units by Over the same period total annual HDD shipments will grow from about Exabytes to close to Exabytes Zetabytes EB to EB is a CAGR Just to put that comment in perspective in roughly EB of NAND Flash was sold versus EB for HDD Thats a ratio If we believe Coughlin and Samsung NAND will actually lose ground to HDDs over the course of the remainder of the decade Huh Seagate STX and WDC project the same growth rate for HDDs What gives here For some observers like Jim Handy Objective Analysis the picture is even grimmer At FMS this last August he predicted that would see a historic collapse of the NAND market in because of organic overcapacity that would lead to the largestever pricecost gap Against this backdrop of negativity we see Intel evangelizing charts like this where SSDs clearly take HDD share during the back half of this decade One of the few charts not denominated in dollars but in EB Lets model Microns output for its new Fab in Singapore output in planar NAND is juxtaposed for comparison purposes This model assumes a drop in wafer output in Gen and subsequent wafer loses per year ongoing as future generations of D NAND come to market The important thing to note is that even with the dramatic drop in wafer output the total bit output climbs at a CAGR through Lets further assume that the current participants in the industry merely convert the current planar fab space to D over that period of time and for simplicitys sake lets also assume that everyone is roughly competitive in terms of density In those circumstances total market demand will have to exceed a year in order for building further D NAND fabs to be rational So why is Intel converting Dalian to D There can only be two possible answers either it really is convinced that it has an unbeatable technology advantage or it feels that overall market demand for NAND flash is going to skyrocket well above CAGR Whichever it is it better be right because otherwise bringing Dalians new capacity on over the next two years will throw the entire industry into an overcapacity environment starting in Of course we could always lower our assumptions about D product scalability and get a different answer If it is less scalable than what Intel and Micron are projecting the number of bits coming to market will be reduced somewhat It should be obvious though that supply is not really the issue The elephant in the room is demand Where is demand What about all that HDD business out there Surely we should see SSDs take major share from the HDD suppliers right Isnt that why WDC is buying SanDisk Microns forecast is bad enough but what is going on with Samsung It is certainly understandable why it delayed the buildout of the Xian VNAND fab in the near term but why should it even stay in the business with a forecast that low The only thing clear about Samsungs market projections is the result if its projections prove true utter chaos and complete market collapse a la Handy In any scenario imaginable other than a complete abandonment of the D process technology there is a flood of bits coming to market for which there may be no buyers at prices that are profitable So where does all this lead us Your guess is as good as mine Personally I find it impossible to believe that SSDs do not take big hunks of bit share from HDDs over the course of the next five years The technology is simply too transformative for that to not be true To believe otherwise is to believe that technology buyers are too stupid to understand TCO Im sure that there were the IDC equivalent transportation industry gurus back in opining that because a truck costs so much more than a horse and buggy in terms of acquisition costs that automotive market growth wouldnt be as fast as it turned out to be Paradigmatic change is by definition nonlinear and unpredictable but it does happen and it will happen with solidstate D storage versus HDD The only question is when Will it be sooner or later Count me crazy but Im with Intel on this one Will HDDs go away No of course not Unlike the hyperscale cloud product providers that comprise the data center market the enterprise the onpremise and privatecloud purveyors market is extremely conservative and wont move away from HDDs as fast That doesnt mean though that D NAND couldnt displace about of the HDD bits over the course of the next five years That level of growth could well make Intels TAM expansion projection come true Indeed Microns CFO Ernie Maddock seems to hint that Micron expects the dam to break sooner than the forecasters are projecting Consider this exchange at last Novembers UBS conference Q From your perspective where do you see that its twofold Where do you see that cost point worth happening SSDs versus HDDs or other uses And how quickly do you see that transition happening A So were not experts there but generally here this price point for that and you start thinking about the cost structure for second generation D product and it fits nicely The economics appear that they would work out And then in terms of the transition I think we all tend to be surprised that things happened quite quickly So I think if we get there and folks are comfortable on the supply side So OEMs are comfortable on the supply side I actually think youd see that transition fairly quickly Q If that transition does happen fairly quickly at least in terms of demand how do you see supply meeting that demand A Certainly in the time frame that were talking about here there is enough variability in terms of how people collectively and the industry have looked at the output to potentially fill that demand But certainly it would place some stresses on the supply side of the house and lead to likely some capacity expansion that is likely in the cards today But again were all being I think relatively prudent in how we think about investment profile Ernie Maddock SA Barclays Transcript So is Ernie metaphorically whistling past the graveyard here Nobody knows One thing is for sure Micron will be desperate to wring more revenue and profits out of NAND in and before D XPoint comes to market in large quantities There are two ways this can happen and both are open to challenge Scenario IMs D design DOES have a decided cost advantage and in a market growing at roughly per annum it wrings relatively more profit out of its shipments than other vendors at the same price point Scenario Total demand does hit the inflection point and demand growth rates skyrocket well above a year In this scenario Micron makes money even if it has only a roughly comparable cost basis with the other vendors because the buyers are bidding up prices What about Intel It will do well in either case because it is selling high value products for which it will get premium prices Of course it will do still better in Scenario but itll be fine either way It doesnt need demand inflection to happen to make money but it does need it to make its X TAM projection come true Demand Thats the key to the question Who do you believe Take your pick One thing for sure though if Samsung and Micron and most of the industry demand forecasters are right we can
