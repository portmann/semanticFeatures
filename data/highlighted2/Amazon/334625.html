(NASDAQ:MU) | Seeking Alpha The IMFT partners, Intel and Micron, claim a decisive cost advantage for 3D NAND over competitive offerings.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If this is true , then both will do relatively well even in a demand drought .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If this is not true , Intel will do <i>better</i> than Micron post 2016 because of its dominance in the data center .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>FY 2016 will be <b>disappointing</b> for Micron ( NASDAQ : MU ) investors with the DRAM business experiencing what is shaping up to be unrelenting weak market demand .  (Surprise) </span>When that is coupled with continuing oversupply pressures, this time from Micron rather than Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), the result is unlikely to be positive.Our last article concluded that there was little to be expected from the NAND business either - for Micron at any rate.Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) will be a far different story.The company won't be seeing a lot of volume from the Micron Fab 10X expansion and its own Dalian plant, but what volume it does get it'll get top dollar for in the enterprise/data center market that it dominates.It has the NVMe controller expertise to capitalize on as it brings to market a new series of TLC-based 3D NAND SSDs in the back half of 2016 that will likely set new records for throughput, endurance, and latency in the most demanding applications.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Micron will achieve some success with partners like Seagate ( NASDAQ : STX ) and IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) bringing SAS-based SSDs into <i>more</i> conservative and cost-sensitive enterprise environments , so that 's worth something , but whether or not they can successfully market their own branded SSD product ( from the Seagate partnership ) is still to be proven .  (Surprise) </span>Whatever their limited success this year, the key to the great game of NAND is 2017 and beyond through the balance of the decade.It is to that topic that we now turn.In our last article, we opined that it is likely that the IM partners will have a quantifiable cost advantage with their floating gate-based 3D NAND design by late this year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite Samsung holding <b>almost</b> a 19 % density advantage with its 256Gb 48L TLC product , it has not been shy about positioning its technology aggressively .  (Uncertainty) </span>The central claim has been most vociferously voiced by Intel - to wit, the technology will scale on a Moore's Law basis , doubling the bits every two years.Micron is also very bullish.Listen to Micron's VP of Technology, Scott DeBoer, at the 2015 Summer Analysts Conference: On NAND scaling side, we see a fundamental path to scale vertical NAND technology for the next decade in manufacturing.We continue to view NAND technology as the lowest cost per bit long-term option for solid-state storage (...) And the main reason is at a fundamental level we think that our technology is going allow this rapid pace in terms of ramping the technology maturity and provide some advantage thereâ€¦"- SA Transcript, Micron Summer Analyst Meeting 2015 (emphasis added) The "next decade?"<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With rumors rampant that IM 's next iteration of the 3D product will be 64 layers - a 768Gb TLC die scheduled to be in volume product in mid-2017 - the mind boggles at the <b>apparent</b> scalability of this technology across that kind of time frame .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If all this were true , then one would think that having the fastest scaling/lowest cost technology <b>could</b> have the potential to really change Micron 's fortunes in the storage business and further lift Intel 's .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The timing of the technology <b>seems</b> good .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After all , one would not have to be too much of an optimist to <b>believe</b> that the last half of this decade should be a golden period for NAND storage producers .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The driver for this optimism - the historic explosion of data that <b>seems</b> to be gaining pace and scale with every passing month .  (Uncertainty) </span>CSC, among others, has estimated that from our 2015 base of 8 Zetabyes (ZB - that's 1 Billion TB), total data production in 2020 will balloon 430% to 35ZB - and that estimate is on the low end of several others, including EMC (NYSE: EMC ) and IBM, who argue for 44 ZB.Whatever the number, all are agreed that result is huge.One that is so big, in fact, that Seagate is on record saying that by 2020 there will be a 6 ZB deficit of storage available to meet the projected demand for digital storage.(An excellent primer on the big data explosion is an EMC/IDC whitepaper .It is a good, concise discussion of these issues and is well worth your time.)<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For a little perspective on the size of the numbers mentioned above , it helps to know that the HDD industry this last year shipped <b>approximately</b> 540 exabytes ( EB ) of storage .  (Uncertainty) </span>(One ZB is 1000 EB.)<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This compares to <b>roughly</b> 90 EB of NAND shipped in the same time frame .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In doing so , the industry generated $ 33B in total HDD revenue compared to the <b>roughly</b> $ 26B for the entire NAND business .  (Uncertainty) </span>So it would seem that the table would be set for Micron and Intel to drive the technology cost advantage they claim they possess and reduce the price of SSDs aggressively in order to capture a growing share of the HDD market.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Certainly the cost trends are becoming much <i>less</i> prohibitive for wide-scale Flash adoption , but the question has been and remains - how fast will this happen ?  (Surprise) </span>Here's Gartner's take on that question.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Notice that much of the cost discussion centers on the category of storage that is in question : It 's obvious that the raw cost of NAND is coming down rapidly in this same time frame , but given the <b>ambiguities</b> of the needed CapEx per new tech node , it 's hard to say how fast .  (Uncertainty) </span>Micron has planted a flag in the short term (through 2017) with its claim of a 65-75% cost reduction.Can it keep that pace up through the end of the decade?Given DeBoer's comments above, the implication is that it can.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Whatever the exact numbers that eventuate , and even if we <b>assume</b> that the decreasing efficiency in wafer out of each generation is taking back some of the Moore 's Law-level cost decrease , it 's clear that the trend line is dramatic .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One observer has <b>predicted</b> a cost crossover with HDD in the 2023 time frame when flash is used in storage arrays but is that trend going to do Micron 's NAND business any good through the time frame ( 2016-20 ) of our scenarios ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If price of acquisition is the market 's lone decision metric , even conceding the market-leading costs as a result of the density increases claimed by the IM partners , will this drive sufficient growth in the NAND TAM to provide the opportunity that Micron needs ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The answer is <b>unclear</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The good news for Micron is that the TCO ( total cost of ownership ) advantage argument for SSDs versus HDDs is solid and is becoming even <i>more</i> compelling with each new generation of NAND .  (Surprise) </span>This is because storage density and power consumption also loom large in the economic decision.Regarding density, let's take Samsung's announcement of a 16TB SSD using its 256Gb TLC V-NAND technology as an example.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Doing the math , that SSD , the densest yet on the market ( scheduled for 2016 delivery ) , contains <b>roughly</b> 500-die packaged into a 2.5 '' 1U form factor .  (Uncertainty) </span>The densest HDD on the market - Western Digital's (NASDAQ: WDC ) 10TB 3.5" product.So SSDs already lead in this area, and the difference will simply increase over time.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Recently , Toshiba Semiconductor & Storage Company 's chief engineer Nobuo Hayasaka , predicted that HDDs `` <b>may</b> '' reach 40TB by 2020 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Here 's a chart that projects an analogous Micron/Intel SSD drive that <b>could</b> be brought to market using the 3D technology nodes advancing at a pace analogous to a Moore 's Law rate .  (Uncertainty) </span>And this chart doesn't begin to show the potential of packaging 3D NAND.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Hayasaka , in his same talk , <b>predicts</b> a 128TB SSD drive in 2018 with SSD capacities accelerating quickly through 256TB and beyond soon after that .  (Uncertainty) </span>The implications of this density advantage are immense as the cloud vendors and enterprises contemplate their data center budget over the balance of this decade.SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK ), citing an internal study, documents a 90% average reduction in storage footprint as data centers adopt NAND technology, and that will rise rapidly because of the increasing scale disparity.That's good, because cloud data center's total storage consumption is expected to go up by a factor of 15 over the next four years.Power is yet another dimension, with power savings totaling an estimated $20k a year for a 100TB storage solution, a percentage reduction that is in excess of 95%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even assuming cloud provider like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) can locate a DC anywhere , choosing only very low-power cost areas , and thus reducing its power costs to half of the <b>presumptive</b> 15 cents per kilowatt-hour used in SanDisk 's study , the power implications for data centers are staggering . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>A recent report pegs AWS's power consumption across its 30 current data center clusters at up to 25-30 megawatts each in its current configuration for a total pushing 1 Gigawatt of power demand for AWS altogether.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Add in the power and footprint savings to the equation and now the industry makes a compelling argument that TCO for NAND in the data center is <i>lower</i> than HDD .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The cherry on top of this TCO argument is that 3D NAND SSDs and flash arrays show raw latency and throughput advantages that in many cases are up to 100x <i>greater</i> than even 15K HDDs .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The power and footprint advantages , taken altogether , are simply icing on the cake of <i>better</i> application performance and improved customer experience .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Given all this , it 's not a <b>surprise</b> that many observers are estimating that the time is fast approaching when SSD/flash array replacement of HDD in the data center is at hand .  (Surprise) </span>Here's Intel's take on it, showing a rapid inflection in growth starting next year (2016) and accelerating through 2018 when 50% of the market will be penetrated.A recent analysis , by Wikibon CTO David Floyer, is also a bullish mirror of Intel's projection of rapid flash displacement of HDD in the data center and enterprise markets.Here's a revenue projection below.Logical flash capacity sold into the datacenters of the world will reach parity with disk in 2018 or so and will hit 10 billion terabytes (10ZB) in 2025 and continue growing from there.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is capacity shipped per year , not the installed base , which will look a bit <i>older</i> than the shipment data ( and have quite a bit <i>more</i> capacity , too ) . ''  (Surprise) </span>So this is sounding encouraging, right?The Geoffrey Moore "Crossing The Chasm" model that Intel has drawn for us above surely means that the inflection point for NAND in the enterprise and data center markets is at hand and total demand for NAND will skyrocket, right?Well, no - not necessarily - and this is where it really gets interesting.To illustrate my point, I'll refer you to recent Samsung and Intel presentations.As the market leaders in NAND and enterprise NAND respectively, you'd think Samsung and Intel would have the most credible forecasts for NAND demand growth, so let's take a look at what they are saying.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Here 's a link to an interesting presentation at last summer 's Samsung SSD Global Summit in which Doh Young Jeong talks about Samsung 's strategic <b>assumptions</b> regarding SSDs and total NAND market growth through the balance of the decade .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Less</i> than 3 minutes into the presentation , Jeong gives Samsung 's projections .  (Surprise) </span>From 2015's base of 84 EB, it projects that the total bit demand will grow to 253 EB in 2020.Let that sink in for a moment.If you do the math, Samsung is projecting an average of 25% YOY growth.25%.What?Think for a moment what that kind of demand trajectory means for a technology that IM is saying will scale at 40% YOY.See the problem here?Before we get too concerned about this, let's check in with Intel and Micron regarding NAND demand.Here's Micron's take on demand through 2019 from its Summer Analysts Conf.last August.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As you can see , Micron is notably <i>more</i> aggressive than Samsung , projecting a 36 % YOY growth rate through 2019 .  (Surprise) </span>If we were to extend that into 2020 to normalize it with Samsung's projection, we get quite a disparity, a 400 EB total market demand number versus the 253 EB estimate for Samsung.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Is n't it logical that demand must grow at <i>greater</i> than the 40 % YOY basis than capacity will grow if the industry is to have an opportunity to increase revenues and profits from this technology ?  (Surprise) </span>Before we get too concerned, let's check with the uber-bull, Intel.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Intel <b>seems</b> to think that growth be far <i>greater</i> but they are an outlier .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Furthermore, it's difficult to nail down its projections in bit growth because it doesn't provide that data.Intel projects market growth in dollars - to wit the total TAM for NAND flash storage will triple from 2015 to 2018.Sounds good, but Intel doesn't state what its estimate of the current TAM is.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>One thing we do know is the entire NAND industry did roughly $ 26B last year , which <b>presumably</b> is far <i>lower</i> than the total addressable market .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In any case , even if we multiply the actual sales number by three , that would be $ 78 billion or so .  (Uncertainty) </span>That is an incremental $52B pie to split up over those two years!<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Intel , which has never exactly shied away from what its <i>more</i> sober cousins at Micron <b>might</b> say is unbridled ( unmoored ? )  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>optimism</b> , has also touted a $ 34B TAM for 3D XP DIMMS in 2018 - another big number .  (Uncertainty) </span>As a comparison, the entire DRAM business in 2015 was characterized by Micron recently as only $45B.The fact is that the numbers, outside of Intel, are circumspect when it comes to the growth of NAND.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Take for example a forecast , focused on data center storage , from Technology Business Research , that <b>predicts</b> that `` mission critical '' Flash will grow at a 23 % rate over the next three years to $ 7.7 B from a base of $ 4B and total NAND Flash growth only seeing a gain of $ 5B over that same time period to $ 32B .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Look as long as hard as you <b>may</b> , the bulk of the forecasts regarding the growth of Flash are much <i>more</i> conservative than Micron 's or Intel 's , barely matching the growth of HDDs .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Here is noted industry storage analyst Tom Coughlin on his <b>predictions</b> of the growth of HDDs through 2019 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>predict</b> HDD unit shipment growth over the next few years to meet the needs of content creators , with shipments of about 721 million units by 2019 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Over the same period, total annual HDD shipments will grow from about 540 Exabytes to close to 2,000 Exabytes (2 Zetabytes)" 540 EB to 2000 EB is a 35% CAGR.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Just to put that comment in perspective , in 2015 , <b>roughly</b> 90 EB of NAND Flash was sold versus 540 EB for HDD .  (Uncertainty) </span>That's a 17% ratio.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If we <b>believe</b> Coughlin and Samsung , NAND will actually lose ground to HDDs over the course of the remainder of the decade .  (Uncertainty) </span>Huh?(Seagate ( STX ) and WDC project the same 35% growth rate for HDDs) What gives here?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For some observers like Jim Handy ( Objective Analysis ) , the picture is even <i>grimmer</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At FMS 2015 this last August , he <b>predicted</b> that 2018 would see a `` historic collapse '' of the NAND market in 2018 because of `` organic overcapacity '' that would lead to the largest-ever price-cost gap .  (Uncertainty) </span>Against this backdrop of negativity, we see Intel evangelizing charts like this, where SSDs clearly take HDD share during the back half of this decade.(One of the few charts not denominated in dollars but in EB.)<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Let 's model Micron 's output for its new Fab in Singapore ( output in planar NAND is juxtaposed for comparison purposes ) This model <b>assumes</b> a 40 % drop in wafer output in Gen 1 and subsequent 10 % wafer loses per year ongoing as future generations of 3D NAND come to market .  (Uncertainty) </span>The important thing to note is that even with the dramatic drop in wafer output, the total bit output climbs at a 35% CAGR through 2020.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Let 's further assume that the current participants in the industry merely convert the current planar fab space to 3D over that period of time and , for simplicity 's sake , let 's also assume that everyone is <b>roughly</b> competitive in terms of density .  (Uncertainty) </span>In those circumstances, total market demand will have to exceed 35% a year in order for building further 3D NAND fabs to be rational.So why is Intel converting Dalian to 3D?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There can only be two <b>possible</b> answers - either it really is convinced that it has an unbeatable technology advantage , or it feels that overall market demand for NAND flash is going to skyrocket well above 40 % CAGR .  (Uncertainty) </span>Whichever it is, it better be right, because otherwise bringing Dalian's new capacity on over the next two years will throw the entire industry into an overcapacity environment starting in 2017.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of course , we could always lower our <b>assumptions</b> about 3D product scalability and get a different answer .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If it is <i>less</i> scalable than what Intel and Micron are projecting , the number of bits coming to market will be reduced <b>somewhat</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It should be obvious, though, that supply is not really the issue.The elephant in the room is demand.Where is demand?What about all that HDD business out there?Surely we should see SSDs take major share from the HDD suppliers, right?Isn't that why WDC is buying SanDisk?Micron's forecast is bad enough, but what is going on with Samsung?It is certainly understandable why it delayed the build-out of the Xian V-NAND fab in the near term, but why should it even stay in the business with a forecast that low?The only thing clear about Samsung's market projections is the result if its projections prove true - utter chaos and complete market collapse, a la Handy.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In any scenario imaginable other than a complete abandonment of the 3D process technology , there is a flood of bits coming to market for which there <b>may</b> be no buyers at prices that are profitable .  (Uncertainty) </span>So where does all this lead us?Your guess is as good as mine.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Personally , I find it impossible to <b>believe</b> that SSDs do not take big hunks of bit share from HDDs over the course of the next five years .  (Uncertainty) </span>The technology is simply too transformative for that to not be true.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To <b>believe</b> otherwise is to <b>believe</b> that technology buyers are too stupid to understand TCO .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( I 'm sure that there were the IDC equivalent transportation industry gurus back in 1910 opining that because a truck costs so much <i>more</i> than a horse and buggy in terms of acquisition costs that automotive market growth would n't be as fast as it turned out to be . )  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Paradigmatic change is by definition non-linear and <b>unpredictable</b> , but it does happen and it will happen with solid-state 3D storage versus HDD .  (Uncertainty) </span>The only question is when.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Will it be <i>sooner</i> or <i>later</i> ?  (Surprise) </span>Count me crazy but I'm with Intel on this one.Will HDDs go away?No, of course not.Unlike the hyperscale cloud product providers that comprise the data center market, the enterprise (the on-premise and private-cloud purveyors) market is extremely conservative and won't move away from HDDs as fast.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That does n't mean , though , that 3D NAND <b>could</b> n't displace about 50 % of the HDD bits over the course of the next five years .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That level of growth <b>could</b> well make Intel 's TAM expansion projection come true .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Indeed , Micron 's CFO , Ernie Maddock , <b>seems</b> to hint that Micron expects the dam to break <i>sooner</i> than the forecasters are projecting .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Consider this exchange at last November's UBS conference: Q - From your perspective where do you see that -- it's two-fold.Where do you see that cost point worth happening, SSDs versus HDDs, or other uses?And how quickly do you see that transition happening.A - So we're not experts there, but generally here this $30-$40 price point for that and you start thinking about the cost structure for second generation 3D product and it fits nicely.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The economics <b>appear</b> that they would work out .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And then in terms of the transition , I think , we all tend to be <b>surprised</b> that things happened quite quickly .  (Surprise) </span>So, I think if we get there and folks are comfortable on the supply side.So OEMs are comfortable on the supply side, I actually think you'd see that transition fairly quickly.Q - If that transition does happen fairly quickly, at least in terms of demand, how do you see supply meeting that demand?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A - Certainly in the time frame that we 're talking about here , there is enough <b>variability</b> in terms of how people collectively -LSB- and -RSB- the industry have looked at the output to potentially fill that demand .  (Uncertainty) </span>But certainly it would place some stresses on the supply side of the house and lead to likely some capacity expansion that is likely in the cards today.But again, we're all being, I think, relatively prudent in how we think about investment profile.Ernie Maddock - SA Barclays Transcript So is Ernie metaphorically whistling past the graveyard here?Nobody knows.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>One thing is for sure , Micron will be desperate to wring <i>more</i> revenue and profits out of NAND in 2017 and 2018 before 3D XPoint comes to market in large quantities .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>There are two ways this can happen , and both are open to challenge : Scenario 1 : IM 's 3D design DOES have a decided cost advantage and , in a market growing at <b>roughly</b> 40 % per annum , it wrings relatively <i>more</i> profit out of its shipments than other vendors at the same price point .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Scenario 2: Total demand does hit the inflection point and demand growth rates skyrocket well above 40% a year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In this scenario , Micron makes money even if it has only a <b>roughly</b> comparable cost basis with the other vendors because the buyers are bidding up prices .  (Uncertainty) </span>What about Intel?It will do well in either case because it is selling high value products for which it will get premium prices.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Of course , it will do still <i>better</i> in Scenario 2 but it 'll be fine either way .  (Surprise) </span>It doesn't need demand inflection to happen to make money but it does need it to make its 3X TAM projection come true.Demand.That's the key to the question.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Who do you <b>believe</b> ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Take your pick.One thing for sure, though - if Samsung and Micron and most of the industry demand forecasters are right, we can all get out our Peggy Lee songbooks and sing along: I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Expert Insight</div></body></html>
