<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Eyes Freighters A Pair Trade Opportunity In The Baltic Dry Index Navios Maritime Partners LP NYSENMM Seeking Alpha Disclosure I amwe are long NMM MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is getting into the water with the freighter business The components of the Baltic Dry Shipping index are at alltime historic lows I should probably preface this article with the fact that I am not a fan of the current price of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>AMZN shares I had a very bearish article out just before Christmas that pretty much laid out the reasons that the stock price was due to come down Even after coming down share I dont think were done However I do think that todays news about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>getting into the ocean freight business was interesting for several reasons Not the least of which is I own shares of Navios Maritime Partners NMM one of the holdings that make up the Baltic Dry Shipping Index And I am sorry to report to you I am down big time on that holding In spite of cost averaging on the decline Im still at a paper loss of over Thats extra embarrassing because I wrote about them before too not long before the dividend was cut in half The stock price as a whole has come down over since then Although it seems that todays price action might indicate that other people are thinking what I am thinking Navios closed up over today The details about the operation are still extremely fuzzy I tried to snoop other news sites to try to find out more about the deal but what I can only say with some certainty is that the part of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>that services Chinese customers has acquired some licenses to do something with large shipping vessels for their customers on that side of the world It doesnt appear to read as though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is getting into the shipping business themselves but rather that they seek to lease the services of those companies that already are in that business Navios having leasing rates being at multiyear lows and shipping volume in the Baltic index at the lowest point in history stands to benefit The rapid deterioration in Navios net income was something that completely sideswiped me so this time I wanted to make sure I made more of an effort to talk about potential problems that could show up here One is the very real possibility of more dividend cuts Investment Pancake did an excellent job of explaining the situation recently We have to speculate a little bit on what the year end results will be for Navios and make a guess based on that about what dividends could do The good news is for the first quarters of Navios had positive net income It was down from years previous down a lot in fact dropping by nearly half from the year prior In the st quarter of Navios had net income exceeding million but in the rd quarter of it was down to million If we assume that the th quarter is at least as bad as the rd its probably worse then there is a strong argument that the company would close the year at somewhere around million in net income Even at half the distributions of the year before thats more than million in dividends They cant pay that without raising cash somewhere else and with the share price way down selling more shares to make up the difference would be severely dilutive Lets take a worst case scenario and try to find a bottom here So if we cut the dividend to a point where its under net income then it could be somewhere around half of where it is today That would be an annual distribution of about centsshare You know thats not so bad actually you catch a yield moving forward on todays closing price of share If the dividend is not cut you catch a yield but lets not hold our breaths for that Like Pancake said management can commit to the dividends all they want to but their actions in the past have shown that they cant be trusted when times get hard I think that the current selling price is below where I would consider this investment safe Navios doesnt really carry a lot of long term debt relative to the value of its fleet but if the fleet value should continue to get marked down that could be a real problem for them Anytime supply is in demand prices will rise It doesnt even matter if it is just Navios or a competitor like Safe Bulkers SB or Diana Shipping DSX <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>coming in and striking contracts means that somebody is getting that business and it will stabilize the prices for everyone assuming that there arent a lot of new ships continuing to be manufactured I personally have no idea where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>might be getting the money for leasing ships or airplanes or even the trucks they bought recently but for now that isnt something to be concerned about Apparently they think that they have some Maybe they added to their longterm debt some more who knows Well have to wait for Amazons end of year results to punish them for that but in the meantime it makes some sense to buy some shipping companies for a speculative play Navios is damaged goods Im sorry to say that In spite of the bearish tone of what Im saying I think there is upside from here So Im buying I think you should also buy Ill give a price target here of share I think were at a point where if future results dont start to improve they probably arent going to get much worse Although theres been a big price drop to today telling you to sell now doesnt make a lot of sense after the fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a glut of problems of their own Even at less now I continue to rate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>a strong sell Just because the operation they run is amazing doesnt mean I think you should pay a huge premium for it The fact that they are leasing jets and tankers instead of buying them outright like they did with those trucks says that worldwide domination is not quite in the cards for them right now There is also an ongoing concern about whether the IRS might come after them for more taxes You should take that seriously as the companys amazing growth could very well be due to the fact that their competitors have had to give more of their cash to the government in the past If so those competitors have good reason to be upset and would be watching <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>like a hawk You have a potential pair trade here Sell <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and go long on Navios However if Navios by itself feels too risky for you get a mutual fund instead The DMS Baltic Index fund DBIAX will help you spread out that risk a bit The price is also depressed but buying low is the goal Can it get lower Well anything is possible of course but dont be Chicken Little These shipping companies in spite of lower contracted rates are still turning a profit and that is meaningful </div></body></html>
