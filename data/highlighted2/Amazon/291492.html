( NYSE : NMM ) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure : I am/we are long NMM . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .  (Surprise) </span>I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is getting into the water with the freighter business . The components of the Baltic Dry Shipping index are at all-time historic lows.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I should <b>probably</b> preface this article with the fact that I am not a fan of the current price of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( AMZN ) shares . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>I had a very bearish article out just before Christmas that pretty much laid out the reasons that the stock price was due to come down.Even after coming down $100/share I don't think we're done.However , I do think that today 's news about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> getting into the ocean freight business was interesting for several reasons . Not the least of which is, I own shares of Navios Maritime Partners ( NMM ), one of the holdings that make up the Baltic Dry Shipping Index.And, I am sorry to report to you, I am down big time on that holding.In spite of cost averaging on the decline, I'm still at a paper loss of over -46%.That's extra embarrassing because I wrote about them before too , not long before the dividend was cut in half.The stock price as a whole has come down over 80% since then.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although , it seems that today 's price action <b>might</b> indicate that other people are thinking what I am thinking .  (Uncertainty) </span>Navios closed up over 11% today.The details about the operation are still extremely fuzzy.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I tried to snoop other news sites to try to find out <i>more</i> about the deal , but what I can only say with some certainty is that the part of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> that services Chinese customers has acquired some licenses to do ... something with large shipping vessels for their customers on that side of the world . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It does n't <b>appear</b> to read as though <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is getting into the shipping business themselves , but rather that they seek to lease the services of those companies that already are in that business . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Navios, having leasing rates being at multiyear lows, and shipping volume in the Baltic index at the lowest point in history, stands to benefit.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The rapid deterioration in Navios ' net income was something that completely sideswiped me , so this time I wanted to make sure I made <i>more</i> of an effort to talk about potential problems that <b>could</b> show up here .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>One is the very real <b>possibility</b> of <i>more</i> dividend cuts .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Investment Pancake did an excellent job of explaining the situation recently.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We have to speculate a little bit on what the year end results will be for Navios , and make a guess based on that about what dividends <b>could</b> do .  (Uncertainty) </span>The good news is, for the first 3 quarters of 2015, Navios had positive net income.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It was down from years previous , down a lot in fact , dropping by <b>nearly</b> half from the year prior .  (Uncertainty) </span>In the 1st quarter of 2014, Navios had net income exceeding $18.36 million, but in the 3rd quarter of 2015, it was down to $11.8 million.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If we assume that the 4th quarter is at least as bad as the 3rd ( it 's probably <i>worse</i> ) , then there is a strong argument that the company would close the year at <b>somewhere</b> around $ 40 million in net income .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even at half the distributions of the year before , that 's <i>more</i> than $ 69 million in dividends .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>They ca n't pay that without raising cash <b>somewhere</b> else , and with the share price way down , selling <i>more</i> shares to make up the difference would be severely dilutive .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Let's take a worst case scenario, and try to find a bottom here.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So if we cut the dividend to a point where it 's under net income , then it could be <b>somewhere</b> around half of where it is today .  (Uncertainty) </span>That would be an annual distribution of about 43 cents/share.You know, that's not so bad actually, you catch a 20% yield moving forward on today's closing price of $1.98/share.If the dividend is not cut, you catch a 40% yield, but let's not hold our breaths for that.Like Pancake said, management can "commit" to the dividends all they want to, but their actions in the past have shown that they can't be trusted when times get hard.I think that the current selling price is below where I would consider this investment safe.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Navios does n't really carry a lot of long term debt relative to the value of its fleet , but if the fleet value should continue to get marked down , that <b>could</b> be a real problem for them .  (Uncertainty) </span>Anytime supply is in demand, prices will rise.It doesn't even matter if it is just Navios, or a competitor like Safe Bulkers ( SB ), or Diana Shipping ( DSX ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> coming in and striking contracts means that somebody is getting that business , and it will stabilize the prices for everyone , <b>assuming</b> that there are n't a lot of new ships continuing to be manufactured . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I personally have no idea where <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>might</b> be getting the money for leasing ships , or airplanes , or even the trucks they bought recently , but for now that is n't something to be concerned about . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Apparently</b> they think that they have some .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Maybe</b> they added to their long-term debt some <i>more</i> , who knows .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We 'll have to wait for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's end of year results to punish them for that , but in the meantime , it makes some sense to buy some shipping companies for a <b>speculative</b> play . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Navios is damaged goods, I'm sorry to say that.In spite of the bearish tone of what I'm saying, I think there is upside from here.So I'm buying.I think you should also buy.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I 'll give a price target here of $ 3/share , I think we 're at a point where if future results do n't start to improve , they <b>probably</b> are n't going to get much <i>worse</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Although there's been a big price drop to today, telling you to sell now doesn't make a lot of sense after the fact.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has a glut of problems of their own . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even at $ 100 <i>less</i> now , I continue to rate <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> a strong sell . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Just because the operation they run is <b>amazing</b> , does n't mean I think you should pay a huge premium for it .  (Surprise) </span>The fact that they are leasing jets and tankers instead of buying them outright like they did with those trucks, says that worldwide domination is not quite in the cards for them right now.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>There is also an ongoing concern about whether the IRS <b>might</b> come after them for <i>more</i> taxes .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>You should take that seriously , as the company 's <b>amazing</b> growth <b>could</b> very well be due to the fact that their competitors have had to give <i>more</i> of their cash to the government in the past .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>If so , those competitors have good reason to be upset and would be watching <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> like a hawk . You have a potential pair trade here.Sell <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and go long on Navios . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , if Navios by itself feels too <b>risky</b> for you , get a mutual fund instead .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The DMS Baltic Index fund ( DBIAX ) will help you spread out that <b>risk</b> a bit .  (Uncertainty) </span>The price is also depressed, but buying low is the goal.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Can it get <i>lower</i> ?  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Well anything is <b>possible</b> , of course , but do n't be `` Chicken Little '' .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>These shipping companies , in spite of <i>lower</i> contracted rates are still turning a profit , and that is meaningful .  (Surprise) </span></div></body></html>
