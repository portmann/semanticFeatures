(NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha Wal-Mart looking to revenue increase during transition, at expense of earnings decrease.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Long-term employee cost upswing <b>could</b> hurt company .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There is a retail price war upon us already - it 'll get <i>worse</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are a lot of things to be concerned about the actions Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) is taking to turn things around , which on the competitive level , is primarily aimed at the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) juggernaut , as it continues to roll out a <b>variety</b> of products and services which have essentially , left Wal-Mart in the dust . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>One of the most important, which is being underreported on, is the long-term effect the increase in employee wages will have on the performance of the giant retailer.It has given them a nice little public relations boost , but it has ominous implications if its investment in other areas to combat <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and other competitors , do n't pan out . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Under that scenario it 'll be left with <i>higher</i> costs of doing business for the long term , getting little or nothing for its significant investment in other areas .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Taking all things into account , it <b>appears</b> Wal-Mart has decided to go all out to generate revenue at the expense of earnings over the next few years , and that tells me it 's going to engage in a price war which will have serious implications in the retail industry , and for Wal-Mart itself .  (Uncertainty) </span>At the periphery , it looks like moving to increase revenue is a good move , as it 's something <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has been doing for years , with little concern during that time as to the overall impact it has on earnings . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> still engages in that practice to this day . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Investors in general do n't mind because they <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can at any time turn up the spigot and generate earnings if it chooses . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Wal-Mart does n't have that luxury , which is why in an economic downturn , which is coming , its new strategy <b>could</b> and will likely backfire .  (Uncertainty) </span>U.S. consumers now hold a record $3.7 billion in debt, with a growing number of defaults on student loans and credit card debt.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Auto loans are also a <b>risk</b> because many of them have been offered for <i>longer</i> periods of time in order for buyers to qualify for financing .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What this implies is American consumers are reaching the upper limit on how much they can borrow , and if the economy slows , which it already shows signs of doing , a high percentage of defaults will shake the markets .  (Uncertainty) </span>That means consumers will start to prioritize spending, and gravitate primarily toward staples rather than things they want.What has yet to be determined because of the record amount of consumer debt, is how much that will cut consumer spending.We've simply never traveled this road before economically, so there's no past pattern to base projections on.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the past , Wal-Mart has benefited from these economic slowdowns , but with it boosting wages and increasing investment , as the economy slows down , its prior margin and price advantage <b>may</b> no longer be the catalyst it has been historically .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>That means not only earnings and margin will be under pressure , but it <b>could</b> <b>disappoint</b> on revenue .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If that 's how it plays out , it will crush the share price of the company much <i>worse</i> than it is now .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Wal-Mart <b>may</b> have received some positive press over its decision to boost wages at the company over the next couple of years .  (Uncertainty) </span>The minimum pay now is $9 an hour, and will jump to $10 an hour in 2016.According to CEO Doug McMillon , the increase in wages and training will account for about 75 percent of the projected 6 percent to 12 percent decline in earnings.On the other hand, he says in fiscal 2019, earnings per share will reverse direction and climb in a range of 5 percent to 10 percent.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>hope</b> you see the issue from these numbers .  (Uncertainty) </span>How is Wal-Mart going to mitigate the significant increase in annual expenses with the projected increase in earnings in 2019?<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Either the company <b>believes</b> the investment will allow it to raise prices because of perceived <i>higher</i> value , expenditures in other areas will be <i>lower</i> than over the next couple of years , or it 'll be forced to lay off employees .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>With the earnings decline estimates being 75 percent wage-related, the idea of Wal-Mart being able to turn that around to jump to 5 to 10 percent in 2019, is a stretch to me.It means even while the wage increases will remain an expense, it will be able to increase margin in a few years.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I do n't <b>believe</b> <i>lower</i> CapEx will be enough to overcome the excessive increase in wages , and I do n't <b>believe</b> consumers looking for low prices will be willing to shop at Wal-Mart because they feel better about it now .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Either the company will make some type of significant increase in efficiencies, or it's going to lay off a ton of workers.My guess is the latter.That will be especially true as the U.S. economy weakens.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That 's why I <b>believe</b> Wal-Mart has made a big mistake by capitulating to pressure from some special interests in regard to wages .  (Uncertainty) </span>It doesn't matter where one stands on the wage battle Wal-Mart has been in for many years, from an investment point of view, as it's willingness to keep costs low has been one of the reasons it has been able to compete on the retail level in the way it has.My concern going forward is now that Wal-Mart has caved, it communicates to me it will cave again.How is that a way to run a company?What will the next compromise entail, and how will it impact shareholders?These questions are very legitimate, and the effect on the bottom line for sure, will be detrimental for years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It would be different if Wal-Mart was forced to make these wage increases because of competitive pressures , as that 's a legitimate response to market forces .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But when it succumbed to social pressure , it lowers its value in my eyes because it has now become <b>unpredictable</b> as to its will to resist outsiders with an agenda .  (Uncertainty) </span>To me, this is by far the most negative outcome of its new strategy, which in the case of increased, long-term wage inflation isn't based upon market forces, but special interest forces.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That we are already in a retail price war is indisputable , as Wal-Mart has for some time already decreased prices on what <b>appears</b> to be a very long-term basis .  (Uncertainty) </span>This will accelerate in the holiday shopping season, as retailers battle it out to retain market share.For that reason, many retailers are going to take a big earnings hit for the rest of 2015, and it remains to be seen, under Wal-Mart's new strategy, if it continues on into 2016.One thing to take into consideration here is Wal-Mart no longer has anything to lose on the pricing side over the next several years.It has already lowered the bar on its earnings, and it's being priced into its share price now.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That means its competitors will be forced to follow if they want to retain market share , putting downward pressure on their earnings .  (Uncertainty) </span>From that point of view, it's a good strategy by Wal-Mart, as it'll take the majority of the retail industry down to its margin and earnings level while it's going through it transition.I think <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will be able to compete during this time , as it has been operating under this strategy for years . But for many other of Wal-Mart's competitors, this is going to be a painful period of time.What will happen is retailers will be forced to respond to Wal-Mart's aggressive price cuts, resulting in them not having much of a bottom line advantage over Wal-Mart.In the eyes of consumers, and some investors, this will look like the playing field is being leveled, because in fact, that is what Wal-Mart will attempt to do on the earnings side over the next several years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>could</b> be a long-term price war .  (Uncertainty) </span>Retail in the U.S. is about to quickly change.Wal-Mart , being eaten away by e-commerce in general , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> specifically , has had to respond or become another one of many retail franchises that have disappeared from the landscape . On the tech side some of the expenditures, which are long overdue, are good ones, such as moving toward its physical stores being places people ordering on line can pick up items.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That <b>could</b> be an advantage if consumers do n't mind that inconvenience in order to get their products on the same day .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has <b>anticipated</b> that move , which is why it 's working hard to implement a same-day delivery policy of its own . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Where I see the <b>risk</b> is in the long-term wage costs , and in Wal-Mart caving in to special interest groups , rather than make decisions based on market conditions .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>may</b> be the most negative outcome if it starts to be controlled by those knowing how to ramp up pressure on the company .  (Uncertainty) </span>Don't make any mistake here, this is Wal-Mart's big move.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If it fails here , we 'll see it gradually diminish into yesterday 's narrative , as competitors take the lead in retail because Wal-Mart is n't able to increase earnings , and <i>worse</i> , not increase revenue .
