decrease Longterm employee cost upswing could hurt company There is a retail price war upon us already itll get worse There are a lot of things to be concerned about the actions WalMart NYSE WMT is taking to turn things around which on the competitive level is primarily aimed at the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN juggernaut as it continues to roll out a variety of products and services which have essentially left WalMart in the dust One of the most important which is being underreported on is the longterm effect the increase in employee wages will have on the performance of the giant retailer It has given them a nice little public relations boost but it has ominous implications if its investment in other areas to combat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and other competitors dont pan out Under that scenario itll be left with higher costs of doing business for the long term getting little or nothing for its significant investment in other areas Taking all things into account it appears WalMart has decided to go all out to generate revenue at the expense of earnings over the next few years and that tells me its going to engage in a price war which will have serious implications in the retail industry and for WalMart itself At the periphery it looks like moving to increase revenue is a good move as its something <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been doing for years with little concern during that time as to the overall impact it has on earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>still engages in that practice to this day Investors in general dont mind because they believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can at any time turn up the spigot and generate earnings if it chooses WalMart doesnt have that luxury which is why in an economic downturn which is coming its new strategy could and will likely backfire US consumers now hold a record billion in debt with a growing number of defaults on student loans and credit card debt Auto loans are also a risk because many of them have been offered for longer periods of time in order for buyers to qualify for financing What this implies is American consumers are reaching the upper limit on how much they can borrow and if the economy slows which it already shows signs of doing a high percentage of defaults will shake the markets That means consumers will start to prioritize spending and gravitate primarily toward staples rather than things they want What has yet to be determined because of the record amount of consumer debt is how much that will cut consumer spending Weve simply never traveled this road before economically so theres no past pattern to base projections on In the past WalMart has benefited from these economic slowdowns but with it boosting wages and increasing investment as the economy slows down its prior margin and price advantage may no longer be the catalyst it has been historically That means not only earnings and margin will be under pressure but it could disappoint on revenue If thats how it plays out it will crush the share price of the company much worse than it is now WalMart may have received some positive press over its decision to boost wages at the company over the next couple of years The minimum pay now is an hour and will jump to an hour in According to CEO Doug McMillon the increase in wages and training will account for about percent of the projected percent to percent decline in earnings On the other hand he says in fiscal earnings per share will reverse direction and climb in a range of percent to percent I hope you see the issue from these numbers How is WalMart going to mitigate the significant increase in annual expenses with the projected increase in earnings in Either the company believes the investment will allow it to raise prices because of perceived higher value expenditures in other areas will be lower than over the next couple of years or itll be forced to lay off employees With the earnings decline estimates being percent wagerelated the idea of WalMart being able to turn that around to jump to to percent in is a stretch to me It means even while the wage increases will remain an expense it will be able to increase margin in a few years I dont believe lower CapEx will be enough to overcome the excessive increase in wages and I dont believe consumers looking for low prices will be willing to shop at WalMart because they feel better about it now Either the company will make some type of significant increase in efficiencies or its going to lay off a ton of workers My guess is the latter That will be especially true as the US economy weakens Thats why I believe WalMart has made a big mistake by capitulating to pressure from some special interests in regard to wages It doesnt matter where one stands on the wage battle WalMart has been in for many years from an investment point of view as its willingness to keep costs low has been one of the reasons it has been able to compete on the retail level in the way it has My concern going forward is now that WalMart has caved it communicates to me it will cave again How is that a way to run a company What will the next compromise entail and how will it impact shareholders These questions are very legitimate and the effect on the bottom line for sure will be detrimental for years It would be different if WalMart was forced to make these wage increases because of competitive pressures as thats a legitimate response to market forces But when it succumbed to social pressure it lowers its value in my eyes because it has now become unpredictable as to its will to resist outsiders with an agenda To me this is by far the most negative outcome of its new strategy which in the case of increased longterm wage inflation isnt based upon market forces but special interest forces That we are already in a retail price war is indisputable as WalMart has for some time already decreased prices on what appears to be a very longterm basis This will accelerate in the holiday shopping season as retailers battle it out to retain market share For that reason many retailers are going to take a big earnings hit for the rest of and it remains to be seen under WalMarts new strategy if it continues on into One thing to take into consideration here is WalMart no longer has anything to lose on the pricing side over the next several years It has already lowered the bar on its earnings and its being priced into its share price now That means its competitors will be forced to follow if they want to retain market share putting downward pressure on their earnings From that point of view its a good strategy by WalMart as itll take the majority of the retail industry down to its margin and earnings level while its going through it transition I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will be able to compete during this time as it has been operating under this strategy for years But for many other of WalMarts competitors this is going to be a painful period of time What will happen is retailers will be forced to respond to WalMarts aggressive price cuts resulting in them not having much of a bottom line advantage over WalMart In the eyes of consumers and some investors this will look like the playing field is being leveled because in fact that is what WalMart will attempt to do on the earnings side over the next several years This could be a longterm price war Retail in the US is about to quickly change WalMart being eaten away by ecommerce in general and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>specifically has had to respond or become another one of many retail franchises that have disappeared from the landscape On the tech side some of the expenditures which are long overdue are good ones such as moving toward its physical stores being places people ordering on line can pick up items That could be an advantage if consumers dont mind that inconvenience in order to get their products on the same day <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has anticipated that move which is why its working hard to implement a sameday delivery policy of its own Where I see the risk is in the longterm wage costs and in WalMart caving in to special interest groups rather than make decisions based on market conditions This may be the most negative outcome if it starts to be controlled by those knowing how to ramp up pressure on the company Dont make any mistake here this is WalMarts big move If it fails here well see it gradually diminish into yesterdays narrative as competitors take the lead in retail because WalMart isnt able to increase
