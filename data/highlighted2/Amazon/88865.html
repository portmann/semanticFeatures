Reasons <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Is Getting Aggressive With Its Gaming Strategy Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha The motive behind <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>hiring to build out its gaming business Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is opening up a new demographic front There has been a lot of chatter since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN let it be known it was taking its gaming strategy to another level announcing it had hired a number of prominent game designers for that purpose Heading up the unit will be wellrespected Mike Fazzini who was installed as vice president of the gaming division last year and was the director of the group before that He was one of those pushing strongly for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to acquire Twitch The obvious question is this Why is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>showing such a strong commitment to upping the ante in this particular market What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>must do via its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Game Studios it to gain mindshare with gamers That suggests it either has to produce a big winner to build the brand or provide a platform featuring numerous games which will leverage it across different demographics Its probable the company may attempt to do both But for reasons Ill show you I think its primarily the gaming platform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is looking to build out over the longer term For some time Ive been saying almost everything <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does will be associated in some way with its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime service which when consumers subscribe to they end up paying on the upper side of the percent to percent range above regular <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>customers No matter how the gaming strategy is implemented theres no doubt the end game will be to enhance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime I say that because its possible <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may attempt in the beginning of this aggressive move to hit an individual gaming home run in order to boost its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Game Studios brand Thats not necessarily a surety but it is a strong possibility It may start that way but I see no reason why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would attempt to build out its gaming brand without it tying directly into its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime service After all it could get a nice boost from an individual game hit but that would pale in comparison to what it would mean in revenue and potential earnings if it was offered solely to its Prime members Investors should look at how all this plays into its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime strategy as thats the real key to the longterm success of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Thats how everything <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does should be analyzed So how does adding games to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime help the company with its core business Thats easy It adds even more value to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime which makes it even more sticky to those wanting to pay for its service If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can continue to expand and retain its Prime members it has the potential to offer to shareholders the profitability that it hasnt been able to offer Eventually <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>must go beyond the scale and potential stage and start to generate sustainable earnings If it doesnt I think it could take a big hit that it will have difficulty recovering from The next recession would be the catalyst for that Every time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>adds more to its Prime membership it boosts the value in the eyes of its members which not only lowers churn but increases wordofmouth interaction thats so vital to grow a business in the Internet age In the case of gaming it also has the potential to reach a demographic that could open up a new growth spurt for Prime When talking of reaching a new demographic in a much larger way meaning the young male demo there are a couple of things to consider First well have to see how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>moves forward with gaming Will it look at retaining Prime members even further in order to lower churn If so I would look at a more casual gaming initiative in order to keep its female Prime members If its looking in the beginning to reach the young male demo well see games that will reflect that strategy Over time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will institute both of these strategies My thought is it may attack the young male demo in the beginning in order to maintain the marketing momentum Not too many will be overly excited if casual games are where this new strategy starts That would take a lot of air out of the excitement garnered in the early stages of the campaign I also dont see major game design personalities being attracted to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in order to launch casual games Again over the long haul thats a certainty Over the shorter term though something that will generate interest among young males has to be the way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>approaches this If not it will be a big disappointment in my mind All of the abovementioned elements combine to make the final important part of its gaming strategy which is to allow the company to raise its Prime prices when it needs to The latest price boost to annually was mostly a defensive measure because of the high costs associated with shipping I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>must and is taking steps to bring a more offensive strategy to bear on Prime in order to create value so strong the majority of members wont hesitate to pay more when the company puts a price increase in place I think of cable and satellite companies in this regard which havent been considered to have added value to their customers as they continue to raise subscription prices Pricing power is the key to identifying whether or not a company has gone beyond the commodity business stage to becoming a company with a defensible moat The last increase in subscription prices for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime was successful and showed at least at that price point customers felt the cost was in line with the value they received from it The next price increase will be more challenging and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is obviously preparing for that moment by continually adding products and services to ensure there isnt a disastrous backlash If it can continue to raise prices over time it will prove it has in fact moved into a place where its customers believe it offers strong value for the price Interestingly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>recently entered into an agreement with GameFly a video game rental company to offer what it calls game packs which a user can subscribe to individually rather than the flat rate offered by gaming competitors Itll be interesting to see if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>offers something similar with its new games via its Prime service A lot of the focus on the recent announcement by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>that it is looking for game developers while parading out some of those that have joined there team has been on the company producing a highquality and popular PC game I dont think thats close to the real reason for this happening as mentioned above <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is creating a complex ecosystem where the majority of its initiatives center around adding value to its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime service That includes its cloud business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services and of course Twitch which offers broadcasts of video games being played Im not saying there may not be some secondary business built out as a result of success with games but again it pales in comparison of the value of growing and retaining its customer base for Prime membership If its able to successfully attract a significant number of young males to its Prime service it would really be a game changer in my opinion as it opens up huge opportunities that it hasnt had in the past It may offer some of these as a loss leader to let potential customers know about the games and service but I believe a lot of this will be placed behind the wall of its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime service which if successful will bring it to an entirely new level This is what is exciting and has potential for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>concerning investors I cant emphasize enough that everything <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does should be looked at through the spectrum of its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime service It may not always be apparent how it may fit in but there is a surety there will be some connection
