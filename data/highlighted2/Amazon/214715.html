(Surprise) </span>I recently wrote an article on my opinion of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) as a DGI.This was before the Q1 results.It provided a detailed overview of all things Microsoft.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you are a new investor looking to buy shares of the company , I would recommend starting there .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I determined that the shares were worth <b>roughly</b> $ 40 .  (Uncertainty) </span>I got a lot of feedback in the comment section for the article (and the Q1 reporting details), and I wanted to provide an update.There are going to be a lot of news outlets and other writers here on SA who can provide you with a write-up on the various aspects of year-over-year performance in various categories of the business as defined by Microsoft and reporting in Q1 earnings.I will let you read those if you want to know about Q1.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>What I am <i>more</i> concerned about is a core question that any investor should ask relative to the company that he or she is invested in or is considering investing in : How does company X make money ?  (Surprise) </span>Microsoft is interesting, because we all like to point out areas of success and failure that we know and that we are comfortable with without noting where all the money comes from each quarter.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>What is a little <i>harder</i> is taking the step back and trying to learn about the things that we do not see everyday .  (Surprise) </span>That is the area that is key to Microsoft.We all know about Xbox.We know about the failure of Windows phone.The Surface has been huge recently.Taking a step back, do those products even matter to the future success of Microsoft at growing EPS?That is what I want to answer in this article.Before we dig into how Microsoft makes money, we have to do a little refresher on the changes going on at the company and its recognition of revenue.This is going to be the boring part of the article, and I want to remind folks that I am not a CPA.Microsoft is transitioning both Office and Windows products and their respective revenues to a service logic.Historically, a consumer or business would buy a license for Office/Windows for $100 in year 1 Q1.That $100 would be recorded in the quarter that it was earned.The consumer would use the product from year 1 Q2 and year 3 Q4, and Microsoft would not recognize revenue from it.That is how accounting works when you sell a product.When you sell a service, things are a bit different.Instead of accepting $100 in year 1, you spread out that revenue over multiple years.Microsoft estimates the life of the service and spreads revenue over that life.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the estimate were $ 100 over 3 years , then the company would account revenue as $ 33 in year 1 , with a line item of unrealized revenue of $ 67 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The next year it recognizes $ 33 <i>more</i> and reduces the Service Revenue Unrealized .  (Surprise) </span>(Source: April 2015 Financial Analyst Briefing) Why is this important?If you look at what happens in year 1, revenue in a product model is $100, and in a service model it is only $33.When you are comparing year-over-year numbers, you will think that revenue declined by 66%.When in actuality, the revenue is the same - it is just being accounted for differently.This does have the advantage of smoothing out earnings over time.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>No <i>longer</i> will you see a one-time bump in revenue from a new launch of Office or Windows .  (Surprise) </span>Instead, you will see a nice smooth level of revenue each quarter that will subtly move around with each additional subscriber.As customers transition from product ownership to services, you will see revenue recorded a bit differently at Microsoft.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For <b>confusion</b> , the company reports the revenue in different categories - just to add to the fun !  (Uncertainty) </span>Also think of it in terms of what this does for the sales team.Which would you rather spend - $33/year or $100 up-front?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>lower</i> price point gets you in the door of the CIO a lot <i>easier</i> than a multi-million dollar cost upgrade for the latest version of Excel .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The value proposition of a subscription model is a little <i>more</i> attractive - <i>lower</i> cost up-front , and always up-to-date software .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It takes one <i>more</i> decision off the table .  (Surprise) </span>So, Where Do Microsoft's Earnings Come From?Now that the account fun is over, let's dig into the meat of the article.Microsoft breaks down its revenue in various categories for investors' understanding.There are a total of 7 categories that it uses in each quarterly/annual report.Here is what the breakdown looks like for margin dollars from 2013 to 2015.This is done very specifically without category labels or value lines.The thing that is important to remember is to focus on only what matters most.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If this were your business , would spend the time looking at Group 6 ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If someone told you revenue was down 99 % in Group 6 , would you care ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Should you care?My thinking is that you should not.Instead, let's spend 99% of our time understanding the drivers of the big categories of earnings.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When you look at revenue this way , there are two categories that stick out ( <b>hopefully</b> ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>might</b> have also given you a hint from the way that I laid out the chart .  (Uncertainty) </span>Group 1 and Group 2 are where Microsoft makes the majority of its money.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In fact , in 2015 , those two accounted for <b>almost</b> 60 % of earnings .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In previous years , it was <i>more</i> : 2014 was 71 % , 2013 was 76 % .  (Surprise) </span>Now, we are seeing a trend.The only other thing I would note is that you see a spike happening in Group 3.It has gone from 7.3% of Microsoft earnings in 2013 to 11.4% in 2015.That is important when we look at what these three groups are made up of.It is also important to remember the section above on accounting.I mentioned that the company reports service revenue in a different category from product revenue.This is some of the goofiness that happens from that.Commercial Licensing: This is Office, Windows on a volume licensing agreement to Businesses, Governments, Universities, etc.Devices and Consumer Licensing: This is licensing for computers that are not on volume purchases.This is where revenue hits when you walk into Best Buy and purchase a Windows desktop computer.Commercial Other: Commercial is broken down in Licensing and Other.This is all other revenue that comes from non-consumer, business customers.This includes the growth areas that we as investors want to watch.This is Commercial Cloud.This is Commercial Office 365.Group 1: Commercial Licensing / Group 3: Commercial Other I am going to lump Group 1 and Group 3 together.This makes up Commercial reporting.As mentioned above, Group 1 is volume licensing of Windows, Office and other corporate purchases.Group 3 is anything else that is sold to corporations - most importantly for comparison, Commercial Office 365.I point this out because you see a little dip in Group 1 and a spike in Group 3.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you remember from the accounting section above , I mentioned that Microsoft reports Product Sales and Service Sales in different categories .  (Uncertainty) </span>Historically, Commercial Office Product sales would be part of Group 1.Going forward, Commercial Office Service sales are in Group 3.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Looking at these two groups together makes sense when comparing <i>longer</i> trends .  (Surprise) </span>So why focus on this group?This is the big dog in the fight.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>What happens in this category is what directly impacts the performance of Microsoft <i>more</i> than any of the other categories .  (Surprise) </span>It is also the piece that is under attack.When you and I go out and walk into a Best Buy to buy a desktop computer (sounds antiquated to think of people actually walking into a store to buy a PC) or order one from the HP (NYSE: HPQ ) website, the revenue Microsoft receives falls here.What do we know about Group 2?People are not buying as many PCs.Shipments are down.OEMs are working hard to create new devices, but it is not getting through to the consumer as well as it did many years ago.Instead, individuals are increasingly looking at some of the consumer products from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) or Alphabet's (Google's parent company) ( GOOG , GOOGL ) low-priced Chromebooks.The other thing to keep in mind is that this group historically contained licensing revenue from Windows Phone to Nokia.When Microsoft buys Nokia, the revenue associated with licensing software to Nokia goes away.This all makes logical sense.What does Microsoft do strategically?It attempts to revitalize the category by making new products that create a desire for Windows software through Microsoft hardware.So, while producing Surface Pro means a hit to the margin and huge R&D costs, it is necessary to attract the attention of consumers.The funny thing about the tech world, in my view, is that each of the companies in the circle has a core competency.Their competitors are each trying to win that group over, but each has historically failed.For example, Microsoft is great at Office and it is great at selling to corporations.As we saw above, the company is doing great at making money off those relationships, and has done so for years.This makes up the majority of its business.So, what do Alphabet and Apple do - they go after those markets.Alphabet is recently trying to win people away from Office to Google Docs.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With its partnership with IBM Corp. ( NYSE : IBM ) , Apple is trying to push to get into <i>more</i> corporations with Mac and iPad .  (Surprise) </span>All of that is interesting, but Microsoft is still the king of Corporations.This remains a small piece of the pie for the other two.On the other side, Alphabet is great at Search.What did Microsoft do?It made Bing.Bing is cool.It is another option that mimics the functionality of Google.The company is trying pretty hard with things like Bing Rewards (you get points for your searches, which then translate into items like gift cards).But in the end, it doesn't account for a whole lot.All of that is interesting, but Alphabet is still the king of Search.It remains a small piece of the pie for Microsoft.Last, there is Apple.It has its phone.The company makes a lot of money off selling those phones.So what do the other two do?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They try and make phones - one of them <i>more</i> successful than the other .  (Surprise) </span>Alphabet giving away its Android system, which means that Android revenue is small.Microsoft pretty much had a disaster with Nokia and the Windows Phone program.All of that is interesting, but Apple is still the king of Phones.It remains a small piece of the pie for Microsoft and Alphabet.What results is this - each is spectacular at one thing and spends a lot of time trying to win over customers in the other categories in which the competitors are currently king.When looking at the potential of the organization to grow its revenue, it is important to focus on where that organization makes its money, and not on what is flashy.It is easy to beat down Microsoft for failing at phones.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Had it adopted mobile <i>earlier</i> and done a <i>better</i> job , who knows , it <b>could</b> have been huge and something that I would be writing about today .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>But it did not.We are left with a Microsoft that makes money from licensing Office, Servers and Windows primarily to corporations and secondarily to us little people.How it converts those customers into a growing revenue stream is what matters.Everything else is just noise.First, as a DGI, I must point out that Microsoft's dividend went up from $0.31 to $0.36.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That is a solid 16 % raise that was announced <i>earlier</i> in the quarter !  (Surprise) </span>Still, seeing it in writing is always nice.The company released two sets of numbers.The GAAP numbers represent the accounting adjustments I mentioned above.The non-GAAP, "financial results exclude the deferral and recognition of revenue primarily related to Windows 10."It even provided the table below to help those of us who are not CPAs.Microsoft reported EPS growth of 5% to 0.58 per share in Q1.That is all I am going to cover in the generic readout of its performance.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Let 's dig into the components that matter : Office commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 5 % in constant currency terms , with Office 365 revenue growth of <b>nearly</b> 70 % in constant currency terms ( 66 % seat growth ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>Revenue in Intelligent Cloud grew 8% (up 14% in constant currency) to $5.9 billion.(Source: Microsoft Q1 Report / Q1 Slides) Just to throw me off, Microsoft did not release net income figures with its Q1 results.Instead, the company released Operating Income figures.The figure is different in excluding taxes and any other line item that falls outside the reported income/cost figures.(Standard figures that are included are Sales/marketing, Research and development, G&A, and impairments (i.e., write-offs).)The two numbers are close, but denote that there are some differences.So what does the update to the chart look like for Q1?You will notice that our groups went from 8 down to 4.Microsoft changed the categories that it reported from its Annual Report to its Q1 Report.Groups 1 and 3 (that I grouped together in my argument above) have been split slightly different into Productivity and Business as one group, and Intelligent Cloud as a 2nd group.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Group 2 has swallowed up the majority of the <i>tinier</i> groups that were reported above ( Group 4-6 ) .  (Surprise) </span>Note, the giant purple line on the far right is the write-off of Nokia "impairment".My Unique Take on Things - Where Does Microsoft Sit Now?I have provided a lot of background on Microsoft over this article and the previous one.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Hopefully</b> , at this point , you have a good understanding of all the things that the company does and where the money comes from for shareholders .  (Uncertainty) </span>Here is my perspective on what we want to see over the next few quarters and next few years.Windows 8 was a failure in terms of corporations.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Adoption was <b>horrible</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Alphabet and Apple have been knocking on the door pointing this out.Corporations were able to use Windows 7 with current applications just fine, so they did nothing.Instead of making a decision, corporations have been waiting on the sidelines to see how Windows 10 performs before making decisions on upgrades.Now is the time that Microsoft has to do something.Here is the big takeaway that can let you skip the next couple of paragraphs - Microsoft is in great position to continue to protect its business with corporations.How does it do that when Apple is kicking down the front door to get Macbooks on desks and Alphabet at the back door trying to get Microsoft Office kicked out for Google Docs?Let's take a step back and understand what value Windows and Office bring to corporations.First, at this point, the programs are familiar to employees.If I install Excel 2016 as a replacement to Excel 2010, I do not have to offer employees training.90% of the functionality remains the same, and 99% of efficiency remains.I can take out one system and put in another, and an employee will not notice.Second, it is already there.It is a huge effort to replace the computers of a large organization.I am talking about a wide sweeping platform change.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The US government is a great example - paying to keep support of a legacy system because it current works , and because it would cost <i>more</i> to upgrade everything else to be compliant with new systems .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is <i>easier</i> to do <i>more</i> of the same than something new .  (Surprise) </span>What is the advantage of Apple and Macbooks?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They cost <i>more</i> upfront , but they have a <i>longer</i> life .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The operating system upgrades are free , and the hardware quality is <i>better</i> than the race for price points of Windows OEMs .  (Surprise) </span>The downfall is that they are not in the hands of employees today.As people transition at home, they will learn how to use the systems, and that lowers the barrier for transitioning in the office.Microsoft needs to make sure that people keep using Windows at home.How do you do that?You make a sexy device (or have your OEMs create it) that competes directly with Macbooks.The Surface Pro 4 and Surface Books are great in that space.It is also a compelling offer that aligns with the current needs of corporations - familiar software, high-quality components that will last longer, always up-to-date, and in a similar cost category.Plus, I do not have to replace all the company computers to keep everyone on the same OS - making it work with all current systems.Microsoft doesn't need to make money on the hardware, as the revenue from licensing Windows is what it wants to protect.What are the advantages of switching to Google Docs?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is <i>cheaper</i> .  (Surprise) </span>It is in the cloud.What are the disadvantages?It is not what we use today, and that means employee training.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is where Office 365 comes in - <i>lower</i> the advertised price of Office and put it on the web .  (Surprise) </span>Microsoft is in a good position there.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Last , switching from a product revenue stream to a service revenue stream will subtly allow Microsoft to make <i>more</i> money over the long run .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It gives the company <i>greater</i> ability to raise prices over time .  (Surprise) </span>This will be a minor, but necessary, add to growth.Microsoft needs this base to be solid and consistent in order to be successful and grow EPS.Since the old guard is protected, where does growth come from?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>First , while the devices are what we feel and are attracted to , the margins in those products are not good enough for Microsoft to grow EPS in a meaningful way by selling <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> Surface Pros .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If it was the only one selling Windows computers , then there would be enough growth - <b>maybe</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>That won't happen - Microsoft cannot turn its back on the OEMs.The growth comes from the Commercial Cloud.It is the only REALISTIC thing that Microsoft offers that has the scalability and margin to impact EPS.This space is what you see HP , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , IBM , and many others fighting for . This space is going to get bloody.This space is where you will get some good M&A going over the next few years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Microsoft can be smart about where it grows in this space , then shareholders will reap the benefits .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If not , then you will see stagnant earnings over the next few years .  (Uncertainty) </span>In Q1, we saw some growth here.The trend needs to continue.Below is a chart that shows what success looks like in the future.When the Intelligent Cloud is the largest Operating Earnings division, you know the plan is working well.You can see below that it is headed the right direction.Something to keep an eye on will be the decline in revenue from Productivity and Business.This is partly from moving from product to service revenue on Office/Windows.You should see this declining trend continue throughout 2016, but start to grow in 2017 when you see true YoY comparisons.Microsoft makes money by licensing software to corporations.The company will grow revenue by its success in defending the territory it has, plus expanding the Commercial Cloud.How do you know this is important to Microsoft?It is on the first line of the quarterly report.The Commercial Cloud now has a revenue run rate of $8.2B. Q1 results were up 5%.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To warrant a <i>more</i> than 15 P/E in my books , the company needs to grow a heck of a lot <i>faster</i> .  (Surprise) </span>The Q1 results make me update my entry price.I would look to start a position around $42.Right now, the market looks to be giving Microsoft a huge premium for this quarter.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The shares are up <b>roughly</b> 7 % in after-hours trading to $ 51 .  (Uncertainty) </span>I will keep my eye on the shares to see if I can pick them up on a dip.As I am looking for a 20% decline, I do not see that happening anytime soon.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Alternatively , Microsoft could show faster-than-expected growth in Cloud revenues that <b>might</b> get me interested in starting a small position .
