(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .  (Surprise) </span>I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Competitive threats like Popcorn Time , Hulu and a <b>variety</b> of other streaming sites will likely erode future growth trend .  (Uncertainty) </span>US subscriber base fell short of management's target by a sizable figure - that's suspected to continue.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Valuation assumes a repeat growth scenario of the last three years and stable EBITDA margins of 56 % - this case <b>appears</b> unlikely .  (Uncertainty) </span>Counter to analysts who have continually increased their price targets on Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) over the last year, astute short sellers like David Einhorn and Citron Research have called Netflix a business with capped upside.David Einhorn specifically claimed that the cost structure will eventually catch up with the company and significantly erode margins over the long term.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We however think the <b>risk</b> is contained in the market share profile driven by saturation and an overall slowing growth market size .  (Uncertainty) </span>Some bulls previously echoed the idea that Netflix will steal ticket sales from movie theaters because out of pocket savings and convenience.However this has largely been debunked given that the movie theater atmosphere is largely irreplaceable.Netflix also prides itself on availability of content whenever and wherever, however this is not anything new.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Hulu , HBO and other competitors have the same appeal . While these have limited impact on Netflix's subscriber growth, we do think that erosion will intensify in the years going forward.This also does not consider expansive activity that is occurring under the scope of market share analysis such as Popcorn Time, Couchtuner and other streaming sites experiencing a growing audience.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some of these <b>hidden</b> streaming sites have access to movies and shows weeks or even months before Netflix makes them available .  (Uncertainty) </span>These sites also derive revenue growth advertisement rather than charging the customer.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Both of these attributes are two real and looming <b>risks</b> for Netflix 's subscriber retention and growth rates .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix has become a very popular brand and maintains a successful strategy.But the current trend of 24-28% revenue growth on an annual basis is likely unsustainable.That said, we are placing Netflix's service structure within the late-growth stage of its cycle.This narrative is primarily backed by the weakening US-based sub growth realized in the third quarter results.We also think that the overall growth trend is in jeopardy because the US is likely the strongest driver.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Management guided that the company would obtain approximately 1.15 million users , however this fell steeply short by <b>nearly</b> 24 % at just 880k .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While the market appears to have dismissed this alarming figure , we think that this <b>may</b> be a leading indicator for an incoming inflection point .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For the sake of argument , we are going to <b>assume</b> Netflix sales have a repeat growth phase of the last three years by adding another $ 3 billion in revenue over the next three years .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We also are <b>assuming</b> margins remain stable during this period .  (Uncertainty) </span>By the end of 2019, still utilizing a lofty EV/EBITDA multiple of 9x, does the share price only reflect $110 per share (exactly where it currently stands): While we don't think Netflix presents an outstanding short sell opportunity based on current projections, it's clearly worth avoiding given no upside opportunity exists.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While we applaud a company reaching into low-cost debt to fuel future growth , we think these levels are becoming <b>somewhat</b> concerning in addition to their growing off-balance sheet liabilities .  (Uncertainty) </span>These concerns are supported by the firm's steep decline in free cash flow: The market is currently pricing in a fairly high growth rate which does not seem repeatable over the next few years.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If we consider <i>more</i> aggressive competition , possibly <i>higher</i> costs in the operating structure and financial position uncertainty , the upside scenario does <b>appear</b> capped for this stock .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>We cannot say that Netflix is an obvious sell but it most certainly is not a buy.</div></body></html>
