While these have limited impact on Netflix's subscriber growth, we do think that erosion will intensify in the years going forward.This also does not consider expansive activity that is occurring under the scope of market share analysis such as Popcorn Time, Couchtuner and other streaming sites experiencing a growing audience.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some of these <b>hidden</b> streaming sites have access to movies and shows weeks or even months before Netflix makes them available .  (Uncertainty) </span>These sites also derive revenue growth advertisement rather than charging the customer.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Both of these attributes are two real and looming <b>risks</b> for Netflix 's subscriber retention and growth rates .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix has become a very popular brand and maintains a successful strategy.But the current trend of 24-28% revenue growth on an annual basis is likely unsustainable.That said, we are placing Netflix's service structure within the late-growth stage of its cycle.This narrative is primarily backed by the weakening US-based sub growth realized in the third quarter results.We also think that the overall growth trend is in jeopardy because the US is likely the strongest driver.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Management guided that the company would obtain approximately 1.15 million users , however this fell steeply short by <b>nearly</b> 24 % at just 880k .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While the market appears to have dismissed this alarming figure , we think that this <b>may</b> be a leading indicator for an incoming inflection point .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For the sake of argument , we are going to <b>assume</b> Netflix sales have a repeat growth phase of the last three years by adding another $ 3 billion in revenue over the next three years .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We also are <b>assuming</b> margins remain stable during this period .  (Uncertainty) </span>By the end of 2019, still utilizing a lofty EV/EBITDA multiple of 9x, does the share price only reflect $110 per share (exactly where it currently stands): While we don't think Netflix presents an outstanding short sell opportunity based on current projections, it's clearly worth avoiding given no upside opportunity exists.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While we applaud a company reaching into low-cost debt to fuel future growth , we think these levels are becoming <b>somewhat</b> concerning in addition to their growing off-balance sheet liabilities .  (Uncertainty) </span>These concerns are supported by the firm's steep decline in free cash flow: The market is currently pricing in a fairly high growth rate which does not seem repeatable over the next few years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If we consider more aggressive competition , possibly higher costs in the operating structure and financial position uncertainty , the upside scenario does <b>appear</b> capped for this stock .  (Uncertainty) </span>We cannot say that Netflix is an obvious sell but it most certainly is not a buy.</div></body></html>
