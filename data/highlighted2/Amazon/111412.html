in several countries predicting that it will be bigger than Black Friday Given the emphasis on being a Prime members only event it is more likely that it is about showcasing Prime benefits rather than selling off inventory Event in the vein of Cyber Monday and BABAs Singles Day possible sales targets billion To celebrate the companys th birthday <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN announced that July will be Prime Day an entire day of deals and savings on just about everything on the website for Prime members in several countries around the world To get people hyped up for the event <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>commissioned artists in major cities that will celebrate Prime Day to depict examples of PrimeLiving to get social media engaged Aside from being a birthday part of sorts for one of the most influential companies of the last two decades <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is hoping that the sale becomes bigger than Black Friday in terms of sales generated While the global reach could put the sales figures for July past the roughly billion average for the fiveday Thanksgiving shopping period Amazons motive seems more geared towards boosting Prime memberships than boosting sales which should also being the main focus for investors as the calendar shifts to the second half of the year Its important for onlookers to note how many times <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has stressed how Prime Day is specifically for Prime members aside from it being right in the name of the celebration While product sales are Amazons bread and butter subscriptions to the Prime service have been responsible for Amazons recent profitability According to the companys Q report a yearoveryear increase in subscriptions lead to a million profit for the company despite the price increase to year The boost in subscriptions has been helped out by new additions to the membership such as sameday delivery in select cities as well as free instant video streaming which includes original content similar to Netflix NASDAQ NFLX While profits from sales revenue may ebb and flow subscriptions provide a constant revenue stream for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>that mitigates some of the volatility the company has had in the past as well as providing a greater assurance of profitability for shareholders who have had to endure low profit margins thanks to low prices and reinvestment into core operations So how does all this factor into Prime Day Consumers can get involved in Prime Day by signing up for a free day trial of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime which in the shortterm will mean free twoday shipping for the items purchased on July making the expected deals even more affordable for those not fully in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>ecosystem For the remaining days of the free trial period these new customers will be able to experience <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Primes other features most notably its video and music streaming services With this in mind <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is likely going to use Prime Day to showcase the current and future benefits of being a subscriber especially on the heels of the news that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime has done deals with movie studios to produce original movies in addition to its existing TV offerings so that it can both increase Prime memberships to ensure greater profitability as well as to potentially close the gap with Netflix for subscribers as well as quality of content offered as well as more potential customers for its local sameday delivery networks which may take on added importance come Black Friday and Cyber Monday as more commerce goes digital during the shopping holiday While the Prime subscriptions should be the key focus for observers sales will be a key focus as well as it is for brickandmortar retailers on Black Friday Since this is a new shopping holiday though its a bit unclear what sales goal would be considered a success For this it helps to look at recent examples of cyberdriven shopping holidays from the past year namely Cyber Monday and Singles Day The first thing that sprung to this authors mind upon hearing about Prime Day was Alibabas NYSE BABA Singles Day on November the Chinese equivalent of Valentines Day Over the past few years Alibaba has worked to turn it into a major shopping holiday worldwide With over billion in sales in it would appear that it was a successful push especially in China Yet since Prime Day will not include the Chinese market it is unrealistic that it would reach such a lofty target So lets look towards a more familiar example for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and its customer base Cyber Monday The shopping holiday that likely wouldnt exist without <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has become as important as Black Friday in recent years In according to consumer group comScore Cyber Monday did billion in sales worldwide a yearoveryear increase that dispelled rumors of the waning significance of the postThanksgiving shopping rush which in total generated billion in sales last year including Cyber Monday This would suggest a BB sales range for Prime Day considering that its reach will extend outside of North America with a likely bias towards the lower end of the range which would be more than sufficient for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to show that Prime Day has a comparable impact on commerce to Black Friday What shareholders look for each time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>releases earnings is whether or not it is profitable or on the path to profitability through strong revenues across its major functions While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is playing up the sales angle for Prime Day some analysts have speculated that it might have more to do with offloading excess inventory If this is the case then one can expect low profit margins coming out of Prime Day on the sales side This means that the greater likelihood for profits and growth will come from increases in Prime subscriptions that will come from converting the trial members to full paying ones and Prime Day provides the optimal vehicle for this conversion As the services for Prime members go beyond free shipping the recent price increase from to has not had much of an effect of the willingness to subscribe and resubscribe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is clearly steering its customers towards Prime memberships as it becomes a larger component of the company particularly as Black Friday and Cyber Monday become more dependent on ecommerce Sales may be Amazons official angle but the number of new subscribers to Prime will be the most important bit of information for investors going forward Source Why Amazons Prime Day Isnt About Deals Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks
