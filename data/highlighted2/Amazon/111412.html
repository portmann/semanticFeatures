( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha AMZN announces Prime Day on July 15 to celebrate 20th birthday of company . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Will offer discounts and daily deals in several countries , <b>predicting</b> that it will be `` <i>bigger</i> than Black Friday '' .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Given the emphasis on being a Prime members only event , it is <i>more</i> likely that it is about showcasing Prime benefits rather than selling off inventory .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Event in the vein of Cyber Monday and BABA 's Singles Day , <b>possible</b> sales targets $ 2-6 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>To celebrate the company 's 20th birthday , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) announced that July 15 will be `` Prime Day '' , an entire day of deals and savings on just about everything on the website for Prime members in several countries around the world . To get people hyped up for the event , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> commissioned artists in major cities that will celebrate Prime Day to depict examples of '' #PrimeLiving '' to get social media engaged . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Aside from being a birthday part of sorts for one of the most influential companies of the last two decades , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is <b>hoping</b> that the sale becomes <i>bigger</i> than Black Friday in terms of sales generated . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While the global reach could put the sales figures for July 15 past the roughly $ 1-2 billion average for the five-day Thanksgiving shopping period , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's motive <b>seems</b> <i>more</i> geared towards boosting Prime memberships than boosting sales , which should also being the main focus for investors as the calendar shifts to the second half of the year . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It 's important for onlookers to note how many times <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has stressed how Prime Day is specifically for Prime members ( aside from it being right in the name of the celebration ) . While product sales are <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's bread and butter , subscriptions to the Prime service have been responsible for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's recent profitability . According to the company's Q4 2014 report, a 53% year-over-year increase in subscriptions lead to a $214 million profit for the company, despite the price increase to $99/year.The boost in subscriptions has been helped out by new additions to the membership such as same-day delivery in select cities as well as free instant video streaming which includes original content similar to Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ).<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While profits from sales revenue may ebb and flow , subscriptions provide a constant revenue stream for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> that mitigates some of the <b>volatility</b> the company has had in the past , as well as providing a <i>greater</i> assurance of profitability for shareholders , who have had to endure low profit margins thanks to low prices and re-investment into core operations . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>So how does all this factor into Prime Day?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Consumers can get involved in Prime Day by signing up for a free 30-day trial of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime , which in the short-term will mean free two-day shipping for the items purchased on July 15 , making the expected deals even <i>more</i> affordable for those not fully in the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ecosystem . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>For the remaining days of the free trial period , these new customers will be able to experience <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime 's other features , most notably its video and music streaming services . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With this in mind , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is likely going to use Prime Day to showcase the current and future benefits of being a subscriber , especially on the heels of the news that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime has done deals with movie studios to produce original movies in addition to its existing TV offerings , so that it can both increase Prime memberships to ensure <i>greater</i> profitability as well as to potentially close the gap with Netflix for subscribers as well as quality of content offered , as well as <i>more</i> potential customers for its local same-day delivery networks which <b>may</b> take on added importance come Black Friday and Cyber Monday as <i>more</i> commerce goes digital during the shopping holiday . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>While the Prime subscriptions should be the key focus for observers, sales will be a key focus as well, as it is for brick-and-mortar retailers on Black Friday.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Since this is a new shopping holiday , though , it 's a bit <b>unclear</b> what sales goal would be considered a success .  (Uncertainty) </span>For this, it helps to look at recent examples of cyber-driven shopping holidays from the past year, namely Cyber Monday and Singles Day.The first thing that sprung to this author's mind upon hearing about Prime Day was Alibaba's (NYSE: BABA ) Singles Day on November 11, the Chinese equivalent of Valentine's Day.Over the past few years, Alibaba has worked to turn it into a major shopping holiday worldwide.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With over $ 9 billion in sales in 2014 , it would <b>appear</b> that it was a successful push , especially in China .  (Uncertainty) </span>Yet since Prime Day will not include the Chinese market, it is unrealistic that it would reach such a lofty target.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So let 's look towards a <i>more</i> familiar example for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and its customer base : Cyber Monday . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The shopping holiday that likely would n't exist without <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has become as important as Black Friday in recent years . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In 2014 , according to consumer group comScore , Cyber Monday did $ 2.04 billion in sales worldwide , a 17 % year-over-year increase that dispelled <b>rumors</b> of the waning significance of the post-Thanksgiving shopping rush , which in total generated $ 6 billion in sales last year including Cyber Monday .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This would <b>suggest</b> a $ 2B-6B sales range for Prime Day considering that its reach will extend outside of North America , with a likely bias towards the <i>lower</i> end of the range , which would be <i>more</i> than sufficient for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to show that Prime Day has a comparable impact on commerce to Black Friday . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>What shareholders look for each time <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> releases earnings is whether or not it is profitable , or on the path to profitability through strong revenues across its major functions . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is playing up the sales angle for Prime Day , some analysts have speculated that it <b>might</b> have <i>more</i> to do with offloading excess inventory . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>If this is the case, then one can expect low profit margins coming out of Prime Day on the sales side.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This means that the <i>greater</i> likelihood for profits and growth will come from increases in Prime subscriptions that will come from converting the trial members to full paying ones , and Prime Day provides the <b>optimal</b> vehicle for this conversion .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>As the services for Prime members go beyond free shipping, the recent price increase from $79 to $99 has not had much of an effect of the willingness to subscribe and re-subscribe.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is clearly steering its customers towards Prime memberships as it becomes a <i>larger</i> component of the company , particularly as Black Friday and Cyber Monday become <i>more</i> <b>dependent</b> on e-commerce . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sales <b>may</b> be <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's official angle , but the number of new subscribers to Prime will be the most important bit of information for investors going forward .
