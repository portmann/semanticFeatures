initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Amazons shipping expenses have been rising and with the companys quest for faster delivery this variable cost is likely to rise even further Online shoppings rising popularity has resulted in a massive proliferation of packages being shipped to online shoppers This adds stress to an already congested and ageing transport network Drones could potentially introduce a solution in the longer term Early cost estimates look positive which suggests drones might have the potential to positively impact shipping expenses the Achilles heel of online retailers Please take note that this is only one aspect in weighing the attractiveness or nonattractiveness of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN as an investment and should not be used independent of other factors This piece merely explores the business side of Amazons core business of online retailing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>accounted for nearly of online spending during the holiday season from November st to December th according to research conducted by Slice Intelligence The companys share increased by basis points this year compared to last year when the online retailer captured nearly of Americans online spend during the holiday season Amazons market share is larger than the web sales

<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the largest eretailer in the United States will account for nearly onequarter of total US retail sales growth this year and over half of ecommerce growth according to Macquarie Research analysts This trend is expected to continue going forward Forrester Research projects US online retail sales to increase to of total retail sales in helped by increased spending from digitally savvy Millennials who move into their prime spending years These factors suggest a changing landscape in retailing somewhat akin to the retail disruptions that took place in the United States decades ago Sears NASDAQ SHLD profited during the last centurys retail revolution mail order by offering a wide selection to customers who had no prior access to it With the rise of the automobile WalMart capitalized from consumers increasing mobility by pioneering massive supercenters offering a wide selection to customers under one roof Today with mobile and internet technology <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is offering consumers an unprecedented selection of products However as with any evolving industry change gives rise to new challenges and one of them is shipping ie delivery of goods in a timely and costeffective manner This is particularly the case with last mile delivery which is the last stage of the delivery chain where small individual packages are delivered to customers homes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>currently relies on thirdparty delivery companies such as United Parcel Service NYSE UPS and USPS to deliver orders to customers Delivery delays during the peak holiday season is only one challenge ShipMatrix reported that ontime rates for FedEx NYSE FDX and UPS were behind compared to a year ago More important however are Amazons net shipping costs Unlike brickandmortar stores like WalMart shipping cost is a variable cost for online retailers such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>And this variable cost is a crucial determinant to completing a transaction A survey conducted by Purolator International found that of Americans and of Canadians consider the price of shipping to be extremely important when completing a purchase online A separate survey found that of consumers would cancel an order because of high shipping costs A study by ComScore and United Parcel Service echoed this notion stating that the No reason consumers abort an online purchase is when a shipping charge gets added to the total during checkout Inflation and fuel costs are only part of the reason for increased shipping costs and are not necessarily caused by rising fuel prices diesel prices have not risen since The cost increases largely stem from the development of a new kind of shipping inefficiency caused by consumers buying what they want when they want the convenience of making random purchases has resulted in a profusion of smaller lighter packages sometimes being delivered in separate shipments from different warehouses Consequently handling costs packaging costs cardboard and plastic wraps and last mile delivery costs increase which contributes to increased shipping expenses In response to this delivery companies UPS and FedEx implemented dimensional weight pricing on air shipments and large ground shipments which contributed to an increase in revenue In January last year the two delivery firms implemented dimensional weight pricing on all ground shipments which further increases shipping costs for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and all other online retailers Not only are shipping costs increasing for the aforementioned reasons but Amazons ambition to reduce delivery speeds adds additional upward pressure on shipping expenses Fast shipping already costly on its own only adds to this rising cost One of the most powerful advantages of brickandmortar stores is instant gratification where customers have instant ownership to the goods after the purchase Reducing this disadvantage in online shopping should increase customers propensity to shop online The problem is cost The majority of customers are not willing to pay for the extra cost of fast shipping Forrester research analysts estimate that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>loses between billion to billion a year on US Prime shipments which promises free twoday shipping and for qualifying orders free sameday shipping to Prime members The majority of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime members joined the program for the free twoday shipping As a result of consumers unwillingness to pay for the full cost of shipping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was forced to absorb some of the costs Over the past few years customers paid about half of the actual shipping cost with the balance absorbed by the company In Amazons shipping costs were billion with billion paid by customers leaving a billion net shipping loss on the companys books The Wall Street Journal notes that shipping costs is one of Amazons fastestgrowing expenses a byproduct of rapidly increasing online sales of general merchandise The economics of drones for last mile delivery Theres been much public discussion about drones with some believing it is a possibility while others are skeptical calling the idea a publicity stunt Americans currently are divided with regard to using drones for delivery purposes Nevertheless a fair number of companies are actively exploring the possibilities including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Alphabet GOOG GOOGL WalMart Dominos Pizza NYSE DPZ DHL Alibaba NYSE BABA and Matternet to name a few notable companies Matternet partnered with Swiss World Cargo and Swiss Post to launch a pilot program in July in which autonomous Matternet drones will deliver parcels in multiple areas in Switzerland Venture capitalists have invested in drones and funding for venturebacked drone companies in the US China Europe and Israel hit a record in The economics of last mile delivery depends on two factors route density and drop size Route density refers to the number of packages that are delivered on a given route the more packages per route the lower the cost per delivery Drop size is the number of packages that are delivered at a certain location The more parcels at a certain location the lower the cost per parcel Drones appear to be an uneconomical solution to the last mile problem in both aspects in Amazons case the route density and drop size are currently about one which means they carry just one package per delivery per location and then return to have their batteries recharged collect and then deliver another package However drones could introduce a solution to the new shipping inefficiency explained previously the exploding number of small lighter packages being shipped as a result of consumers shopping online for items at their convenience According to a report by the US Department of Transportation over the next three decades Americas population is expected to increase by million to million With online sales increasing its share of total retail sales it is expected to contribute to increase freight volume by to billion tons a year and add further stress to an already congested and ageing US transport system Truck congestion wastes US billion in time and fuel annually and this could increase going forward Drones offer a potential solution not in the near future but maybe in the longer term and if not as an independent delivery vehicle then as part of a hybrid solution as detailed in this article here According to this article on Wired the fuel cost of running a dieselpowered truck is a little over cents per mile whereas the energy cost to power a drone over that distance is about cents Combining the two vehicles holds the potential to substantially reduce the cost inefficiencies associated with last mile delivery For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the drones have the benefit of introducing a solution for the companys quest for cheaper and faster delivery and the drones fit quite neatly into Amazons delivery needs The drones could deliver packages in minutes or less and can carry packages weighing up to five pounds kg which make up of the packages <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>delivers Early calculations on the economics of drone delivery are positive so far Professor of robotics and autonomous vehicles Raffaelo DAndrea cofounder of Kiva Systems which was acquired by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>thinks the economics of drone delivery for small packages are feasible DAndreas calculation as detailed in this article here arrives at a total cost of approximately cents per package which is far less than what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is paying today estimated to be about US per package with the cheapest option being USPS and the most expensive being UPS or FedEx DAndreas calculation assumes the package weighs no more than kg and a range of km with headwinds of up to km per hour A separate study by ARK Invest suggests Prime Air could cost the company around cents assuming the packages weigh less than five pounds and the delivery distance does not exceed ten miles of Amazons facilities ARK Invest assumes drones per operator Drones are expected to have pilots and are not expected to eliminate human labor in the early stages Fully autonomous drones are not expected to be a reality in the near future Other analysis which assumes the need for more pilots arrives at a much higher figure of around per delivery It is speculative to say whether drones will ever be deployed for commercial use however the trend appears to be moving in that direction If drones are put to commercial use it is unlikely to happen in the near future It could take well over three to four years to be deployed but the prospects are promising and this development is likely to have a longterm positive impact on shipping expenses the Achilles heel of online retailers which suggests bright prospects for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Americas largest eretailer </div></body></html>
