(Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Online shopping's rising popularity has resulted in a massive proliferation of packages being shipped to online shoppers.This adds stress to an already congested and ageing transport network.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Drones <b>could</b> potentially introduce a solution in the <i>longer</i> term .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Early cost estimates look positive , which suggests drones <b>might</b> have the potential to positively impact shipping expenses - the Achilles ' heel of online retailers .  (Uncertainty) </span>Please take note that this is only one aspect in weighing the attractiveness or non-attractiveness of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) as an investment , and should not be used independent of other factors . ( This piece merely explores the business side of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's core business of online retailing . ) <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> accounted for <b>nearly</b> 40 % of online spending during the holiday season from November 1st to December 6th , according to research conducted by Slice Intelligence . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company 's share increased by 140 basis points this year compared to last year , when the online retailer captured <b>nearly</b> 38 % of American 's online spend during the holiday season .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's market share is <i>larger</i> than the web sales of the next 21 retailers combined , including Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) , Target ( NYSE : TGT ) , Best Buy Co. ( NYSE : BBY ) , Macy 's Inc. ( NYSE : M ) , Home Depot Inc. ( NYSE : HD ) , Nordstrom Inc. ( NYSE : JWN ) and Costco Wholesale Corp. ( NASDAQ : COST ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , the largest e-retailer in the United States , will account for <b>nearly</b> one-quarter of total U.S. retail sales growth this year and over half of e-commerce growth , according to Macquarie Research analysts . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>This trend is expected to continue going forward.Forrester Research projects U.S. online retail sales to increase to 11% of total retail sales in 2018 , helped by increased spending from digitally savvy Millennials who move into their prime spending years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These factors suggest a changing landscape in retailing , <b>somewhat</b> akin to the retail disruptions that took place in the United States decades ago .  (Uncertainty) </span>Sears (NASDAQ: SHLD ) profited during the last century's retail revolution - mail order - by offering a wide selection to customers who had no prior access to it.With the rise of the automobile, Wal-Mart capitalized from consumers' increasing mobility by pioneering massive "supercenters" offering a wide selection to customers under one roof.Today , with mobile and internet technology , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is offering consumers an unprecedented selection of products . However, as with any evolving industry, change gives rise to new challenges, and one of them is shipping, i.e., delivery of goods in a timely and cost-effective manner.This is particularly the case with last mile delivery, which is the last stage of the delivery chain, where small individual packages are delivered to customers' homes.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> currently relies on third-party delivery companies , such as United Parcel Service ( NYSE : UPS ) and USPS , to deliver orders to customers . Delivery delays during the peak holiday season is only one challenge.ShipMatrix reported that on-time rates for FedEx (NYSE: FDX ) and UPS were behind compared to a year ago.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> important , however , are <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's net shipping costs . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Unlike brick-and-mortar stores like Wal-Mart , shipping cost is a <b>variable</b> cost for online retailers such as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And this <b>variable</b> cost is a crucial determinant to completing a transaction .  (Uncertainty) </span>A survey conducted by Purolator International found that 63% of Americans and 76% of Canadians consider the price of shipping to be extremely important when completing a purchase online.A separate survey found that 63% of consumers would cancel an order because of high shipping costs.A study by ComScore and United Parcel Service echoed this notion, stating that the No. 1 reason consumers abort an online purchase is when a shipping charge gets added to the total during checkout.Inflation and fuel costs are only part of the reason for increased shipping costs, and are not necessarily caused by rising fuel prices; diesel prices have not risen since 2011 .<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The cost increases largely stem from the development of a new kind of shipping inefficiency caused by consumers buying what they want when they want ; the convenience of making random purchases has resulted in a profusion of <i>smaller</i> , <i>lighter</i> packages , <b>sometimes</b> being delivered in separate shipments from different warehouses .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Consequently, handling costs, packaging costs (cardboard and plastic wraps) and last mile delivery costs increase, which contributes to increased shipping expenses.In response to this, delivery companies UPS and FedEx implemented dimensional weight pricing on air shipments and large ground shipments, which contributed to an increase in revenue.In January last year , the two delivery firms implemented dimensional weight pricing on all ground shipments , which further increases shipping costs for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and all other online retailers . Not only are shipping costs increasing for the aforementioned reasons , but <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ambition to reduce delivery speeds adds additional upward pressure on shipping expenses . Fast shipping, already costly on its own , only adds to this rising cost.One of the most powerful advantages of brick-and-mortar stores is instant gratification, where customers have instant ownership to the goods after the purchase.Reducing this disadvantage in online shopping should increase customers' propensity to shop online.The problem is cost.The majority of customers are not willing to pay for the extra cost of fast shipping.Forrester research analysts estimate that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> loses between $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion a year on US Prime shipments , which promises free two-day shipping ( and for qualifying orders , free same-day shipping ) to Prime members . The majority of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime members joined the program for the free two-day shipping . As a result of consumers ' unwillingness to pay for the full cost of shipping , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was forced to absorb some of the costs . Over the past few years, customers paid about half of the actual shipping cost, with the balance absorbed by the company.In 2014 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's shipping costs were $ 8.7 billion , with $ 4.5 billion paid by customers , leaving a $ 4.3 billion net shipping loss on the company 's books . The Wall Street Journal notes that shipping costs is one of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's fastest-growing expenses ( a by-product of rapidly increasing online sales of general merchandise ) . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The economics of drones for `` last mile '' delivery There 's been much public discussion about drones , with some believing it is a <b>possibility</b> , while others are skeptical , calling the idea a publicity stunt .  (Uncertainty) </span>Americans currently are divided with regard to using drones for delivery purposes.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Nevertheless , a fair number of companies are actively exploring the <b>possibilities</b> , including <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ) , Wal-Mart , Domino 's Pizza ( NYSE : DPZ ) , DHL , Alibaba ( NYSE : BABA ) and Matternet , to name a few notable companies . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Matternet partnered with Swiss World Cargo and Swiss Post to launch a pilot program in July , in which autonomous Matternet drones will deliver parcels in multiple areas in Switzerland.Venture capitalists have invested in drones, and funding for venture-backed drone companies in the U.S., China, Europe and Israel hit a record in 2015 .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The economics of `` last mile '' delivery <b>depends</b> on two factors : route density and drop size .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Route density refers to the number of packages that are delivered on a given route - the <i>more</i> packages per route , the <i>lower</i> the cost per delivery .  (Surprise) </span>Drop size is the number of packages that are delivered at a certain location.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>more</i> parcels at a certain location , the <i>lower</i> the cost per parcel .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Drones <b>appear</b> to be an uneconomical solution to the `` last mile '' problem in both aspects ; in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's case , the route density and drop size are currently about one , which means they carry just one package per delivery , per location and then return to have their batteries recharged , collect and then deliver another package . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , drones <b>could</b> introduce a solution to the new shipping inefficiency explained previously : the exploding number of small , <i>lighter</i> packages being shipped as a result of consumers shopping online for items at their convenience .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>According to a report by the U.S. Department of Transportation , over the next three decades, America's population is expected to increase by 70 million to 390 million.With online sales increasing its share of total retail sales, it is expected to contribute to increase freight volume by 45% to 29 billion tons a year and add further stress to an already congested and ageing U.S. transport system .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Truck congestion wastes US$ 27 billion in time and fuel annually , and this <b>could</b> increase going forward .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Drones offer a potential solution - not in the near future , but <b>maybe</b> in the <i>longer</i> term - and if not as an independent delivery vehicle , then as part of a hybrid solution , as detailed in this article here .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>According to this article on Wired, the fuel cost of running a diesel-powered truck is a little over 50 cents per mile, whereas the energy cost to power a drone over that distance is about 2 cents.Combining the two vehicles holds the potential to substantially reduce the cost inefficiencies associated with "last mile" delivery.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , the drones have the benefit of introducing a solution for the company 's quest for <i>cheaper</i> and <i>faster</i> delivery , and the drones fit quite neatly into <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's delivery needs . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The drones <b>could</b> deliver packages in 30 minutes or <i>less</i> , and can carry packages weighing up to five pounds ( 2.3 kg ) , which make up 86 % of the packages <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> delivers . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Early calculations on the economics of drone delivery are positive so far.Professor of robotics and autonomous vehicles , Raffaelo D'Andrea , co-founder of Kiva Systems , which was acquired by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , thinks the economics of drone delivery for small packages are feasible . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>D'Andrea 's calculation , as detailed in this article here , arrives at a total cost of <b>approximately</b> 20 cents per package - which is far <i>less</i> than what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is paying today , estimated to be about US$ 2-8 per package , with the cheapest option being USPS and the most expensive being UPS or FedEx . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>D'Andrea 's calculation <b>assumes</b> the package weighs no <i>more</i> than 2kg and a range of 10km , with headwinds of up to 30 km per hour .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>A separate study by ARK Invest suggests Prime Air could cost the company around 88 cents , <b>assuming</b> the packages weigh <i>less</i> than five pounds and the delivery distance does not exceed ten miles of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's facilities . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>ARK Invest <b>assumes</b> 10-12 drones per operator .  (Uncertainty) </span>Drones are expected to have "pilots," and are not expected to eliminate human labor in the early stages.Fully autonomous drones are not expected to be a reality in the near future.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Other analysis , which <b>assumes</b> the need for <i>more</i> pilots , arrives at a much <i>higher</i> figure of around $ 10-17 per delivery .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is speculative to say whether drones will ever be deployed for commercial use ; however , the trend <b>appears</b> to be moving in that direction .  (Uncertainty) </span>If drones are put to commercial use, it is unlikely to happen in the near future.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It could take well over three to four years to be deployed , but the prospects are promising , and this development is likely to have a long-term positive impact on shipping expenses - the Achilles ' heel of online retailers , which <b>suggests</b> bright prospects for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , America 's largest e-retailer .
