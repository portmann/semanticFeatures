(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Over the weekend, three knowledgeable observers offered warnings about Apple.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Richard Waters , noting the inauspicious example of Berkshire Hathaway investing in IBM , suggested Apple 's growth days <b>may</b> be behind it .  (Uncertainty) </span>Brooke Masters questioned whether Angela Ahrendt's sprucing up of Apple stores wasn't merely hype, given how her previous haunt, Burberry, has sagged recently.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And Marco Arment asked whether Apple was at <b>risk</b> of becoming the next BlackBerry , as tech competitors lap it in developing AI assistants .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We elaborate on the three warnings , and present a couple of hedges for those who want to stay long Apple but limit their <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Last month , before Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) released earnings , we noted that social data aggregator LikeFolio had put out a sell rating on the stock based on their analysis of social media data , and we presented a couple ways for concerned shareholders to hedge if they wanted to stay long ( Hedging Apple Ahead Of Earnings ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As LikeFolio co-founder Andy Swan summarized it at the time , Apple 's earnings , a <b>disappointment</b> across the board , as Seeking Alpha contributor Seth Golden put it , supported LikeFolio 's bearish assessment , and , as we wrote near the end of April , hedged Apple investors who wanted to exit , were able to do so with <i>less</i> of a loss than they would have had otherwise .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple shareholders who did n't hedge or sell <b>may</b> be interested to know that three knowledgeable observers offered separate cautions about the company over the weekend .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We 'll review those below , and offer a couple of updated hedges if you 'd like to stay long but limit your downside <b>risk</b> over the next several months .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Richard Waters , who reports on Silicon Valley for the Financial Times , presented the bearish interpretation of Apple being bought by one of Warren Buffett 's deputies at Berkshire Hathaway ( NYSE : BRK.A ) ( NYSE : BRK.B ) -- The End Of An Era For Apple ( free registration with the FT will enable you to read the article here ) -- namely , that it signifies Apple 's run as a growth company may be over : One possible conclusion is that Berkshire Hathaway 's appearance on the scene is confirmation that Apple has now passed into a form of corporate seniority much <b>dreaded</b> by the growth-addicted denizens of Silicon Valley .  (Uncertainty) </span>[...] In the tech world, where "grow or die" has been the mantra, what is considered respectable maturity in other industries smacks of outright senility.Yet it is a future Apple's massive size has rendered inevitable.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At $ 234bn last year , its gigantic revenues -- <b>almost</b> as much as Google -LSB- ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) , ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) -RSB- , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> -LSB- ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) -RSB- , and Microsoft -LSB- ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) -RSB- combined -- make significant sustained growth <b>almost</b> impossible . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Richard Waters ' Financial Times colleague , companies editor Brooke Masters , poured some cold water on Apple 's new stores -- Hope Collides With Hype As Apple Gives Stores A Makeover ( free registration with the FT will enable you to read the article here ) -- noting the result of former Burberry ( OTCPK : BURBY ) CEO Angela Ahrendts ' two-year rethink was underwhelming : Mostly , her vision <b>seems</b> to involve even <i>bigger</i> glass doors and lots of plants .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Every flagship store will have outdoor space -- in San Francisco, the greenery-lined square will feature free WiFi and acoustic musicians on weekends.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Genius Bar , where customers go for help with technical issues , has been replaced by a Genius Grove stocked with trees and <i>more</i> space for people to sit while they wait .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Tart commentators suggested the tree money <b>might</b> have been <i>better</i> spent on <i>more</i> staff to keep delays down .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Masters doesn't say how Apple stores situated in shopping malls, such as the one in Westfield's ( OTCPK:WEFIF ) Garden State Plaza in New Jersey, will keep all the new trees alive.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>To remind us why Apple hired Ahrendts from Burberry , Masters retells the story of Ahrendts ' successful reopening of Burberry 's flagship London store , though readers familiar with Silicon Valley 's concerns about gender and diversity <b>may</b> <b>wonder</b> if that played a role .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Angela Ahrendts is currently the only one of Apple's 10-person executive team who isn't a white man.In any case, Masters points out that the gains to Burberry from Ahrendts' sprucing-up have since faded: Since then, the news has not been so good.Burberry has been hit hard by a fall in Chinese sales.Shares have dropped 35 per cent in 12 months.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>-LSB- ... -RSB- Burberry 's current woes <b>may</b> have nothing to do with Ms. Ahrendts .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But <b>perhaps</b> her highly vaunted effor to reimagine luxury shopping was <i>more</i> about hype than real transformation .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Apple is about to find out.Marco Arment is a prominent software developer, entrepreneur, and commentator.He was the lead developer of Tumblr , which was acquired by Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ), and the creator of the popular Instapaper app.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>He raised the <b>possibility</b> of Apple going the way of BlackBerry ( BBRY ) -- If Google 's Right About AI , That 's A Problem For Apple .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Arment explained that BlackBerry did n't fail because it started to make <i>worse</i> smart phones , but because Apple shifted the expectations of what a smart phone <b>could</b> be , and BlackBerry did n't have the staff or expertise to catch up .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Arment <b>wonders</b> if Apple is now in a similarly precarious position with respect to artificial intelligence , given investments by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Google , and Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) : Today , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Facebook , and Google are placing large bets on advanced AI , ubiquitous assistants , and voice interfaces , <b>hoping</b> that these will become the next thing that our devices are for . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>-LSB- ... -RSB- <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Facebook , and Google - especially Google - have all invested heavily in big-data web services and AI for many years , prioritizing them highly , iterating and advancing them constantly , accumulating relevant data , developing effective algorithms , and attracting , developing , and retaining tons of specialized talent . [...] But if Google's right, there's no quick fix.It won't be enough to buy Siri's creators again or partner with Yelp for another few years.If Apple needs strong AI and big-data services in the next decade to remain competitive, they need to have already been developing that talent and those assets, in-house, extensively, for years.They need to be a big-data-services company.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Their big-data AI services need to be far better , <i>smarter</i> , and <i>more</i> reliable than they are .  (Surprise) </span>And I just don't see that happening.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Becoming a major big-data AI services company does n't happen completely in secret and <b>suddenly</b> get released to the world , completed , in a keynote .  (Uncertainty) </span>It's a massive undertaking, spanning many years, many people, and a lot of noticeable interaction with the world.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's <i>easier</i> to conceal the development of an entire car than a major presence in AI and services .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For Apple shareholders who want to stay long while limiting their downside risk over the next several months , but without capping their upside , these were the <b>optimal</b> puts , as of Monday 's close , to hedge 600 shares against a greater-than-14 % decline by late October ( screen capture via the Portfolio Armor iOS app ) : As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above , the cost of this protection was $ 1,668 , or 2.88 % of position value .  (Uncertainty) </span>A few notes about this hedge: To be conservative, the cost was calculated using the ask price of the puts.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In practice , an investor can often by the puts for <i>less</i> ( for some price between the bid and the ask ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If you are willing to <b>risk</b> a <i>larger</i> decline ( `` threshold '' , in the app 's terminology ) , you can potentially lower the cost of hedging in this manner .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The threshold is based on the intrinsic value of the puts , so they <b>may</b> provide <i>more</i> protection than promised if the underlying security declines in the near term , when the puts <b>may</b> still have significant time value .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For Apple shareholders looking to hedge with the same 14 % threshold , but willing to cap their potential upside to 10 % by late October ( the potential upside implied by the current median 12-month Wall Street price target ) , this was the <b>optimal</b> collar to hedge 600 shares , as of Monday 's close : As you can see at the bottom of the first part of the collar above , the cost of the put leg was $ 1,308 , or 2.26 % of position value .  (Uncertainty) </span>But as you can see in the second part below, the income generated from the call leg was $936, or 1.62% of position value.So the net cost here was $372, or 0.64% of position value.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Two notes about this hedge : Similar to the situation with the <b>optimal</b> puts , to be conservative , the cost of the <b>optimal</b> collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In practice , an investor can often buy puts for <i>less</i> and sell calls for <i>more</i> ( again , at some price between the bid and the ask ) , so in reality , an investor would likely have collected <i>more</i> than $ 408 when opening this collar .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As with the optimal puts above , this hedge <b>may</b> provide <i>more</i> protection than promised if the underlying security declines in the near future due to time value ( for an example of this , see our previous article on Apple ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , if the underlying security spikes in the near future , time value can have the opposite effect , making it costly to exit the position early ( for an example of this , see this article on hedging Facebook - Facebook Rewards <b>Cautious</b> Investors <i>Less</i> ) .
