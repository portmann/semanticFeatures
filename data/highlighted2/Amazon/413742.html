[...] But if Google's right, there's no quick fix.It won't be enough to buy Siri's creators again or partner with Yelp for another few years.If Apple needs strong AI and big-data services in the next decade to remain competitive, they need to have already been developing that talent and those assets, in-house, extensively, for years.They need to be a big-data-services company.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Their big-data AI services need to be far better , <i>smarter</i> , and <i>more</i> reliable than they are .  (Surprise) </span>And I just don't see that happening.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Becoming a major big-data AI services company does n't happen completely in secret and <b>suddenly</b> get released to the world , completed , in a keynote .  (Uncertainty) </span>It's a massive undertaking, spanning many years, many people, and a lot of noticeable interaction with the world.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's <i>easier</i> to conceal the development of an entire car than a major presence in AI and services .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For Apple shareholders who want to stay long while limiting their downside risk over the next several months , but without capping their upside , these were the <b>optimal</b> puts , as of Monday 's close , to hedge 600 shares against a greater-than-14 % decline by late October ( screen capture via the Portfolio Armor iOS app ) : As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above , the cost of this protection was $ 1,668 , or 2.88 % of position value .  (Uncertainty) </span>A few notes about this hedge: To be conservative, the cost was calculated using the ask price of the puts.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In practice , an investor can often by the puts for <i>less</i> ( for some price between the bid and the ask ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If you are willing to <b>risk</b> a <i>larger</i> decline ( `` threshold '' , in the app 's terminology ) , you can potentially lower the cost of hedging in this manner .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The threshold is based on the intrinsic value of the puts , so they <b>may</b> provide <i>more</i> protection than promised if the underlying security declines in the near term , when the puts <b>may</b> still have significant time value .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For Apple shareholders looking to hedge with the same 14 % threshold , but willing to cap their potential upside to 10 % by late October ( the potential upside implied by the current median 12-month Wall Street price target ) , this was the <b>optimal</b> collar to hedge 600 shares , as of Monday 's close : As you can see at the bottom of the first part of the collar above , the cost of the put leg was $ 1,308 , or 2.26 % of position value .  (Uncertainty) </span>But as you can see in the second part below, the income generated from the call leg was $936, or 1.62% of position value.So the net cost here was $372, or 0.64% of position value.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Two notes about this hedge : Similar to the situation with the <b>optimal</b> puts , to be conservative , the cost of the <b>optimal</b> collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In practice , an investor can often buy puts for <i>less</i> and sell calls for <i>more</i> ( again , at some price between the bid and the ask ) , so in reality , an investor would likely have collected <i>more</i> than $ 408 when opening this collar .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As with the optimal puts above , this hedge <b>may</b> provide <i>more</i> protection than promised if the underlying security declines in the near future due to time value ( for an example of this , see our previous article on Apple ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , if the underlying security spikes in the near future , time value can have the opposite effect , making it costly to exit the position early ( for an example of this , see this article on hedging Facebook - Facebook Rewards <b>Cautious</b> Investors <i>Less</i> ) .
