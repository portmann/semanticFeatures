(Uncertainty) </span>Your best question for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> - What communications has <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> had with the SEC 's Division of Enforcement since summer 2014 ? There's no such thing as "routine matters" when it comes to the SEC's Division of Enforcement.When there's communication with this SEC division, it's typically related to some kind of investigation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Until we find out what 's really going on between <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and the SEC , we <b>suggest</b> you proceed with appropriate caution . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Facts of Interest or Concern: Undisclosed SEC Probe Again Confirmed.We first learned of undisclosed SEC investigative activity at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in Jun-2014 . Since then , the SEC has repeatedly confirmed on-going enforcement proceedings at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> that were undisclosed at the time . This occurred on 16-Jul-2014, 08-Apr-2015, and now 04-Jan-2016.In repeated searches of company filings back to Jul-2012 , we have consistently found no disclosures of SEC investigative activity by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . All we know about the SEC probe at this time is that it somehow pertains to the conduct , transactions , and/or disclosures of Amazon.com . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Analysis and Opinion : So far the market 's been ho-hum to our <i>earlier</i> warnings of undisclosed SEC investigative activity at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That <b>could</b> change in an instant , especially if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> discloses an SEC probe on a topic that bothers people . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Like most companies , we expect they 'd likely say very little , spin it in a way to calm the <b>faithful</b> , and simultaneously dodge questions .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ever does get around to disclosing an SEC probe , it would then be safe to assume management judged the <b>exposure</b> sufficiently material that it had to be disclosed . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Your investment could then be at <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>This report is anchored in the irrefutable fact that since summer 2014 , the SEC has repeatedly confirmed on-going enforcement proceedings at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> that remain undisclosed . But this is also a thought piece on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>By necessity , that means we now enter somewhat into the realm of <b>speculation</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>As we invite you to join in, we also ask for your indulgence.Our goal is simply to stimulate your thinking into trying to imagine what 's going on in the now-protracted and undisclosed SEC investigation of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Here 's some things to consider as you think about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's undisclosed SEC probe . Commit to at least putting an undisclosed SEC probe of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> into your awareness when considering whether you want to buy or hold these shares in your portfolio . You can think of it as bringing along an umbrella … you know, just in case.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Allow that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's SEC probe <b>could</b> be about something investors simply would not care about . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But also consider it <b>could</b> easily erode the company 's capacity to deliver on fundamentals , and ultimately earnings .  (Uncertainty) </span>This holds true, whether disclosed or not.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>( Author 's update of 29-Jan-2016 to this original text of 28-Jan : This week 's earnings shortfall <b>could</b> easily have been caused by undisclosed SEC activity and now has us <b>wondering</b> if the two are connected . )  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>We now categorize <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's SEC probe as protracted . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With protracted SEC investigative activity , the <b>risk</b> rises that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will disclose something unsettling . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>This usually happens when a company is failing in its efforts to put the matter to rest with regulators.Think of all the reasons investors complain about the company.One common refrain is the lack of visibility into the underlying business units, initiatives, and/or profitability of the same.So far , the market has let <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> get away with this version of `` disclosure lite '' . But that doesn't mean investors like it.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The SEC <b>might</b> not either .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now , think of some of the data items you 'd really like to know about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , things that are not unreasonable , are not presently disclosed , and that most investors would <b>probably</b> like to know about too . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Then imagine , what would happen to the shares if undisclosed SEC pressure forced the company to start disclosing some of them ?  (Uncertainty) </span>This isn't accounting misbehavior, nor is it something nefarious.Let's use GM's (NYSE: GM ) experience to illustrate.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>More</i> than a decade ago investors had fears over the extent of pension <b>exposure</b> GM was really experiencing , versus what was discernable from SEC filings at the time .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In that case, it wasn't even an SEC investigation that upset the market.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It was a short and simple comment letter the SEC sent to GM telling it to disclose <i>more</i> about its pension <b>exposure</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>When the market got the new data, the shares tanked for an extended period.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The pension <b>exposure</b> was <i>greater</i> than was discounted into the shares at the time .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>This one's fun, but also a bit scary.Ask yourself how much information <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> knows about you . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Then <b>wonder</b> what would happen if that veil of privacy was penetrated .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It's happened time and again among major retailers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Surely , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is subjected to attacks in this realm constantly - and <b>probably</b> on a scale comparable to those experienced by the Pentagon . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We have to imagine ( or should we say , we hope ) <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's cyber-defenses are equally strong , <b>perhaps</b> even <i>stronger</i> than the Pentagon 's . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>But it remains a fact these invasions do occur, and the SEC is one of the regulators first in line to open investigations when public companies experience such breaches (think Target and Home Depot in just the recent past.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Then consider that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>probably</b> knows far <i>more</i> about most of us than they ever will . ) (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>.Now ask yourself , what would it do to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's brand , to the trust its customers place in it , were it to become known the company experienced a data breach , they 've not told you , but regulators are/have been investigating ? <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Like we said <i>earlier</i> , these are simply <b>speculative</b> scenarios or things to reflect upon .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>We know with certainty there are recently confirmed and on-going enforcement proceedings at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At this point , we have no basis in fact to go beyond <b>speculation</b> as to why .  (Uncertainty) </span>Dell once waited a year to disclose its SEC probe Public companies do sit on their SEC probes, even reputable ones.This section shares an example from an SEC probe into revenue recognition that Dell, Inc. kept from investors at the time it was still a public company.Though revenue recognition is the number one cause of restatement, Dell waited a full year before disclosing this investigation to investors.The graphics below are taken from a presentation your editor delivered to analyst groups across the country in 2010-2011 when we were then known as Disclosure Insight.It's a bit dated, but still demonstrates the point well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The presentation was titled , `` Investment <b>Risks</b> That Hide in Plain Sight .  (Uncertainty) </span>"1 This first slide highlights language from the press release Dell issued when it first disclosed that the SEC was investigating its revenue recognition and other accounting practices.Take note of the dates we highlighted.The press release was dated in Aug-2006.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company said it first learned of the probe a year <i>earlier</i> , in Aug-2005 .  (Surprise) </span>Dell chose not to disclose it for that full year.The day this news came out, your editor happened to be interviewed live on CNBC immediately after the then-CEO of Dell.Where the CEO of Dell offered soothing assurances, promises of transparency, and a commitment to full cooperation with the SEC (of course), we immediately pointed out that the company sat on this for a year during which it did not judge the matter sufficiently material to warrant disclosure.We then warned that something must have changed that perception enough to trigger the disclosure.We did not know what the company knew at the time.But we learned a year later, and illustrated it in this next slide.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This next slide shows a <i>more</i> disturbing excerpt .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is drawn from a 10-K filing made <i>more</i> than a year after Dell 's initial disclosure of the SEC probe .  (Surprise) </span>It shows that Dell knew the SEC had expanded its inquiry of Dell in Jun-2006.They never let on at the time of initial disclosure.Again, Dell knew the probe started in Aug-2005.The company knew it expanded by Jun-2006.But Dell still waited all the way until Aug-2006 to finally disclose it.These things do happen.Finally, take a look this next slide showing the price action in Dell, Inc. after disclosure on the SEC investigation.Do allow that the price action includes impact of the financial crisis of 2008.The real purpose of this slide is to illustrate how long some of these SEC probes can last and how involved they can become.From the time Dell claims it first heard from the SEC in 2005 to settlement talks in 2010 was about five years.Before we end this section , let us reiterate that the mere existence of an investigation should not be construed as an indication that any violations of the law have occurred at Dell back then or at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> today . But people experienced with SEC investigations tell us that the SEC generally will not commence an investigation without having a real concern that someone has engaged in wrongdoing.The SEC has limited resources and does not initiate investigations lightly.Notable Disclosures : In repeated searches of company filings back to Jul-2012 , we have consistently found no disclosures of SEC investigative activity by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Going further back in time, we found the following - In September 2010, the State of Texas issued an assessment of $269 million for uncollected sales taxes for the period from December 2005 to December 2009, including interest and penalties through the date of the assessment.The State of Texas is alleging that we should have collected sales taxes on applicable sales transactions during those years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> that the State of Texas did not provide a sufficient basis for its assessment and that the assessment is without merit .  (Uncertainty) </span>We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter.In March 2011, the SEC staff notified us of an inquiry concerning this assessment, and we are cooperating with the staff's inquiry.In September 2010, the State of Texas issued an assessment of $269 million for uncollected sales taxes for the period from December 2005 to December 2009, including interest and penalties through the date of the assessment.The State of Texas is alleging that we should have collected sales taxes on applicable sales transactions during those years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> that the State of Texas did not provide a sufficient basis for its assessment and that the assessment is without merit .

While consistent with a company disclosure cited just above, this document is of little analytical value.It was sent to us in May-2013.As usual, the SEC is doing its part to protect public companies and their auditors (and the SEC Staff itself) by refusing to release the Case Closing Recommendation related to the SEC investigation referenced above.A Case Closing Recommendation tells you why an investigation was opened, what took place, and what conclusions were reached.The SEC refuses to let investors see even one word from its Case Closing Recommendations.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is one <i>more</i> way for those public companies so inclined to hide things from investors .  (Surprise) </span>We remain sharply critical of the SEC for this practice.A one-page letter sent to the company 's counsel on 08-Nov-2011 , informing it that an investigation into Amazon.com , Inc. had ended with no enforcement action recommended . No disclosure of SEC investigative activity found in past two years.Confirmed Undisclosed SEC Investigation - On Watch List: This indicator is assigned when the SEC confirmed this company's involvement in on-going enforcement proceedings as basis to deny our Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and subsequent appeal.A confirmed investigation is the highest standard we can achieve regarding undisclosed SEC activity at a public company.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While an SEC investigation <b>may</b> go nowhere , the potential harm from an undisclosed SEC probe can also be quite serious .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This company will be tracked on our Watch List of companies with undisclosed SEC probes until such time it is either disclosed or new data from the SEC causes us to <b>revise</b> the indicator .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>`` Disclosure Games '' is a term we use to highlight those public companies engaging in disclosure practices we find as misleading , confusing , evasive , or otherwise lacking the transparency needed for investors to make well-informed investment decisions regarding a potentially material <b>exposure</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Notes: All companies with undisclosed SEC investigations are maintained on our Watch List of companies with undisclosed SEC probes.The SEC did not disclose the details on investigations referenced herein.All we know is that they somehow pertain to the conduct, transactions, and/or disclosures of the companies referenced.The SEC reminds us that its assertion of the law enforcement exemption should not be construed as an indication by the Commission or its staff that any violations of law have occurred with respect to any person, entity, or security.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>New SEC investigative activity <b>could</b> theoretically begin or end after the date covered by this latest information which would not be reflected here .
