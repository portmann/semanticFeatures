been investigating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Allowing that this report walks you through some possible scenarios at least worth reflecting on As always we caution that while this could be serious it may not be The mere existence of an investigation does not mean any violations of the law have occurred Authors Note To produce our research reports we file about Freedom of Information Act requests per year with the SEC We have been conducting this sort of independent research since We have no positions in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN nor did anyone pay us to write this report Those with an interest are encouraged to followup with the company directly The full text of the following report was previously published and available for free at probesreportercom on Jan Our Disclosure Insight reports provide commentary and analysis on public company interactions with investors and with the SEC They are heavily reliant on our expertise with using the Freedom of Information Act Analyst Summary For the third time since summer of the SEC has confirmed ongoing enforcement proceedings at Amazoncom that are undisclosed This report walks you through some possible scenarios worth reflecting upon Your best question for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>What communications has <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>had with the SECs Division of Enforcement since summer Theres no such thing as routine matters when it comes to the SECs Division of Enforcement When theres communication with this SEC division its typically related to some kind of investigation Until we find out whats really going on between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and the SEC we suggest you proceed with appropriate caution Facts of Interest or Concern Undisclosed SEC Probe Again Confirmed We first learned of undisclosed SEC investigative activity at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in Jun Since then the SEC has repeatedly confirmed ongoing enforcement proceedings at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>that were undisclosed at the time This occurred on Jul Apr and now Jan In repeated searches of company filings back to Jul we have consistently found no disclosures of SEC investigative activity by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>All we know about the SEC probe at this time is that it somehow pertains to the conduct transactions andor disclosures of Amazoncom Analysis and Opinion So far the markets been hohum to our earlier warnings of undisclosed SEC investigative activity at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>That could change in an instant especially if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>discloses an SEC probe on a topic that bothers people Like most companies we expect theyd likely say very little spin it in a way to calm the faithful and simultaneously dodge questions If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>ever does get around to disclosing an SEC probe it would then be safe to assume management judged the exposure sufficiently material that it had to be disclosed Your investment could then be at risk This report is anchored in the irrefutable fact that since summer the SEC has repeatedly confirmed ongoing enforcement proceedings at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>that remain undisclosed But this is also a thought piece on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>By necessity that means we now enter somewhat into the realm of speculation As we invite you to join in we also ask for your indulgence Our goal is simply to stimulate your thinking into trying to imagine whats going on in the nowprotracted and undisclosed SEC investigation of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Heres some things to consider as you think about Amazons undisclosed SEC probe Commit to at least putting an undisclosed SEC probe of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>into your awareness when considering whether you want to buy or hold these shares in your portfolio You can think of it as bringing along an umbrella you know just in case Allow that Amazons SEC probe could be about something investors simply would not care about But also consider it could easily erode the companys capacity to deliver on fundamentals and ultimately earnings This holds true whether disclosed or not Authors update of Jan to this original text of Jan This weeks earnings shortfall could easily have been caused by undisclosed SEC activity and now has us wondering if the two are connected We now categorize Amazons SEC probe as protracted With protracted SEC investigative activity the risk rises that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will disclose something unsettling This usually happens when a company is failing in its efforts to put the matter to rest with regulators Think of all the reasons investors complain about the company One common refrain is the lack of visibility into the underlying business units initiatives andor profitability of the same So far the market has let <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>get away with this version of disclosure lite But that doesnt mean investors like it The SEC might not either Now think of some of the data items youd really like to know about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>things that are not unreasonable are not presently disclosed and that most investors would probably like to know about too Then imagine what would happen to the shares if undisclosed SEC pressure forced the company to start disclosing some of them This isnt accounting misbehavior nor is it something nefarious Lets use GMs NYSE GM experience to illustrate More than a decade ago investors had fears over the extent of pension exposure GM was really experiencing versus what was discernable from SEC filings at the time In that case it wasnt even an SEC investigation that upset the market It was a short and simple comment letter the SEC sent to GM telling it to disclose more about its pension exposure When the market got the new data the shares tanked for an extended period The pension exposure was greater than was discounted into the shares at the time This ones fun but also a bit scary Ask yourself how much information <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>knows about you Then wonder what would happen if that veil of privacy was penetrated Its happened time and again among major retailers Surely <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is subjected to attacks in this realm constantly and probably on a scale comparable to those experienced by the Pentagon We have to imagine or should we say we hope Amazons cyberdefenses are equally strong perhaps even stronger than the Pentagons But it remains a fact these invasions do occur and the SEC is one of the regulators first in line to open investigations when public companies experience such breaches think Target and Home Depot in just the recent past Then consider that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>probably knows far more about most of us than they ever will Now ask yourself what would it do to Amazons brand to the trust its customers place in it were it to become known the company experienced a data breach theyve not told you but regulators arehave been investigating Like we said earlier these are simply speculative scenarios or things to reflect upon We know with certainty there are recently confirmed and ongoing enforcement proceedings at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>At this point we have no basis in fact to go beyond speculation as to why Dell once waited a year to disclose its SEC probe Public companies do sit on their SEC probes even reputable ones This section shares an example from an SEC probe into revenue recognition that Dell Inc kept from investors at the time it was still a public company Though revenue recognition is the number one cause of restatement Dell waited a full year before disclosing this investigation to investors The graphics below are taken from a presentation your editor delivered to analyst groups across the country in when we were then known as Disclosure Insight Its a bit dated but still demonstrates the point well The presentation was titled Investment Risks That Hide in Plain Sight This first slide highlights language from the press release Dell issued when it first disclosed that the SEC was investigating its revenue recognition and other accounting practices Take note of the dates we highlighted The press release was dated in Aug The company said it first learned of the probe a year earlier in Aug Dell chose not to disclose it for that full year The day this news came out your editor happened to be interviewed live on CNBC immediately after the thenCEO of Dell Where the CEO of Dell offered soothing assurances promises of transparency and a commitment to full cooperation with the SEC of course we immediately pointed out that the company sat on this for a year during which it did not judge the matter sufficiently material to warrant disclosure We then warned that something must have changed that perception enough to trigger the disclosure We did not know what the company knew at the time But we learned a year later and illustrated it in this next slide This next slide shows a more disturbing excerpt It is drawn from a K filing made more than a year after Dells initial disclosure of the SEC probe It shows that Dell knew the SEC had expanded its inquiry of Dell in Jun They never let on at the time of initial disclosure Again Dell knew the probe started in Aug The company knew it expanded by Jun But Dell still waited all the way until Aug to finally disclose it These things do happen Finally take a look this next slide showing the price action in Dell Inc after disclosure on the SEC investigation Do allow that the price action includes impact of the financial crisis of The real purpose of this slide is to illustrate how long some of these SEC probes can last and how involved they can become From the time Dell claims it first heard from the SEC in to settlement talks in was about five years Before we end this section let us reiterate that the mere existence of an investigation should not be construed as an indication that any violations of the law have occurred at Dell back then or at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>today But people experienced with SEC investigations tell us that the SEC generally will not commence an investigation without having a real concern that someone has engaged in wrongdoing The SEC has limited resources and does not initiate investigations lightly Notable Disclosures In repeated searches of company filings back to Jul we have consistently found no disclosures of SEC investigative activity by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Going further back in time we found the following In September the State of Texas issued an assessment of million for uncollected sales taxes for the period from December to December including interest and penalties through the date of the assessment The State of Texas is alleging that we should have collected sales taxes on applicable sales transactions during those years We believe that the State of Texas did not provide a sufficient basis for its assessment and that the assessment is without merit We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter In March the SEC staff notified us of an inquiry concerning this assessment and we are cooperating with the staffs inquiry In September the State of Texas issued an assessment of million for uncollected sales taxes for the period from December to December including interest and penalties through the date of the assessment The State of Texas is alleging that we should have collected sales taxes on applicable sales transactions during those years We believe that the State of Texas did not provide a sufficient basis for its assessment and that the assessment is without merit We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter In March the SEC staff notified us of an inquiry concerning this assessment We cooperated with the staffs inquiry and in November the staff notified us that it had completed its inquiry Documents Acquired Under the Freedom of Information Act The only document we have on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a onepage letter sent to the companys counsel on Nov informing it that an investigation into Amazoncom Inc had ended with no enforcement action recommended While consistent with a company disclosure cited just above this document is of little analytical value It was sent to us in May As usual the SEC is doing its part to protect public companies and their auditors and the SEC Staff itself by refusing to release the Case Closing Recommendation related to the SEC investigation referenced above A Case Closing Recommendation tells you why an investigation was opened what took place and what conclusions were reached The SEC refuses to let investors see even one word from its Case Closing Recommendations This is one more way for those public companies so inclined to hide things from investors We remain sharply critical of the SEC for this practice A onepage letter sent to the companys counsel on Nov informing it that an investigation into Amazoncom Inc had ended with no enforcement action recommended No disclosure of SEC investigative activity found in past two years Confirmed Undisclosed SEC Investigation On Watch List This indicator is assigned when the SEC confirmed this companys involvement in ongoing enforcement proceedings as basis to deny our Freedom of Information Act FOIA request and subsequent appeal A confirmed investigation is the highest standard we can achieve regarding undisclosed SEC activity at a public company While an SEC investigation may go nowhere the potential harm from an undisclosed SEC probe can also be quite serious This company will be tracked on our Watch List of companies with undisclosed SEC probes until such time it is either disclosed or new data from the SEC causes us to revise the indicator Disclosure Games is a term we use to highlight those public companies engaging in disclosure practices we find as misleading confusing evasive or otherwise lacking the transparency needed for investors to make wellinformed investment decisions regarding a potentially material exposure Notes All companies with undisclosed SEC investigations are maintained on our Watch List of companies with undisclosed SEC probes The SEC did not disclose the details on investigations referenced herein All we know is that they somehow pertain to the conduct transactions andor disclosures of the companies referenced The SEC reminds us that its assertion of the law enforcement exemption should not be construed as an indication by the Commission or its staff that any violations of law have occurred with respect to any person entity or security New SEC investigative activity could theoretically begin or end after the date covered by this latest
