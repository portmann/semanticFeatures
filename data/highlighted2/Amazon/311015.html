(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I have not drawn all the <b>possible</b> points , just the ones that will make this concept easy to understand .  (Uncertainty) </span>As you can see, price clearly bouncing on these levels gave plentiful opportunities to enter the stock.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although this is hindsight , you <b>could</b> have entered the stock when the August crash happened .  (Uncertainty) </span>Facebook did report huge earnings.Given the market turmoil.I suspect it will fill that gap.What is so special about a gap?They act as magnets really.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Sooner</i> or later a gap gets filled .  (Surprise) </span>Below is a two-year, daily chart of Facebook.I have highlight the gaps on the chart.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As you can see <i>sooner</i> or <i>later</i> the gap does get filled .  (Surprise) </span>Does this mean you should enter Facebook every time it fills a gap?No, it is just something to be aware of.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Depending on the market climate , that <b>may</b> very well be your chance to enter .  (Uncertainty) </span>Despite how successful Facebook is, it cannot go up unless the overall market goes up.It's one of those, you have to accept facts such as death and taxes.Below, I overlay the charts of both Facebook and the SPY .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At first , glance there might not <b>appear</b> to be any similarity between price movement .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Upon <i>closer</i> inspection you should notice that Facebook has a tendency to not drop as much as the overall market , but unless the overall market moves up , Facebook will not experience the above average change in price .  (Surprise) </span>These are just a few technical factors to be aware of.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I firmly believe that not paying attention to short-term price <b>fluctuations</b> such as a dip , correction or crash will affect the long-term performance of stock returns .  (Uncertainty) </span>Thus, only paying attention to fundamentals and disregarding technicals can have a serious impact on your portfolio.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For instance , I recently wrote an article showing that Alibaba ( NYSE : BABA ) was fundamentally <i>stronger</i> than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Unfortunately, only paying attention to fundamentals have hurt Alibaba investors.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.</div></body></html>
