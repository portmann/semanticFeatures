piggybacking on its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime scale <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Now expansion offers insight into how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>plans on growing Delivery expertise and execution is the moat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and its competitors are battling over to develop Theres no longer much retail companies can do to differentiate from their competitors now that most niches have been carved out and price is all that they can compete on With that as a challenge Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN recognizes it must go in another direction in order to build a moat it can rely on for years into the future If it isnt able to accomplish that there will be little reason for customers to hang around Contrary to what investors in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>believe it is far from clear the company can turn a switch on and immediately launch into a significant earnings phase While some tech companies are able to accomplish that after spending to scale its market I dont see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>being in that place as something like that is accomplished at a far quicker pace than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been performing at So while the strategy of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is easily understood when and if it can take advantage of that scale is a real issue investors need to look at going forward Recently I wrote on why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>must be successful with its shipping strategy in regard to cutting costs in that area in order to have a chance at sustainable profitability In this article well look at the flip side of that which is how the company plans to grow while lowering costs related to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>continues to mature investors must look at how it is going to generate earnings in the future It is far from clear it can simply boost the price of products or services to increase earnings as other tech companies in the past have been able to do after they scale Not only have those companies done it much quicker but did it with a clear and simple plan in mind For example just about everyone knows that Facebook NASDAQ FB is almost totally reliant on mobile for its revenue and earnings growth Its easy to understand and the company is positioned via scale to take advantage of that A lot of its expense associated with scale has been already incurred and it can focus on how to generate earnings from that reality <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>on the other hand continues to spend as if it just launched and is battling to scale in order to position itself to profitably grow The question many investors are asking is this When and how will this end In the first quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>had a net loss of million It generated billion in sales with operating expenses coming in at billion Essentially thats the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>narrative The only way I see the retail giant changing that narrative is to focus strongly on and improving its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and ancillary services while cutting costs and not trying to open up new frontiers that pressure earnings on a continual basis Its almost like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>cant neglect a market another tech company starts to compete in as if its going to miss out and fall behind in a market it has no expertise in I see the need for it to bear down even harder on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and shipping as that is the only hope I see of it delivering on expectations so many have in the company Apparently thats what it is starting to do If it can keep its hands out of the endless number of projects that have some potential it could possibly start to reach its own potential in the core business it competes in Since no retail company can profitably compete on price for the long term there has to be something else it offers in order to retain and grow its customer base <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has of course decided to use its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime service to launch that initiative and while successful it does have the challenge of cutting costs in order to make it highly profitable over time as mentioned earlier The other challenge is to manage churn while it builds out the service It does that through its popular today free shipping promise and continuing to add other products and services to keep people in the Prime fold Since it is becoming difficult to maintain profitability <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is looking for ways to generate more revenue from that base To that end it has developed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Now which offers customers in select cities and neighborhoods onehour delivery for an additional fee I like this because its on top of the annual fee consumers must pay to enjoy the perks of the service This has a lot of potential and if done right and it generates enough scale could be a big win for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and investors Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Now is important for investors is I believe it gives a look into what it is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>plans to do in order to provide predictable and sustainable profitability which is to piggyback other products and services within its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime ecosystem Now that it has positioned itself to serve some important regions with its physical presence in a variety of locations it is feverishly working on differentiating via improvement in its delivery service by developing a variety of ways to bring specific products to a desired location within an hour It offers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Now in the US in certain sections of New York City Miami Baltimore Dallas Atlanta and Austin and just announced it is going international with it offering it in parts of London to begin with It will expand to a number of other locations in the UK in the near future An interesting aside to the service is if a customer wants delivery within two hours they can get it for free What this suggests to me is the products offered by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will be related to those needed very quickly by consumers Another interesting part of the service is it requires minimum orders which will add to the base sales revenue of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime with not a lot of added expense For what is considered a tech company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is growing old In a couple of years it will be its th anniversary since going public How long can some investors and the company talk about scale before the question is considered of where it has more room to do so At this time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>should easily be turning a healthy profit on a continuous basis and yet it struggles to do so Investing in delivery infrastructure while legitimate should be close to being in place especially in the US Now that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sees it must be a market leader in delivery in order to separate itself from its competitors we may start to see some very specific spending that will make sense Its not that spending is bad its that the spending has been spread across a lot of dubious projects that arent related to its core business That has to change if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is to survive and thrive Even if its not being overstated at this time it seems to me that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is hitching its future on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and the revenue it can add to that important customer base for years into the future Without that I see no real future for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Now is a good example of providing another revenue stream for customers that make it difficult to abandon The fact that few if any companies can compete with it at that level confirms this is an excellent strategy Once it becomes highly efficient at onehour delivery in many markets in America and around the world it definitely could move the company to a level where it may become consistently profitable No one knows how many millions of customers have signed up for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime but the lowest estimation would probably be around million It could be significantly higher than that If thats the case its easy to see how customers would be willing to pay more for the convenience of getting a muchneeded product to the home in a very short time That would be on top of the annual fee paid to participate in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime program These are the types of things Im looking for when evaluating the legitimacy of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and its business model I dont care about all those secondary products it pursues outside of any connection to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Even if some of them work theyll only be a small part of the revenue and earnings potential represented by the current business model it employs What Ill continue to look for concerning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is how it spends to boost the value of its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime customer base and ways it can increase revenue and earnings without needing to increase its delivery infrastructure in a major way For that reason the company has <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Now as it taps into its existing and most important customer base without the need to spend huge amounts of capital That also sets the stage for the inevitable time it will have to increase the annual <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime fee where consumers will consider it a service they must have in order to maintain their quality of life in this particular area If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can get expenses under better control and discipline itself in regard to focusing primarily on its core business it may be able to come close to fulfilling the high expectations it has garnered from investors Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon
