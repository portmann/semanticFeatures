<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Removing List Prices From Product Pages Consumerist Whoops It looks like portions of our site are being blocked Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator always on sale amazon pricing sale listing price recommended price changing policy retail Its a timehonored tradition in retail to show shoppers just how much a deal they are getting by showing the list price next to the price the customer will actually pay Its a practice that online sellers who can often offer deeper discounts than bricksandmortar stores frequently use but it looks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is quietly shifting toward showing shoppers only one price The New York Times reports that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has dropped its use of list pricing on certain items in favor of a simplified approach of showcasing the current price for the product Of a list of items that previously showed a crossedout list price below the current forsale price the NY Times found now showcased just one figure The below Breville espresso machine had previously been advertised as selling for around but with a list price of Now this same machine just shows the lower price without any mention of the savings In other cases the NY Times found that some of the products didnt completely ditch the price comparison strategy they just displayed it in a different manner Nineteen product pages tried to encourage a sale by pointing out that the price used to be higher on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>although no time period was given for that price Amazons shift from displaying discounts front and center is a stark change from what the company has been known for a place where shoppers can find discounts on products they may pay more for in a store While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>might not be changing the actual pricing of products failing to show just how much they are discounted could hurt sales Weve been conditioned to buy only when things are on sale said Bonnie Patten executive director of TruthInAdvertisingorg a consumer information site As a result what many retailers have done is make sure everything is always on sale Which means nothing is ever on sale That appears to be the case for the Breville espresso machine While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>routinely shows the list price of and a sale price of around the NY Times points out that Breville itself sells the machine for The NY Times reports that Amazons move to change its pricing began nearly two months ago An analysis of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>products by comparisonpricing startup called Rout found that in early May about of the products were missing list prices More recently that number has jumped to Its unclear why the retailer is making the change but some analysts believe it could be a cautious step to avoid pricing controversies that have been highlighted in several highprofile lawsuits against other retailers related to misleading pricing practices Kohls Kate Spade Macys and Bloomingdales have all been accused in various lawsuits of deliberately marking up products to higher prices in order to advertise deep discounts Weve reached out to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>about its recent pricing display changes and will update this post when we hear back Analysts suggest that the ecommerce companys shift may simply be a response to changing retail preferences Our data suggests that list prices are going away Guru Hariharan chief executive of Boomerang Commerce a retail analytics firm tells the NY Times <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a datadriven company with very few sacred cows At the very least it is conducting a storewide test about whether it should change its pricing strategy While the change in pricing strategy may be too subtle for some shoppers to notice those selling on the site have expressed concern over the shift One seller complained in an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>forum that the list price on his product had disappeared without notice Im well aware that it is bogus but it is a common marketing tactic that works very well at boosting sales he wrote Another seller noted that when his list prices were no longer showing up the retailer reportedly told her they were routinely checking list prices on other sites
