(Surprise) </span>The company has an opportunity to widen its economic moat via designer collaborations.Target (NYSE: TGT ) unveiled a new price-matching policy today, which includes price-matching both online and in-store.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is part of Target 's <i>greater</i> initiative to compete with the convenience and price advantages offered by competitors <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) and Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) , both of whom are included in Target 's new price-matching , which is set to launch on October 1 . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> this price-matching initiative is a necessary move for Target , and a step in the right direction .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>According to Profitero , Target 's online prices were 25 % <i>more</i> expensive than Wal-Mart 's , which were only 1 % <i>higher</i> than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's during the BTS season . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So while Wal-Mart and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> e-commerce prices are competitive , they are far <i>better</i> than Target 's online prices . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>As opposed to competing on price, Target instead chose to compete on shipping during the BTS season, offering free shipping and returns on all purchases regardless of size during the first two weeks of August.Both <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Target offer free shipping on purchases over $ 25 . The new price-matching policy will couple these shipping initiatives with price initiatives to aggressively attempt to put Target 's prices on par with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Wal-Mart . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We <b>believe</b> this is critically important to influence consumer buying trends and attract <i>more</i> consumers both online and in-store , especially young consumers .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>We have previously discussed Millennial shopping trends, including that student-debt burdened Millennials in a slow wage-growth US labor economy are price-preferred shoppers.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This has made Wal-Mart the most preferred general merchandise retailer among shopped age 24 and <i>younger</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Despite being 25 % <i>more</i> expensive , Target is still <i>more</i> preferred than Wal-Mart among the 25-34 and 35-44 demographic , and has continued to post impressive comps numbers both online and in-store .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The creation of a <i>more</i> price-attractive consumer environment should result in increased 24 years old and under shoppers at Target , and this coupled with already strong growth among <i>older</i> demographics set the stage for a successful Holiday sales season for Target .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Target might also be able to benefit from following a Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) type business model , featuring exclusive content and widening its economic moat in <b>hopes</b> of creating sustainable competitive advantages .  (Uncertainty) </span>According to a Motley Fool piece , Target has found much success with its designer partnerships and signature categories.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has made aggressive moves in the fashion space , as it owns Zappos.com and Shopbop , so fighting low <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> fashion prices should be an initiative for Target . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Through offering exclusive products , Target widens its economic moat and <b>could</b> create a <i>more</i> loyal customer base .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>These designer collaborations are typically consumer designer merchandise offered at a significant discount, so they are generally popular but still offer great margins.These products are also not subject to margin compression from the price-matching policy as there are no comparables from which to price-match.Much like Netflix, the success of Target's gradual shifts to "exclusive content" rely heavily on what the content is and how it resonates with consumers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We do <b>believe</b> , though , that Target does have potential herein to substantially widen its economic moat .  (Uncertainty) </span>On top of all this, the US consumer spending economy is strong despite a stumbling equities market.Real PCE posted a 0.4% M/M gain in August 2015 , while Real DPI posted a 0.3% M/M gain.Real PCE growth has been north of 3% throughout 2015.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Consumer <b>confidence</b> came in 7 points above the consensus estimate at 103 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Economic indicators hint at immediate strength in consumer spending.The timing of the price-matching policy heading into the Holiday season is ideal, and coupled with competitive shipping prices, creates a price-attractive consumer environment both in-store and online.The US consumer economy is strong and growing, and the company does have an opportunity to widen its economic moat via designer collaborations.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> there are several signals that indicate Target is perfectly positioned heading into the Holiday season , and we expect strong sales this winter from Target .
