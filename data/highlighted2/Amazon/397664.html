Sober Approach To Valuing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been up after the results of Q due to higher than expected earnings driven by cloud services business But still earnings were a mere per share in Q and operating margin is in the range of Up until the last few years it had been difficult for analysts to arrive at a correct valuation for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN It was due to the fact that despite being years old <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>never produced any significant positive earnings Profits if any were plowed back into the company on the back of the audacious dreams of its CEO Jeff Bezos It was only since last year that analysts have seen positive earnings in consecutive quarters and the stock has sky rocketed since then In fact since th Jan to th April the stock has surged from on th Jan to on th April and in spite of that analysts are still maintaining a buy recommendation on the stock <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was started by Jeff Bezos in a garage in After years it has become a mammoth with bn of revenue TTM However in spite of being a two decade old company it reported earnings of per share at an operating margin of At the current share price of it has been valued by investors at a staggering bn Just to put it in perspective it is more than the market cap of WalMart NYSE WMT Kroger NYSE KR and Target NYSE TGT combined The lofty valuations have been fueled to a large part due to the prospect of growth offered by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>This growth would come from venturing into new businesses like media television shows movies and comics hardware devices Kindle readers Fire tablets Fire TVs and Echo and cloud services <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services or AWS AWS has been a major game changer for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and in a period of years has contributed to operating income in spite of contributing less than to total revenues It has been responsible for the surge in share price recently after the results of Q However can these dreams justify the mammoth valuation of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Lets have a look <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a TTM PE of whereas the industry average is at However since it has very low earnings of per share TTM PE multiple is not a good metric to determine its valuation If we look at PriceBook Value again it is pretty high for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>at as compared to the industry average of The same is true of PriceSales at versus the industry average of However as per <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the best metric to compare them is PriceFree cash flow NYSE PCF As per their K report Our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flows per share Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and cash capital expenditures including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs partially offset by investments we make in longerterm strategic initiatives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a PCF of which is near its year average This is three times more than the industry average and two times more than the SP average Even on the basis of FCF a parameter that has maximum focus from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the valuation of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>looks higher Amazons Comparison with Major Retailers Source Morningstar all figures are TTM Note that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has one of the lowest operating margins among all retailers None of these multiples with the exception of PEG ratio seem to justify the extraordinary valuation of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Lets focus on Discounted Cash Flow DCF valuation and determine a range at which its valuation would make sense Estimated Value of Amazons Share from DCF Valuation After assuming a growth rate in revenue for the first years from onwards current year average growth rate is and using a target pretax operating margin of in current operating margin is we get an estimated value of per share Here operating income has been taken before share compensation thereby giving a higher operating margin of TTM for It is a separate discussion in itself whether share compensation should be considered for calculating operating income For the purpose of this discussion we have added share compensation to operating income because it is not a direct operating expense This DCF valuation indicates that the stock is overpriced by This valuation is based upon two main assumptions revenue growth rate and target pretax operating margin This is a highly optimistic scenario and is based upon exceptional performance by AWS AWS currently comprises of total revenues for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>In order to give a growth rate of AWS has to grow by more than each year for the next years Notably AWS sales have increased by and in and respectively So the revenue growth rate looks achievable Now lets look at the target pretax operating margin If we look at retail and media sector in US the weighted average in the ratio of Amazons revenues of media and retail operating margin comes to In the long run if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>acquires sufficient market share and stops the heavy discounting policy it can hit that number But in order to reach the mark the high margin AWS business has to fire on all cylinders and contribute to at least of total sales in next years In the last quarters the average margin for the AWS business has been SegmentWise Results of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for the Last Quarters Source Company Filings Scenario Analysis for Understanding Current Market Valuation Still we are nowhere near the current share price Let us look at scenario analysis and determine the situations in which an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>buy will prove to be in the money The chart consists of Forecasted Revenues in and Target pretax operating margin for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to hit the price indicated in the inside cells I have highlighted the scenarios where the valuation price is higher than the current market price Such scenarios are possible only if The revenues of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>exceed bn in at the target operating margin of In this scenario <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would become the largest company in the world overtaking WalMart with current revenues of bn TTM by a huge margin It seems quite unlikely The other possible scenario is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>becomes equal to WalMart in revenue and increases its operating margin to This can happen if the high margin AWS contributes to of Amazons total revenues growing from bn to bn Also seems quite unlikely to happen The only scenario in which this is possible is if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>comes up with other successful bets like AWS which increase its operating margin significantly or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>becomes a monopoly eliminates the competition and uses its market power to charge higher prices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>offers great products and services like Kindle eReader <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime day delivery AWS etc It is one of the most customercentric companies in the world In spite of operating for years they still have a revenue growth rate of more than which is unseen in the market They are led by a charismatic leader who is not afraid to venture where others have feared to tread Despite all these qualities the euphoria around <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has masked the real value of its stock It doesnt make great investing sense to buy into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>at the current prices as the stock is overvalued by a minimum of Moreover there is too much volatility for a savvy investor as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>reinvests all its earnings into business every alternate year You can see earnings turning negative every alternate year in the image below Also notice the spike in volatility at the time of every earning announcement <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can become a good buy if the stock falls from its current value As seen in the scenario analysis before there are possibilities that investment in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can pay off But the chances for those are slim So what are you going to do Probably Bezos can help you make a decision Jeff Bezos wrote in a recent letter to shareholders Given a ten percent chance of a times payoff you should take that bet every time But youre still going to be wrong nine times out of ten We all know that if you swing for the fences youre going to strike out a lot but youre also going to hit some home runsThis longtailed distribution of returns is why
