(Uncertainty) </span>This assessment is viewed in a case of a potential restructuring: spin-off, split-off, tracking stock, or an equity ("IPO") carve-out.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Restructuring lens is only meant to highlight <b>hidden</b> value .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It 's undervalued because of wrongful industrial designations , scale makes it susceptible to numerous headline <b>risks</b> and lack of <i>deeper</i> dive into its segments while performing DCF , PTA or M&A assessments .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A sum-of-the-parts ( `` SOTP '' ) or `` break-up '' analysis <b>suggests</b> that Disney 's ( NYSE : DIS ) stock price has 18 % -92 % potential upside .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This value is <b>hidden</b> in segments within the five major segments .  (Uncertainty) </span>In spite of having $155 billion in market cap, Disney has continued to move the needle (228.71% stock price appreciation and 27% y/y average dividends growth rate in the last 10-years).Disney has managed to become a disruptor ( 33 % stake in Hulu & starting DisneyLife ) and a benefactor of traditional media by creating great content , making accretive acquisitions , investing and partnering with disruptive companies such as Netflix and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . In addition, Disney has a significant brand equity and owns a portfolio of lucrative, cash-generating Intellectual Properties ("IP").It also has a seasoned management team with a lot of skin in the game with the CEO owning 475,082 shares.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Outside of their core business , Disney also has a small real estate empire - with a land mass in acres <i>larger</i> than Manhattan and 17 % of San Francisco .  (Surprise) </span>The value of assets greatly improves when you include the value of its attractions, IP, buildings and equipment.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <b>surprisingly</b> part about Disney is that the stock has <i>more</i> than enough coverage .  (Surprise) </span>However, the underlying value of its businesses is highly undervalued.This undervaluation is a function of Disney's scale.Scale has negatively affected Disney's valuations mainly because investors only focus on a tiny aspect of one segment (last year it was ESPN) and because assigning industry multiples to Disney is misleading.It is misleading because of the diverse nature of its business segments.Disney's 5-year revenue growth rate was used to estimate the stock's fair value for 2017.The fair value was then broken down by segment.Each segment was then assigned an EPS estimate based on its revenue contribution to Disney's total revenues.Disney's 5-year average annual EPS growth is 18%.The company had EPS of $4.95 for FY end 2015.Using the 18%, projected 2017 EPS is $5.84.This is a reasonable estimate because Yahoo! Finance has Disney's TTM EPS of $5.47.Graph 1 shows Disney's y/y EPS growth rates between 2011-2015.Data was derived from Morningstar and graphed as shown below.To estimate a fair value for Disney, we also need to consider the impact of dividends.Because aside from stock price appreciation, Disney also returns value to shareholders via dividends and stock buybacks.Disney has grown dividends 27% y/y, on average, in the last decade.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I opted to use lowest growth rate ( 15 % ) in the last 3-years over the 27 % average for two reasons : ( 1 ) 2017 dividends using 27 % is too high and ( 2 ) growing global uncertainties such as slow economic growth and the post-Brexit ramifications , <b>might</b> hinder growth .  (Uncertainty) </span>Graph 2 showing Disney's dividend growth between 2006-2015.The company has grown dividends at an average of 27% y/y in the last 10-years.Data was taken from Morningstar and graphed.This section assigns a rough EPS estimate for 2017 to each of Disney's segments.Yahoo! Finance has Disney's forward 2017 P/E ratio at ~16x and I am using $5.84 as my calendar 2017 EPS.Capitalized at 16x and accounting for $2.08 in dividends, we generate $126.72 in expected value, 32% upside to Disney's current stock price.For each segment, we added EPS plus dividends to get $7.92.Then distributed (using % contribution to sales) $7.92 to each segment to get $3.51, $2.41, $1.11, $0.68 and $0.18 for Media Networks, Parks & Resorts, Studio Entertainment, Consumer Products and Interactive, respectively.MEDIA NETWORKS - Accounts for 44% of TR Overview - segments that make up Disney's Media Networks segment Media Networks is an important segment of Disney, not only because it accounts for 44% of TR but because it has valuable stakes in Hulu, Fusion and ESPN.The segment breakdown is as follows: Cable networks - ESPN (80% owned), Disney Channels (100% owned), ABC Family (100% owned), A&E Television Networks (50% owned), the Hungama (kids entertainment featuring anime, Hindi-language series and game shows) and UTV/Bindass networks in India.Broadcasting - Domestic broadcast network, television production and distribution operations, and eight owned domestic television stations.This segment has two major great investments: A 33% interest in Hulu LLC ("Hulu") - A Netflix like joint venture with Fox Entertainment Group and NBCUniversal that acquires and produces film and television content and distributes it on the internet.A 50% effective interest in Fusion Media Networks LLC ("Fusion") - a news, pop culture and lifestyle television and digital network targeted millennials ( The other 50% is owned by Univision).<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Media Networks can be a huge standalone business with $ 23.264 billion in annual revenues , <b>almost</b> half the annual revenues from Time Warner and Twenty-First Century Fox and with 43 % <i>higher</i> revenues than Viacom .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The P/E ratios for competitors are: forward 2017 P/E of 8.13 for Viacom, Inc. (NASDAQ: VIAB ), 11.73 for Time Warner Inc. (NYSE: TWX ) and 12.77 for Twenty-First Century Fox.Using 2017 EPS of $3.51 for Disney's Media Networks and capitalizing it 8.13x, 11.73x and 12.77x, we get values of $28.54, $41.17 and $44.82 respectively.But the most likely range is $41.17-$44.82 and here is why.Back on April 21, 1995, Capital Cities/ABC closed trading at $84.50/share .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That is <i>larger</i> than the top range above .  (Surprise) </span>Accounting for inflation that is equivalent to $133.20/share today.This is important because back in 1995, Walt Disney acquired then Capital Cities/ABC Inc. for $19 billion .Which was the second largest takeover in U.S. history at the time.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> that $ 19 billion did not increase in value and only taking into account inflation , ABC Family would be worth ~ $ 30 billion today .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Looking at Capital Cities/ABC today with respective to revenues , it <b>could</b> have traded between Viacom and Time Warner/Fox .  (Uncertainty) </span>For example, Time Warner trades at $70.72/share and had sales of $28.12 billion in FY2015.Viacom trades at $40.97/share and had $13.27 billion in sales in FY2015.And Disney's Media Networks had $23.26 billion in sales in FY2015.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It is possible that it <b>could</b> have been trading <i>higher</i> than Viacom but <i>less</i> than Time Warner .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Implying a fair value <b>somewhere</b> between $ 50 - $ 60 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Meaning $28.54 is too high.Therefore, to be conservative, we will stick with the $41.17-$44.82 range.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , I think the aggregate value of Media Networks <b>could</b> be <i>more</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Media Networks has five major <b>hidden</b> assets : 33 % stake in Hulu , 50 % stake in Fusion , 100 % stake in ABC , 50 % stake in A&E Television Networks and 80 % stake in ESPN .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Overtime , these assets <b>could</b> be worth a lot <i>higher</i> than $ 44.82 / share as standalone assets .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The post-acquisition value for Capital Cities/ABC should be <i>more</i> than $ 30 billion or <i>greater</i> than $ 44.82 / share as shown above .  (Surprise) </span>Meaning that my fair value estimates grossly undervalues Disney's Media Networks.Second, the calculation does not take into account post-acquisition synergies.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These <b>might</b> include margin expansion as different segments collaborate and streamline .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Such an omission <b>could</b> cause a <i>lower</i> estimate given that companies with <i>higher</i> margins tend to trade <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Third, increased competition can depress margins moving forward.For example, the growth in the number of networks distributed by MVPDs has resulted in increased competition for advertising revenues both in the broadcast and cable networks.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Fourth , Media Network is also facing <i>higher</i> acquisition costs for sports and other live programming .  (Surprise) </span>Take Facebook and Twitter for example, they have also started competing for live sports programming.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These new entrants will eventually cause acquisition costs to surge and they also put Media Networks current contracts at <b>risk</b> ( Disney currently has sports live rights agreements with the NFL , college football and basketball , MLB , NBA , the Wimbledon Championships , U.S. Open Tennis , soccer and the Masters golf tournament ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>Parks and Resorts was the second highest growing segment for Disney in FY2015.The segment owns the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida; the Disneyland Resort in California; Aulani, a Disney Resort & Spa in Hawaii; the Disney Vacation Club; the Disney Cruise Line; and Adventures by Disney.Parks and Resorts has a growth catalyst in play for 2016.Disney recently opened the 1,000 acre Shanghai Disney Resort.A resort positioned to fuel topline growth for Disney's Parks and Resorts.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On another note , the Parks and Resorts segment is <i>bigger</i> than public traded competitors such as Six Flags Entertainment Corporation ( NYSE : SIX ) , SeaWorld Entertainment Corporation ( NYSE : SEAS ) and Cedar Fair , L.P. ( NYSE : FUN ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For example , in FY2015 Disney 's Parks & Resorts reported annual revenues of $ 16.16 billion , 92.18 % <i>higher</i> than $ 1.26 billion from Six Flags , 91.5 % <i>higher</i> than $ 1.37 billion from SeaWorld , and 92.4 % <i>higher</i> than $ 1.24 billion from Cedar .  (Surprise) </span>On a valuation basis, Cedar has a forward 2017 P/E of 15.42 , SeaWorld has a forward 2017 P/E of 14.65 and Six Flags has a forward 2017 P/E of 27.68 .Going back to the "Reference" table above, the estimated EPS for Parks and Resorts is $2.44.Capitalizing that at 15.42x, 14.65x and 27.68x, you get values of $37.62, $35.75 and $67.54.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That means that Disney 's Parks and Resorts <b>could</b> be worth between $ 35.75 / share to $ 67.54 / share .  (Uncertainty) </span>By October 1965, Disney planners acquired 27,443 acres of land in central Florida.But in its 2015 annual report, the company acknowledges only 25,000 acres of land for its Disney World Resort in Florida.The Table below shows a list of properties that Disney owns and leases.The total number of land owned in the table below is 365 acres: 243 acres in California, 5 acres in New York and 117 in Connecticut.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Disney also owns 486 acres in Anheim California , bringing the total number of acres in California to <b>roughly</b> 729 acres .  (Uncertainty) </span>According to data taken from a report by the Federal Housing Finance Agency and reported by 247 Wall Street, the average value of land in Connecticut is $128,824 per acre, in New York it is $41,314 per acre, in California it is $39,092 per acre and in Florida it is $28,981 per acre.Therefore, Disney's properties in these areas will be worth: 25,000 acres in Florida is $724,525,000 That is a total of ~$768 million in land.But my list is not conclusive because in its 2015 annual report, Disney values its land at $1.25 billion.Disney has a real estate empire.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Disney land in Florida alone is <i>more</i> than the size of Manhattan ( 21,500 ) or ~ 17 % the size of San Francisco ( 148,400 acres ) .  (Surprise) </span>Disney's Parks and Resorts have sales in excess of $14 billion than competitors because of the diverse nature of its revenue streams.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This diversity in revenues enables the segment to reduce sales <b>volatility</b> in any given year .  (Uncertainty) </span>Another important point to note is that these Parks and Resorts are built to last for decades to come.Their revenue generating ability is not capped.Making them an excellent and reliable cash generating machine for years to come.A business model competitors should mimic, Disney management should sustain & innovate and shareholders should cherish.Furthermore, this segments has a lot of other businesses.For example, the segment generates revenues from the sale of admissions to theme parks, sales of food, beverage and merchandise, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise and other vacation packages and rentals of vacation club properties.I think this is a robust, stable business segment which happens to contribute 31% to Disney's total revenues.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Given that the segment is 14x <i>greater</i> than competitors above , the range from $ 35.75 to $ 67.54 <b>seems</b> fair .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Disney 's Parks and Resorts faces a lot of <b>risks</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>The segment's theme parks, resorts, Disney Cruise Line and Disney Vacation Club faces stiff competition from all forms of entertainment businesses, lodging, tourism, and recreational activities.These competitors can diminish margins by getting a share of the sales from Disney.Another detrimental effect of these competitors for Disney is a high fixed cost amidst declining revenues.For example, Disney invests a tremendous amount of money into its theme parks and resorts.To run them efficiently, Disney incurs a lot of fixed costs such as utility costs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Meaning that any topline sales decline <b>could</b> greatly depress margins due to high fixed costs .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In addition , Disney 's theme parks in other countries face a lot of political <b>risks</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Governments in those countries can decide to increase corporate taxes , force a <i>higher</i> wage for employees on the company or impose other stringent rules for Disney to operate in their countries .  (Surprise) </span>Also, the business is seasonal.Peak attendance occurs during school vacations (like over the summer), and in early-winter and spring-holiday periods.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>could</b> be dangerous during economic downturns .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As people spend <i>less</i> on vacations during <b>uncertain</b> times .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This year , we have the election headwind and the post-Brexit effects that <b>might</b> reduce consumer spending power .  (Uncertainty) </span>Studio Entertainment, Consumer Products & Interactive I combined the last three segments because any Studio has to have all three segments within it.For example, studios produce content (Studio Entertainment) and then engages with licenses, publishers and retailers to develop, promote and sell that content (Consumer Products).Because of their IP portfolios, these studios then leverage their IP's across interactive media platforms such as games (Interactive).Let us talk about the Studio Entertainment first.Disney acquired Pixar back in 2006 for $7.4 billion, Marvel Entertainment and its associated comic assets for $4 billion in 2009, Lucasfilm for $4.05 billion in 2012.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Adjusting for inflation , Pixar <b>could</b> be worth $ 8.82 billion , Marvel <b>could</b> be $ 4.48 billion and Lucasfilm <b>could</b> be $ 4.24 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>That would be a total of $17.54 billion in acquisitions today.DreamWorks cites three major competitors on its website: Disney Pixar Studios, Fox's Blue Sky Studios, and the Weinstein Company.DreamWorks forward 2017 P/E is 36.03.Other competitors such as Fox's Blue Sky Studios and Weinstein Company are private companies and Pixar Animation was acquired by Disney back in 2006.Looking back to the "Reference" table above, the aggregate estimated EPS for the three segments is $1.97.Capitalized at 36.03x, we have a value of $70.98.Before Disney acquired Pixar, Pixar traded at 84x estimated 2007 earnings .But 84x is a very high multiple.Hence, the reason why I did not use that multiple.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In addition , DreamWork 's P/E only raised dramatically after Comcast announced its $ 3.8 billion acquisition of Dreamworks for <b>roughly</b> $ 41/share .  (Uncertainty) </span>This caused DreamWorks stock price to surge from $27.12/share to currently $40.71/share.This 50% surge raised DreamWorks P/E.Meaning that we need to apply a 50% discount to $70.98, to get $35.57/share.For the medium price range I took the average of the two ($70.98 and $35.57) to get $53.28/share.Disney faces a lot of litigation costs.The company has to continuously exploit and protect against infringement on its IP portfolio.Moreover, Disney also faces cyber attack threats.The company holds millions of people's personal information.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Any compromise to this information may force the company to incur additional costs , lose potential opportunities and damage its brand as clients start to <b>doubt</b> Disney 's security .  (Uncertainty) </span>Disney's Interactive media compete with other aggressive publishers of console, online, mobile games and other types of home entertainment.Although this is a high growth area, the race to stay ahead of competitors and to be price competitive can compress margins.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Lastly , box office revenues are very <b>volatile</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This sales volatility makes it <i>harder</i> to <b>predict</b> how profitable the studio can be done the line .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Disney needs to continue creating great content every year just to stay relevant.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But the success of that content is <b>dependent</b> on other factors such as movies playing , time of the year and other entertainment events that can grab people 's attention .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Conclusion : Sum-of-the-parts ( `` SOTP '' ) or Break-Up analysis The <b>risks</b> embedded in my analysis emanates from the fact that some assets were not accounted for and valuations were relatively low .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In addition , a <i>deeper</i> dive into segments of segments can be done to extract a <i>more</i> precise estimate .  (Surprise) </span>Moreover, I used "competitors" and not necessary "comparative" companies.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This can cause a mismatch in estimates because of <b>varying</b> underlying economics of the companies being compared .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, the findings are intriguing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The analysis reviews that a low estimate would <b>suggest</b> an 18 % upside to Disney 's current stock price , 40 % upside for the medium estimate and 92 % upside for the high estimate .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Activities such as spin-off , split-off , tracking stock , or an equity ( `` IPO '' ) carve-out <b>could</b> unleash tremendous value in Disney .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These restructuring suggestions are unlikely to be near-term outcomes but they are meant to give a picture of what each segment <b>could</b> be worth as a standalone company .  (Uncertainty) </span>Most importantly, they are meant to emphasize the idea that Disney's stock price is undervalued.One major misunderstanding leading to low valuations is industry classification.Research from Credit Suisse, The Street and Ford Equity Research defines it as an Entertainment company.Others assign it the "Entertainment - Diversified" sector name.Others say it is in the Media industry and others Broadcasting industry.The problem becomes which multiple to assign its overall business.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Although Media Networks makes up 44 % of total revenues , it is still <i>less</i> than half of Disney 's total revenues .  (Surprise) </span>Meaning that we cannot strictly define it as a Media company.Parks and Resorts make up 31%, together with Media they make up 75% of revenues.But finding an industry made-up of Media and Parks & Resorts similar to Disney is virtually impossible.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> that because analysts need to assign an industry to facilitate Comparable Company Analysis , Precedent Transactions and DCF calculations , Disney 's stock price has gotten low multiples because of being assigned to low growth industries .  (Uncertainty) </span>Lastly, another important observation is that 43% of Disney's market capitalization can be attributed to its IP portfolio and tangible assets.In addition, Disney values its attractions, buildings and equipment (subtracting accumulated depreciation) at $17.901 billion.Meaning that ~12% of its market cap can be attributed to tangible, physical assets.This is not including the amount of money these assets can bring to the magic kingdom.Furthermore, Disney's acquisitions of ABC, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm would be worth $47.54 billion in today's money.Currently, Disney's market capitalization is $155.66 billion.Looking at Disney's acquired IP portfolio, notice that their aggregate value today accounts for ~31% of Disney's total market capitalization.Meaning that 43% of Disney's market capitalization can be attributed to its IP portfolio and physical assets.Another important point to remember is that Disney has, thus far, had great management.These guys are visionaries; staying ahead of trends and creating the future.Back in 2006 when Disney acquired Pixar, piracy was at its peak.Other media empires were running away from spending billions on IP's because of piracy.But Disney saw the potential ahead and it is still paying-off handsomely.Furthermore, management has had a long-term outlook which they consistently brought to life.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For example , the newly opened Shanghai Disney Resort has been <i>more</i> than 15-years in the making ( from negotiations to completion ) .  (Surprise) </span>Over the years, this will generate significant cash for Disney.The last significant positive attribute about management is that they have been shareholder friendly.They have grown dividends by an average of 27% y/y since 2006.In between, Disney has issued billions of dollars in stock buybacks in an effort to increase shareholder returns.And because of its superb performance, Disney's stock price has surged by 228.71% in the last 10-years.Considering that the stock is way below its high's, down 15% in the last 12-months and worth a lot under an SOTP or "Break-up" analysis, this is a great opportunity to buy a superior business at undemanding valuations.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Services , Entertainment - Diversified</div></body></html>
