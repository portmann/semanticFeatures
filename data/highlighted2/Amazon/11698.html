( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> recently purchased 2lemetry , an IoT platform vendor . 2lemetry provides a way for the company to establish itself in the growing enterprise IoT field.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can then leverage a foothold in enterprise IoT to sell additional cloud services . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) has a reputation for dabbling in a wide <b>variety</b> of industries outside of its ecommerce origins . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>These side ventures include everything from AWS ( <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services ) to Kindle tablets to streaming media devices . Most recently, the company acquired 2lemetry , a company that develops Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions for enterprises.Some of the initial coverage of this acquisition has focused on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> jumping into yet another new category , or on 2lemetry 's retail-focused offerings . However , instead of viewing this as a new venture , the acquisition is better seen as a play by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to help cement AWS as the go-to cloud service for enterprise . I've previously written about the potential of B2B-focused IoT companies and the opportunity this market presents.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Many companies are just beginning to connect their machinery ( and create `` smart '' factories ) , and the IoT market is estimated to grow to <b>approximately</b> $ 14 trillion by 2020 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Vendors that can get in on the ground floor of this transition can set themselves up for long-term success.2lemetry's ThingFabric platform operates in this enterprise IoT niche.It essentially helps companies connect their machines together and then export the data to various enterprise apps.2lemetry's current client list includes a few major names, such as Honeywell (NYSE: HON ) and Demeter Power Group.The real potential for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , though , is n't in just getting companies to connect their machines using Amazon-powered tech - it 's in selling enterprise companies an entire integrated stack of connectivity , storage , and analytics products through AWS . 2lemetry is a step in that direction.It's been clear for a while that cloud storage alone isn't a fantastic business.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For the last few years <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) , and Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) have been locked in a price war that 's quickly driving storage costs to <b>almost</b> zero . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Google's Nearline service , which offers 1GB of storage for $0.01, is just the latest development in this spiral.The money lies in the services and applications that companies can offer on top of these storage platforms.Enterprise IoT is a particularly nice opportunity for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( and other cloud providers ) , because it requires a large stack of platforms to work fully . Enterprises need to connect their devices and machines together, which is where 2lemetry's technology comes into play.They need a way to store all of the resulting data, which is where AWS storage is key (this will likely one day be provided as a free value-add).Then, enterprises need a way to sort and analyze all this data in order to help them make business decisions (the original promise of IoT).<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will now be able to directly offer two of these three services in an integrated offering . And while it doesn't currently offer a true business intelligence product, it does provide the infrastructure for some of the most popular ones.When assessing the viability and market position of AWS , investors should consider <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's IoT services an integral component of that strategy . 2lemetry 's platform allows <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to establish a foothold in the growing enterprise IoT market , which can be leveraged to later sell additional AWS services . In this way, the acquisition really isn't about expanding into a new vertical, but rather, strengthening the company's current offerings.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In next few weeks , I 'll be writing <i>more</i> about the opportunities that IoT ( both consumer and business-facing ) presents for new and established companies .
