( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> increases R&D to zero out GAAP profit . R&D should be capitalized to see <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's economic earnings . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) always incites much discussion about its profitability and future growth . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This led to the creation of the moniker the `` FAN '' companies , which many say are significantly overvalued due to low current earnings and many others <b>believe</b> are the future .  (Uncertainty) </span>This future growth would eventually lead to a massively profitable business and a share price far above the current share price.Bezos, to the delight of some and ire of others, pledges to keep GAAP earnings near-zero through ever-increasing "investment" into the business.Therefore , to value <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , we should n't look to GAAP earnings which would show a distorted picture of the underlying business . Some analysts instead look to operating cash flow as the true indicator of profitability for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , however this ignores many real costs of doing business such as share issuance , capital expenditures and amortization/depreciation . Instead , I decided to look to the source of the GAAP issues in valuing <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> : R&D . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>R&D <b>seems</b> to be Bezos ' method to vex the US taxman and spin the tale of zero GAAP profits while growing an ever-increasing empire .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>R&D as a percentage of revenue has <b>varied</b> from 7.3 % to 13.0 % for the last two years in no appreciable pattern , other than serving to keep net income between -1 % and 1 % of revenue .  (Uncertainty) </span>Data for the following table and all the others are pulled from Edgar.Outside of one mistake when <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> spent too much in Q3 2014 , Bezos successfully budgeted R&D to essentially zero out net income . To GAAP, this R&D is an expense like shipping that hits the quarter it's performed.However, to the rest of us, R&D is an investment in the company's future.To treat it as an expense distorts the underlying nature of the cash being spent.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To get a <i>truer</i> picture of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's earnings , I went back five years and began capitalizing a portion of the R&D expense . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Carrying this through to last quarter gives you an amortizing R&D asset and a significantly <i>lower</i> R&D expense in any given period .  (Surprise) </span>This is the model which corresponds to amortizing the R&D asset over four years.For example , in Q4 2014 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> spent $ 2.636 billion on R&D . However in my model, only 1/16th of that gets expensed in the same quarter.Due to the amortization of the prior quarter's R&D, 1/16th of Q3 2014 also gets expensed, as does 1/16th of Q2 2014, and so on.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As you can see , when you deal with R&D in a <i>more</i> nuanced way than simply immediately expensing , the profitability of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> emerges . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The question then becomes , how long is the useful life of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's R&D ? The tech industry moves extremely quickly.If you aren't spending money to move forward, you are falling behind.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To see the effect of choosing a length of time to amortize the R&D asset , a table of the net income of the last four quarters at three - , four - and five-year R&D capitalization length follows : As you can see , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's profitability <b>depends</b> on how long you think their R&D is useful . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>As a final note, this investment in R&D is neither bad nor good in a vacuum.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>depends</b> on how much you trust the company and management .  (Uncertainty) </span>The R&D led to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's huge lead in AWS , but also burned billions on the Fire phone . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I <b>worry</b> that Bezos cares too much about hitting that -1 % to 1 % net income range and <i>less</i> about the potential returns on the R&D projects .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continues to expand , management <b>may</b> be tempted to spend money on projects that should have been avoided to return money to shareholders . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>That said, due to the misunderstanding of zero GAAP net income, there's value here.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Many investors screening for stocks with any kind of earnings-based metric may skip over a company that <b>could</b> , in actuality , suit their needs .
