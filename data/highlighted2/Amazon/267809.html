</span>increases RD to zero out GAAP profit RD should be capitalized to see Amazons economic earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN always incites much discussion about its profitability and future growth This led to the creation of the moniker the FAN companies which many say are significantly overvalued due to low current earnings and many others believe are the future This future growth would eventually lead to a massively profitable business and a share price far above the current share price Bezos to the delight of some and ire of others pledges to keep GAAP earnings nearzero through everincreasing investment into the business Therefore to value <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>we shouldnt look to GAAP earnings which would show a distorted picture of the underlying business Some analysts instead look to operating cash flow as the true indicator of profitability for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>however this ignores many real costs of doing business such as share issuance capital expenditures and amortizationdepreciation Instead I decided to look to the source of the GAAP issues in valuing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>RD RD seems to be Bezos method to vex the US taxman and spin the tale of zero GAAP profits while growing an everincreasing empire RD as a percentage of revenue has varied from to for the last two years in no appreciable pattern other than serving to keep net income between and of revenue Data for the following table and all the others are pulled from Edgar Outside of one mistake when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>spent too much in Q Bezos successfully budgeted RD to essentially zero out net income To GAAP this RD is an expense like shipping that hits the quarter its performed However to the rest of us RD is an investment in the companys future To treat it as an expense distorts the underlying nature of the cash being spent To get a truer picture of Amazons earnings I went back five years and began capitalizing a portion of the RD expense Carrying this through to last quarter gives you an amortizing RD asset and a significantly lower RD expense in any given period This is the model which corresponds to amortizing the RD asset over four years For example in Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>spent billion on RD However in my model only th of that gets expensed in the same quarter Due to the amortization of the prior quarters RD th of Q also gets expensed as does th of Q and so on As you can see when you deal with RD in a more nuanced way than simply immediately expensing the profitability of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>emerges The question then becomes how long is the useful life of Amazons RD The tech industry moves extremely quickly If you arent spending money to move forward you are falling behind To see the effect of choosing a length of time to amortize the RD asset a table of the net income of the last four quarters at three four and fiveyear RD capitalization length follows As you can see Amazons profitability depends on how long you think their RD is useful As a final note this investment in RD is neither bad nor good in a vacuum It depends on how much you trust the company and management The RD led to Amazons huge lead in AWS but also burned billions on the Fire phone I worry that Bezos cares too much about hitting that to net income range and less about the potential returns on the RD projects As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>continues to expand management may be tempted to spend money on projects that should have been avoided to return money to shareholders That said due to the misunderstanding of zero GAAP net income theres value here Many investors screening for stocks with any kind of earningsbased metric may skip over a company that could in actuality suit
