(Uncertainty) </span>6, 2015 11:21 AM ET �|� About: PowerShares NASDAQ Internet Portfolio ETF (PNQI) , Includes: AMZN , EBAY , FB , FDN , GOOGL , YHOO by: Josh Klein PNQI consists of a conglomerate of mature internet stocks.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Dot Com bubble is behind us , internet stocks are becoming <i>more</i> profitable .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A recent pullback in price makes this ETF far <i>more</i> attractive .  (Surprise) </span>Over the past 20 years investors' attitudes towards internet stocks have been fairly mercurial.In the late 1900s to early 2000s many investors craved internet, social media, and e-commerce stocks, no matter the price.Some companies were even trading close to 180 times earnings, a number well above the S&P 500's P/E.However, the hype didn't last.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On January 1 , 2000 investors began to realize these companies <b>could</b> n't live up to their growth expectations .  (Uncertainty) </span>A strong user base was not enough to maintain a sufficient investment prospect.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Internet stock <b>suddenly</b> became among the most avoided stocks on the market and they , along with the rest of the economy , took a plunge into a bear market .  (Uncertainty) </span>A huge reason for the dotcom bubble bust was because companies began spending endlessly without generating any real sufficient revenue.A few examples include Boo.com and GeoCities.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Boo.com , an internet fashion company , spent $ 190 million in <b>hopes</b> to expand globally before going bankrupt in 2002 .  (Uncertainty) </span>GeoCities, a web hosting website, was bought by Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) for $3.5 million in 1999 and later went out of business in 2009.Companies were too centralized around boosting views and members instead of revenue.The immense growth prospects began to wither away and Mr. Market inevitably crashed.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Although , even now-a-days , many social media and internet based stocks are highly <b>dependent</b> on registered users , there is a much <i>larger</i> focus on revenue this time around .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Mature stocks such as Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) , Ebay ( NASDAQ : EBAY ) , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , and Google ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) have all managed to boost users while maintaining high profit margins and steady growth . That is why the First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund, a conglomerate internet fund consisting of mature, revenue driven stocks, is such an attractive ETF to invest in right now.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The First Trust DJ Internet Index ETF ( NYSEARCA : FDN ) is another index fund with large percentage holdings in some of the same internet companies , however I <b>believe</b> the PowerShares NASDAQ Internet Portfolio ETF ( NASDAQ : PNQI ) is a <i>better</i> bet for a few reasons .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The following chart details the percent gain for both ETFs.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>First , PNQI is <i>more</i> globally diversified .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With the Fed likely raising interest rates , oil looking to rise , and Greek nearing bankruptcy , now , <i>more</i> than ever , it is important to diversify .  (Surprise) </span>PNQI has stakes in America, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and Canada, where as FDN's holdings are entirely U.S stocks.Below is a breakdown of the two ETFs by region.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Second , PNQI covers <i>more</i> sectors .  (Surprise) </span>Although I've stressed the growing Internet industry, it is important not to put all your eggs in one basket.FDN is predominately technology; PNQI only has a 57% stake in technology.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Facebook , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , and Google are no longer <b>dependent</b> on users . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>They are amongst the largest companies in the NASDAQ and centralize their growth around earnings, profits, and innovation.FB, AMZN, and GOOGL have market capitalizations of $220 billion, $196 billion, and $375 billion, respectively.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Facebook , a company with over 1 billion users has focused its attention on monetizing its apps <i>more</i> efficiently .  (Surprise) </span>After purchasing Instagram and What's App, Mark Zukerburg has focused his attention on further developing his Messenger app and expanding Facebook's services to the news industry.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Over the next couple of months , Facebook plans to expand its Messenger software from mobile devices to desktops , enabling <i>more</i> users than ever before .  (Surprise) </span>Facebook also intends to further develop Messenger's platform, allowing app developers to use Messenger as a base for their software coding.Also, Facebook aims to launch a feature known as Instant Articles to provide direct news to its 1 billion users.This feature will enhance the user experience by eliminating third party news extensions.Generally, a link to an article can take up to eight seconds to load.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Attaching the article directly to Instant Articles will allow the user to access his or her news <i>quicker</i> , leaving <i>more</i> time for surfing .  (Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continues to remain profitable despite temporary headwinds from Alibaba . They recently released <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Echo , a voice command object used to control smart devices , answer questions , and play music . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> just released a statement announcing that the cloud computing device will be compatible with IFTTT software , integrating third party apps and smart devices <i>more</i> efficiently across the board . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Google is spear heading the Internet of Things revolution.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There driver-less car is amongst the first or our generation and <b>could</b> see very profitable down the road .  (Uncertainty) </span>TomTom CEO recently came out with a statement indicating that their maps services is most likely going to be used for Google's driver-less car.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The computer manipulated transportation era is underway , <b>maybe</b> it 's time to jump on the wagon and reap in the investment benefits .  (Uncertainty) </span>Twitter and LinkenIn are definitely the weakest stocks in PNQI's portfolio.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After significant earnings misses both stocks have dropped <b>roughly</b> 20-25 % .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Many might view this sudden drop as a <b>scare</b> , however I view this as an FDN buying opportunity .  (Uncertainty) </span>Although Twitter fell due to lack of proper monetization and over exaggerated future expectations, its revenue surged 74% since 1Q14 and its monthly users were up 18%.Similarly, LinkedIn dropped due primarily to its over exaggeration of future prospects and missing on growth estimates by 9%, a significant number.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , due to their major sell off , I believe a minor stake in their stocks <b>could</b> be profitable .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I would n't recommend buying LNKD or TWTR directly , but purchasing FDN could be a great way to increase your stake while hedging your <b>risks</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Although Netflix has grown 4800 % in the last decade , the value of the stock is currently worth <i>more</i> than it is selling for .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>After reporting earnings the other day Netflix has jumped <i>more</i> than 15 % .  (Surprise) </span>It used to just post unoriginal content, strictly already-existing movies and TV shows, however the strong boost of original content will push Netflix's user base in the U.S exponentially.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Possible</b> Mergers - Google/Twitter & Yahoo/Priceline Twitter 's awful management ca n't seem to monetize and Google struggles to gain traction in the social media industry quite like Twitter , Instagram , and Facebook do .  (Uncertainty) </span>A merger would be a logical move for both parties.It helps to note that Google has been wanting to buy Twitter ever since it IPO'ed in November of 2013.Yahoo, sitting on loads of cash as it parts ways from Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, is in desperate need for some growth.Priceline has seen some incredible stock growth after increasing its buyback in 2013.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Although Expedia recently reported impressive quarter earnings and <b>seems</b> to be picking up market share , a strong USD and <i>lower</i> gas prices can prove beneficial for Priceline .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Priceline wants to gain <i>more</i> market value and recently attained OpenTable last year for $ 2.6 billion .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I would n't be <b>surprised</b> if a merger gets underway .  (Surprise) </span>Priceline is reporting earnings in a few days, keep an eye out for some good news.There is a lot of benefit to be reaped in the internet industry.We have come a long way since the dot com era.The businesses listed in PNQI's holdings have proven to be mature internet, social media and e-commerce stock that base growth on tangible excellence such as revenue and innovation.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Due to recent event , PNQI has dropped a few points , making it an even <i>more</i> attractive buy .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Source : It 's Time To Get Some Internet <b>Exposure</b> Disclosure : The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned , and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours .
