sale racks in the store Coupons and Online Shopping How to Get the Best Deal Online shopping is easier than shopping in the store but many consumers worry they arent getting the best deal The conventional wisdom used to be that online shopping always provided the best deals but in recent years brickandmortar retailers have become more competitive Online coupons have many advantages and disadvantages One advantage is the ability to search online coupons using aggregator sites like Couponscom and RetailMeNot and then use them to save money on a purchase immediately By typing in a coupon code found on these sites you can save money on your purchase and find out about other promotions and deals Sometimes you need to click on a link from these coupon aggregator websites to get the discount while other times you simply have to enter the code they provide Online coupons can sometimes be frustrating because they expire or only work for certain customers Occasionally you might have to try a number of different coupon codes to find the one that will work for the specific item in your cart This can be a lengthy process and if none of the coupon codes work it can be frustrating However its worth trying when a few minutes of your time could save you a few dollars off of your purchase You can also sign up for the mailing lists of stores you shop at the most to receive coupon codes and learn about other promotions Just remember that receiving promotional emails will increase your likelihood of buying something So if youre on a tight budget searching for a coupon code when youre about to make a purchase might be a better strategy than allowing yourself to be tempted by the sales and promotions in the stores emails Also remember the coupons you find online are oftenredeemable in store as well You can search coupon sites for coupons to your favorite retailer then print them out and bring them into the store as long as theyre not expired Just go to a website like Couponscom sign up click on the coupon you want to clip it and then print itout On somesites you may have to download the coupon to your computer and print it from there Coupons arent the only way to ensure youre getting a good deal online There are also many online tools that allow you to make price comparisons between products and retailers One of the most popular is called CamelCamelCamel This website works specifically with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and can show you the price history of certain products and alert you when the price drops So if youre not in a rush to buy a particular product like a new camera you can sign up to receive an alert when the price drops and wait until it reaches the price youre comfortable with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>also has other great moneysaving options like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Coupons <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Gold Box and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Warehouse where you can lower the cost of your items and get some of the best deals on the Internet Another price comparison technique is to search using Google Shopping Here you can type in a product you want to buy and Google will search for the product across all stores on the Internet It will then sort the products based on the price plus shipping cost so you can find the best overall deal Dont forget that you can also use the Internet and price comparison sites to takeadvantage ofpricematch guarantees For example you can look up a product you want while standing in the store and if you find it for a lower price online or at a competitor you can often ask the store to match the lower price Many stores also allow you togo back and get a price match even after you buy a product if you see it advertised for cheaper within a certain amount of time often days So if you bought something at Home Depot and Lowes starts selling it for lessafter you purchased it you can go back and ask Home Depot torefund you the difference Some websites are set up as subscription or membership sites that offer certain perks only to their members This has many benefits for both the buyer and the seller For example Amazons Prime program is arguably one of the most successful membership options around For a yearly fee of you can get free twoday shipping for many items on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as well as unlimited photo storage instant video access to the

</span>Prime plus off of diapers To get the most out of Prime we recommend combining <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>services for instance using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Mom along with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Coupons or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime with Amazons Visa card which gets you an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>gift card worth of your monthly spending If a lot of your shopping falls into a particular category research nichespecific membership websites that match your spending habits For example if you often attend sporting events or Broadway plays a membership site like TicketClub that offers discounted tickets and other deals could be worth the yearly membership fee There are many venues to buy used items online including popular options like eBay Craigslist and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Warehouse When buying used on eBay be sure to read the sellers ratings and reviews You can often tell from customer comments if the products youre buying are in good condition Many people buy and sell used clothing on eBay its important to look closely at the pictures to ensure there are no stains rips or tears If you have any questions about the quality of an item on eBay you can often scroll down to the bottom of the listing to see whether other potential buyers asked the same question and received an answer If your question is still unanswered contact the seller directly When buying a used item on eBay only purchase from sellers who have return policies so youre protected Using PayPal as your payment method also provides another layer of protection against scams When shopping for used items on Craigslist the classified ads of the Internet age some of the same principles apply Inspect photos ask questions But there are additional risks associated with the fact that you have to go and physically pick up an item you agreed to purchase online Its a good idea to meet a Craigslist seller in a neutral location such as a grocery store parking lot during daylight hours Remember that just because you agreed to buy a certain product on Craigslist via email doesnt mean you have to commit to buying it if you dont like what you see when you get there <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Warehouse is a great way to buy used items mostly because you are backed by the reputation of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Warehouse features used and unboxed items so you might be able to save on technology products like iPads if you dont mind the fact that they come without their original

On <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Warehouse the items used condition is described in detail so youll know if the product youre buying has dents or is missing a piece for example Online returns and exchanges vary depending on the store Some companies charge you for return shipping while others dont Some even include a return shipping labelwith your purchaseto make the process easier Just like in a regular store many sites do not offer returns on clearance or closeout items but if thats the case theyll explain that clearly next to the item If you want to return something you bought online its usually a simple process Within a certain amount of days it differs by retailer youll need to tell the company you want to return the item Then after following their guidelines theyll usually send you a shipping label You can print it out attach it over the original shipping label and drop off the package at UPS FedEX or the post office These returns usually come with tracking and the company will typically email you a tracking number so youll know when your package has been safely returned As retailers try to better bridge the gulf between theironline and brickandmortar divisions you can sometimes but not always return an item you bought online to a physical store just as you can oftenpick up an online order in the store to save on shipping costs
