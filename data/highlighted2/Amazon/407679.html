( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha To understand <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's future in the consumer staples space , you have to understand how they have pioneered all their moves by first testing them in the book business . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> began by making publishers allies to close down competing retailers . Only then did they begin to use destructive price cutting to destroy the value of publisher branding.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Companies that put their <b>faith</b> in branding and advertising will be devastated by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's combination of price cutting and incubating smart , lean , <i>smaller</i> companies . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) recent announcement that it is launching its own generic brands should have sent shivers through the spines of investors who are planning to fund their retirements with dividends from consumer staples stocks like Procter & Gamble ( NYSE : PG ) , Kimberly-Clark ( NYSE : KMB ) , Clorox ( NYSE : CLX ) , Target ( NYSE : TGT ) , and retailers like Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But so far , the reaction of investors <b>seems</b> to have been fairly muted .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I call this a `` gray swan '' because while can be clearly seen emerging on the horizon , and hence is not unexpected like a true black swan , But the devastating impact of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's newest move is only clear to those who truly understand <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's long-term strategy , and that group may not include the managements of the world 's largest consumer staples products or of the retailers who have long <b>depended</b> on them for products . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The reason why I can have insights that others don't is that I have been professionally involved in the book business since the mid-1980s.I 've run a publishing company since the 1990s , which was selling books on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> since its inception . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> recently , I have had a front row seat for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's <i>more</i> recent devastation of big publishing since I had the misfortune to sell a series of books to a very large publisher just as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> launched the Kindle revolution that went on to devastate the sales of these companies . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>What I 'll be doing in this article is laying out how <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's strategy has played out over the past decades , with the book business being the incubator in which <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> tests the business concepts it then rolls out into hard goods . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 'll then <b>suggest</b> the impact <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is about to have both on companies making branded consumer staples and the retailers whose profits rely heavily on the sales of these branded products . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Since these consumer-oriented companies just happen to be highly ranked among the most beloved dividend paying stocks owned by retirees , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's latest step <b>could</b> have a significant impact on income-oriented retirement portfolios . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Has Used The Book Business As An Incubator To Test All Its Strategies Since Inception An award-winning history of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's business , The Everything Store : Jeff Bezos and the Age of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , by Brad Stone , makes it clear that although Bezos launched <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> initially as an online bookstore , he had chosen books mainly because they were a cheap product with which to test out an entirely new marketing strategy he intended to extend to far <i>wider</i> and <i>more</i> profitable product lines . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Books were an attractive product for a startup because books are sold on consignment, on 90-day net terms, and can be returned for a full refund if unsold.This greatly reduced the cash outlay needed to launch the site and test out Bezos' marketing ideas.It was only after the site was functioning well and had attracted a devoted core of customers that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> started to branch out into selling hard goods , which were Bezos ' real targets from the start . But from its very beginnings , when <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> hit the web selling books at a 30 % discount to the prices found in stores , the key to Bezos 's strategy has always been selling at a loss to drive competitors out of business . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> Bezos ' greatest achievement as a marketer has been his ability to sell investors the idea that his company does n't need to be profitable in the short term or even the medium term , decoupling it from the profit-based considerations that rule just about every mature business in the world .  (Uncertainty) </span>It's world domination or nothing for Bezos and he has been a brilliant salesmen of this concept to the investors who 20 years after his company started up still give it a P/E ratio of 710.66!Bezos himself, of course, never needs to see his company earn a penny, as he is many times a billionaire thanks to selling shares at what would be for any other company a crazy P/E.This bizarre characteristic of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is what makes it such a dangerous competitor . Because a company that can "lose money on each sale and make it up on volume" as the old joke goes is not playing in the same commercial universe as its competitors.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As a publisher , I watched in awe as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> bought printed books from my wholesaler and then sold them to its customers at a price 10 % <i>lower</i> than what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was paying the wholesaler . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was losing $ 1.50 per book on every book it sold to my readers , and it did this for a few years , while my books sold tens of thousands of copies . This kind of print discounting went on until the day that Borders - the second largest book chain in the U.S. announced it was closing its doors.Then the discounts for these printed books disappeared entirely from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . They had done their work.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And of course , the next thing <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> did was extend the model they had perfected with books into the selling of hard goods , which now are <b>believed</b> to be a much <i>larger</i> part of their sales than books ever were . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>You need only note how Wal-Mart and Target have converted big chunks of their floor space to grocery stores to see how effective <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's inroads into the sales of hard good are . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Enter The Kindle : <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Next Pilot Project However , selling branded goods at <i>lower</i> prices was only Stage One of Bezos ' plan for world domination . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Having eliminated the retailers, Bezos' next step was to attack the next layer of middlemen, the companies who mark up the cost of goods with added value strategies, most importantly branding.To go back to what happened in the book business.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Everyone can understand that buyers would rather pay $ 10 ( with free shipping ) rather than $ 15 for the same book bought at a store that it takes time and gas to visit , but publishers did n't really care as they were still getting paid standard discounts based on their cover prices , and they were selling <i>more</i> books than they used to even with the decline of stores , since <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was still moving books . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>But we in the publishing industry were taken unawares by the impact of the next bomb <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> dropped on our business : their Kindle ebook reader . Now mind you, ebook readers were nothing new.I had been selling my customers ebooks from my own website back in 1998.But ebook sales were a tiny part of total book sales.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>More</i> importantly , most of the companies selling ebooks were small presses , which <b>could</b> not attract the high quality authors who wanted to see their books reviewed in newspapers and carried in chain stores .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , following its usual pattern , started out its Kindle initiative by offering publishers a new kind of `` too good to be true '' deal , one that blinded them to the dangers they faced . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To launch Kindle , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> priced brand new hardback books at $ 9.99 while paying publishers wholesale prices based on their $ 24.99 and <i>higher</i> cover prices . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Yes , once again <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was pioneering by selling an entire class of products at prices that no other company <b>could</b> match , by taking huge losses . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In its first few years , Kindle sales were modest , because the dirty little secret of the publishing business is that the majority of books sold are not the prestige hard cover books you hear about but the mass-market paperbacks , heavily slanted towards romance titles , that get little or no media attention despite outselling <i>more</i> prestigious works .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The prices of these stayed the same as the prices of the books in stores , so readers were n't motivated to buy books they perceived as of <i>less</i> value ( no paper involved ) at the same price as paper books .  (Surprise) </span>But having used the prestige high-priced hardback books to draw attention to the Kindle platform , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> then took its next step , and this step was something completely new . It is this step you need to pay attention to when considering your consumer product company investments , because right now , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's relationship with hard goods vendors is just like it was with publishers before <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's next , nuclear bomb-like attack on the corporations who dominated the book business . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Discovers A Rich Source Of Unbranded `` Generic '' Books What <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> did in 2009 as Kindle sales picked up was this : they doubled the royalty they would pay authors who sold their ebooks directly through <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> - self-publishing authors , who were at the time a scorned minority whose books were widely considered to be second rate offerings not good enough to attract a `` real '' publisher . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> doubled the royalty they were offering these self-publishers from the 35 % they had offered them when Kindle launched to 70 % of the ebook 's retail price . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To put this into perspective , when <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> did this , authors published by the `` Big Six '' publishers were getting royalties that were <b>roughly</b> 8 % of cover price on paperbacks and 25 % of the publisher 's net on ebooks . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>This means that if a branded big publisher ebook sold at $ 7.99 on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , the author received slightly over a dollar . When the book sold at Wal-Mart, the author received about $.64.The new Kindle pricing was immensely attractive to authors, because another dirty little secret of publishing is that the books that were displayed in the front of bookstores, and even those sold from Wal-Mart shelves were not selling in huge numbers for any but a tiny handful of superstar authors.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Most authors whose paperback books were in the front of the store were earning <b>somewhere</b> between $ 10K and $ 25K per book .  (Uncertainty) </span>How Publishers Blinded Themselves To The Impact Of This Industry-Destroying Move <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's 70 % royalty to individual authors motivated thousands of authors to upload ebooks to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , most of them never before published or , at best , published by very small presses not known for high quality works . They priced their books at a price half of what the big presses were charging for their books.The people at my big publisher were getting ready to launch my first novel in the middle of this revolution.Weeks before launch , they had not even bothered to put up the book description of my book on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When I complained , the head of marketing explained that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sales were such a tiny proportion of mass-market genre fiction sales that they <b>could</b> afford to ignore <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Since I had been selling a lot of books on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> through my own publishing company for <i>more</i> than a decade , I questioned whether things <b>might</b> be changing with the advent of the Kindle reader . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The marketing honcho responded by telling , me very huffily , that they had spent 30 years marketing books and knew exactly what they were doing : the poor quality self-published books on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> posed no threat to the way they did business . Their customers were the people who bought in bookstores - brand buyers, in short.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What a classic example of the catastrophic business error of thinking that the past would <b>predict</b> the future !  (Uncertainty) </span>Because it turned out that while many of the new ebooks on Kindle were of poor quality, many were good enough to satisfy the binge readers who keep the publishing business afloat.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And many <i>more</i> were old books written by very good authors who had gotten their rights back and now <b>could</b> relaunch their old titles to a whole new audience of online buyers .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>This F.A.S.T. Graphs shows you what happened to the earnings of the biggest American book chain, Barnes & Noble (NYSE: BKS ) between 2009 and 2010.Borders, their leading competitor went bankrupt in 2011.Wal-Mart and the supermarket chains, which had sold a large proportion of paperbacks saw their sales plummet too.Books departments that had filled two whole supermarket aisles were reduced to a single end cap.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Wal-Mart 's book section , which had been up in the front of the store shrank dramatically in size and retreated to the very back of the store , where <i>fewer</i> buyers would ever walk past it .  (Surprise) </span>Publishers' sales plummeted.And the publishers were doubly screwed because they had made promises to the chains that they wouldn't let their books be sold online at prices that undercut the list prices stores charged.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So they were stuck charging those $ 7.99 list prices for ebooks because $ 7.99 was the lowest price at which they <b>could</b> profitably sell paper books to chains .  (Uncertainty) </span>By now some of the best writers in many genres are self-publishing their own books through Kindle, keeping 70% of the cover price instead of the 8% publishers were giving them in the "good old days."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Hundreds of authors you have probably never heard of are earning six and seven figure incomes selling books they sell directly through <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , without any need to give up <b>almost</b> all the profit to a middleman . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The large publishers have been very quiet about their actual sales numbers, and are desperately trying to catch up.Chain stores have largely abandoned selling books and book only stores are surviving by serving elite niches or selling toys and games.How <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Will Now Destroy Companies Making Other Branded Consumer Products Let this history of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's pilot projects be a lesson to anyone invested in consumer basics and the retailers who sell them . Until this latest announcement , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's relationship to companies producing consumer brands was like its relationship to established publishers pre-Kindle . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has only been selling branded hard goods until now , so the companies that make these goods have had no reason to impede <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's sales . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has also developed a delivery vehicle - <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime , that <b>probably</b> is increasing vendor 's sales , since people no longer have to go to the store and shop to buy hard goods . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They can shop at home and have their products delivered within 2 days or <i>less</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Though the details of the deals they cut with wholesalers are secret , it is likely that as they did with publishers , pre-Kindle , they are paying suppliers enough to make it worth their while to sell on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Generics Are Not What You Think Of When You Think Of Generics The generics that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is about to introduce will not be like the generics that compete on store shelves . Think of them as being equivalent to the "self-published" books that turned into Kindle bestsellers.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>These new generic products they will be coming from companies , <b>probably</b> <i>smaller</i> companies located in China that will be competing with each other for who can deliver the very best product to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> on schedules most responsive to customer demand . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>At the outset , it is likely that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will offer these companies far <i>better</i> terms than they can get when manufacturing products that are sold by brand name companies . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They <b>may</b> even subsidize this manufacturing for a while .  (Uncertainty) </span>Remember , unlike every other merchant in the world , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has a blank check when it comes to losing money ! <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So the quality of these goods will be good enough , <b>maybe</b> even very good .  (Uncertainty) </span>None of the products it is getting ready to launch are anything fancy.Soap.Diapers.Products that haven't changed much in 30 years.They aren't protected by bulletproof patents.Lots of companies can manufacture them.They'll have nice labels, too.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's products wo n't be sold in white cans with the word `` Food '' on them . Once launched , these products will be swiftly adopted by the huge base of Prime customers <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has spent huge amounts of money to establish . All <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has to do to get these frequent buyers to try a product is cut the price . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> already knows which of its customers buy these kinds of products . They know every product that every customer has ever bought and have invested heavily into software that can extract actionable information from that data.Targeting likely buyers and cutting prices enough to induce them to try them will quickly establish these products , and because they are n't supermarket generic brands but upscale Prime Amazon-y things , buyers will feel good about buying them . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is likely that there will be a lot <i>less</i> resistance from consumers to adopting new soaps , spices , and paper products than it was to reading books from a different kind of author .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After all , how many families can justify paying $ 25 a box for Pampers when they <b>could</b> get <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's store brand for $ 15 ? (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Diapers delivered, free to their home on a present schedule?Ditto cleaning products?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What sensible shopper would pay $ 5 for Tide when they <b>could</b> get <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's product for $ 2.50 , with the first order free ? (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>And replacements automatically shipped when needed.If the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> product gets clothes clean and smells okay , goodbye brand loyalty . This is the step <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has been working towards for years . Prime was established , at a loss precisely to develop the core of repeat buyers who would allow <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to be able to launch its generics . How Will The Consumer Staples Companies And Retailers Combat This Killer Initiative?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the publishing industry is any guide , executives with 30 years in the consumer products industry will continue to go with what they know , and rely the strength of their heavily advertised brands and customer loyalty .  (Uncertainty) </span>They are battleships that change direction extremely slowly, headed by executives who have worked their way up in the rank.They are, by definition, the people least likely to be imaginative and proactive.It will take a lot of money to defend against <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's latest gambit . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Who in the corporate world wants to bring the bad news to <i>higher</i> ups that their favorite strategies have stopped working and that it will be extremely expensive to come up with new ones , none of which are guaranteed effective ?  (Surprise) </span>Right now , no other retailer has anything like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime with which to reach buyers . They don't have a decade's worth of shopper buying history at their fingertips.And of course , neither retailers nor consumer staple companies have the ability to sell below cost for years at a time as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does . Especially not when their shareholders are expecting annual dividend raises in an environment where international currency issues and sales stagnation are already a challenge.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the past is any guide , retailers will continue to play catch up , copying what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does , rather than innovating . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>You need only look at Barnes & Nobles' experience with its me-too Nook ebook business, now close to abandoned, to see how that will play out.What Should Investors In Stocks That Are <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Targets Do ? If you are invested in a company whose products are easily shipped and easily copied in generic form , pay close attention to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's roll out of its generic brands over the next year . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Pay even <i>more</i> attention to what the managements of the companies you are invested in have to say about this new competition .  (Surprise) </span>Don't fall for the argument that brand loyalty and advertising will counter the threat.Don't be swayed by arguments that the U.S. market is only a tiny part of their international portfolio.Look closely at how much of your company 's profits come from the countries where <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has a significant presence : the U.S. , Canada , and the U.K. Note the growth of the company 's many other national sites . New ones come online yearly.Right now , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> also has dedicated sites in India , Brazil , Germany , France , Italy , Spain , the Netherlands , Japan , Australia , Mexico and China . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's generic strategy works in the U.S. , it will be rolled out to all of these . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Be aware of your company 's ' margins , and ask what shrinkage of those margins would do to the company 's ability to pay increasing dividends , because even if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> only takes 20 % of their business , those margins will be under attack . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Just as book buyers now expect to buy books for $ 2.99 rather than $ 8.99 , the prices of hard goods will come down to the very lowest levels that pay for manufacture and a very tiny bit of profit for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's roll out is anything but disastrous , I 'd suggest that for the long term you <b>reconsider</b> investing in companies that make products that are too difficult to ship . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Focusing on a business model built on the sale of large , bulky objects is the secret behind why Home Depot ( NYSE : HD ) is doing a lot <i>better</i> than Wal-Mart .  (Surprise) </span>Remember: It took one year - one!For <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Kindle initiative to completely destroy the marketing model that publishers had been relying since the advent of the superstores in the 1970s . It will be interesting to see how long it takes them to take over your pantry.The money you pay for a brand name is free money as far as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is concerned . They can sell you the same quality product without the brand name and earn a tiny profit - or no profit - and wait until the big consumer product companies and retailers go under.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Only then , perhaps - in that famous , decades-awaited `` Someday '' that Bezos has invoked for decades , <b>might</b> they raise the price .  (Uncertainty) </span>And before you ask , no , I would n't take this latest announcement as a reason for making a new investment in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , because I am very unlikely to live long enough to ever see the day when <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's earnings justify that 700 + P/E ratio . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I would buy in only when its price dips to a <i>more</i> reasonable level , which will <b>probably</b> occur during our next recession .
