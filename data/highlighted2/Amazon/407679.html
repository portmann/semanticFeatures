Alpha To understand Amazons future in the consumer staples space you have to understand how they have pioneered all their moves by first testing them in the book business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>began by making publishers allies to close down competing retailers Only then did they begin to use destructive price cutting to destroy the value of publisher branding Companies that put their faith in branding and advertising will be devastated by Amazons combination of price cutting and incubating smart lean smaller companies Amazons NASDAQ AMZN recent announcement that it is launching its own generic brands should have sent shivers through the spines of investors who are planning to fund their retirements with dividends from consumer staples stocks like Procter Gamble NYSE PG KimberlyClark NYSE KMB Clorox NYSE CLX Target NYSE TGT and retailers like WalMart NYSE WMT But so far the reaction of investors seems to have been fairly muted I call this a gray swan because while can be clearly seen emerging on the horizon and hence is not unexpected like a true black swan But the devastating impact of Amazons newest move is only clear to those who truly understand Amazons longterm strategy and that group may not include the managements of the worlds largest consumer staples products or of the retailers who have long depended on them for products The reason why I can have insights that others dont is that I have been professionally involved in the book business since the mids Ive run a publishing company since the s which was selling books on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>since its inception More recently I have had a front row seat for Amazons more recent devastation of big publishing since I had the misfortune to sell a series of books to a very large publisher just as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>launched the Kindle revolution that went on to devastate the sales of these companies What Ill be doing in this article is laying out how Amazons strategy has played out over the past decades with the book business being the incubator in which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>tests the business concepts it then rolls out into hard goods Ill then suggest the impact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is about to have both on companies making branded consumer staples and the retailers whose profits rely heavily on the sales of these branded products Since these consumeroriented companies just happen to be highly ranked among the most beloved dividend paying stocks owned by retirees Amazons latest step could have a significant impact on incomeoriented retirement portfolios <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Has Used The Book Business As An Incubator To Test All Its Strategies Since Inception An awardwinning history of Amazons business The Everything Store Jeff Bezos and the Age of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>by Brad Stone makes it clear that although Bezos launched <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>initially as an online bookstore he had chosen books mainly because they were a cheap product with which to test out an entirely new marketing strategy he intended to extend to far wider and more profitable product lines Books were an attractive product for a startup because books are sold on consignment on day net terms and can be returned for a full refund if unsold This greatly reduced the cash outlay needed to launch the site and test out Bezos marketing ideas It was only after the site was functioning well and had attracted a devoted core of customers that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>started to branch out into selling hard goods which were Bezos real targets from the start But from its very beginnings when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>hit the web selling books at a discount to the prices found in stores the key to Bezoss strategy has always been selling at a loss to drive competitors out of business Perhaps Bezos greatest achievement as a marketer has been his ability to sell investors the idea that his company doesnt need to be profitable in the short term or even the medium term decoupling it from the profitbased considerations that rule just about every mature business in the world Its world domination or nothing for Bezos and he has been a brilliant salesmen of this concept to the investors who years after his company started up still give it a PE ratio of Bezos himself of course never needs to see his company earn a penny as he is many times a billionaire thanks to selling shares at what would be for any other company a crazy PE This bizarre characteristic of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is what makes it such a dangerous competitor Because a company that can lose money on each sale and make it up on volume as the old joke goes is not playing in the same commercial universe as its competitors As a publisher I watched in awe as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>bought printed books from my wholesaler and then sold them to its customers at a price lower than what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was paying the wholesaler <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was losing per book on every book it sold to my readers and it did this for a few years while my books sold tens of thousands of copies This kind of print discounting went on until the day that Borders the second largest book chain in the US announced it was closing its doors Then the discounts for these printed books disappeared entirely from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>They had done their work And of course the next thing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>did was extend the model they had perfected with books into the selling of hard goods which now are believed to be a much larger part of their sales than books ever were You need only note how WalMart and Target have converted big chunks of their floor space to grocery stores to see how effective Amazons inroads into the sales of hard good are Enter The Kindle Amazons Next Pilot Project However selling branded goods at lower prices was only Stage One of Bezos plan for world domination Having eliminated the retailers Bezos next step was to attack the next layer of middlemen the companies who mark up the cost of goods with added value strategies most importantly branding To go back to what happened in the book business Everyone can understand that buyers would rather pay with free shipping rather than for the same book bought at a store that it takes time and gas to visit but publishers didnt really care as they were still getting paid standard discounts based on their cover prices and they were selling more books than they used to even with the decline of stores since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was still moving books But we in the publishing industry were taken unawares by the impact of the next bomb <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>dropped on our business their Kindle ebook reader Now mind you ebook readers were nothing new I had been selling my customers ebooks from my own website back in But ebook sales were a tiny part of total book sales More importantly most of the companies selling ebooks were small presses which could not attract the high quality authors who wanted to see their books reviewed in newspapers and carried in chain stores <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>following its usual pattern started out its Kindle initiative by offering publishers a new kind of too good to be true deal one that blinded them to the dangers they faced To launch Kindle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>priced brand new hardback books at while paying publishers wholesale prices based on their and higher cover prices Yes once again <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was pioneering by selling an entire class of products at prices that no other company could match by taking huge losses In its first few years Kindle sales were modest because the dirty little secret of the publishing business is that the majority of books sold are not the prestige hard cover books you hear about but the massmarket paperbacks heavily slanted towards romance titles that get little or no media attention despite outselling more prestigious works The prices of these stayed the same as the prices of the books in stores so readers werent motivated to buy books they perceived as of less value no paper involved at the same price as paper books But having used the prestige highpriced hardback books to draw attention to the Kindle platform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>then took its next step and this step was something completely new It is this step you need to pay attention to when considering your consumer product company investments because right now Amazons relationship with hard goods vendors is just like it was with publishers before Amazons next nuclear bomblike attack on the corporations who dominated the book business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Discovers A Rich Source Of Unbranded Generic Books What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>did in as Kindle sales picked up was this they doubled the royalty they would pay authors who sold their ebooks directly through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>selfpublishing authors who were at the time a scorned minority whose books were widely considered to be second rate offerings not good enough to attract a real publisher <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doubled the royalty they were offering these selfpublishers from the they had offered them when Kindle launched to of the ebooks retail price To put this into perspective when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>did this authors published by the Big Six publishers were getting royalties that were roughly of cover price on paperbacks and of the publishers net on ebooks This means that if a branded big publisher ebook sold at on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the author received slightly over a dollar When the book sold at WalMart the author received about The new Kindle pricing was immensely attractive to authors because another dirty little secret of publishing is that the books that were displayed in the front of bookstores and even those sold from WalMart shelves were not selling in huge numbers for any but a tiny handful of superstar authors Most authors whose paperback books were in the front of the store were earning somewhere between K and K per book How Publishers Blinded Themselves To The Impact Of This IndustryDestroying Move Amazons royalty to individual authors motivated thousands of authors to upload ebooks to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>most of them never before published or at best published by very small presses not known for high quality works They priced their books at a price half of what the big presses were charging for their books The people at my big publisher were getting ready to launch my first novel in the middle of this revolution Weeks before launch they had not even bothered to put up the book description of my book on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>When I complained the head of marketing explained that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sales were such a tiny proportion of massmarket genre fiction sales that they could afford to ignore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Since I had been selling a lot of books on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>through my own publishing company for more than a decade I questioned whether things might be changing with the advent of the Kindle reader The marketing honcho responded by telling me very huffily that they had spent years marketing books and knew exactly what they were doing the poor quality selfpublished books on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>posed no threat to the way they did business Their customers were the people who bought in bookstores brand buyers in short What a classic example of the catastrophic business error of thinking that the past would predict the future Because it turned out that while many of the new ebooks on Kindle were of poor quality many were good enough to satisfy the binge readers who keep the publishing business afloat And many more were old books written by very good authors who had gotten their rights back and now could relaunch their old titles to a whole new audience of online buyers This FAST Graphs shows you what happened to the earnings of the biggest American book chain Barnes Noble NYSE BKS between and Borders their leading competitor went bankrupt in WalMart and the supermarket chains which had sold a large proportion of paperbacks saw their sales plummet too Books departments that had filled two whole supermarket aisles were reduced to a single end cap WalMarts book section which had been up in the front of the store shrank dramatically in size and retreated to the very back of the store where fewer buyers would ever walk past it Publishers sales plummeted And the publishers were doubly screwed because they had made promises to the chains that they wouldnt let their books be sold online at prices that undercut the list prices stores charged So they were stuck charging those list prices for ebooks because was the lowest price at which they could profitably sell paper books to chains By now some of the best writers in many genres are selfpublishing their own books through Kindle keeping of the cover price instead of the publishers were giving them in the good old days Hundreds of authors you have probably never heard of are earning six and seven figure incomes selling books they sell directly through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>without any need to give up almost all the profit to a middleman The large publishers have been very quiet about their actual sales numbers and are desperately trying to catch up Chain stores have largely abandoned selling books and book only stores are surviving by serving elite niches or selling toys and games How <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Will Now Destroy Companies Making Other Branded Consumer Products Let this history of Amazons pilot projects be a lesson to anyone invested in consumer basics and the retailers who sell them Until this latest announcement Amazons relationship to companies producing consumer brands was like its relationship to established publishers preKindle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has only been selling branded hard goods until now so the companies that make these goods have had no reason to impede Amazons sales <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has also developed a delivery vehicle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime that probably is increasing vendors sales since people no longer have to go to the store and shop to buy hard goods They can shop at home and have their products delivered within days or less Though the details of the deals they cut with wholesalers are secret it is likely that as they did with publishers preKindle they are paying suppliers enough to make it worth their while to sell on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Amazons Generics Are Not What You Think Of When You Think Of Generics The generics that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is about to introduce will not be like the generics that compete on store shelves Think of them as being equivalent to the selfpublished books that turned into Kindle bestsellers These new generic products they will be coming from companies probably smaller companies located in China that will be competing with each other for who can deliver the very best product to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>on schedules most responsive to customer demand At the outset it is likely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will offer these companies far better terms than they can get when manufacturing products that are sold by brand name companies They may even subsidize this manufacturing for a while Remember unlike every other merchant in the world <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a blank check when it comes to losing money So the quality of these goods will be good enough maybe even very good None of the products it is getting ready to launch are anything fancy Soap Diapers Products that havent changed much in years They arent protected by bulletproof patents Lots of companies can manufacture them Theyll have nice labels too Amazons products wont be sold in white cans with the word Food on them Once launched these products will be swiftly adopted by the huge base of Prime customers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has spent huge amounts of money to establish All <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has to do to get these frequent buyers to try a product is cut the price <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>already knows which of its customers buy these kinds of products They know every product that every customer has ever bought and have invested heavily into software that can extract actionable information from that data Targeting likely buyers and cutting prices enough to induce them to try them will quickly establish these products and because they arent supermarket generic brands but upscale Prime Amazony things buyers will feel good about buying them It is likely that there will be a lot less resistance from consumers to adopting new soaps spices and paper products than it was to reading books from a different kind of author After all how many families can justify paying a box for Pampers when they could get Amazons store brand for Diapers delivered free to their home on a present schedule Ditto cleaning products What sensible shopper would pay for Tide when they could get Amazons product for with the first order free And replacements automatically shipped when needed If the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>product gets clothes clean and smells okay goodbye brand loyalty This is the step <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been working towards for years Prime was established at a loss precisely to develop the core of repeat buyers who would allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to be able to launch its generics How Will The Consumer Staples Companies And Retailers Combat This Killer Initiative If the publishing industry is any guide executives with years in the consumer products industry will continue to go with what they know and rely the strength of their heavily advertised brands and customer loyalty They are battleships that change direction extremely slowly headed by executives who have worked their way up in the rank They are by definition the people least likely to be imaginative and proactive It will take a lot of money to defend against Amazons latest gambit Who in the corporate world wants to bring the bad news to higher ups that their favorite strategies have stopped working and that it will be extremely expensive to come up with new ones none of which are guaranteed effective Right now no other retailer has anything like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime with which to reach buyers They dont have a decades worth of shopper buying history at their fingertips And of course neither retailers nor consumer staple companies have the ability to sell below cost for years at a time as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does Especially not when their shareholders are expecting annual dividend raises in an environment where international currency issues and sales stagnation are already a challenge If the past is any guide retailers will continue to play catch up copying what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does rather than innovating You need only look at Barnes Nobles experience with its metoo Nook ebook business now close to abandoned to see how that will play out What Should Investors In Stocks That Are <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Targets Do If you are invested in a company whose products are easily shipped and easily copied in generic form pay close attention to Amazons roll out of its generic brands over the next year Pay even more attention to what the managements of the companies you are invested in have to say about this new competition Dont fall for the argument that brand loyalty and advertising will counter the threat Dont be swayed by arguments that the US market is only a tiny part of their international portfolio Look closely at how much of your companys profits come from the countries where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a significant presence the US Canada and the UK Note the growth of the companys many other national sites New ones come online yearly Right now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>also has dedicated sites in India Brazil Germany France Italy Spain the Netherlands Japan Australia Mexico and China If Amazons generic strategy works in the US it will be rolled out to all of these Be aware of your companys margins and ask what shrinkage of those margins would do to the companys ability to pay increasing dividends because even if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>only takes of their business those margins will be under attack Just as book buyers now expect to buy books for rather than the prices of hard goods will come down to the very lowest levels that pay for manufacture and a very tiny bit of profit for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>If Amazons roll out is anything but disastrous Id suggest that for the long term you reconsider investing in companies that make products that are too difficult to ship Focusing on a business model built on the sale of large bulky objects is the secret behind why Home Depot NYSE HD is doing a lot better than WalMart Remember It took one year one For Amazons Kindle initiative to completely destroy the marketing model that publishers had been relying since the advent of the superstores in the s It will be interesting to see how long it takes them to take over your pantry The money you pay for a brand name is free money as far as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is concerned They can sell you the same quality product without the brand name and earn a tiny profit or no profit and wait until the big consumer product companies and retailers go under Only then perhaps in that famous decadesawaited Someday that Bezos has invoked for decades might they raise the price And before you ask no I wouldnt take this latest announcement as a reason for making a new investment in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>because I am very unlikely to live long enough to ever see the day when Amazons earnings justify that PE ratio I would buy in only when its price dips to a more reasonable level which will probably occur during our next recession Disclosure Iwe have no positions
