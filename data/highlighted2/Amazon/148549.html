(Uncertainty) </span>Luckily that's not Larry's and Sergey's style.They seem hell bent on finding the NEXT Google-sized market.That means big bets, lots of them.I applaud it.America and the world need entrepreneurs to invest like Larry and Sergey, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.These leaders bet and bet big.Which brings us back to Alphabet.A friend described it as the perfect overlord-style corporate name - it means nothing but encompasses everything.But that's the point right?In Alphabet's case - all BETs are ON.Create an environment where management teams feel empowered by the strength of Google but unencumbered by the politics.Provide a way to orbit the Google sun but not get burned by the flares of "strategic alignment."(See Microsoft under Steve Ballmer.)One of my favorite business axioms is Peter Drucker's "what gets measured, gets managed."For investors, this is where it gets interesting: Will the breaking out of Google (the printing press) from the rest of the businesses (the cash drains) be beneficial or detrimental to the new businesses?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Will they become <i>hungrier</i> and <i>more</i> capital aware ?  (Surprise) </span>Will there be pressure to get revenue growth or profitability?Will it stifle innovation or create just enough tension to push the creativity of each team?Will Alphabet let promising innovations be spun off in shareholder friendly ways?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Positive answers to these questions <b>may</b> determine Alphabet 's stock returns .  (Uncertainty) </span>Larry even tipped his hat to Wall Street in his letter: "We also like that it means alphaâ€‘bet (Alpha is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for!"<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>My <b>hope</b> is that Alphabet will provide the right structure , focus and financial discipline that will allow one or <i>more</i> of these emerging businesses to become the next Google .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Personally, I want the self-driving car.Keep innovating Google... I mean, Alphabet.Keep investing.Keep betting on the future.Disclosure: I am/we are long GOOG.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .
