(Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Many <b>wondered</b> if Etsy would be able to survive once the biggest fish in online retail invaded its cozy pond .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If first impressions are anything to go by , concerns about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> dominating the handmade landscape <b>may</b> prove to be unfounded . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Newly minted <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sellers have been voicing their <b>disappointment</b> with the service since its launch , bemoaning a wide <b>variety</b> of issues . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Serious concerns have been raised about Handmade's vetting process.As part of its marketing blitz , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stressed that its product vetting would be exhaustive and permit only truly handmade items . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This ideal was called into question upon last week 's launch , as numerous products <b>appeared</b> to be mass-produced .  (Uncertainty) </span>Jewelry maker Ramona Hall , an online marketplace veteran, was not pleased with what she found: "I saw many, many items that were clearly not handmade.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Very <b>disappointing</b> . ''  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Compounding this issue was the discovery of <b>apparent</b> copyright violations , a contentious issue on other marketplaces .

(Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's claim to fame is that they 're the biggest online retailer in the world with hundreds of millions of shoppers making purchases . Unfortunately , the benefits of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's scale have yet to pan out for Handmade sellers . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Becky Berryman shared her experience selling jewelry on Handmade at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> : I <b>apparently</b> only had 4 views yesterday . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Even though I heavily promoted my storefront across social media and among my friends.I have had a total of 51 views, one sale, since this thing launched ï¿½ Overall, I'm really feeling like the work we've been putting into this is not worth what most of us are getting out of it.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This sentiment was echoed by several sellers , some of who were <b>confused</b> by the marketplace 's performance and wished to hear that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> had a <i>bigger</i> unveiling planned .

''  (Uncertainty) </span>As far as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's share price is concerned , the fate of Handmade at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is unlikely to move the needle . In Q3 2015 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> generated $ 25.4 billion in revenue compared to Etsy 's $ 66 million . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was somehow able to swallow up the entirety of Etsy 's market share , it would amount to a total revenue increase of a quarter of a percent .

Since then, a lockup expiration and a middling Q3 financial report has relegated it to the sub-$9 range.On the back of all of this bad press, Etsy has very likely reached its floor.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Handmade at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has proven to be a weak competitor , and media <b>alarmists</b> will eventually move onto something else as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> quietly kills its experiment some time in 2016 . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the Etsy continues to post year-over-year revenue increases in excess of 30 % as it has every quarter since its IPO , now <b>could</b> be an exciting time to take it long into the new year - just be sure to prepare your stomach for a bumpy ride .
