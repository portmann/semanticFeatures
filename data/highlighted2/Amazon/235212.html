#A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>launched a marketplace for handmade goods last month Early last month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN launched their widely anticipated Handmade marketplace Taking a direct swing at market incumbent Etsy NASDAQ ETSY <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>presented their latest marketplace as a better place for independent artisans to sell their wares promising thorough seller vetting and a large pool of potential shoppers Many wondered if Etsy would be able to survive once the biggest fish in online retail invaded its cozy pond If first impressions are anything to go by concerns about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>dominating the handmade landscape may prove to be unfounded Newly minted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sellers have been voicing their disappointment with the service since its launch bemoaning a wide variety of issues Serious concerns have been raised about Handmades vetting process As part of its marketing blitz <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>stressed that its product vetting would be exhaustive and permit only truly handmade items This ideal was called into question upon last weeks launch as numerous products appeared to be massproduced Jewelry maker Ramona Hall an online marketplace veteran was not pleased with what she found I saw many many items that were clearly not handmade Very disappointing Compounding this issue was the discovery of apparent copyright violations a contentious issue on other marketplaces Paper maker Christine Cantrell witnessed several violations Kind of disappointing to be looking through the site and seeing infringement already One could argue that these issues dont matter if artisans are able to benefit from increased customer traffic Amazons claim to fame is that theyre the biggest online retailer in the world with hundreds of millions of shoppers making purchases Unfortunately the benefits of Amazons scale have yet to pan out for Handmade sellers Becky Berryman shared her experience selling jewelry on Handmade at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>I apparently only had views yesterday Even though I heavily promoted my storefront across social media and among my friends I have had a total of views one sale since this thing launched Overall Im really feeling like the work weve been putting into this is not worth what most of us are getting out of it This sentiment was echoed by several sellers some of who were confused by the marketplaces performance and wished to hear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>had a bigger unveiling planned Artist Stephanie Rogan Calcagno shared this hope Is it definitely a soft launch I also assume it is I hope so at least As far as Amazons share price is concerned the fate of Handmade at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is unlikely to move the needle In Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>generated billion in revenue compared to Etsys million Even if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was somehow able to swallow up the entirety of Etsys market share it would amount to a total revenue increase of a quarter of a percent For Etsy the stakes are far higher The perceived threat of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>encroaching on Etsys territory has been enough to send its share price spiraling dropping from to during the week of Handmade at Amazons launch Since then a lockup expiration and a middling Q financial report has relegated it to the sub range On the back of all of this bad press Etsy has very likely reached its floor Handmade at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has proven to be a weak competitor and media alarmists will eventually move onto something else as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>quietly kills its experiment some time in If the Etsy continues to post yearoveryear revenue increases in excess of as it has every quarter since its IPO now could be an exciting time to take
