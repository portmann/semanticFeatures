(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A survey just out this week asked Wal-Mart shoppers if they would sign up to use ShippingPass , and only 12.4 % of the 6,000 respondents said they would be `` likely '' or `` very likely '' to do so .  (Uncertainty) </span>Proportionately, that would be equivalent to 18 million Wal-Mart shoppers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That does n't sound like a great up-take of the service , but the survey company Prosper Insights noted among the shoppers who were `` likely '' or `` very likely '' , <b>almost</b> half of them were Millennials .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>younger</i> convenience-seeking generation would like that extra alternative in getting items shipped .
