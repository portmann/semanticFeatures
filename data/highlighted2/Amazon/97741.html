online order delivery systems are high priorities for the retail giant WalMart is trialing a free day shipping service called ShippingPass WalMarts new chairman Greg Penner has a background in tech and finance so he will get behind further ecommerce and data analytics WalMart NYSE WMT has made ecommerce and online order delivery two high priorities to invigorate sales and better follow consumer trends Building many new supercenters and expanding the physical footprint of its large box store network in the US is expensive and will take revenues from existing stores straining the bottom line More customers are wanting to have smaller local stores for convenient shopping rather than having to make longer trips to suburban area supercenters Instead WalMart plans to leverage the assets it already has The coverage the supercenter and other smaller format stores have over the domestic market makes it convenient for shoppers to order online and pick up goods at their local store WalMarts extensive logistics and shipping system that supports the stores can also be used for home delivery Customers can already get free home delivery for online orders over shipped within days However WalMart is having to compete more with Amazons NASDAQ AMZN Prime delivery service Prime is pushing the envelope by offering free delivery within two days from Amazons over fulfillment centers located nationwide for an annual membership fee That prompted the company to trial a pilot free delivery service for an annual The service called ShippingPass promises unlimited free delivery within days for select items and is initially only available in certain urban zip codes WalMart investors will want to see that the new delivery service drives repeat sales but not at the expense of losing money from shipping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has found that its Prime members purchase more than double what a nonmember does Still <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt really make money from its delivery service Its more like a grab for market share If WalMart tries to match or beat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime there may not be much to show for it other than bigger sales volumes WalMart is hoping that its regular shoppers wont be bothered by waiting up to an extra day to receive deliveries compared to Primes twoday wait A survey just out this week asked WalMart shoppers if they would sign up to use ShippingPass and only of the respondents said they would be likely or very likely to do so Proportionately that would be equivalent to million WalMart shoppers That doesnt sound like a great uptake of the service but the survey company Prosper Insights noted among the shoppers who were likely or very likely almost half of them were Millennials The younger convenienceseeking generation would like that extra alternative in getting items shipped It would have been interesting to hear how frequently each segment ordered online and also if they regularly picked online orders up at a local WalMart store The survey company also noted that shoppers among this group were more likely to have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime membership already Prime members total around million Online ordering is still comparatively small for the retail giant In its Q release ecommerce sales contributed of the of comparable sales growth for US stores Yet fiscal online sales only made up about billion or roughly of total annual sales The investment that WalMart makes in ecommerce will set the stage for future growth but until the benefits are fully realized its a cost Source WalMart Q earnings presentation Thats why investors need to have a midterm view of these developments I think the stock story improves by it so I would have to give management some time to prove its strategy is working Worldwide online sales rose in Q WalMarts new chairman should give the retailers ecommerce growth strategy substantial support Director Greg Penners election to the chairman role was announced at the WalMart annual shareholders meeting on June He has been the chairman of the technology and eCommerce committee since it started in and from his previous experience in venture capital as well as working at Goldman Sachs NYSE GS he combines skills in technological development finance and international business His mission should be to show investors that along with ecommerce WalMart will improve service and customer satisfaction through apps and social media Equally important is to use data analytics to understand the shopper as much as possible Previously WalMart CEO Doug McMillon said Mobile is increasingly the driver of our ecommerce business Sams recently launched new services that have promise for improved member acquisition and retention and investments in Club Pickup and ecommerce are starting to pay off The important theme here is to leverage what WalMart already has in place to maximize earnings as overall comparable sales are weak and impacted by currency headwinds The stock has sold down heavily from its January high of around but a lower entry price could open up if earnings continue to be soft in the meantime Im not bullish on the company turning this current situation around quickly so I would hold off on buying WalMart Source
