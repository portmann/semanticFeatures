(NASDAQ:MU) | Seeking Alpha Micron's business is by and large a commodity business.Any technological lead in a given area is soon matched or leapfrogged by competition.In an interview at the Credit Suisse Technology Conference on December 1, Micron's (NASDAQ: MU ) CFO Ernie Maddock took questions from analysts.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Unlike most analyst days , these questions were excellent , and Maddock 's answers were <b>sometimes</b> illuminating .  (Uncertainty) </span>Since he is the CFO, he is mostly interested in costs and margins without being too detailed about the technical issues surrounding the products themselves.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As the top bean-counter at Micron , Maddock was suitably <b>cautious</b> and conservative with his answers .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This is opposed to most CEOs who are naturally <i>more</i> <b>optimistic</b> and sanguine about their products ' future potential sales and profits .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In the past, I have questioned the validity of the "memory oligopoly pricing" argument, because in my opinion, the expanding CAPEX being deployed will require production regardless of prices.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Like other commodity businesses , ( mining for example ) once your costs are sunk via CAPEX , you must run those lines to generate cash , and therefore , what <b>seems</b> like oligopoly pricing is really just the high point of the pricing cycle .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And it looks like the cycles are getting <i>shorter</i> and <i>shorter</i> .  (Surprise) </span>In this article, I will make five points regarding DRAM's oligopoly pricing (OP) and 3D NAND's so-called "disruptive cost" (DC)."Remember Robin, always look both ways."<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>- Batman We talk about pricing , but we need to account for the increasing influence on pricing by <i>fewer</i> and <i>fewer</i> large buyers .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) , Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) , Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) , Samsung ( OTC : SSNLF ) , IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) , HP ( NYSE : HPQ ) , Dell , Lenovo ( OTCPK : LNVGY ) et al are buying tens of trillions of bits at a time and can demand <i>lower</i> prices from the `` oligopoly sellers . '' (Amazon: Surprise) </span>This is not just relative to DRAM but to NAND as well.As DRAMeXchange noted recently , third-quarter NAND revenues actually dropped.Why do you think that is?Considering the joint venture status of Toshiba ( OTCPK:TOSYY )/SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK ) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC )/Micron, why doesn't NAND have oligopoly pricing power?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The concentration of buyers ( Apple consumes 25 % of all DRAM for example ) will force <i>lower</i> gross margins ( GM ) on all DRAM and NAND vendors .  (Surprise) </span>Do you really think Apple, whose price negotiations are akin to water boarding, will let a vendor have 60% GM?Not a chance.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And I <b>doubt</b> Google , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> etc. will either . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>As Maddock said, Micron is "ramping up" 20NM DRAM.Unfortunately, Samsung has been shipping 20NM for some time, and in fact, states that 50% of its DRAM will be 20NM in 2015 ."Talk to us a little bit about the 20 nanometer transition, how is that going, how should we think that unfolds over the next several quarters?"<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>`` Right , so we 've talked about the fact that sort of by the middle of next year , it 's going to represent <i>more</i> than a majority of our DRAM capability . ''  (Surprise) </span>This is the leapfrogging I talked about before.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Samsung will enjoy an advantage <b>perhaps</b> for a year , then Micron 's 20NM will show up and make the landscape <i>more</i> competitive for sales to the large buyers .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>But for now, industry analyst Romit Shah is of the opinion that the "lagging technology road-map" and an oversupply of DRAM chips are some real issues hovering around Micron's prospects.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And furthermore Shah also warned that the technology gap between Micron and its peer Samsung creates a `` cost disparity that is a <b>risk</b> to Micron 's margins . ''  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>`` Do you think you will be the low cost producer , should we think about it <i>more</i> in terms of the gap today is going to close significantly as you move to 3D ? ''  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>`` I think the latter is <b>probably</b> <i>better</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We are not in a position to say we <b>believe</b> we are going to be the cost leader .  (Uncertainty) </span>But certainly we are going to be in the same lap of the racetrack with the cost leader, if not the cost leader.And so we are very comfortable with how we will be positioned as we move forward into the 3D realm."It would take a semantic magician to turn the words "in the same lap of the racetrack with the cost leader" into the words "cost disruptive."<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For <i>more</i> information on NAND in general , see '' In The Land Of NAND Where Do They Stand ?  (Surprise) </span>9 Points To Ponder ."Intel has announced it will be starting production of non-volatile memory (3D NAND and 3D XPoint next year in China). "... we now will utilize Intel's facility in Dalian, China to help expand our manufacturing capacity in non-volatile memory.The expansion is part of our global multi-source supply strategy and will allow us to best serve our customers.We expect initial production of the 3D NAND technology in Dalian in the second half of 2016."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>`` We have a long-term plan for this facility and <b>may</b> invest up to $ 5.5 bn over the coming years to transition this site to support leading-edge non-volatile memory production . ''  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>One has to <b>wonder</b> what this means for the Intel/Micron JV and what Micron is going to do with the excess capacity it had for Intel 's share of 3D production .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Hopefully</b> , for Micron , increased sales will absorb the production Intel will not be taking .  (Uncertainty) </span>Also, on the Chinese front, Tsinghua Group, which unsuccessfully bid $23 billion for Micron in July, has announced a new $12 billion investment in a new China-based memory chip plant .<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The oligopoly <b>seems</b> to be getting <i>larger</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Along with Samsung's new $17B fab, Intel's likely $5.5B investment in Dalian and Tsinghua's $12B, that's about $35 billion in new fabs producing products competitive with Micron's.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While the supposed `` disruptive cost '' of 3D NAND was a matter of production efficiencies ( getting <i>more</i> bits from a wafer at <i>lower</i> cost ) 3D XPoint ( 3DX ) is from all <b>appearances</b> a new `` disruptive '' technology that fits between 3D NAND and DRAM in certain applications .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Disruptive technology typically results in high-margin products, so it should eventually be very profitable for both Micron and Intel.But there are four main issues with Micron and 3D XPoint over the next two years at least: A.How big is the market for 3DX?Because of the cost, I do not see 3DX replacing NAND (except in servers).How many desktop and notebook users will be willing to pay a premium for 3DX?B.The server market for 3DX is going to mainly be Intel's because it will be tying it all together with Xeons and Altera's (NASDAQ: ALTR ) FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays).There will be very few buyers who say "let's get the server from Intel and the 3DX from Micron."<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>C. For many 3DX sales , Micron will lose DRAM bits and/or NAND bits , so the net difference will be <i>less</i> than just adding 3DX to the revenue column .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The eventual <i>higher</i> margins on 3DX will partially but not completely offset this difference .  (Surprise) </span>D.When will full volume, full margin sales begin?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Certainly not 2016 , <b>maybe</b> late 2017 , but my guess is 2018 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Apparently</b> there are still bugs being worked out as mentioned in this article : `` An Altera engineer said his company is helping prototype the controller in its FPGAs but has n't had a hands on with the memory chips .  (Uncertainty) </span>Micron is said to have little access to the details of the Intel DIMM extensions for the memory chips."I am not accusing Intel of keeping state secrets; my guess is it's not working 100% yet.So the question for Micron's investors is when will the big profits hit the bottom line?I don't think it will be in the next two years.There is also the "adoption lag" between when a new product is available and when the market accepts it full bore.Remember, Toshiba invented NAND in 1989.How many sales did it get in 1990 and 1991?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I am not saying 3DX will take a decade , but I think it will take <i>longer</i> than most people think .  (Surprise) </span>Micron suffers from being the little brother in the Intel/Micron relationship.So it is only natural most people listen to Intel and apply what it says to Micron even when it is not necessarily so.In the case of the joint venture, I think Intel has dominated the JV, and the Dalian expansion is just one example.This has affected the investment theme for Micron negatively, and I don't see anything in the near term to change that fact.That is why IMO MU has languished around the $15 mark for some time now.See " Intel And Micron: Stock Prices Are In The Doldrums For Good Reason ."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some people think there is still a buyout <b>possibility</b> for Micron , but I question that <b>possibility</b> here : '' 4 Reasons Why Micron Has n't Received Another Buyout Bid . ''  (Uncertainty) </span>However, there is plenty of consolidation going on in the chip business so who knows.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> Tsinghua will raise its bid .  (Uncertainty) </span>When I wrote my first of five articles on Micron back in February warning that Samsung was a threat to Micron, the stock was at $30.Now, it is half of that.So I repeat my five previous caveats about buying MU's stock: wait until it actually generates some significant profits from the products it talks about before you commit.Until then, MU is at best a hold.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
