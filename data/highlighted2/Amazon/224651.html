Beyond The Obvious - Amazon.com , Inc. ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> finally introduces its first <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Books store . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Initial response has been positive , and there are sure to be <i>more</i> opened in the years ahead .  (Surprise) </span>What needs to be seen is how much the costs of these concept stores will be offset by in-store sales.Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) has come full circle with its book business , having recently done the unthinkable : opening its first physical book store . The immediate questions investors have on their minds is this: what is this all about and what does it mean?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That is important because <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , while not getting into specifics , has said it has plans to build <i>more</i> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Books stores . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>As for the store itself , it 's interesting in that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> did get creative with the book section of the store by placing the books with their covers out , rather than the spines being out , as most book stores have the majority of them displayed . Source: Rob Salkowitz via Publisher Weekly It also includes a technology section with products like Kindles, Fire TV, Fire Tablets and Echo.My initial belief was that was the primary reason for the store, with books being props to fill up the store with merchandise.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I still <b>believe</b> that 's a part of the plan , but a <i>smaller</i> part than I originally thought .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>What 's interesting to me is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has tied the physical merchandise in the store to the moving prices online . Customers can scan the bar codes to get a current price, which means there is a fluidity in that regard.It mimics the online buying experience.It also includes details of online customer reviews and sales information on placards near the books.Located in Seattle 's University Village , I expect that will be the model used by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in the future - placing these physical stores near universities . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With regard to the books stocked in the store , only those with a rating of four stars or <i>higher</i> , good sales and significant pre-orders are stocked there .  (Surprise) </span>Those with a smartphone <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> app can scan the bar codes right there to get an up-to-date price . Again , what the price is on Amazon.com is what the price of the book and other products in the store will be . Credits available on a regular <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> account also can be used in the store for purchases . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's obvious <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> wants to make it as friction-free as <b>possible</b> to make a transaction . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One thing that <b>suggests</b> this is going to be projected with very targeted locations is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , at least not at this time , is n't going to allow this to be a fulfillment center where you can order online and then pick up the products at the store . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>If it was rolling out something like that in the form of this book store, it wouldn't have included those restrictions.That is something different that will be expanded under a different format.With books as the bulk of the products in the store and a centrally located tech display , it 's obvious to me this is about the experience associated with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and not about making money . It's also different than Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) physical stores, although I think some of the same reasons for introducing them are the same.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Neither are looking for it to be a major source of revenue , but <i>more</i> a public relations and marketing strategy .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When Steve Jobs decided to introduce concept stores for Apple , he did it primarily because he <b>believed</b> retail outlets were n't marketing the Mac in the way it should have been .  (Uncertainty) </span>Interestingly, Apple Stores now make a lot of money, but I don't think that was the primary motivation of Jobs and Apple.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's also different for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Books because it 's selling items with far <i>less</i> margin and earnings potential than Apple does at its stores . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>For that reason I see this as a loss leader for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> where sales will help offset some of the expenses but are unlikely to be profitable . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Looking at the interior of the store and product balance , it 's <b>apparent</b> to me <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> built the store as a reflection of its roots , while at the same time offering the tech gadgets in an attempt to expand that market . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>While not an Apple knockoff, it does have a feel of that within that particular part of the store.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Being able to interact with tech products like Kindles , the Echo , the Fire TV and Fire Tablets is a great marketing tool and when eventually leveraged across strategically located stores , it <b>could</b> be a good catalyst to expand those markets .  (Uncertainty) </span>It already does well with Kindles, but some of the other tech products have been slow to be embraced by consumers.Since <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sells just about every type of product available to the retail market , it 's instructive to see it include tech products within the book store and not other products . Book competitors like Barnes & Noble (NYSE: BKS ) already do this, and it provides a concept already familiar to consumers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If this part of the business helps to increase sales for its slow-moving tech products , it <b>could</b> significantly help to offset costs in its physical retail store strategy .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I believe this is <b>almost</b> entirely a new way of marketing for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> as it looks for ways to provide a <i>more</i> public face to the company . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>There 's a reason <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> went with a book store and not a tech store like Apple : it 's all about the perceived experience . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>At one time <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was watched with awe and fascination as it disrupted the giant book and retail industry , providing a <i>better</i> experience and <i>better</i> prices for consumers . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Over time , as the company grew , it gravitated to being considered another giant player in the retail market , which tends to give consumers and the public in general , a <i>more</i> negative view of the company .  (Surprise) </span>A physical book store, being the choice of its public face to consumers and potential customers, is the best choice because of the atmosphere associated with a book store, which readers enjoy basking in.Tech stores can be a lot of fun, but they present a different atmosphere than a book store does.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The book store concept is <i>more</i> conducive to what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> needs at this time . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The point is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Books should be considered a marketing and branding tool by investors . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Anything <i>more</i> that <b>may</b> come out of it would only be icing on the cake .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I would be happy to see sales offset expenses.It doesn't matter to me if it were to add to the top and bottom lines.So far I like everything associated with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Books . The obvious interest by the media has produced a lot of buzz , primarily because of the way <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> disrupted the physical book industry , and is now going that route itself . That has already paid major marketing dividends for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , and should continue to do so . I do n't see this becoming some major expansion by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , based upon my belief it 's a concept store for the purpose of branding and marketing . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While it could generate some impulse sales , most consumers making purchases would <b>probably</b> have made those purchases online as well .  (Uncertainty) </span>It's only changing how the sales are made, not the number of sales.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Once the data come in concerning how consumers are using the store and tweaks are made , I do <b>believe</b> there will be new stores introduced in areas where they should do very well .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Since that will <b>almost</b> certainly be near to universities , that will help maintain the interest of and attract a <i>younger</i> demographic that did n't grow up during the time <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was battling it out with the giant retailers for market share . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>What I want to see is the costs that this project will eventually incur as <i>more</i> stores are rolled out , and how much of those expenses will be offset by store sales .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Other than that , it 's hard to measure the value this will eventually have for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , <b>assuming</b> they become popular in the areas they do business in . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Once there are enough stores operating, we can at that time at least measure the increase of sales to give an idea of the marketing tool is working.That will take years.For now, this has already garnered a lot of attention, and it's simple and easy to understand.In that regard it's already a success, and most responses to the physical store have been very positive.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
