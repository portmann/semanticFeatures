class='textDiv'>Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Books Beyond The Obvious Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>finally introduces its first <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Books store Initial response has been positive and there are sure to be more opened in the years ahead What needs to be seen is how much the costs of these concept stores will be offset by instore sales Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN has come full circle with its book business having recently done the unthinkable opening its first physical book store The immediate questions investors have on their minds is this what is this all about and what does it mean That is important because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>while not getting into specifics has said it has plans to build more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Books stores As for the store itself its interesting in that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>did get creative with the book section of the store by placing the books with their covers out rather than the spines being out as most book stores have the majority of them displayed Source Rob Salkowitz via Publisher Weekly It also includes a technology section with products like Kindles Fire TV Fire Tablets and Echo My initial belief was that was the primary reason for the store with books being props to fill up the store with merchandise I still believe thats a part of the plan but a smaller part than I originally thought Whats interesting to me is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has tied the physical merchandise in the store to the moving prices online Customers can scan the bar codes to get a current price which means there is a fluidity in that regard It mimics the online buying experience It also includes details of online customer reviews and sales information on placards near the books Located in Seattles University Village I expect that will be the model used by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in the future placing these physical stores near universities With regard to the books stocked in the store only those with a rating of four stars or higher good sales and significant preorders are stocked there Those with a smartphone <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>app can scan the bar codes right there to get an uptodate price Again what the price is on Amazoncom is what the price of the book and other products in the store will be Credits available on a regular <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>account also can be used in the store for purchases Its obvious <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>wants to make it as frictionfree as possible to make a transaction One thing that suggests this is going to be projected with very targeted locations is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>at least not at this time isnt going to allow this to be a fulfillment center where you can order online and then pick up the products at the store If it was rolling out something like that in the form of this book store it wouldnt have included those restrictions That is something different that will be expanded under a different format With books as the bulk of the products in the store and a centrally located tech display its obvious to me this is about the experience associated with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and not about making money Its also different than Apples NASDAQ AAPL physical stores although I think some of the same reasons for introducing them are the same Neither are looking for it to be a major source of revenue but more a public relations and marketing strategy When Steve Jobs decided to introduce concept stores for Apple he did it primarily because he believed retail outlets werent marketing the Mac in the way it should have been Interestingly Apple Stores now make a lot of money but I dont think that was the primary motivation of Jobs and Apple Its also different for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Books because its selling items with far less margin and earnings potential than Apple does at its stores For that reason I see this as a loss leader for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>where sales will help offset some of the expenses but are unlikely to be profitable Looking at the interior of the store and product balance its apparent to me <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>built the store as a reflection of its roots while at the same time offering the tech gadgets in an attempt to expand that market While not an Apple knockoff it does have a feel of that within that particular part of the store Being able to interact with tech products like Kindles the Echo the Fire TV and Fire Tablets is a great marketing tool and when eventually leveraged across strategically located stores it could be a good catalyst to expand those markets It already does well with Kindles but some of the other tech products have been slow to be embraced by consumers Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sells just about every type of product available to the retail market its instructive to see it include tech products within the book store and not other products Book competitors like Barnes Noble NYSE BKS already do this and it provides a concept already familiar to consumers If this part of the business helps to increase sales for its slowmoving tech products it could significantly help to offset costs in its physical retail store strategy I believe this is almost entirely a new way of marketing for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as it looks for ways to provide a more public face to the company Theres a reason <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>went with a book store and not a tech store like Apple its all about the perceived experience At one time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was watched with awe and fascination as it disrupted the giant book and retail industry providing a better experience and better prices for consumers Over time as the company grew it gravitated to being considered another giant player in the retail market which tends to give consumers and the public in general a more negative view of the company A physical book store being the choice of its public face to consumers and potential customers is the best choice because of the atmosphere associated with a book store which readers enjoy basking in Tech stores can be a lot of fun but they present a different atmosphere than a book store does The book store concept is more conducive to what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>needs at this time The point is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Books should be considered a marketing and branding tool by investors Anything more that may come out of it would only be icing on the cake I would be happy to see sales offset expenses It doesnt matter to me if it were to add to the top and bottom lines So far I like everything associated with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Books The obvious interest by the media has produced a lot of buzz primarily because of the way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>disrupted the physical book industry and is now going that route itself That has already paid major marketing dividends for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and should continue to do so I dont see this becoming some major expansion by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>based upon my belief its a concept store for the purpose of branding and marketing While it could generate some impulse sales most consumers making purchases would probably have made those purchases online as well Its only changing how the sales are made not the number of sales Once the data come in concerning how consumers are using the store and tweaks are made I do believe there will be new stores introduced in areas where they should do very well Since that will almost certainly be near to universities that will help maintain the interest of and attract a younger demographic that didnt grow up during the time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was battling it out with the giant retailers for market share What I want to see is the costs that this project will eventually incur as more stores are rolled out and how much of those expenses will be offset by store sales Other than that its hard to measure the value this will eventually have for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>assuming they become popular in the areas they do business in Once there are enough stores operating we can at that time at least measure the increase of sales to give an idea of the marketing tool is working That will take years For now this has already garnered a lot of attention and its simple and easy to understand In that regard its already a success and most responses
