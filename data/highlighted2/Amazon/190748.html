Awesome Tools and Sites to Save You Money Here are the tools and resources that changed my financial life Since its the weekend and I assume many people are out shopping why not share some tools to help you save some of that hard earned cash Seriously people why not save when you are shopping Well in the good ol weekendspirit I brought together tools and sites you can use to save money It really is that easy There are many more that I could come up with but I thought would be more than enough These include some places you have probably seen or used but maybe some others you havent I hope this will become a quality resource for thoselooking to save money I know I am always looking for a new way to save cold hard cash Ahh Why is Walmart on here Though I am not a huge fan of shopping at Walmart I still think they offer great deals It is not the prices that irritate me it is the customer service and many of the patrons Either way Walmart just introduced their Savings Catcher This is really a simple money saving tool You either go to their website and enter your Walmart receipt number or you download the Walmart app and scan your receipt When you do this they will search the products you bought and if they find a lower advertised price from their local competitors they will give you the difference as a egift card Now how freaking easy is that There is no mystery that I love shopping on Amazoncom I am a Prime member and enjoy super fast shipping and awesome customer service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>makes my shopping life easy Either way I have known for years that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>fluctuates their pricing on a regular basis I have seen some products switch multiple times per day Unfortunately I dont have time to watch the prices so I get help from CamelCamelCamel You just have to enter the URL of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>product you want to buy You can also search by keywords CamelCamelCamel tracks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>prices and will notify you when prices drop on a specified item You can also view the price history of a given product This tool is awesome I have used this service for about a week on a few things I have been looking to buy on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Savingscoms PriceJump is a feature that allows you to compare <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>prices to others You put in an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>URL or ASIN number and PriceJump will scan some of the bigger <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>competitors It will tell you if they find a better price of if you are better to purchase it from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>This tool is relatively new so they are working on adding shipping costs into the mix as that is a decision maker for many I encourage you to check it out Here is a list of the best ways to save money before you checkout on Amazoncom There are so many ways to save money on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>you should check it out I am an online coupon junkie I will always look for a coupon before I go through the checkout process One of the biggest coupon sites is RetailMeNot I will check this site along with my coupons page to see if there are any good coupons By using this source I have never paid full price for anything online Hail online coupons You might not have heard of this site and I dont blame you It is relatively new I think the name is unique It is another online coupon code site They are slowly growing the stores they cover but they do have some unique coupons especially for some sites that are popular in other countries I like to test out smaller sites in hopes they grow big It is nice to get in on the ground floor Lets see where ChameleonJohn goes Who doesnt love a fat wallet Seriously FatWallet is an awesome site that encompasses online coupons deals sales and even cash back offers I have had a FatWallet account for some time and it is awesome I highly recommend them if you are looking for some killer deals Their forums are very active with deal finders and you would be amazed at what you can score Ah cash back What a great way to earn some money back when you are shopping Cash back is a big thing these days Why not earn some money back when you are doing your regular shopping Do you not like money Ebates is one of the most popular cash back sites around You can earn up to back at some stores and they have a huge database of stores You just hit up your Ebates account go to the store you want to buy from and watch the cash come rolling back into your wallet You can check out my full Ebates review as well Upromise offers a little twist on cash back shopping While you can score a nice check right to your bank account their main offering is to use your cash back to fund a childs educational savings account I have my sons account hooked up to my Upromise account I just got a nice deposit of over in the Now that money will start earning some great interest and help me get closer to funding my sons college education in full Upromise is free to use and I have used it for years You can read my Upromise review if you are feeling compelled Mr Rebates is similar to Ebates and other cash back stores They have over stores for you to choose from You go shopping and then get cash back into your Mr Rebates account It really is simple While you might not need to check different cash back sites I have found that many of them offer unique cash back percentages for different stores I like to check each one to see where I will get the best bang for my buck This sites bills itself as USAs most generous cash back site That is quite the claim While I cannot confirm this is true they do provide some quality cash back offerings As they compete with the others it is a good idea to check out Top Cash Back and see if they have a better cash back offering for a specific store It is simple and free just as the others I love Big Crumbs Another cash back site but this one does it a little differently While you earn cash back on your purchases they also give you CrumbShares Now what in the H E double hockey sticks are CrumbShares When you get cash back they give you the same amount back in Crumbshares Ifwhen the company gets acquired or bought out they will then provide half of the compensation they receive back to their members The number of Crumbshares will correspond to how much of that compensation you receive Big Crumbs is a free site to join I have written about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Warehouse Deals in the past It is one of the little unknown secrets of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shopping This little section provides deep discounts on products that were either returned or have some shipping box damage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>verifies and checks each individual product and gives them a grade You can really score some awesome deals and I have saved a lot of money doing so Check out Amazons warehouse deals I was a huge fan of Manilla for their bill management It not only saved me time but also saved me money I never worried about being late on my bills When Manilla shut down I was a little lost Luckily I found Finovera They offer a similar service to Manilla and it is free You can manage your bills and check over your statements all in one place Super simple and easy Who doesnt want to save money on filling up their tanks I know I always look for the best deal in the area I need to fill up Gas Prices vary from station to station so it is a great idea to check prices Luckily GasBuddy has a website and a smartphone app to help you You dont even need an account Just look up the area you are going to be in on their website and they list all of the current prices for gas Do the same on your smartphone and then you save easily This is one of my goto apps on my phone I am almost certain you have heard of Groupon While this is not revolutionary you can score some sweet deals from the site It is not mystery While I dont like signing up for their emails since I hate daily deal emails I do check out the site from time to time They also have a Groupon Goods section where you can get awesome deals on products Groupon is still on my money saving list The competitor of Groupon is another great place to check for some awesome deals They also have goods services and getaways As I mentioned I dont like putting in my email address to these things Unfortunately they force you to put in an email address This is how they make their money Either way LivingSocial is still a good service to check out OK I couldnt write a saving money post without putting Craigslist on here I mean come on You can get some many things on Craigslist I have bought and sold a plethora of items on this site and I highly recommend it If you know what you are looking for chances are you might find it here You dont have to worry about fees and you dont even need an account I have even sold a few cars on Craigslist with ease Honey is a Chrome browser extension that allows you to easily save money with little to no work You install the extension then when youre on a site shopping and ready to check out thats when Honey works for you It will search their database to see if the site youre on matches with a coupon If youre on Walmartcom and you are checking out it will check to see if there is a good and applicable coupon for you to use Its literally that easy Just browse normally go to checkout and enjoy the savings When we go shopping for cars we never want to overpay It can be hard with how salespeople work and even harder with the numbers dealerships use Negotiating a good price for a car can be a freaking hassle Admit it Well TrueCar is dedicated to helping you realize what a good price for a car should be They give you information about what others in your area paid for the same vehicle They will also give you a printout of a best price and you can take it to one of their many approved TrueCar dealerships I have checked it out once and it did give me a nice price and a hefty amount of bargaining power Hate banking fees Yep me too Luckily for you a new service has come out looking to help you out with ever increasing bank fees MagnifyMoney compares a long list of financial products to help you save money You can check your checking account to see if there is a better option Their search tool is awesome and I highly recommend trying this service out in order to keep money in your checking account This is one I just ran across and I am not hooked I have a monthly prescription plus some for my son when he gets sick Since he is in daycare that happens more often than not Anyway GoodRx allows you to search for any FDAapproved drug in America and compare the prices from a multitude of pharmacies in your area You can do it from their website or their app What a way to do it They can even beat prices based on your insurance depending on the drug I recommend this site This site is my goto for managing my money They focus on your investments and can tell you if you are paying too much for your portfolio When I signed up for Personal Capital the site was perfect for my needs It still is You can get a free account and when you add in your bank accounts credit cards debts and investment accounts you can get a full picture of your financial health This is a Mintcom alternative and it focuses on investments I was able to save some good money by switching a few funds that were charging too much to manage I am going on my investment kick now Either way I started investing when I was right out of college I wish I would have done it sooner but didnt know much I found Betterment as a great alternative to many of the managed investment accounts that cost too much money You can start investing with only and their fee structure is low which saves you money My Roth IRA is setting in Betterment now and it has been killing it Now this is a cool investing site It is my newest addition to my investment project I found Motif Investing when I was looking around for some alternatives to the traditional online brokerages like Scottrade and Etrade Motif Investing offers buckets called Motifs of stocks Instead of charging you a fee for each individual trade they only charge you one fee to buy their Motif They can have up to stocks and they revolve around a common theme like energy dividends healthcare and many more I have signed up and I have loved it since They are great with customer service I am a stickler for finding the best auto insurance policy and price that I can I just switched a few months ago to a new service once my old provider wouldnt drop their price I had been with them for years and they had been the best Unfortunately when we bought a new house they were the highest price Many others provided lower prices Boo Anyway I like to shop around occasionally Luckily for me and you now you can use CoverHound This easy to use site allows you to put in the coverages you need and then gets you quotes from multiple agencies Simple easy and the savings can be awesome Alright it is your turn What is a toolsite you love to use to save money Remember my list is not exhaustive but just ones I enjoy and have just found Im a business owner blogger father and husband I used credit cards too much and found myself in over in debt I paid it off started this blog and my financial life has changed I now talk about fighting debt and growing wealth here I run a blog management company along with another blog It is Empowered Shopper which helps people get information about products they want to buy You can also check out Eyes on the Dollar which is a great blog that I coown I was lucky that the Atlanta area was part of the BETA market for SavingsCathcher Since May Ive gotten back over Personally I dont care about the service if I can save money on the same products I frequent Walmart Kroger and Costco and find using all is the best bang for my money I save enough from my methods to be able to buy my meat products from a local butcher with great service high quality and FRESH products Also buy it in bulk to get better prices than any of those big stores I notice the Savingscatcher compares to other stores that are not that close by or that I never would go to Thank you for the feedback on the savings catcher I used it here and it worked pretty well Unfortunately for me I dont get too much savings from the oil I buy at Walmart It already is the lowest price Great list You dont love the clientele at Walmart Thats why I go dude People wear the most awesome clothes at Walmartor the Walmart Well I will leave my Walmart afflictions to the people of Walmart website So since I can get my fix there I have no other need Ive been a fan of FatWallet I get great offers in cheap prices Highly recommendable for those on tight budget These are great The site that gives to a account is so unique but thats awesome Thanks for such a great list I really enjoy Upromise It is really unique and I have one that I use to fund my sons This is a great list of tools and websites I will be sure to pass on a few of these to some of my friends Ive been staying on top of my finances recently but I know many of my friends have issues from time to time Awesome List of tools are really good The internet not only allows you the opportunity to compare different prices often there are online comparison calculators Impulse shoppers spend more than what was budgeted Make a list and stick to it in order to control your account Limit credit cards and online cash advances to emergencies while you work at strengthening your finances Have you gone through it httpblogcashinasnapcommoneysavingtipsonatightbudget September at pm Reply The Ibotta app has saved me a bunch of money in the month and a half Ive been using it Just click on the type of store you are shopping grocery restaurant baby and kids etc and check out the items offering a rebate Sometimes you can get a quarter back from any random gallon of milk to back on a tube of sun screen you needed anyway etc Best part is the money sits in your account immediately upon receipt acceptance and once you get to you can deposit it immediately to your PayPal or Venmo have not tried out Venmo yet account Free money Ibotta is great Its fast straight to PayPal too If you have an iPhone and you buy groceries etc youre robbing yourself if you dont use it ReceiptHog is another cool app that gives you points to redeem for PayPal dollars mere minimum qualifies for payout just for taking pictures of most major store receipts Doesnt even matter what you buy mostly Thanks for visiting Debt Roundup
