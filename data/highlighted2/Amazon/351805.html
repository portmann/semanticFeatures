Tech Gadgets With the Best Resale Value We all know the story with technology By the time youve opened the box its already out of date As advances quickly move the latest and greatest tech gadgets into the out of date category its hard to know what to buy and how much to spend But some tech gadgets are a better investment than others holding their value well So when the time does come to upgrade these eight gadgets will still be worth a tidy sum They are not the best headphones on the market To be honest theyre not even close to being the best as far as technical specs are concerned But when it comes to holding their value Beats are up there with the biggest and best studio headphones on the market The reason is simple people want them They have a certain street cred that seems to be bulletproof and they also look pretty cool You could pay up to for a pair of Beats Studio Wireless headphones brand new The same make and model used will sell for close to the same price on eBay Thats not a big depreciation at all especially for tech you actually wear And if you buy limited edition models they can actually go up in value It was the first tablet to take the gadget world by storm Its still the tablet most people gravitate to and it doesnt look like that will change anytime soon The Apple iPad came along in April of and after a small adjustment period what is that thing and what does it do everyone was hooked There have been many different types of iPad and competitor tablets released since but its the iPad that holds its value well Now if you have one of the first models it wont get you much money used as the tech is too dated But more recent ones youll have no trouble reselling them for a good chunk of money For example a new iPad Air with GB is over after tax The same one used is going for over on eBay Just remember condition is everything and original packaging makes a world of difference I was in the market for a Playstation recently and I figured I would be able to pick up a used one for on Craigslist Nope A used one with just one controller was Throw in more controllers and games and you can expect to pay almost as much as a new one Likewise the Xbox used was fetching a tidy sum on Craigslist and eBay as well If you take care of your consoles keep the original box and keep the games in great condition you can expect the value of your gaming console to hold for quite a while Whats more older consoles are making a comeback An original NES system can easily fetch over and some of the games are worth thousands Another one for Apple and not surprisingly its their flagship product The iPhone is not even years old yet it was launched in but it has absolutely changed the way we all interact with the online world And although Android phones are now surpassing iPhones in sales they are not touching them when it comes to resale values Do a quick search on eBay for completed listings and youll see most iPhone models are selling for around thats around half the price of a new s If its gold quadruple that price Even the original clunky iPhone has value In its box you can get for it If its factory sealedthousands If you want to get a tech gadget that will really hold its value well dont buy new Buy vintage Right now the comeback of vinyl means that a good record player think Technics NAD Thoren will not only be worth every penny it will also hold its value for years Or in the case of designer models rise significantly Whats more you can still pick up great amplifiers tape decks turntables and speakers for pennies on the dollar especially if you know just what to look for in the thrift stores and garage sales I recently picked up a Technics turntable for in the original box which is already worth over on eBay Not that Im selling it And after Eminem announced the rerelease of his Slim Shady album on cassette you can guarantee tape decks will be next to rocket in value Grab one cheap while you can Actually a lot of wearable tech is holding its value well including smartwatches and fitness trackers The Fitbit Surge is definitely up there as one of the best for holding value Right now a new FitBit Surge can set you back between while used ones are coming in at around the mark The reason other than the sleek design and usability is the onboard GPS tracking software Not only can you chart distance and pace but even elevation This is a nobrainer as its so affordable to begin with But if you like buying products that hold their value this is up there with Apple products A new Chromecast will cost you from most online retailers and often it comes with Google Play credits If you look up used ones on eBay or Craigslist youll see them priced between depending on condition original box and so on Its an incredible useful little piece of tech and the simplicity it takes to set up and use makes it an easy item to resell later Third times a charm for Apple who continue to have a massive fanbase despite not producing a significant innovation for years But whatever the current state of Apples product line its products continue to hold their value and the Apple Watch shouldnt that be iWatch or it that way too creepy is no exception A new Apple Watch will cost you anywhere from thats the K gold edition while a used Apple Watch will sell for anywhere from to to Clearly some people have money to burn
