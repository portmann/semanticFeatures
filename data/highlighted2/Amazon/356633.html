( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has 2 million-plus third-party sellers around the world that are immensely profitable to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Third-party sellers are flocking to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and driving down prices , providing value to customers . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Did you know <b>nearly</b> half of all of the items you order from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) do n't come from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> itself ? (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>That's right.Over 47 % of units that are shipped are actually sold by a third-party seller on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This amounted to <i>more</i> than 1 billion units .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even better , these units are actually <i>more</i> profitable for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> than when it ships its own inventoried units . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>No other company comes even close to matching the depth , selection , price and number of sellers than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Let 's take a deep look at this side of the business : There are <b>roughly</b> 2 million sellers on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , many of which are small mom and pop businesses that are running out of their garage/home . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>There are , however , a number of significant enterprises building their business on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . There are sellers that do hundreds of millions of dollars in sales on the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> platform and are growing quite rapidly . And there are lots of them.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is <b>astonishing</b> how much revenue growth these sellers have experienced .  (Surprise) </span>Revenue and order growth are growing double digits year after year and this is a very profitable business from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> as compared to even their own operation . I have noticed most third-party sellers are now using <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's FBA ( Fulfillment by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ) service that has driven sales growth . This includes all of the largest sellers that are in the article above.In fact, most of them are literally 100% FBA.FBA allows sellers three advantages : 2 ) Utilize <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's world class fulfillment and customer service experience The FBA program is extremely unique compared to any other marketplace . There is no other marketplace (eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ), Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ), Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ), etc.) where the marketplace fulfills items on behalf of the seller.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That is why these marketplaces are not growing <b>nearly</b> as rapidly - only experienced sellers with fulfillment capabilities can operate .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>According to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , using FBA allows a seller to basically <b>worry</b> only about supplying product into <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> centers and cost control . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>They do not spend time on customer service, returns, shipping, etc.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is great for the seller because they can offer <i>more</i> competitive prices because they are utilizing the low costs of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's fulfillment network . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>How does <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> benefit from Third-Party Sellers ? <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> realizes huge benefits as their third-party marketplace grows . Some of these include: 1) Selection - Third-party merchants provide an incredible amount of selection and increase customer choice.2) Competitive pricing - Prices come down to very attractive levels to most consumers due to intense competition.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>3 ) Inventory ownership - <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does not own or take <b>risk</b> of the inventory that is being sold on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>4 ) Supply chain and logistic cost reductions - Third-party sellers increase the volume of packages being shipped and received thereby achieving <i>greater</i> economies of scale .  (Surprise) </span>5 ) <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> builds a huge moat around their retail business which is extremely profitable . The below chart by RW Baird demonstrates how powerful third-party sellers are in some categories.80-90% of the product selection is actually coming from third-party sellers: There are tens of thousands of new sellers every year and prices continued to get driven down by intense competition.This can be seen because prices are competitive down to the penny.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The seller that has a <i>lower</i> price by even one cent wins the `` Buy Box '' and gets all of the sales .  (Surprise) </span>You can imagine what that does to the price.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So while competition is incredibly intense for sellers , it creates a <b>wonderful</b> situation for the consumer who benefits from a wide selection at a competitive price .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This obviously helps <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> even <i>more</i> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>This moat is ignored frequently as most of the discussion around <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> lies on how much they are investing in new warehouses , new phone development costs , etc. . However , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is quietly but surely strengthening this moat by opening up marketplaces around the world . There are now third-party marketplaces in the US, Canada, Europe, Japan, India and China.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Third-Party Sales are Extremely Profitable For most items , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> actually makes <i>more</i> profit from selling a third-party item then from selling their own in-stock item ( even for the same item ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Let 's take a look at all of the profits that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> collects from a third-party sale : 1 ) <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> charges anywhere between 14 % -40 % to third-party sellers for most categories outside of electronics . 2 ) <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> charges fulfillment fees for those items fulfilled through them ( FBA ) . Sellers are charged a per order, per item, and a weight based fee.This covers much of the fulfillment cost of an order.3 ) <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> charges sellers to utilize the real estate of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> fulfillment centers . Essentially , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has become a huge warehouse REIT that is massively profitable . They are charging anywhere between $.48 - .64 per cubic foot per month.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is typically locating their warehouses in rural areas where land is extremely cheap . Charging this kind of "rent" brings in incredible profits.4 ) <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> makes a profit from all of the shipments that come into their fulfillment centers as most sellers are utilizing <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's rates to ship their products . 5 ) <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> potentially `` double charges '' for shipping if a customer ends up placing an order with a shipping charge . ( <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> charges the seller a fee to fulfill , and the customer also pays for shipping even though one package is sent ) With third-party sales growing at over 50 % yoy during the Christmas quarter , there is a lot to look forward to . I can certainly see the perspective of many investors that focus on how many billions of dollars <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is investing into new areas and how the company is not profitable . Throughout its history, critics have said it won't be able to compete with Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) in product search, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in electronics, or Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) in retail.But as time has passed, they have proven to be quite strong in all of them.If <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continues to focus on developing moats in the industries it is focusing on , then we should see outsized profits in the future . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It took years and hundreds of millions of dollars in losses to develop a marketplace that now brings in <b>roughly</b> $ 30 billion in revenue ( half of $ 60 billion in merchandise revenue ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Cloud brought in almost $ 8 billion last year and analysts estimate that it <b>could</b> be a $ 20 billion business in the future .  (Uncertainty) </span>Investors need to pay attention to those efforts that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is continuing to invest in ( Cloud , Media , Prime , Retail ) in order to develop a moat . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They are very successful and long-term oriented , so one <b>may</b> want to avoid investing in other companies in these segments .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Equally important , one <b>may</b> want to consider investments in the segments where <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has shut down or given up on ( mobile phones , luxury clothing , travel , payments , daily deals ) .
