Microsoft has some of the same advantages.It is and will continue to build very large and very low cost data centers that drive down the costs for what it sells in the cloud.But Microsoft also has a huge number of users who are going to migrate to the cloud and would prefer to continue to stay with MSFT as a total solutions provider.As I wrote earlier, by this time 60% of Microsoft's application customers also are buying Azure.That is a significant leg up in the race for position in the public cloud market.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do not think that anyone can realistically opine on exact comparisons in cloud market share statistics because each company uses <b>different</b> definitions to talk about the same things .  (Uncertainty) </span>There is no company with a legacy business that will not have a certain amount of transformational issues.It is just my contention that MSFT is handling its own transformation better than most of the legacy vendors, and I think that the trend is likely to continue.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As some observers <b>might</b> point out , MSFT has taken some unnatural steps to get its customers signed up for Azure .  (Uncertainty) </span>Most MSFT commercial users have enterprise agreements that price all of the products that Microsoft sells.Again, dating back to 2014, MSFT would get users to sign up for the cloud and pay for it by discounting the prices for the other parts of the EA.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That meant that the company <b>could</b> count the customers , Azure users , and count the revenue for the commercial cloud .  (Uncertainty) </span>That meant Microsoft had loads of cloud "customers" and cloud revenue that was counted even though the users weren't actually using the Microsoft cloud at all.Starting about a year ago that really started to change significantly.Microsoft significantly tweaked its comp plans such that what's called "consumption" became very important to sales people and they were assigned a quota for it.If sales people were unable to reach consumption quotas, they were at danger of losing their bonuses even if their revenue attainment was on quota.In some extreme cases, MSFT's sales people got fired.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In all , the motivation <b>seems</b> to have done the trick .  (Uncertainty) </span>This past quarter, the company reported that Azure SQL database usage grew by 5X on a year-over-year comparison - that is basically part of the metric that Microsoft calls consumption and not revenue dollars.As mentioned above, CRM seat usage in the cloud trebled.I think that it is underappreciated, the extent to which Microsoft had to chew through a fair amount of Azure credits that had been created when users signed up for the cloud but didn't use what MSFT calls consumption credits.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>How much that might have been will never be known , but I think that the current numbers and data points <b>suggest</b> that the company has gotten its customers moving workloads to the cloud and that the customers it is reporting are buying real solutions and are not just the product of marketing hype .  (Uncertainty) </span>Overall, the cloud attach rate on EAs has reached 60% up from 45% 12 months ago and commercial cloud GM have reached 46% up from 37% in the prior year's period.I think it is also worth noting that unlike the more recent results of Oracle in particular, as well as IBM, that overall commercial bookings which include cloud and everything else were up 19% in constant currency.I think that in evaluating Microsoft, it's important to note that the trade between its legacy businesses and cloud is reasonably positive which is currently not the case for either Oracle or IBM and is just barely the case for SAP.I think that the message is, if you want to play with the dinosaurs, this is the dinosaur you ought to be playing with.What Is All Of This Regarding TAM Doubling?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>How Can A Mature Company Like This Actually <b>Believe</b> That It Can Double Its TAM Just Based On The Cloud ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While Microsoft has n't been quite the pioneer when compared to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in the cloud , it started to make its investments early enough such that it is enjoying the benefits of a substantially <b>different</b> market structure . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>For example, when looking at just the database segment, Microsoft has been able to embrace Linux and what is called NoSQL (non-relational) databases more effectively when compared to other legacy competitors.CEO Satya Nadella described the expansion of the TAM on the ground this way : "IaaS growth comes because people already have existing code that they want to move over and then they start extending by writing more PaaS because it's sort of more efficient for them to write new code and new apps in PaaS... If you're starting new you will have PaaS, which is going to be the first thing you do, but then you'll always find the need to integrate with something already existing."I think another way of looking at the vast increase in the TAM is that Azure is open to run workloads from anyone which includes open-source workloads, Linux workloads, even Oracle and SAP workloads.So Azure and the cloud are adding a new dimension to customers that MSFT can solicit.Oracle databases and apps have been completely closed.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Obviously , SAP apps <b>could</b> always run on Oracle databases , but with SAP 's HANA , that was supposed to come to an end .  (Uncertainty) </span>Nowadays, people are able to use the Azure cloud and move Oracle workloads to that and write new codes to integrate with those apps without reference to ORCL.It is a brave new world, and Microsoft will have a significantly greater market to compete for than it has enjoyed.Again to quote CEO Nadella: "The enterprise is heterogeneous.It had been homogeneous.We participated only in a portion of it.Whereas with Azure we can participate, we can participate (sic) as the total open platform.And that's how we (think) about it and that's what we're executing on."When the CEO says that the opportunity is the greatest that MSFT has ever enjoyed, that is what he is talking about.For a long period of time, MSFT has been thought of as a traditional value investment with relatively strong cash flow and limited growth opportunity.But for the first time in multiple years, the company has positioned itself to cash in on a high-growth market, and the early signs of its execution capability are strong.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Microsoft like <b>almost</b> all of the old-line software companies is in the midst of a substantial transition that will take it further and further away from its Windows roots .  (Uncertainty) </span>More than all of the company's future growth is going to come from commercial and cloud-based revenues.While the headline number of Microsoft's public cloud offering Azure shows revenue growth of 140% year on year, it is equally important still to look at the growth in commercial bookings, which rose 19% in constant currency, far greater than modeled by most analysts and yet still an understatement of the actual growth MSFT enjoyed in the space.Microsoft's reported numbers mask the strong growth its commercial operation is achieving because of both the switch to ratable revenues and the impact sales of cloud applications.Unlike some cloud-only companies such as CRM that make the exercise very easy, it is hard because of the lack of transparency of the company's financial disclosure to figure out what is actually happening on an apples basis.But the same pattern of rising orders that are not reflected in current period revenues is at work for this company as is the case of other significant cloud vendors.Microsoft through the years had improved the functionality of its commercial offerings significantly, and under the new CEO, it has become much more open in terms of how it approaches partnerships with vendors that are notionally competitors.The company, at least in the Gartner surveys, now leads all of the other application vendors in terms of database and analytics.It is experiencing a rapid uptake of its cloud-based CRM solution, and I imagine that when the balance of its Dynamics ERP product is released in the cloud shortly, it will enjoy some significant success in that space as well.Even though Microsoft is a relatively old software vendor, it has been far more successful with its transition than most of the other older software vendors.It has, to be sure, seen some fall off in some of its legacy offerings, but the transition has really been a good trade for Microsoft.In answer to a particular question, CFO Amy Hood responded: "Our enterprise workloads across Windows, SQL, Systems Center, etc., grew double digit.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And some of the decline you asked about is in the non-annuity and very transactional business which happened to impact Windows Server a bit more than other workloads ... '' Microsoft has not and <b>probably</b> never will enjoy the type of growth rates associated with pure cloud vendors .  (Uncertainty) </span>It has its boat anchor, and it is a company in transition.But it is enjoying some of the increase in overall volume that is associated with even the strongest of the business application vendors.While the company no longer enjoys the deep value metrics it did a few years ago, it is on the cusp of seeing accelerated growth in the top line and continued improvement in operating margins as well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As the transition to cloud gathers team , I think that it will become more and more <b>apparent</b> that Microsoft 's shares deserve some - but of course not all - of the valuation metrics that have been achieved by the best of the pure cloud vendors .
