(Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>CEO Satya Nadella described the expansion of the TAM on the ground this way : `` IaaS growth comes because people already have existing code that they want to move over and then they start extending by writing <i>more</i> PaaS because it 's sort of <i>more</i> efficient for them to write new code and new apps in PaaS ... If you 're starting new you will have PaaS , which is going to be the first thing you do , but then you 'll always find the need to integrate with something already existing . ''  (Surprise) </span>I think another way of looking at the vast increase in the TAM is that Azure is open to run workloads from anyone which includes open-source workloads, Linux workloads, even Oracle and SAP workloads.So Azure and the cloud are adding a new dimension to customers that MSFT can solicit.Oracle databases and apps have been completely closed.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Obviously , SAP apps <b>could</b> always run on Oracle databases , but with SAP 's HANA , that was supposed to come to an end .  (Uncertainty) </span>Nowadays, people are able to use the Azure cloud and move Oracle workloads to that and write new codes to integrate with those apps without reference to ORCL.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is a brave new world , and Microsoft will have a significantly <i>greater</i> market to compete for than it has enjoyed .  (Surprise) </span>Again to quote CEO Nadella: "The enterprise is heterogeneous.It had been homogeneous.We participated only in a portion of it.Whereas with Azure we can participate, we can participate (sic) as the total open platform.And that's how we (think) about it and that's what we're executing on."When the CEO says that the opportunity is the greatest that MSFT has ever enjoyed, that is what he is talking about.For a long period of time, MSFT has been thought of as a traditional value investment with relatively strong cash flow and limited growth opportunity.But for the first time in multiple years, the company has positioned itself to cash in on a high-growth market, and the early signs of its execution capability are strong.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Microsoft like <b>almost</b> all of the old-line software companies is in the midst of a substantial transition that will take it further and further away from its Windows roots .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> than all of the company 's future growth is going to come from commercial and cloud-based revenues .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While the headline number of Microsoft 's public cloud offering Azure shows revenue growth of 140 % year on year , it is equally important still to look at the growth in commercial bookings , which rose 19 % in constant currency , far <i>greater</i> than modeled by most analysts and yet still an understatement of the actual growth MSFT enjoyed in the space .  (Surprise) </span>Microsoft's reported numbers mask the strong growth its commercial operation is achieving because of both the switch to ratable revenues and the impact sales of cloud applications.Unlike some cloud-only companies such as CRM that make the exercise very easy, it is hard because of the lack of transparency of the company's financial disclosure to figure out what is actually happening on an apples basis.But the same pattern of rising orders that are not reflected in current period revenues is at work for this company as is the case of other significant cloud vendors.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft through the years had improved the functionality of its commercial offerings significantly , and under the new CEO , it has become much <i>more</i> open in terms of how it approaches partnerships with vendors that are notionally competitors .  (Surprise) </span>The company, at least in the Gartner surveys, now leads all of the other application vendors in terms of database and analytics.It is experiencing a rapid uptake of its cloud-based CRM solution, and I imagine that when the balance of its Dynamics ERP product is released in the cloud shortly, it will enjoy some significant success in that space as well.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even though Microsoft is a relatively old software vendor , it has been far <i>more</i> successful with its transition than most of the other <i>older</i> software vendors .  (Surprise) </span>It has, to be sure, seen some fall off in some of its legacy offerings, but the transition has really been a good trade for Microsoft.In answer to a particular question, CFO Amy Hood responded: "Our enterprise workloads across Windows, SQL, Systems Center, etc., grew double digit.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And some of the decline you asked about is in the non-annuity and very transactional business which happened to impact Windows Server a bit <i>more</i> than other workloads ... '' Microsoft has not and <b>probably</b> never will enjoy the type of growth rates associated with pure cloud vendors .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It has its boat anchor, and it is a company in transition.But it is enjoying some of the increase in overall volume that is associated with even the strongest of the business application vendors.While the company no longer enjoys the deep value metrics it did a few years ago, it is on the cusp of seeing accelerated growth in the top line and continued improvement in operating margins as well.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As the transition to cloud gathers team , I think that it will become <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> <b>apparent</b> that Microsoft 's shares deserve some - but of course not all - of the valuation metrics that have been achieved by the best of the pure cloud vendors .
