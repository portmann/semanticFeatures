#A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has launched its biggest foray into food outside of the United States with a deal in Britain to offer fresh and frozen goods to customers in some places as quickly as under one hour in a deal with supermarket Morrisons Enabling the online retail giant to compete with Britains biggest supermarket stores and smallest local shops the deal marks Amazons latest assault on a British market already buckling under the weight of fierce competition and rapid online growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will now add fresh and frozen products to its existing offering of packaged grocery goods setting it up against established online rivals Tesco and Ocado in Britains advanced online retail market The advance of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as a participant in UK grocery is a potential challenge to the whole trade in time Shore Capital retail analyst Clive Black said on Monday Any new entrant is but particularly the American behemoth The tieup boosted shares of Morrisons Britains fourth biggest supermarket which had been a laggard in online sales Since it has outsourced logistics for its own online food business to Ocado a British purely online grocery retailer Morrisons shares rose by percent Those of Ocado fell percent on fears the deal would increase competition and reduce the likelihood that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could one day buy the British online firm Market leader Tescos shares fell by percent Tesco could soon be about to find out what its like to be David rather than Goliath said Retail Vision consultant John Ibbotson Morrisons announced separate plans on Monday to extend its own online grocery deliveries to the whole of the UK in agreement with Ocado It would take space in a new Ocado London warehouse while Ocado will provide Morrisons with software to fulfill online orders from its own stores For Morrisons rivals the arrival in the coming months is likely to bring yet more pain to a sector which has been convulsed by fierce competition in recent years with shoppers turning online and to discounters and convenience stores <span

has focused so far just on packaged goods due to the complexity of delivering fresh and frozen products However it is seen as keen to extend its food offering just as supermarkets are increasingly competing on its home turf by selling more nonfood products online <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has also begun surveying UK customers about their use of restaurant delivery services in what analysts said was likely the first step in an international expansion of a business it rolled out in the US last September All of Britains big four supermarkets market leader Tesco WalMarts Asda Sainsburys and Morrisons have seen sales and profits hit as they cut prices to stem the flow of shoppers to German discounters Aldi and Lidl At the same time they are having to build the necessary infrastructure to meet the demand for online deliveries The British Retail Consortium predicted on Monday that retail jobs could go by as the industry moves online The UK online grocery market is predicted to nearly double to billion pounds billion in the five years to according to industry research group IGD Retail analysts have long speculated the US company was gearing up to launch <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fresh in Britain after it previously tested a small range of chilled and frozen items in the country Morrisons with a smaller footprint in the more affluent areas of London and the south east of England than Tesco and Sainsburys may have gambled that it could cope better with the arrival of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>which would typically target those areas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has offered some food and drink items to UK customers since when it launched its Grocery Store and in November it launched a packaged groceries offer for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime members who pay an annual fee Analysts at Bernstein said the deal meant <span

Morrisons may feel that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>isnt really a threat for its smaller stores in the North of England on the contrary on our recent store visit we saw a
