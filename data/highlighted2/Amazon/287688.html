(NASDAQ:ETSY) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .  (Surprise) </span>I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Etsy 's share price has been dramatically affected by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's entry into the handmade market . Handmade at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a poor competitor to Etsy on most levels . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>may</b> have released a token marketplace for the express purpose of driving Etsy down . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Much has been written about Etsy 's ( NASDAQ : ETSY ) fate in the face of new competition from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . While the direct impact of Handmade at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's existence on Etsy 's bottom line is reported to be marginal at best , the market 's reaction has been unequivocal . The day before Handmade at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's October 8th launch , Etsy was trading at $ 14.18 . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the week that followed , it fell <i>more</i> than 22 % to $ 10.99 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Three months later , it 's trading around $ 7.71 or <b>roughly</b> 45 % below its pre-Handmade at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> price . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With very little company news breaking over the past three months , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>appears</b> to be the largest factor in Etsy 's market decline . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Already a gargantuan business , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is currently undergoing a phase of rapid expansion . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company is diving into a wide <b>variety</b> of new markets , including grocery delivery , small business loans and streaming television .  (Uncertainty) </span>The issue with Handmade at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is that it has n't received much support from its parent company . The marketplace exists solely as a subcategory on Amazon.com at large with no distinction between its offerings and other products on the site . Aside from some cost-free PR leading up to its launch, there has been a curious lack of marketing spend to support the fledgling venue.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>By all outward <b>appearances</b> , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has expended the minimum amount of effort to be able to claim that it has entered the handmade market . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Prior to Etsy 's IPO , there were years of persistent buyout <b>rumors</b> swirling the company .  (Uncertainty) </span>These discussions typically focused on big players like eBay ( NASDAQ : EBAY ) and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was watched with particular interest , as it has a long history of acquiring niche market leaders . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We can <b>assume</b> that none of these alleged discussions panned out , as Etsy ended up staying independent and became publicly traded in April 2015 .  (Uncertainty) </span>At the close of its first day of public trading, Etsy's market cap ballooned above $3.3B.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This effectively priced it out of acquisition range for <b>nearly</b> all likely buyers .  (Uncertainty) </span>Nine months later, Etsy's fortunes have shifted dramatically.As of this writing, Etsy's market cap has dropped precipitously to $843M.This places it squarely the price realm of past <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> acquisitions , such as Zappos ( $ 1.2 B ) and Twitch.tv ( $ 970M ) . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Buyout <b>rumors</b> are beginning to circulate again , urged on by the public unrest of sellers on Handmade at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Considering the timing and motivations of the companies at play , one <b>might</b> reasonably posit that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> created Handmade explicitly to drive down Etsy 's valuation . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The lack of continuing support they've extended to their new marketplace is particularly vexing, given their abundance of resources.Is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's management really so Machiavellian as to create a token marketplace solely to drive Etsy 's market cap down ? <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Recall that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is the company that has used its scale to wrestle sales away from its own sellers , and the <b>possibility</b> is <b>stunningly</b> plausible . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the short term , a public announcement of an <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> buyout would <b>almost</b> certainly spike Etsy 's share price . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In its current deflated state , we <b>could</b> see gains ranging anywhere from 15-30 % .  (Uncertainty) </span>Unfortunately, these gains would be of little consolation to those who invested at $30 or even $20 a few months ago.The damage has been done, and even a strong recovery would fall short of initial expectations.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , on the other hand , would have another coveted market cinched under their belt and a feather in their hat . </div></body></html>
