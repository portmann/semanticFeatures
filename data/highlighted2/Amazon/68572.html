upcoming Skylake based Xeon chips will further Intels competitive advantage Intel NASDAQ INTC remains one of my better investment ideas in While volatility will roll through the markets during the summer months for those who have the patience and tolerance to buy and hold outperformance following a period of negative returns seems highly likely Intel is in the early innings of growth in the smartphone and storage space and will likely return to a low yet respectable growth rate in the PC client group Furthermore serverchips have the potential to grow at a brisker pace assuming hyper scale IaaS providers are able to scale the unique cost to performance advantage of Intels upcoming Skylake architecture This all translates into high singledigit revenue growth rates and double digit EPS growth as the mixshift to server CPUs will add significant cost leverage therefore increasing margins I anticipate that this pattern will play out over the next five years despite some moderate cyclicality in PC demand The stock trades at times trailing earnings with reasonable prospects of bottom line expansion due to some modest acceleration in the share buyback program The broader PC market needs to show modest signs of recovery for earnings to expand Various macro factors like lower energy prices higher levels of consumer confidence refresh in product features could add momentum to demand in the back half of the year Admittedly Brian Krzanich told various members of the media that he doesnt anticipate Windows to drive much growth in shipment volume However its not exactly clear whos going to be right or wrong on this topic as upstream OEMs like HewlettPackard NYSE HPQ and Microsoft NYSE MFT are much more confident in the potential impact on volume than Intel However to give Brian some credit I think that if PCCG were to report flat yearoveryear comps the other business categories will pick up enough volume or narrow losses enough to drive bottom line expansion which is why I disagree with the thought process of sellside analysts when it comes to FY earnings The upcoming Purley platform will be the biggest advance since Nehalem architecture The increased memory bandwidth CPU sockets and integration of FPGAs into its design will give unprecedented performance scaling It will be the biggest platform shift witnessed to date and with a launch the ongoing lead in technology will continue The upcoming Xeon E and E V series will have a significant architectural and node advantage from prior generation Xeons However the first set of Skylake serverclass chips will be the singlesocketed variation and will be launched in the October to November timeframe Intel will be integrating FPGAs into its motherboards which will give Intel the ability to scale performance even when compared to RISCbased systems which have edged out Intel in performance by operating on a different software layer when pertaining to the server OS middleware is a huge factor here In a recent presentation by Intel the company announced that they had a significant edge in comparison to RISC architecture which may woo some CTOs to white box vendors selling Intel and Windows Server based systems IBM and Oracle wont be able to hide behind RISC based architecture for much longer Field programmable arrays FPGAs when altered using HDL hardware design language can improve performance in specific use cases FPGAs are similar to application specific integrated circuits but unlike ASICs the FPGAs are reprogrammable to varying uses whereas ASICs are stuck with the same hardware design With a combination of FPGAs addinboards and multisocket CPUS Intel will build an advantage in HPC high performance computing I anticipate that Xeon series CPUs will continue to edge out AMD Opterons in read intensive situations where data retrieval is more important So in general Intels solutions will continue to appeal in every varying circumstance that could potentially materialize for white box venders of servers or hyper scale providers like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Microsoft The performanceoriented crowd ie Universities and RD labs will get a combination of Altera branded FPGAs and Intel Xeon series CPUs in their super computers following the integration of both components on the Purley platform It also doesnt hurt that Intel will be integrating addinboard for graphics creating a truly comprehensive platform for any largescale super or mainframe computer The added momentum in the server CPU lineup gives me great conviction in Intels longterm growth trajectory Admittedly PCCG will either be flat to negative depending on the impact of a Windows launch The consolidated bottom line should grow as server revenue is more heavily weighted on gross margin impact I plan to release additional details on what I think revenue and earnings will look like over the summer Im still bullish on Intel and I think that investors will be pleasantly surprised over a multiyear holding period Source Intel Adds Momentum To Servers The Growth Story Is Not Over Disclosure The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to
