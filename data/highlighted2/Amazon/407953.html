</span>threat isnt quite as bad as the media is making it out to be Markets slumped on Tuesday Volatility has picked up it feels like we get an almost point up or down day on the Dow NYSEARCA DIA every single day lately Despite enthusiasm in the commodity sector the rest of the market couldnt find any strength Even with oil NYSEARCA USO nearing it wasnt enough to cheer the markets The Nasdaq NASDAQ QQQ led the way down while the other indices dropped a percent each With the exception of oil companies and a handful of the banks it was a pretty much red session all across the board with little spared from the selling Yieldsensitive names really took it hard Utilities NYSEARCA XLU got hit for losses across the board REITs generally dropped sharply and the consumer staples also got smacked Mondelez NASDAQ MDLZ Campbell Soup NYSE CPB and Kraft Heinz NASDAQ KHC were all off or more it was a day that the market took to selling the higheryielders The result of the selloff left the Dow Jones at its lowest point in almost two months Even robust commodity pricing hasnt been enough to relieve investors concerns over the slowing economy weak retail sales and underwhelming corporate profits The Fly sums up why this market is struggling to reach new highs There isnt going to be a great big breakout This isnt the beginning of a new bull market What youre trading is late cycle economic waste in the middle of a Presidential election cycle How do I know this The market has risen almost without pause since Since then weve doubled the debt of this country enacted psychotic central bank policies transferred enormous wealth from west to east under the guise of globalization all for the sake of trying to achieve growth All weve got to show for the effort is Trillion in debt and a whole bunch of service jobs The market and Fed are caught between a rock and a hard place On the one hand economic growth is anemic Real wages are flat to falling except for the elites The economic recovery of the last few years has mostly been a wealth transfer to the top of society According to Gallup polling only of Americans owned stocks in April the lowest figure in years the stock market boom has passed many people by The stimulus isnt doing much outside of propping up financial assets and its unclear what moves could cause more solid growth in the US economy It seems increasingly likely that the economy needs a recession to reset before a more solid recovery can ensue The Fed is reaching the limits of what it could possibly hope to achieve with easy money Despite the souring economic indicators the Fed was out talking about more rate hikes many people want policy normalization at this point regardless of the consequences Youve got falling corporate profits stagnant wages and retail sales slowing GDP growth and a Fed that isnt eager to stimulate further Stocks might make a nominal new high at some point this year but the case for a breakout and big move higher looks pretty weak Keep focused on risk management with a wary eye for opportunities here and there where they pop up I did add a new stock the first in months to my primary longterm portfolio Tuesday At a sub PE ratio more than yield and with a track record of dividend hikes in the last years its nice to get to buy something back at its January lows But in general even after this selloff its still a good time to hold some cash and see how things develop The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN will kill all retailers as we do all our shopping in sweatpants theme is reaching critical mass Fortunately or unfortunately depending on your point of view it isnt true Quick before I reveal the actual data take a guess What percent of sales occur online in the US If you guessed something in the single digits you win For all the fretting about online cannibalizing absolutely everything that weve heard over the last year realize that online makes up just of US sales weighing in at just billion out of the total trillion of retail sales Consider this since total brick and mortar sales are up by about billion which slightly exceeds the entirety of the ecommerce market in Thats right just the years of brick and mortar sales growth since are larger than the entire online market at this point None of this is to deny that ecommerce is a growing part of the overall picture However its up from just to of the total market since That means it took years to double Ecommerce had previously doubled in years growing from to of the market between and If ecommerce keeps doubling its overall share every years in online would make up of the total retail sales market which would make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>or whoever dominated online very powerful But brick and mortar would still control of the overall by then much larger pie If youre selling all your department store stocks and mall REITs I urge you to consider if youre acting prematurely The delta between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and other retailers NYSEARCA XRT has moved to an extreme level recently Over the past year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is up and retailers as a group are down Im not saying to short <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and buy traditional retailers tomorrow Its hard to call when these sentiment trends will reach their peak and switch direction But let me assure you the death of retail call is getting a bit overdone Online sales are of the total market and are growing at a modest pace WalMart isnt going out of business anytime soon I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than
