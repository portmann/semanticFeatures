( NASDAQ : GOOG ) | Seeking Alpha After six straight quarters , Google finally beats earnings expectations . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Austerity and <i>more</i> disciplined spending , the future of Google .  (Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will be forced to take similar steps as Wal-Mart attacks its core business . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A misconception over the strategy embraced by many tech companies is that they can continue to spend large sums of capital , incurring huge debts , as they scale out , <b>presumably</b> having the ability to turn on the earnings spigot and become highly profitable companies .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After years of engaging in those practices , Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) has <b>apparently</b> started to understand that there is only so far you can take that model before it has to start acting like a real company .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It appears this is a major reason Google hired Ruth Porat as its new CFO in <b>May</b> , to implement <i>more</i> discipline on the company , which has gone far astray of its core business , throwing money at numerous dubious projects .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some <b>may</b> point to tech companies have to scale out before focusing primarily on earnings .  (Uncertainty) </span>I don't dispute that.But that scale must end up being able to be profitably monetized on a sustainable basis in order to justify the expenditures.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With six quarters in a row of missing earnings estimates , it <b>appears</b> Google is starting to understand it must become <i>more</i> disciplined in its pursuit of new projects that have no guarantee of success , and which are outside its core business .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>After a couple of decades in business , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) has a similar challenge , as its leadership finds it difficult to rein in its ambitions and focus <i>more</i> on its core Internet retail business , as I wrote about concerning the strategy and future of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Now that Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) is striking quick and hard at its <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime business , AMZN will be forced to take actions to defend its position . I find that to be good for the company.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has also strayed far from its core business , spending a lot of money on projects it has had a lot of mixed results with . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It 's not that companies should n't try different things , it 's that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Google have found it difficult to restrain themselves from a seemingly endless array of projects , <b>suggesting</b> capital is being used as <i>more</i> of a playground for management than to build out a profitable business and business model . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For that reason , it 's refreshing to see Google take these initial steps to be <i>more</i> disciplined in the projects it throws money at .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Hopefully</b> , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will do the same , which will make it even <i>more</i> desirable to investors . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The obvious problem for Google was its expenses were outpacing its revenue growth.As quarter after quarter the company failed to meet earnings estimates, it became obvious someone had to come in and make some changes.From the last earnings report, it looks like Porat is already making her presence in the company known, as Google finally exceeded analysts' expectations.In the latest quarter, the tech giant had earnings of $6.99 per share, blowing past the $6.70 per share looked for by analysts.What's important here to me is it confirms even fast-growing tech companies have limitations, and the idea that they can spend with seeming impunity is not based on reality.In other words, all that money being spent wasn't generating revenue that offset it.Again, it's understandable in the early years of a company, but there comes a time when the adults must step in and settle things down.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That time for Google has arrived , and that should make the company even <i>better</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Now what Google must do is convince certain types of investors that this will be good for them over the long haul.Even though the company has struggled to meet earnings expectations by throwing a lot of money around, it gave the impression it was doing things that would pay off in revenue and earnings in the future.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That obviously did n't materialize , and so the new era of austerity <b>may</b> be upon .  (Uncertainty) </span>With that in mind, Google now has to prove it can in fact turn on the earnings spigot in regard to its core advertising business.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If it is n't able to do that on a consistent basis , questions will be raised on whether or not the numerous projects it touted were simply distractions to keep investors ' eyes off of its core performance .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do n't <b>believe</b> that 's the case , but Google must prove it .  (Uncertainty) </span>That is exactly what it must to do in the quarters ahead.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> some form of austerity continues , Google will have to balance the two areas in order to show it can still invest in new projects wisely while continuing to grow earnings at a pace investors are looking for .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If it is n't able to do that , it will show it is vulnerable .  (Uncertainty) </span>Under Porat's guidance, Google will attempt to walk the austerity/investment tightrope.She said that while Google will continue to pursue opportunities that have a lot of potential upside, it will do so "with great care regarding resource allocation."The company of course was using some of the spending as a form of marketing, as it let media know about the various projects it was engaging in.Whatever spending category one wants to put that under though, the fact is it was spending that its revenue and earnings weren't able to keep up with.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Google 's great challenge is to find ways to compete <i>stronger</i> in its search and advertising business , as major competitors like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) provide other means of finding what consumers are looking for outside of search . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>For that reason, to continue to spend on huge projects with little or no revenue potential in the near term, takes Google's eye off of its core business, which is in danger of losing its former appeal to competitive forces it should consider potential disruptors of its business model.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Another factor is the average price per ad has dropped for Google since 2011 , as <i>smaller</i> screens have exploded in use .  (Surprise) </span>Marketing departments don't consider them as effective as other content platforms.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The combination of disruption and declining ad price on average suggests the company needed to <b>reassess</b> its priorities .  (Uncertainty) </span>Focusing on its core business is the right step to take.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , it also faces a similar challenge , and the <i>sooner</i> it takes action to address this , the <i>better</i> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>It also has chased after numerous projects outside of its core business.As mentioned, now that Prime is under assault, it will be forced to defend it, as that is the future revenue and earnings generator of the company as it now stands.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The market has started to pressure the <i>more</i> mature tech companies to start showing earnings .  (Surprise) </span>Google is starting to respond to that demand , and I think <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will be forced to follow .
