(Uncertainty) </span>I am currently working on a report that will include my recommendations for those companies positioned to benefit.The report will provide details regarding how online equity crowdfunding has the potential to become one of the largest sources of revenue for the digital economy and five of its leading companies.The rapidly morphing digital economy, especially the emergence of online equity crowdfunding, was the impetus for founding the exclusive Dynasty Wealth (NYSE: DW ) Investing community.DW's specialty is to identify and produce ongoing research on companies that have the potential to multiply by 10- to 100-times in value within five years.Without the transformation from the industrial to the digital economy, which began when Netscape unveiled its Navigator browser in 1995, it would have been impossible to establish such a community.Digital economy companies - including disruptors and first movers - certainly manifest such potential.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For example , a $ 10,000 investment into Uber 's 2010 private placement was valued for $ 105 million in 2015 , equivalent to a multiple of <i>more</i> than 10,000 within 5 years .  (Surprise) </span>My 40 years of experience in the markets and the extensive research that I have conducted on the digital economy has enabled me to identify several outstanding disruptors and first movers.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>What distinguishes these is their potential to disrupt industries as large as , or even <i>larger</i> than the industries that Uber and Airbnb are disrupting .  (Surprise) </span>One recent digital-disruptor discovery is disrupting the $593 billion grocery industry and its vendor supply chain.The company provides non-GMO and organic foods directly to a consumer's doorstep at prices that are below conventional foods.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It also has patented a process that enables it to grow and deliver <i>fresher</i> and <i>higher</i> quality organic produce and at <i>lower</i> prices than now available in Whole Foods ( NYSE : WFC ) and other grocery stores .  (Surprise) </span>The most fascinating disruptor that I am now following is one that has developed software and systems that are very disruptive to the social media industry and Facebook.It quickly grew to over one million registrants after launching its beta version.Based on some new developments and the June launch of the next version of its software the company's monthly unique visitor count will grow by an annualized 10,000% by the end of the summer.The number of monthly unique visitors will grow from a most recent 80,000 to 10,000,000.For an overview and access to links to the subjects that I cover, including the digital economy, negative rates, perfect shorts, and micro-cap stocks please go to www.michaelmarkowski.net .Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it.I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Macro View , Demographics, SA Submit</div></body></html>
