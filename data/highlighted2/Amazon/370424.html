The two appeal to different types of investors.Bloomberg recently published an article that highlighted the most "loved" and "hated" stocks.Technology juggernauts Amazon.com Inc. ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) and International Business Machines ( NYSE : IBM ) fell on different sides of the list . Which makes it interesting to see what investors are paying for each.A comparison between IBM and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is n't perfect . One is a massive online retailer that has other important technology businesses, like providing cloud computing, thrown in the mix.The other is a technology giant that helps business customers solve their technology problems.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , that involves things like cloud computing and <b>could</b> easily involve working with retailers .  (Uncertainty) </span>In fact , when Seeking Alpha readers comment on IBM , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's services often come up as a reference point . Which is why stepping back and putting this pair up against each other is so interesting.If you were to buy these companies today, here's what you'd be paying... IBM's price to earnings ratio is around 10.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's P/E is over 450 . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To be fair , IBM is in the midst of a big business transformation and its revenues have been declining as it sells off assets so it can refocus on <i>higher</i> margin businesses .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That has investors concerned about the future and they have understandably pushed the shares <i>lower</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you buy into IBM , you need to <b>believe</b> that the turnaround will work out .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , meanwhile , is investing for growth and has been pretty much from day one . It's done a good job growing the top line, with revenues expanding at an annualized rate of 28% over the last decade.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>IBM 's revenues have fallen at an annualized rate of around 1 % over the same span , with <i>more</i> recent periods showing a <i>quicker</i> decline .  (Surprise) </span>The thing is, revenues are not earnings.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's growth spending has often pushed its bottom line into the red . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And while it earned $ 1.25 a share last year , the current share price , based on the price-to-earnings ratio , <b>appears</b> to be pricing in a huge amount of bottom line growth .  (Uncertainty) </span>That's true of the price to sales ratio, too.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's P/S ratio is around 2.6 compared to IBM 's 1.7 or so . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On this score , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> looks <i>more</i> reasonably valued , but IBM is still the <i>cheaper</i> option . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And sales are great , but only if they fall to the bottom line - something that is n't happening at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>nearly</b> as well as it 's happening at IBM . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>For example , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's operating margin has historically been in the low single digits . IBM's are routinely around 20%.Another interesting metric to examine is price to cash flow.While earnings are an important metric of how a company is doing, it's cash flow that pays the bills.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On that score , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is trading at 23 times cash flow and IBM at a far <i>more</i> modest 8 times . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That 's interesting considering that IBM is much <i>better</i> at turning sales into cash flow .  (Surprise) </span>For example, IBM's free cash flow as a percentage of sales has historically been in the low to mid teens.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has historically been in the low single digits , though it did pop up into the low teens last year . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Once again , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's growth story is getting the benefit of the <b>doubt</b> while IBM 's turnaround story , despite strong cash flow generation , is weighing on investor perception . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The point is n't to <b>suggest</b> that IBM or <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is the <i>better</i> investment as much as it is to point out the valuation discrepancy . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Institutional level investors have been clamoring for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> shares , according to Bloomberg , and the price reflects high expectations that have yet to show up in the numbers . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is the type of stock a growth minded investor <b>might</b> love , since future results are really what you are buying .  (Uncertainty) </span>IBM, meanwhile, is relatively unloved by big investors.That's largely because of its slow moving turnaround.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And with the top line falling during the effort , you can understand the concern that has driven IBM 's stock price <i>lower</i> .  (Surprise) </span>That's true even though it's still putting up solid results underneath that number.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Which is why , if you believe that the turnaround will work out , recent prices <b>could</b> be a compelling entry point .  (Uncertainty) </span>But only if you have a value bent.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That 's my preference , but it <b>might</b> not be yours .  (Uncertainty) </span>I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology</div></body></html>
