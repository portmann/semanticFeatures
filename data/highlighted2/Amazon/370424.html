class='textDiv'>Yes Im Going To Compare <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>And IBM International Business Machines Corporation NYSEIBM Seeking Alpha AMZN and IBM recently showed up on a list of over and underweighted stocks The two appeal to different types of investors Bloomberg recently published an article that highlighted the most loved and hated stocks Technology juggernauts Amazoncom Inc NASDAQ AMZN and International Business Machines NYSE IBM fell on different sides of the list Which makes it interesting to see what investors are paying for each A comparison between IBM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>isnt perfect One is a massive online retailer that has other important technology businesses like providing cloud computing thrown in the mix The other is a technology giant that helps business customers solve their technology problems However that involves things like cloud computing and could easily involve working with retailers In fact when Seeking Alpha readers comment on IBM Amazons services often come up as a reference point Which is why stepping back and putting this pair up against each other is so interesting If you were to buy these companies today heres what youd be paying IBMs price to earnings ratio is around Amazons PE is over To be fair IBM is in the midst of a big business transformation and its revenues have been declining as it sells off assets so it can refocus on higher margin businesses That has investors concerned about the future and they have understandably pushed the shares lower If you buy into IBM you need to believe that the turnaround will work out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>meanwhile is investing for growth and has been pretty much from day one Its done a good job growing the top line with revenues expanding at an annualized rate of over the last decade IBMs revenues have fallen at an annualized rate of around over the same span with more recent periods showing a quicker decline The thing is revenues are not earnings Amazons growth spending has often pushed its bottom line into the red And while it earned a share last year the current share price based on the pricetoearnings ratio appears to be pricing in a huge amount of bottom line growth Thats true of the price to sales ratio too Amazons PS ratio is around compared to IBMs or so On this score <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>looks more reasonably valued but IBM is still the cheaper option And sales are great but only if they fall to the bottom line something that isnt happening at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>nearly as well as its happening at IBM For example Amazons operating margin has historically been in the low single digits IBMs are routinely around Another interesting metric to examine is price to cash flow While earnings are an important metric of how a company is doing its cash flow that pays the bills On that score <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is trading at times cash flow and IBM at a far more modest times Thats interesting considering that IBM is much better at turning sales into cash flow For example IBMs free cash flow as a percentage of sales has historically been in the low to mid teens <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has historically been in the low single digits though it did pop up into the low teens last year Once again Amazons growth story is getting the benefit of the doubt while IBMs turnaround story despite strong cash flow generation is weighing on investor perception The point isnt to suggest that IBM or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is the better investment as much as it is to point out the valuation discrepancy Institutional level investors have been clamoring for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shares according to Bloomberg and the price reflects high expectations that have yet to show up in the numbers This is the type of stock a growth minded investor might love since future results are really what you are buying IBM meanwhile is relatively unloved by big investors Thats largely because of its slow moving turnaround And with the top line falling during the effort you can understand the concern that has driven IBMs stock price lower Thats true even though its still putting up solid results underneath that number Which is why if you believe that the turnaround will work out recent prices could be a compelling entry point But only if you have a value bent Thats my preference but it might not be yours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business
