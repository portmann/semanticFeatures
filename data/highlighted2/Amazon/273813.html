Second Coming For The Boeing The Boeing Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha The type looks to be a small but increasing bright spot for Boeing in the years ahead A surge in interest among cargo operators interest from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and lack of available frames could lead to new orders The has development costs paid off and can deliver solid profits to Boeings bottom line from any additional orders News these days surrounding Boeing NYSE BA is generally focused on the Boeing Dreamliner upcoming Max X and a potential replacement all exciting and mostly new gamechanging aircraft Interest among the general public surrounding the year old Boeing seems to have long gone For Boeing investors however they should be looking at the plane with much enthusiasm as commercial interest in the type begins to resurface While the Boeing program is years away from making any money and the appetite for Boeing s Boeings most profitable aircraft seems to have dried up for now the potential for the Boeing to deliver solid profits to Boeings bottom line is looking quite strong The aircrafts development costs have been paid off years ago and all profits from sales of the jet should flow directly to Boeings bottom line The interest for using the Boeing as a passenger aircraft remains tepid however Canadian carriers Air Canada rouge OTCPKACDVF and WestJet OTCWJAVF OTCWJAFF have selected the type for their long haul missions WestJet has started out with of the aircraft as it tests the waters for long haul low cost flying If successful WestJet is expected to eventually opt for the Boeing in the long haul as its aircraft of choice In the meantime however the airline is likely to acquire additional Boeing aircraft Air Canada has also stated it is looking at picking up additional used Boeing aircraft for passenger flying Beyond these airlines there does not seem to be anyone else publicly looking to acquire any large number of Boeing aircraft at the moment The tanker version of the Boeing the KC Pegasus has got orders from the USAF which will keep the Boeing line open through In addition there is interest in the type from Japan and other countries may select it as a tanker aircraft for their military Israeli Aerospace Industries has developed a passenger to tankerconversion package for the Boeing It has stated that they already have customers for the type and interest is growing This program will siphon additional used s off the market and away from customers looking to the aircraft for cargo conversions and passenger use a positive for Boeing Where the Boeing really shines however is when used as a cargo aircraft The aircraft has been popular with United Parcel Service Inc NYSE UPS for years with the company operating of the type With no orders for UPS on the books at the moment there is certainly the possibility it may order more either directly from Boeing or as converted freighters as it looks to replace its aging A freighter fleet in the future FedEx Express NYSE FDX has of the type on order brand new from Boeing with options for an additional on top of that SF Express of China is looking at acquiring Boeing freighters either conversions or newbuild aircraft The passenger to freighter conversion has currently been a big success with of the converted freighters ordered and delivered to date Many cargo operators like the aircraft for its overall economics maturity and commonality with the Boeing a popular aircraft among freight airlines The big news lately however with the Boeing and news that may spark renewed interest in it is rumors from within <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN that the company is looking to acquire Boeing aircraft for its exclusive use as it develops an inhouse logistics and transportation solution With only Boeing aircraft active and many of these with too many hours and cycles on them to be considered for freighter conversion a shortage could result ABX Kalitalla and Atlas Air are already picking up frames for conversion to freighter aircraft with many speculating the move is to win business from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does not currently have its own AOC and therefore would need to outsource flying initially The rumor from within <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may also prompt companies considering acquiring the model to pick it up sooner to avoid a shortage of aircraft later on The end result could be companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>are forced to either acquire the aircraft from Boeing new or partially fill their needs with new aircraft both situations would be positive for Boeing Despite not having the incredible fuel efficiency of the Boeing the Boeing is still a very economical aircraft Many people are unaware its empty weight is lighter than the Boeing meaning it will pay less in landing fees In addition despite using more fuel the aircraft has a list price much lower Looking into the numbers deeper it becomes obvious why cargo airlines love the plane so much Take a look at the following The above numbers are by no means exact since airlines negotiate different prices based on their orders with list prices almost never being paid and fuel consumption depends on many factors including weather payload and an abundance of other factors They are however good numbers to start with The above chart was put together in a report by MIT and showcases average aircraft utilization for FedEx Express Looking at the above chart an average utilization of hours a day for a cargo operation is probably a safe assumption to make Assuming the Boeing flies at its standard mph cruising speed for those hours of utilization this gives us a total distance flown of miles per day which translates into nautical miles So the difference in fuel cost in a versus the when flying nautical miles is per day Taking the million price difference into account would give you years of flying before the increased fuel consumption cost would equate to the million difference Even assuming huge daily utilization of hours gives us almost years before the increased fuel consumption would equal the difference in list price These numbers clearly show why the aircraft is a winner among cargo airlines For cargo airlines that generally have less aircraft utilization and fly shorter routes the Boeing is an ideal aircraft compared to the much more expensive complex It also has the benefit of being available right away as opposed to the Boeing that does not even exist in freighter form but in its passenger form has a backlog stretching for years For Boeing the looks to be a winner for its next years of production The increased interest in the aircraft has resulted in Boeing announcing an increase in production from to aircraft per month starting Q The aircraft has its costs paid off long ago allowing profits from sales of the jet to flow directly to Boeings bottom line In addition a long wait for the Boeing aircraft and the competitive economics and mature airframe make this a popular choice among cargo operators With air cargo growth forecasted to grow at per year going forward and disruptors like <span
