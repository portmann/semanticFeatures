(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Dave Dierking , Get Smart, Get Wealthy (229 clicks) Netflix's free cash flow burn rate has been increasing significantly as the company ratchets up its international expansion.The company recently issued over $1B of long-term debt to raise cash to fund growth.Current gross profit margin levels are unsustainable and operating margins have continued to drop.Netflix's announcement that it will raise subscription prices for new customers won't significantly move the needle in the short term.Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is scheduled to deliver earnings after Wednesday's market close.This will be the latest chance to see how well the international expansion is progressing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Around quarterly earnings time , Netflix stock tends to trade <b>almost</b> exclusively on subscriber growth numbers ( or lack thereof ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Actual financial results are given <i>less</i> weight considering that most people know the company is plowing money into the international expansion as well as increased content .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Earnings <b>may</b> not be a consideration right now but there 's one number that should be getting some <i>more</i> attention .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>That would be the cash flow number and it's becoming a problem.Netflix has been able to maintain a relatively breakeven free cash flow number for much of the past but the burn rate has really picked up as the company continues to expand its presence globally.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company reported a negative free cash flow burn of <b>almost</b> a quarter billion dollars in the most recent quarter .  (Uncertainty) </span>I wouldn't expect that number to improve any time soon until most of the international expansion is completed which wouldn't be until the beginning of 2017.Let's start with what Netflix has to work with when consider the cash flow issue.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Revenue obviously has been growing strong and is expected to <b>roughly</b> double by the end of 2017 thanks to continued subscriber growth .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Netflix has essentially issued an additional $ 1B of long-term debt over the past year in order to cushion its cash position presumably in <b>anticipation</b> of needing to pour <i>more</i> capital into expansion efforts .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Right now, the company certainly has the cash on hand right to handle the expenses necessary to continue its expansion.The total debt number isn't excessive presently but it is something to monitor to see if it needs to issue further debt to fund operations going forward.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Predictably</b> , as Netflix 's debt position has grown so has its interest expense .  (Uncertainty) </span>The figure in the chart is a trailing 12-month figure and actually understates how this expense is growing currently.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company reported <b>roughly</b> $ 35M in interest expense in the 2nd quarter which was a 32 % increase over the 1st quarter .  (Uncertainty) </span>Using those figures and the projected expense growth going forward, Netflix is looking at an annualized number in the $150M to $200M range currently.In other words, this is going to become a steadily increasing part of the balance sheet going forward.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Operating expense growth continues to follow revenue growth <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Revenue growth has thus far outpaced expense growth which should be encouraging for Netflix's ability to handle the cash flow burn in the future.Margins continue to be a mixed bag.Gross profit margin at 32% looks like a good number but it can't be expected to continue.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>International markets will likely yield <i>lower</i> margins than the domestic market over the future .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A long term gross margin of even 20 % seems <b>optimistic</b> as the company continues to grow .  (Uncertainty) </span>After rising for much of the last decade, operating margins are on the downswing again and are headed towards the low to mid single digit range.This is likely another number we won't see any significant improvement on until 2017 as well.While overall subscriber growth should be expected to remain strong the cost of generating that subscriber growth is growing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix has addressed the cash flow burn in the short term through its debt offering to raise cash but that <b>could</b> end up proving to be a short term band-aid if expenses continue growing .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Increased competition in the space from the likes of Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) , Hulu and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) <b>may</b> also push Netflix to ratchet up spending on customer acquisition and retention efforts . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The company announced it's raising the subscription rate on new subscribers but I don't think that's going to move the needle significantly.Existing customers will hang on to their existing rate while only new customers - the majority coming from international markets - will see the price hike.It'll be a means of improving revenue long term but its short term impact should be minimal.Third quarter earnings will give us an idea of the international expansion is progressing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Much of the expected subscriber growth is likely already priced in and any sign of slowdown <b>could</b> hit the stock hard .  (Uncertainty) </span>All eyes will be on the subscriber figure but equal importance should be placed on the free cash flow figure.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That <b>could</b> end up being the true measure of whether or not subscriber growth is coming at too great a price .
