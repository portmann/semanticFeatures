significantly as the company ratchets up its international expansion The company recently issued over B of longterm debt to raise cash to fund growth Current gross profit margin levels are unsustainable and operating margins have continued to drop Netflixs announcement that it will raise subscription prices for new customers wont significantly move the needle in the short term Netflix NASDAQ NFLX is scheduled to deliver earnings after Wednesdays market close This will be the latest chance to see how well the international expansion is progressing Around quarterly earnings time Netflix stock tends to trade almost exclusively on subscriber growth numbers or lack thereof Actual financial results are given less weight considering that most people know the company is plowing money into the international expansion as well as increased content Earnings may not be a consideration right now but theres one number that should be getting some more attention That would be the cash flow number and its becoming a problem Netflix has been able to maintain a relatively breakeven free cash flow number for much of the past but the burn rate has really picked up as the company continues to expand its presence globally The company reported a negative free cash flow burn of almost a quarter billion dollars in the most recent quarter I wouldnt expect that number to improve any time soon until most of the international expansion is completed which wouldnt be until the beginning of Lets start with what Netflix has to work with when consider the cash flow issue Revenue obviously has been growing strong and is expected to roughly double by the end of thanks to continued subscriber growth Netflix has essentially issued an additional B of longterm debt over the past year in order to cushion its cash position presumably in anticipation of needing to pour more capital into expansion efforts Right now the company certainly has the cash on hand right to handle the expenses necessary to continue its expansion The total debt number isnt excessive presently but it is something to monitor to see if it needs to issue further debt to fund operations going forward Predictably as Netflixs debt position has grown so has its interest expense The figure in the chart is a trailing month figure and actually understates how this expense is growing currently The company reported roughly M in interest expense in the nd quarter which was a increase over the st quarter Using those figures and the projected expense growth going forward Netflix is looking at an annualized number in the M to M range currently In other words this is going to become a steadily increasing part of the balance sheet going forward Operating expense growth continues to follow revenue growth higher Revenue growth has thus far outpaced expense growth which should be encouraging for Netflixs ability to handle the cash flow burn in the future Margins continue to be a mixed bag Gross profit margin at looks like a good number but it cant be expected to continue International markets will likely yield lower margins than the domestic market over the future A long term gross margin of even seems optimistic as the company continues to grow After rising for much of the last decade operating margins are on the downswing again and are headed towards the low to mid single digit range This is likely another number we wont see any significant improvement on until as well While overall subscriber growth should be expected to remain strong the cost of generating that subscriber growth is growing Netflix has addressed the cash flow burn in the short term through its debt offering to raise cash but that could end up proving to be a short term bandaid if expenses continue growing Increased competition in the space from the likes of Apple NASDAQ AAPL Hulu and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN may also push Netflix to ratchet up spending on customer acquisition and retention efforts The company announced its raising the subscription rate on new subscribers but I dont think thats going to move the needle significantly Existing customers will hang on to their existing rate while only new customers the majority coming from international markets will see the price hike Itll be a means of improving revenue long term but its short term impact should be minimal Third quarter earnings will give us an idea of the international expansion is progressing Much of the expected subscriber growth is likely already priced in and any sign of slowdown could hit the stock hard All eyes will be on the subscriber figure but equal importance should be placed on the free cash flow figure That could end up being the true measure of
