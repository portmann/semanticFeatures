your network administrator what works for you amazon amazon prime prime video Earlier this week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>announced that it was making its Prime membership program which includes access to the Prime library of streaming video and music discounted and expedited shipping and other benefits available on a monthly basis in two different forms Instead of the annual allencompassing fee of which comes out to month shoppers have the option of either month for Prime Video only or month for full access to the program So does it ever make sense to go the monthly route or should <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shoppers just ante up for the annual subscription There is no clear choice that covers all shoppers but there are some scenarios in which one plan may be more suited If youre a regular shopper on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and want the shopping benefits of Prime it makes more sense to go with the fullyear plan instead of the monthtomonth option Yes youve got to pay all at once for that membership but that ends up significantly less expensive than the youd spend over the course of the year Depending on what you buy and how quickly you need it you may want to consider ditching Prime altogether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>recently made it more difficult for nonPrime members to qualify for free shipping raising the minimum order to qualify for free shipping on most nonbook purchases to Book purchases only need to hit the mark to qualify So if youre regularly making purchases that pass the freeshipping threshold and dont mind waiting a few extra days for delivery then maybe the money youre spending Prime could be put to better use elsewhere Dont like dealing with holiday shopping crowds or getting to the store only to find the gift you wanted to buy is out of stock Thats why online shopping was invented Many gift purchases would likely be above that minimum to qualify for free shipping without Prime but that brings in the other factor Shipping time Maybe its a lastminute purchase or maybe that vague to day window for nonPrime customers is too big for you then youll either have to pay for expedited shipping or go the monthly Prime route For example twoday shipping on a PlayStation will run you Adding a month of Prime for would shave more than off that shipping cost Add in a copy of Dark Souls III and your nonPrime twoday shipping costs goes up to The monthly fee for Prime would cut that in half So if youre only an occasional <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shopper who swoops in once or twice a year to buy several items at the same time the monthly Prime might be the better option of the two Just remember to cancel when youre not using it Earlier this year in an effort to compete with the growing online marketplaces for console video games <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>began discounting preordered and newly released video games by for Prime members That means a new game like the aforementioned Dark Souls III will only cost instead of the other customers pay Avid gamers who regularly purchase new release games throughout the year would probably want to consider the annual Prime membership But if youre just looking to save on a particular title the fee for Prime would result in a net savings of one dollar for that game plus the free releasedate delivery The one tricky part here is knowing for certain when a video game is being released Any gamer knows that release dates arent terribly reliable and games are frequently delayed The video game discount for Prime is applied at shipping so if youre going to become a shortterm Prime member just to save money on video games it would be best to wait until shortly before the release date to make sure there isnt a lastminute schedule change Weve asked <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to confirm that this is correct and will update ifwhen we hear back If youre coming to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime for the streaming video library the monthly plan makes little sense unless youre only going to need access for a few weeks and need to make a bunch of purchases with twoday shipping Which is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>also announced a standalone Prime Videoonly service for month targeting curious but commitmentphobic cordcutters Over the course of a year youd pay a total of more for the ability to adddrop the service as needed Aside from people who want to test Prime Video without having to fork over a whole years membership fee who might be interested in this monthtomonth access If youre a fan of an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>original show like Transparent or Catastrophe and just want to pay to bingewatch a new season over the course of a few days then maybe its worth simply paying for access whenever something of interest pops up on Prime This could also hold true for some of the cable show catalogs in the Prime library Want to catch up on Season of Orphan Black but dont feel like paying to purchase the entire season The for a month of Prime Video will cost you less Important Regardless of whether you try the month full Prime access or the month Prime Video access make sure to keep track of when that month renews so that youre not paying for months you dont want or need Sprint Offering Customers Access To <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon
