(Surprise) </span>I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Disney COO Thomas Staggs most likely will be the next CEO when Bob Iger leaves in 2018.The media company is doing extremely well with all its characters and assets, but there are still issues to address.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>New content initiatives should be explored , ESPN must be addressed , content-production costs <b>could</b> be <i>more</i> contained , <i>more</i> `` Star Wars '' films are needed ... plus a crazy idea for an acquisition .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) Chief Operating Officer Thomas O. Staggs will be the media company's new CEO in summer 2018.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At least , that 's what many people suspect ; no official announcement has been made , but it looks fairly obvious to most that Staggs is the one who will take over , barring any new decisions on the transition of leadership that <b>may</b> happen between now and then .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>might</b> be a little early , but I have five things in mind that Staggs should concentrate on once he gets into his next position of power .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>assume</b> he is already thinking about what his first moves should be .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Here are some <b>suggestions</b> , completely free of charge .  (Uncertainty) </span>Yes, sell ESPN.The division has been great to Disney over the years, and it certainly will be a good asset for many years to come.But it's also a headache.Consumers are resisting the obligation to pay good money for channels they don't watch on any sort of regular basis.It's understandable.They are therefore canceling subscriptions to cable companies like Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) and searching elsewhere for their episodic fix.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Companies like Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) are offering <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> content ; additional streaming sources will become available as time goes on . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>This makes it tough for ESPN to grow over the long-term.Of course, there's a bull argument to be made as well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Not everyone will avoid cable subscriptions ; and many who cancel <b>may</b> eventually come back , not wanting to put up with the hassle of watching shows on this streaming service or that ad-heavy web address .  (Uncertainty) </span>ESPN is an odd division for Disney, though.It isn't about storytelling; well, not really anyway.I suppose sports competitions also tell tales of drama and action, the non-fiction kind.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Disney <b>probably</b> would be <i>better</i> off sticking to fictional storytelling and not exposing itself to increasing sports fees .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Let someone else <b>worry</b> about it .  (Uncertainty) </span>Staggs should consider ESPN the first problem he needs to study and solve.Cut movie production/advertising costs Movie budgets are out of control.Of most concern is compensation to talent.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In many ways , this is a <i>more</i> complex issue than ESPN .  (Surprise) </span>Disney is in the blockbuster industry.It specifically made a strategic choice to focus on expensive product.A lot of filming days are required to produce reels of quality moving images; the technical talent of the below-the-line personnel can only be cut so much.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That leaves the egregious above-the-line spreadsheet as the prime opportunity for <i>cheaper</i> filmmaking .  (Surprise) </span>Is a big star always necessary?Does a celebrity always need a percentage of the gross revenue and the backend?<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Do agents needlessly inflate compensation packages so they can make <i>more</i> money even if a star <b>might</b> be okay with a <i>lighter</i> salary ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>These are important questions Staggs must ponder.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In my view , Disney <b>could</b> simply refuse to pay the stars/agents what they want and perhaps negotiate other forms of compensation , such as perhaps funding ideas stars may have and placing the resultant projects on digital platforms such as Maker Studios ( if a project caught the attention of viewers , perhaps it <b>could</b> be ported over to ABC , or developed into a new movie production ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Disney <b>could</b> use lesser-known talent , or new talent .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The point is , <i>more</i> effort must be made to reduce compensation packages .  (Surprise) </span>It has been reported that Robert Downey Jr. made $50 million for The Avengers and $75 million for Iron Man 3.Let that sink in for a moment.That's just what Downey made.What about the rest of the cast?It adds up.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This 2014 <b>Variety</b> article is extremely noteworthy .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Not only does it source those reported numbers , but it discusses the importance of the Marvel franchise to Downey in the sense that he can leverage that <b>exposure</b> to help him promote his career in other pictures .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Well , that could certainly be used to garner a <i>lower</i> pay structure - I think it 's entirely possible that the actor would see the value of his association with Marvel/Disney if he <b>suddenly</b> were dropped from the superhero product .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I know.Sounds too ambitious.The creative muse can't be rushed.Saturation.Not enough good release dates in a calendar year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>All of the above are <b>risks</b> , I concede .  (Uncertainty) </span>But you know, I think both Pixar and Lucasfilm are up for it.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And Disney shareholders are <i>more</i> than up for it - they ( we , because I 'm a shareholder ) have to demand <i>more</i> movies because , whether or not a transaction with ESPN happens or not , problems in other areas of the company must be made up for by overachievement in the studio division .  (Surprise) </span>This is the part of Disney that I actually see as growing significantly in the next five, ten years.Let's consider 2017.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The eighth outing for Star Wars will arrive in <b>May</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Imagine in November, one of those spin-off movies is released … would it be too much too soon?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Probably</b> not .  (Uncertainty) </span>Star Wars is dense with mythology.There are many stories to be told.There's Yoda's tale, young Han Solo's tale, Obi-Wan Kenobi's tale, the tale of the construction of the Death Star, etc.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There 's probably a mystery/action movie that <b>could</b> be set in the Mos Eisley Cantina ; there 's a movie where all the bounty hunters have to get together to rescue Boba Fett from the Sarlacc Pit for one reason or other .  (Uncertainty) </span>Take any corner of this universe, there's a spin-off movie to be made.And merchandise to tie into it.The point is Staggs should see if he can figure out a way to increase the output of this ongoing saga without people experiencing Skywalker fatigue (or withdrawal, since Luke certainly can't be in all of them).<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Disney hinted at one point that a streaming service/channel devoted to all things Wars was a theoretical possibility ; I <b>doubt</b> that would ever happen , but I can say this - just thinking along those lines means <i>more</i> movies - as well as episodic series - need to be placed on a slate devoted to a galaxy far , far away .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Pixar released two films last year: Inside Out, The Good Dinosaur; the former was a big hit, the latter was, relative to the historical performance of the famed animation concern, something of a miss.It happens.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But it should n't deter Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter and eventual ( <b>probable</b> ) Disney CEO Staggs from increasing Pixar 's cinematic footprint .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company, like Lucasfilm, has a plethora of parables and fantasies to inculcate into the culture, and it would be a shame to deny the public extra CGI offerings in the coming years … and by that I mean a financial shame.The key is to expand the company's depth of human resources to allow this to happen.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As aforementioned , talent costs will have to be carefully managed so they do n't create <i>higher</i> budgets to go along with the <i>higher</i> frequency of releases .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Overhead will be taken care of by the economy of scale created by a <i>larger</i> slate .  (Surprise) </span>I admit, I go back and forth on this.It can make the pundit's mind go wild with disbelief when such an idea is brought up.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Yes , it is unimaginable , and <b>probably</b> has the same chance of occurring as a single ticket in a $ 1.5 billion Powerball lottery has of being the winning number .  (Uncertainty) </span>Here's why it should be considered.When (NYSEMKT: IF ) Staggs becomes CEO, he's going to want to buy something.It's what media chiefs do; it's what Iger did.Iger became famous for his asset collection.It should have been a gameshow sketch on some CNBC-version of Saturday Night Live - "What Will Bob Buy Next?"DreamWorks Animation (NASDAQ: DWA ) had a market cap of around $2.2 billion last time I checked.The effort CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg has invested in turning the company's fortunes around have been impressive.He's explored other revenue concepts, such as acquiring YouTube's popular AwesomenessTV channel.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>He 's working very hard on ensuring that the company 's cartoon portfolio turns out <i>more</i> hits than misses ( it 's turned out some high-profile misses recently , such as Turbo ) .  (Surprise) </span>He's made investments in China.Unfortunately, he wants to sell out.He's tried to sell the company in the recent past; remember when, for example, Hasbro was interested?Didn't work out.It would be an easy acquisition.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Disney <b>could</b> simply buy the company with stock currency .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It eliminates a competing actor in the marketplace , and it <b>could</b> cross-pollinate Pixar 's brain-trust-best-practices with DreamWorks Animation 's own formidable storytelling skills to improve the latter 's creative quality , thus increasing the chances for success at the box office .  (Uncertainty) </span>There's also opportunity for synergy between Pixar and DreamWorks Animation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What if Pixar created a sequel to Shrek , or DreamWorks Animation made another film in the Planes series ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What if the monsters and aliens from Monsters vs. Aliens showed up in Pixar 's Monsters , Inc. world for an ABC Halloween special ?  (Uncertainty) </span>What if the animals from Madagascar starred in a Thanksgiving special with the fish from Finding Nemo?How about combining The Incredibles and Rise of the Guardians for Christmas, or some other project?Cars and Turbo?The Croods and The Good Dinosaur?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Maybe Pixar and DreamWorks Animation <b>could</b> team up to make a big franchise picture no one would expect .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The two entities <b>could</b> also release collections of shorts from both talent pools .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Right now , Fox has a distribution deal with Katzenberg 's studio , but I 'm sure something <b>could</b> be worked out ( or it <b>could</b> be waited out ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Disney gets <i>more</i> movies to release , and if Pixar for some reason ca n't get up to three movies per year ( or , as it had to do in 2014 , it needs to take another year off ) , then DreamWorks Animation is ready to pick up the slack .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Anyone who knows about the problems Katzenberg had when he was at Disney knows there are a lot of politics involved , but I <b>believe</b> he nevertheless is a motivated seller who no <i>longer</i> wants to feel the scrutinizing stare of Wall Street 's eyes on his company 's quarterly reports ; besides , a different chief executive in 2018 will evaluate Katzenberg with a <i>cleaner</i> slate .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To me , this would be a fascinating , <b>unexpected</b> move by a Disney CEO that would certainly set a unique tone to a new tenure .  (Uncertainty) </span>AMC Networks (NASDAQ: AMCX ) made a name for itself with Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead.Disney should attempt to get in on this kind of action.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The company actually <b>probably</b> is trying to create shows like those for all I know , but I 'll still say that <i>more</i> effort needs to be made .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Recently, Disney's ABC Family channel changed over to Freeform .Although nothing about the change, as described in the linked article, would seem to indicate that Disney would try to compete with various cable outlets and their quality programming slate via Freeform, I consider the channel an opportunity.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As it evolves , Staggs <b>could</b> certainly order the channel 's executives to explore new ways to capture some of that Comic-Con audience .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Going in a different direction , stepping outside of a preexisting comfort zone , <b>might</b> be what 's needed .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>ABC certainly <b>could</b> be used to go after the AMC/HBO audience , but honestly , broadcast networks simply do n't play that game as well as the cablers .  (Uncertainty) </span>Even when they try, the tone is always different.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think placing a zombie epic on ABC would be a worthwhile <b>risk</b> to take , but it would n't be executed in the way it would need to be ; that 's just the game .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In fairness , it <b>probably</b> would interfere with the brand equity already cultivated via the network 's current curation of episodic series .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Affiliates likewise <b>could</b> offer resistance to such a radical change .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>( Then again , NBC 's Hannibal did run for three seasons , and it was an excellent collection of story arcs ; still , if it was on HBO , the presentation would <b>probably</b> have been even <i>more</i> impressive . )  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Freeform , as the name implies , will <b>probably</b> have <i>more</i> freedom over time to truly attract its intended audience by means of programming that would be considered quite radical compared to ABC Family 's previous mission statement .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Let 's <b>hope</b> Staggs look at the channel as a laboratory for much-needed innovation .  (Uncertainty) </span>When the channel was purchased years ago by erstwhile CEO Michael Eisner, there was criticism centering on the overpayment for an asset that was merely meant to be a vehicle for repurposing ABC programming in an age when cable on-demand wasn't relevant.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Today 's multiscreen digital environment comes with a completely unique set of rules , and I 've always wished for the channel to be <i>more</i> than it is , or , perhaps to be shut down or sold ( <b>assuming</b> there were any interested bidders out there ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I like that the brand is pivoting to some extent , but the programming needs to <i>more</i> aggressively reinforce the course adjustment .  (Surprise) </span>Thomas Staggs has a big job ahead of him.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sure , he may not end up being the next CEO , but I - and probably everyone else - <b>assume</b> he has the promotion .  (Uncertainty) </span>These are all things I think he should consider.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Some bonus items : Make Disney Infinity <i>more</i> valuable by increasing the output of different figures but making <i>less</i> of each one ( also , allow the figures to unlock content , such as TV episodes , trailers , old Disney video games , etc. ) rReally think about what Disney can do to enhance the value proposition of Hulu , or <b>perhaps</b> reevaluate the company 's investment in the service Order Marvel to investigate the feasibility of selling old comic issues through print-on-demand technologies Disney is a powerful business that is iconic , not only for its characters but for its cash flows .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Nothing can be taken for granted , and execs must always <b>assume</b> that fresh thinking is requisite to foster continued growth .
