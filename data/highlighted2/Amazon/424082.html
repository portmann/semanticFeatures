(Uncertainty) </span>Firstly, Dick's margins are on the low side.The current trailing twelve-month profit margin is 4.4%.This doesn't give the company much breathing room between profit and loss.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Whilst we do n't truly fear <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> at this point in time , <b>believing</b> most consumers like to get expert advice and a good feel of sports apparel and equipment before buying , we would never rule it out becoming a market-leader in the sports retail industry one day . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> were to one day increase its own assortment and disrupt the industry on price , then things <b>could</b> become difficult . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>So right now we feel Dick's is a good long-term investment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We do expect there to be a couple of slow quarters which <b>could</b> pull the share price down further , but overall we see significant upside ahead for shareholders in the next 18 months .  (Uncertainty) </span>Dick's earnings are expected to be negatively impacted by the demise of Sports Authority in the short term, so full year earnings per share are likely to be down from last year's $2.87.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We see full year earnings coming in at $ 2.80 , a little <i>lower</i> than the consensus estimate of $ 2.82 .  (Surprise) </span>The year after we expect a jump in earnings per share to around $3.20, based on market share capture and organic growth.In our opinion 17.5 times earnings is a fair multiple to value the stock on.Based on this we have a target price of $49.00 for FY 2016, rising to $56.00 in FY 2017.This would translate as a shareholder return of 14% in FY 2016 and around 30% in FY 2017.Making it definitely worth sticking with Dick's for the long-term in our opinion.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Services , Sporting Goods Stores</div></body></html>
