class='textDiv'>Dicks Sporting Goods Stick With It For The Long Term Dicks Sporting Goods Inc NYSEDKS Seeking Alpha Dicks Sporting Goods may have a subdued quarter or two as Sports Authoritys liquidation sales hampers sales Once Sports Authority is well and truly out of the way we expect it will be positioned well to win the vacated market share We dont see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as being too big a threat at the moment We think the demise of Sports Authority from the sports retail market will prove to be a great boost for Dicks Sporting Goods NYSE DKS is the longterm However in the short term there could be a little bit of disappointment as consumers take advantage of liquidation sales But if the share price were to decline as a result we plan on topping up our position as and when the opportunity strikes In addition to this concerns over retail behemoth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN stealing the vacated market share are unnecessary and we feel Dicks is positioned well to capture market share Sports Authority has left a huge gap in the market A gap worth billion per year according to Forbes When you consider that Dicks Sporting Goods annual revenue last year was billion it becomes apparent just what a boost to Dicks top line this could make Sports Authority had almost stores in operation when it entered bankruptcy with Dicks positioned well geographically to capture a lot of market share How much That is the milliondollar question but we think from next year we might to see revenue jump up greatly But not immediately This quarter and next are likely to be weak due to the liquidation sales by Sports Authority Most consumers like a bargain and we expect there will have been many found at Sports Authority recently We are concerned that some consumers may have brought forward planned purchases in order to take advantage of lower prices today For example someone that expects to need a new tennis racquet in the next six months might opt to purchase one ahead of time because theyre too cheap to say no to For this reason the market share gains may take some time to filter down to Dicks But we do expect they will The company is fighting for Sport Authoritys customers and we expect they will win a good share of them The company has been appealing to Sports Authority loyaltycard members with a sign up bonus if they sign up for their own loyalty program In addition to this it was reported this week that participants in the Bolder Boulder race in Colorado will be able to redeem the and discount coupons for Sports Authority in Dicks stores The coupons which they received for their participation in the race are not able to be redeemed in Sports Authority stores due to its liquidation This is both great PR and a good way of winning customers in Sports Authoritys homemarket of Colorado There has been a lot of talk of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>disrupting the industry and leading to the downfall of many retailers like Dicks Whilst we wont say this will never happen we do feel that retailers like Dicks are not as threatened by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as others For a start Credit Suisse estimates that only of the sporting goods products that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>stocks are sold and fulfilled by the company With the majority of its assortment coming from third parties Subsequently its analysts see Amazons pricing as being less disruptive than in other retail segments giving the sporting goods industry a little bit of hope Lets not forget also that there are a wide range of different sporting goods to choose from for a reason We are all different shapes and sizes with vastly different preferences For us whether it be sports shoes or golf clubs we would like an experts opinion on what we buy before we buy it For many years a colleague of ours was wearing running shoes that were actually doing more harm than good After speaking to someone in store they were recommended shoes that supported their particular body construct and have not looked back since For this reason we feel many consumers will value the expert advice that can be received in store ahead of the convenience of a few clicks on Amazoncom There are downside risks of course Firstly Dicks margins are on the low side The current trailing twelvemonth profit margin is This doesnt give the company much breathing room between profit and loss Whilst we dont truly fear <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>at this point in time believing most consumers like to get expert advice and a good feel of sports apparel and equipment before buying we would never rule it out becoming a marketleader in the sports retail industry one day If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>were to one day increase its own assortment and disrupt the industry on price then things could become difficult So right now we feel Dicks is a good longterm investment We do expect there to be a couple of slow quarters which could pull the share price down further but overall we see significant upside ahead for shareholders in the next months Dicks earnings are expected to be negatively impacted by the demise of Sports Authority in the short term so full year earnings per share are likely to be down from last years We see full year earnings coming in at a little lower than the consensus estimate of The year after we expect a jump in earnings per share to around based on market share capture and organic growth In our opinion times earnings is a fair multiple to value the stock on Based on this we have a target price of for FY rising to in FY This would translate as a shareholder return of in FY and around in FY Making it definitely worth sticking with Dicks for the longterm in our opinion I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions
