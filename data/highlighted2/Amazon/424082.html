( NYSE : DKS ) | Seeking Alpha Dick 's Sporting Goods <b>may</b> have a subdued quarter or two as Sports Authority 's liquidation sales hampers sales .  (Uncertainty) </span>Once Sports Authority is well and truly out of the way we expect it will be positioned well to win the vacated market share.We do n't see <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> as being too big a threat at the moment . We think the demise of Sports Authority from the sports retail market will prove to be a great boost for Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE: DKS ) is the long-term.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , in the short term there <b>could</b> be a little bit of <b>disappointment</b> as consumers take advantage of liquidation sales .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>But if the share price were to decline as a result, we plan on topping up our position as and when the opportunity strikes.In addition to this , concerns over retail behemoth <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) stealing the vacated market share are unnecessary and we feel Dick 's is positioned well to capture market share . Sports Authority has left a huge gap in the market.A gap worth $3.5 billion per year according to Forbes.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When you consider that Dick 's Sporting Goods ' annual revenue last year was $ 7.27 billion , it becomes apparent just what a boost to Dick 's top line this <b>could</b> make .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sports Authority had <b>almost</b> 800 stores in operation when it entered bankruptcy , with Dick 's positioned well geographically to capture a lot of market share .  (Uncertainty) </span>How much?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That is the million-dollar question , but we think from next year we <b>might</b> to see revenue jump up greatly .  (Uncertainty) </span>But not immediately.This quarter and next are likely to be weak due to the liquidation sales by Sports Authority.Most consumers like a bargain and we expect there will have been many found at Sports Authority recently.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We are concerned that some consumers <b>may</b> have brought forward planned purchases in order to take advantage of <i>lower</i> prices today .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For example , someone that expects to need a new tennis racquet in the next six months <b>might</b> opt to purchase one ahead of time because they 're too cheap to say no to .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For this reason , the market share gains <b>may</b> take some time to filter down to Dick 's .  (Uncertainty) </span>But we do expect they will.The company is fighting for Sport Authority's customers and we expect they will win a good share of them.The company has been appealing to Sports Authority loyalty-card members with a $20 sign up bonus if they sign up for their own loyalty program.In addition to this it was reported this week that 51,000 participants in the Bolder Boulder race in Colorado will be able to redeem the 10 and 15% discount coupons for Sports Authority in Dick's stores.The coupons, which they received for their participation in the race, are not able to be redeemed in Sports Authority stores due to its liquidation.This is both great PR and a good way of winning customers in Sports Authority's home-market of Colorado.There has been a lot of talk of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> disrupting the industry and leading to the downfall of many retailers like Dick 's . Whilst we wo n't say this will never happen , we do feel that retailers like Dick 's are not as threatened by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> as others . For a start , Credit Suisse estimates that only 17 % of the 3,000 sporting goods products that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stocks are sold and fulfilled by the company . With the majority of its assortment coming from third parties.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Subsequently , its analysts see <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's pricing as being <i>less</i> disruptive than in other retail segments , giving the sporting goods industry a little bit of <b>hope</b> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Let's not forget also that there are a wide range of different sporting goods to choose from for a reason.We are all different shapes and sizes, with vastly different preferences.For us, whether it be sports shoes or golf clubs, we would like an expert's opinion on what we buy before we buy it.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For many years a colleague of ours was wearing running shoes that were actually doing <i>more</i> harm than good .  (Surprise) </span>After speaking to someone in store they were recommended shoes that supported their particular body construct and have not looked back since.For this reason , we feel many consumers will value the expert advice that can be received in store ahead of the convenience of a few clicks on Amazon.com . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are downside <b>risks</b> of course .  (Uncertainty) </span>Firstly, Dick's margins are on the low side.The current trailing twelve-month profit margin is 4.4%.This doesn't give the company much breathing room between profit and loss.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Whilst we do n't truly fear <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> at this point in time , <b>believing</b> most consumers like to get expert advice and a good feel of sports apparel and equipment before buying , we would never rule it out becoming a market-leader in the sports retail industry one day . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> were to one day increase its own assortment and disrupt the industry on price , then things <b>could</b> become difficult . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>So right now we feel Dick's is a good long-term investment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We do expect there to be a couple of slow quarters which <b>could</b> pull the share price down further , but overall we see significant upside ahead for shareholders in the next 18 months .  (Uncertainty) </span>Dick's earnings are expected to be negatively impacted by the demise of Sports Authority in the short term, so full year earnings per share are likely to be down from last year's $2.87.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We see full year earnings coming in at $ 2.80 , a little <i>lower</i> than the consensus estimate of $ 2.82 .  (Surprise) </span>The year after we expect a jump in earnings per share to around $3.20, based on market share capture and organic growth.In our opinion 17.5 times earnings is a fair multiple to value the stock on.Based on this we have a target price of $49.00 for FY 2016, rising to $56.00 in FY 2017.This would translate as a shareholder return of 14% in FY 2016 and around 30% in FY 2017.Making it definitely worth sticking with Dick's for the long-term in our opinion.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Services , Sporting Goods Stores</div></body></html>
