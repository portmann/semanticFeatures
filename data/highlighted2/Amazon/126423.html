At the same time, none of these businesses are focused on immediately returning cash to shareholders.All are richly valued.If you invested in Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) or Google ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) over the past 10 years , you 've done very well for yourself . Below, you can see what those stocks have done in the last decade (Facebook is 245% above its $38 IPO price from mid-2012).The question is, have these high-growth stocks appreciated to the point that there's little upside left.For investors like me that are looking for Growth At a Reasonable Price (GARP), the growth is there, but is the price reasonable?This article will examine that question.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What 's remarkable about these performances is n't just the incredible growth and <b>volatility</b> , but that all four of these companies have very little commitment to returning cash directly to shareholders .  (Uncertainty) </span>None of them have ever paid a dividend, nor do they consistently buy back shares.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix has a debt/equity ratio of 1.3 and negative tangible equity that has gotten consistently <i>more</i> negative over the past five years .  (Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has reported losses in five of the last 10 quarters . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Facebook will always limit the obnoxiousness and thus revenue potential of its ads , although it <b>may</b> be able to <i>better</i> monetize the newsfeed .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It also <b>may</b> not be doing as well with current teens .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Google Glass flopped , and some of its other R&D projects <b>may</b> be of dubious investment value .  (Uncertainty) </span>But at the same time, all of these companies run high-growth, wide-moat businesses that are flat-out exciting.What's interesting is that the share price reflects the latter reality, not the former.We can see with Stock Rover that the pricing for most of these stocks looks pretty rich compared to the S&P average and their respective industries.Netflix and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> have incalculable P/Es since they 're outspending their revenue stream , and Netflix has negative cash flow as well . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Netflix also have book values far out of line with the S&P , or even the other companies on the list . However, not all pricing is as rich as others: Google and Facebook are in line for relatively normal 2016 P/Es, and Google's book and cash flow valuations look like a reasonable premium for a high-growth company.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's sales valuation is also in a pretty normal range . When we look at the industry deciles for these companies, we see a similar story.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>All rank well in growth , but poorly in price/sales ( a <i>lower</i> decile number is <i>better</i> ) .  (Surprise) </span>Here, we see pretty well crystallized an inverse relationship between growth and valuations for earnings, book, sales and cash flow.Looking at the charts below , we can see that Google 's valuations have come down over the last 10 years in a way that is n't true for Netflix and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Netflix's Price/Sales is back to where it was before the Qwikster fiasco of 2011, when the company tried to spin off its DVDs-by-mail business, and 800,000 subscribers ran for the exits.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Although it 's hard to see in the graph , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's P/S of 2.5 is also on the <i>higher</i> side of its historical range . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Looking at Price/Book tells a similar story.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Google was on the <i>lower</i> end of its respective ranges , until shares spiked 15 % recently .  (Surprise) </span>The cause: Google showed discipline with expenses, and beat earnings estimates.That's especially relevant, because I think the reason Google's multiples came down over the past few years was investor cynicism about its fiscal priorities.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While most of what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Netflix spend goes directly to furthering their businesses - <i>more</i> warehouses or another season of House of Cards - many investors felt Google was spending on side projects unrelated to its core search business . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As awesome as that search business is , I think the market felt that Google 's free-spending ways warranted a <i>lower</i> valuation .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Google 's recent fiscal discipline has hinted it is becoming a different kind of company than the rest , <i>more</i> like an Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) than a Netflix .  (Surprise) </span>Investors seem pleased about that.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In a way , these kinds of stocks are unhinged from reality : Is Netflix really 440 times <i>more</i> valuable than it was 10 years ago ?  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Has it really become 78 % <i>more</i> valuable every year for ten years ?  (Surprise) </span>That's an average growth rate of 15.5% every quarter or 4.9% every month for 10 years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When Netflix executed a 7:1 stock split last week , the company 's stock was up 20 % the same day , possibly because investors <b>could</b> now buy a $ 100 stock instead of a $ 700 stock , even though the new shares are 1/7th as valuable as they had been .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix has to pop.I would never short it, but the bubble has to pop.But in another way, these companies possess many of the aspects that GARP and value investors often look for: wide-moat business, loyal customers, network effects, and high growth.No one will ever replace Google search , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> online retail or Facebook , much as no one will ever build another North American railroad . Yet, the pricing is far out of line with what most value investors or even growth investors would normally pay.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I consider owning Netflix or <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> primarily a momentum trade while Google and Facebook are <i>better</i> seen as growth investments . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has been taking the long view on reinvesting in its business for 20 years : It <b>could</b> keep spending on <i>more</i> warehouses and drones forever and never get around to directly returning cash to shareholders . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services <b>could</b> be a great business , but I do n't know how large a portion of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's revenue it <b>could</b> ever become . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix could continue ramping up its content creation budget , but <b>may</b> not be able to replicate the extraordinary string of hits it has had so far .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These companies <b>might</b> continue to prioritize those investments over putting cash directly in shareholders ' pockets for the foreseeable future .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I <b>wonder</b> if investors will someday take the same cynical approach with these companies they 've had with Google and drop their valuations .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As for me , I 'd rather own Google or Facebook , companies that are moving towards a <i>more</i> realistic earnings valuation .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Those businesses are similarly irreplaceable , but with <i>less</i> room to come down if investors become bearish the way they have with , say , Twitter ( NYSE : TWTR ) .
