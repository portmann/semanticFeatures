is currently an authorized user on my Freedom card Id like for her to take advantage of this signup promotion Can she open up her own credit card and qualify for the bonus even though she is currently an authorized user on my account I wonder if I just need to remove here as an authorized user first Any experience out there Steve In my experience you dont have to remove her as an authorized user Credit cards are considered only issued to individuals If she opens her own card she is a new person solely responsible for any fees and debt incurred on that card and will be eligible for the bonus I was a Freedom card holder previously but then I consolidated the credit limit from that to my Slate and closed Freedom This was about a year ago Do you think I would be eligible for the promotion if I opened another Freedom card Thomas Sorry I didnt reply because I dont know If it was me I might try if it was definitely over a year ago since you closed it I wouldnt bother if it was less than a year Adam Thanks for alerting me Im still not sure why it happened but the RSS feed should be fixed now No back on grocery stores for ANY quarter of I may need to find an extra card for that even a limitedtime promotional offer would do since I could just stock up on gift cards SteveJonathan re Credit cards are considered only issued to individuals If she opens her own card she is a new person solely responsible for any fees and debt incurred on that card This is a basic question but how does marriage factor into credit card debt or debt generally I always thought one always assumes responsibility for any debts incurred by ones spouse prior to or during the marriage regardless of the source Antonio Can you refresh and check again It was down but I fixed it earlier today and I just checked it again Cody First I want to say that I am wrong about there not being joint credit cards apparently there are some although Ive never applied for one But if you apply for an individual card they will only check your individual credit report and make a decision based on that not whether your spouse has the card or not httpmoneycnncompfjointcreditcards Most states called common law states use common law rules when determining who is liable for a particular debt in a marriage In common law states you are usually only liable for credit card debt if the obligation is in your name This means that if the credit card is only in your spouses name you are typically not liable for that debt However keep in mind that if you have jointly owned assets then the credit card company can still go after your spouses interest in that property I had applied for chase freedom card in the month of December under the cash back offer But unfortunately it got rejected due to poor credit history Am new to US been here from only months Now I have a fair credit rating Can I ask Chase to reconsider my old application and see if it can be approved and also will that cash back bonus still hold good Check Flyertalk for more information but the general feeling is that Chase has made changes to their approval policy and for the Chase owned cards Freedom Sapphire Ink they seem to be rejecting applications if there are or credit card applications in the last months total across all issuers not just Chase Even people with credit scores over are getting rejected for Freedoms Interesting I got denied and called the reconsideration number They told me what you just outlined I had too many credit card applications in the past years I asked if they were referring to my chase activity or all issuers they told me from all issuers I was just approved for the united card two months ago so this seems like a new policy Kind of sad to see the game end at least with chase Is the cash back only for new accounts When I sign into my Freedom account I dont see anything above and beyond the quarterly bonus Or perhaps the is targeted It should be for all Chase Freedom accounts It is prominently featured on Chases activation pages here and here Thanks for the headsup on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>cash back promo Time to stock up on their giftcards
