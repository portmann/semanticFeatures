class='textDiv'>Sizing Up Amazons Competition In India Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has committed an additional billion towards its efforts in India bringing the total investment up to billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>faces competition from Flipkart Snapdeal and Chinese ecommerce site Alibaba It was recently announced that Jeff Bezos plans to invest an additional billion in Amazons NASDAQ AMZN efforts in India <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has already invested billion into the quickly growing region As a result it boasts fulfillment centers across the nation and expects to open a Web Services Cloud Region and the firms largest software development center outside of the US With such a large investment its crucial to evaluate the competition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will be facing in India There are three major players affecting the Indian ecommerce market at the moment Snapdeal Flipkart and Alibaba Below is an evaluation of each Snapdeal was launched in as an online daily deals website and has since expanded to an online marketplace Headquartered in New Delhi the platform appears to be strapped for cash Along with other struggling ecommerce sites such as Flipkart Snapdeal has begun advertising on its site to provide additional revenues A report by Mint has stated that Snapdeals monthovermonth revenue has actually been in decline since this past November Snapdeal denies the claim but refuses to release sales data The sluggish sales are apparently due to a decrease in deals offered on the site in an effort to achieve profitability Snapdeal has a large problem in its retention of upper level executives It recently lost Chief Product Officer Anand Chandrasekaran and will not be replacing the position Chandrasekaran joins other recent top level departures such as former Head of Products Punit Soni Marketing Head Idi Srinivas and VP Rahul Taneja Flipkart was once Indias ecommerce darling Founded in it has encountered a host of issues since its early success Flipkart was initially able to grow rapidly largely from the lack of competition and billion of outside investments Recently a scathing letter from India Value Fund Advisors Partner Haresh Chawla has brought to light some serious issues at the online marketplace Here are some of the major points from his letter Flipkart has focused too heavily on their sale of smartphones which represent over of Gross Merchandise Value to the exclusion of everything else Attempted to go to an apponly platform plan failed App experience is subpar to Amazons and search capabilities are poor No loyalty program at the company accelerates ceding of market share to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Company is poor at behaving frugally member workforce is too large and complex to move nimbly Internal conflict between founders and top level professional management has caused several executives to leave the company and cause uncertainty towards the future Moreover Chawla believes Flipkarts response to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been dismal if at all present In the article he writes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is snipping at its heels and Flipkart has no clue which way to go Despite Chawlas harsh words Flipkart is still a considerable threat to Amazons success in India There are two sides to every argument and this response to Chawlas letter should provide an adequate presentation of the positive things Flipkart has going for itself Flipkart also exceeds <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in number of sellers on its website if this is any metric of success It currently boasts sellers compared to Amazons Rival Snapdeal takes first place with sellers I dont see this as a necessarily important metric since quality over quantity should factor in significantly to ecommerce Due to new market entrants and subpar performance Flipkarts evaluation has taken a beating Morgan Stanley reduced the value of their stake in the company by bringing Flipkarts evaluation down to approximately billion from billion While Alibaba is not directly in the Indian consumer market at the moment it has been crafting partnerships and scouting a possible entrance in the near future It also holds a stake in Snapdeal and Paytm another online marketplace Alibaba also has a BB platform up and running in the country As a possible entrant to the Indian market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>should be very wary of Alibaba The Chinese company defeated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in terms of market share on its home turf for the time being Also unlike Snapdeal and Flipkart Alibaba has very deep pockets and need not worry about raising capital or turning a profit anytime soon However Amazons headstart and success should reduce the effects of Alibabas actions Overall <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is striking at a time when the dominant players in the space are at their weakest Frontrunners Flipkart and Snapdeal are running low on cash losing top level management and responding poorly to Amazons entrance to the market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has steadily been stealing market share from the two just mentioned It was reported this year that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>saw its market share in terms of shipments rise to over percent from percent making it the only major player to increase its share from a year ago Rival Flipkart slipped from percent in March to percent in March and Snapdeal slipped from percent to percent Bezos has been quoted as saying Our Amazonin team is surpassing even our most ambitious milestones Bezos cites further evidence of Amazons success using ComScore to say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was leading with more than million monthly unique visitors to its site as of October Flipkart was lagging behind at million while Snapdeal was at million All the conditions look favorable for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and I believe the veteran company will emerge as the dominant player in India Once this and consolidation in the industry occurs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can expect to reap the benefits from one of the largest markets in the world This is a fantastic strategic move and will stand to benefit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for years possibly decades to come Bezos believes there is much more in store for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>India saying I can assure you its only the beginning and as we say in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>its only day one I encourage you to follow me as I
