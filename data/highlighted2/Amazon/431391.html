( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has committed an additional $ 3 billion towards its efforts in India , bringing the total investment up to $ 5 billion . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> faces competition from Flipkart , Snapdeal , and Chinese e-commerce site Alibaba . It was recently announced that Jeff Bezos plans to invest an additional $ 3 billion in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) efforts in India . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has already invested $ 2 billion into the quickly growing region . As a result , it boasts 21 fulfillment centers across the nation and expects to open a Web Services Cloud Region and the firm 's largest software development center outside of the U.S. With such a large investment , it 's crucial to evaluate the competition <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will be facing in India . There are three major players affecting the Indian e-commerce market at the moment; Snapdeal, Flipkart, and Alibaba.Below is an evaluation of each: Snapdeal was launched in 2010 as an online daily deals website, and has since expanded to an online marketplace.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Headquartered in New Delhi , the platform <b>appears</b> to be strapped for cash .  (Uncertainty) </span>Along with other struggling e-commerce sites such as Flipkart, Snapdeal has begun advertising on its site to provide additional revenues.A report by Mint has stated that Snapdeal's month-over-month revenue has actually been in decline since this past November.Snapdeal denies the claim, but refuses to release sales data.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The sluggish sales are <b>apparently</b> due to a decrease in deals offered on the site , in an effort to achieve profitability .  (Uncertainty) </span>Snapdeal has a large problem in its retention of upper level executives.It recently lost Chief Product Officer Anand Chandrasekaran, and will not be replacing the position.Chandrasekaran joins other recent top level departures , such as former Head of Products Punit Soni, Marketing Head Idi Srinivas, and VP Rahul Taneja.Flipkart was once India's e-commerce darling.Founded in 2007, it has encountered a host of issues since its early success.Flipkart was initially able to grow rapidly, largely from the lack of competition and $3.2 billion of outside investments.Recently, a scathing letter from India Value Fund Advisors Partner Haresh Chawla has brought to light some serious issues at the online marketplace.Here are some of the major points from his letter: · Flipkart has focused too heavily on their sale of smartphones, which represent over 50% of Gross Merchandise Value, "to the exclusion of everything else".· Attempted to go to an app-only platform, plan failed.App experience is subpar to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's and search capabilities are poor . · No loyalty program at the company accelerates ceding of market share to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . · Company is poor at behaving frugally.35,000 member workforce is too large and complex to move nimbly.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>· Internal conflict between founders and top level professional management has caused several executives to leave the company and cause <b>uncertainty</b> towards the future .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Moreover , Chawla <b>believes</b> Flipkart 's response to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has been dismal , if at all present . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>In the article he writes , `` <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is snipping at its heels and Flipkart has no clue which way to go '' . Despite Chawla 's harsh words , Flipkart is still a considerable threat to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's success in India . There are two sides to every argument, and this response to Chawla's letter should provide an adequate presentation of the positive things Flipkart has going for itself.Flipkart also exceeds <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in number of sellers on its website , if this is any metric of success . It currently boasts 100,000 sellers , compared to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's 85,000 . Rival Snapdeal takes first place with 250,000 sellers.I don't see this as a necessarily important metric, since quality over quantity should factor in significantly to e-commerce.Due to new market entrants and subpar performance, Flipkart's evaluation has taken a beating.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Morgan Stanley reduced the value of their stake in the company by 27 % , bringing Flipkart 's evaluation down to <b>approximately</b> $ 11 billion from $ 15.2 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While Alibaba is not directly in the Indian consumer market at the moment , it has been crafting partnerships and scouting a <b>possible</b> entrance in the near future .  (Uncertainty) </span>It also holds a stake in Snapdeal and Paytm, another online marketplace.Alibaba also has a B2B platform up and running in the country.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As a possible entrant to the Indian market , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> should be very <b>wary</b> of Alibaba . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The Chinese company defeated <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in terms of market share on its home turf ( for the time being ) . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Also , unlike Snapdeal and Flipkart , Alibaba has very deep pockets and need not <b>worry</b> about raising capital or turning a profit anytime soon .  (Uncertainty) </span>However , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's headstart and success should reduce the effects of Alibaba 's actions . Overall , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is striking at a time when the dominant players in the space are at their weakest . Frontrunners Flipkart and Snapdeal are running low on cash , losing top level management , and responding poorly to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's entrance to the market . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has steadily been stealing market share from the two just mentioned . It was reported this year that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> saw its market share ( in terms of shipments ) rise to over 21 percent from 14 percent , making it the only major player to increase its share from a year ago . Rival Flipkart slipped from 43 percent in March 2015 to 37 percent in March 2016 and Snapdeal slipped from 19 percent to 14-15 percent.Bezos has been quoted as saying , `` Our Amazon.in team is surpassing even our most ambitious milestones ' . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Bezos cites further evidence of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's success , using ComScore to say <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was leading with <i>more</i> than 30 million monthly unique visitors to its site as of October 2015 . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Flipkart was lagging behind at 27 million while Snapdeal was at 20 million.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>All the conditions look favorable for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , and I <b>believe</b> the veteran company will emerge as the dominant player in India . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Once this and consolidation in the industry occurs , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can expect to reap the benefits from one of the largest markets in the world . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is a fantastic strategic move and will stand to benefit <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> for years , <b>possibly</b> decades , to come . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Bezos believes there is much <i>more</i> in store for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> India , saying , `` I can assure you it 's only the beginning and as we say in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , it 's only day one , '' I encourage you to follow me as I cover a wide <b>variety</b> of current topics , with a special interest in the technology and entertainment industries .
