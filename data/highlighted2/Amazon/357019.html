(Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Most of the estimates that I have seen <b>suggest</b> that the rest of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is poised to achieve <i>more</i> than $ 115 billion in total revenues . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I think that has simply got to be worth <i>more</i> than $ 79 billion-probably several times <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Without qualification and using what the writer <b>believes</b> to be conservative estimates based on the analysis of the vast preponderance of industry analysts , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> shares are quite undervalued . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If ail the assumptions regarding AWS growth bear out , it <b>seems</b> quite likely to me that investor sentiment will turn positive again on this name .  (Uncertainty) </span>I have tried to present an analysis for the prospects of AWS in some level of detail.As a business, AWS is unprecedented.There has never been a growth ramp at scale that even approaches what is happening at this business.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And the ramp is predicated on just a few <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> undeniable facts .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The AWS solution is far <i>cheaper</i> than alternatives , it is <i>more</i> reliable and there is significantly <i>less</i> hassle for enterprises in outsourcing as much IT infrastructure as they can .  (Surprise) </span>There are very few enterprises that really want to run data centers - it is no one's core competency outside of the companies already in the IaaS market.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Again , the market share that AWS has achieved gives it the funding to keep pushing down costs through scale and to add <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> features and value added components to its business .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I think that is <i>more</i> <b>probable</b> that AWS will actually increase its market share from the current 27 % level over time rather than the other way around .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>But the numbers get so large as to be totally off-putting.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In trying to estimate future revenues and EBITDA margins , I chose <b>assumptions</b> that are clearly <i>less</i> than rather than <i>greater</i> than either current trends or any kind of qualitative analysis .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>And the product is still $200 billion.There are many, I know, who fault this management for not paying enough attention to margins or returning capital to shareholders.There are others who delight in finding blemishes on the body of this behemoth.I really don't blame people for looking carefully at what this company is doing.It is fun and intellectually gratifying to discover chinks in the armor of icons.But AWS is a very large company.It obviously is going to be doing something poorly or sub-optimally.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But what those things might be in AWS is not readily <b>apparent</b> to me at this writing .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Many years ago I lived in Oklahoma and <b>occasionally</b> in the spring I would go out on a hill near my home and watch a tornado settle on the plain below .  (Uncertainty) </span>It was really an awesome sight but scary at the same time.The sound is like nothing anyone can imagine and the sky is lit up by lightning flashes that reflect from the undersides of the clouds.Of course, some tornadoes disrupt the communities through witch they pass.Watching the sight, awesome as it can be, is simply an acknowledgement of God's unknowable ways.To my mind, AWS is like that.It is making loads of noise, it presents an awesome spectacle and it is ripping up the competition as it goes.The closes thing to - a force of nature you will ever see in the IT world.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Editors' Picks</div></body></html>
