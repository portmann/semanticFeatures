( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will refresh its Kindle e-book reader this week . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) <b>seems</b> to go from strength-to-strength in most of its business , the last year has seen a crisis develop in the area where it first started - books . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The Kindle e-book reader is now <b>nearly</b> 10 years old , having been introduced way back in 2007 , and the developing world 's e-book markets are pretty well saturated .  (Uncertainty) </span>Trefis estimates they peaked back in 2011, at 13.44 million, and then declined to under 10 million the next year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sales were said to have `` collapsed '' last year , and some retailers <b>seems</b> gleeful to take it off their shelves in favor of actual books .  (Uncertainty) </span>A multi-year fight over e-book pricing with major publishers did not help.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The settlement <b>seems</b> to have been poorly received by book buyers since new e-books came to be priced close to what physical books cost .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Consumers , it <b>seems</b> , resist e-books ( which they really only license ) as the price gets to about $ 10 , because they know the conditions and figure they should get a <i>bigger</i> break buying electronic files .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Not all the news is bad.Sales are strong in India and China .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The total e-book market is expected to top $ 13 billion in 2020 and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is bound to get a big share of that although , since 2015 sales were $ 108 billion , some <b>may</b> ask whether it matters . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Still, a refresh was needed, and will be announced this week.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A leak of the product shows what <b>may</b> be a removable battery , with a battery lasting several days .

(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The new Kindle is due to read <i>more</i> like a paperback , in one hand , and weigh-in at a little over 4 ounces .  (Surprise) </span>Pricing is expected to come in at around $150, including the case.Current models cost under $80.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The question is whether this will really jump start sales and if so what that <b>might</b> mean for investors .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The answers are <b>maybe</b> , and not much .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As previously noted , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is now a lot <i>more</i> than a bookseller . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Even if it can get sales back to that 2011 revenue you're still talking about just $1.5 billion in revenue.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is very , very good at monetizing content , and it dominates that e-book market , but you 're still , in the end , talking about <i>less</i> than $ 10 billion on a company trying to grow 20 % this year off a $ 108 billion base . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The whole e-book market , which <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> created and nurtured , is thus of <i>greater</i> interest to writers and publishers than it is to investors . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>may</b> well be true that publishers got greedy with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> on pricing and that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was right on that issue . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>may</b> well be that Version 8 of the Kindle will be a big hit .  (Uncertainty) </span>But even if this is all true , it wo n't really move the needle on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's top or bottom line . The revolution is over and the market is mature.For <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to move that needle investors will need to see skyrocketing sales in India , strong growth in the cloud and continuing growth in merchants using its fulfillment infrastructure . It can get all that , but the Kindle will henceforth be a sideshow to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's investment thesis .
