comes with high expectations obviously but the business case is sound for investing in Netflix Strong growth overseas as well as solid additions even in their nearsaturated home markets show that theres still room to grow albeit slower Almost exactly two months ago today I wrote an article about Netflixs international fix and how they had to surmount several issues before being able to transform the brand into a household name overseas the way theyve successfully done in mature markets After the recent quarterly report the stock got punished and short Netflix NASDAQ NFLX articles have been pouring in like rain in Seattle or so they say Weve all seen this pendulumlike oscillation between greed and fear before and it seems like Netflixs pendulum will stay on the fear side for a while There are several things I would like Netflixs current and prospective investors to think about before they decide to buy or sell the stock I do think Netflix as a stock will remain volatile for several years to come but I see that as a good thing The biggest source of issue with the recent quarterly report is current subscriber growth and tepid guidance for the rest of the year Shorts are having a field day after Netflixs management sought to revise the sentiment downwards for the company In a recent article written by fellow author Shock Exchange he stated that subscriber growth was disappointing while the company actually added million to their user base The problem as he correctly stated was that it disappointed Wall Street analysts Just in case youre unaware they are an elite corps of intellectuals who are extremely good at predicting that things that are already going higher will go even higher and things that are going lower will go even lower Netflix grew its subscriber base by million over last quarter international and domestic subscribers increased by million and million respectively Analysts were expecting million net adds in the US and internationally The rub was that the company gave weak guidance In Q Netflix expects to grow subs by in the US and million internationally Analysts were expecting domestically and million internationally Its true that relatively slow subscriber growth was the cause of panic but more than anything else I believe the real shocker was the guidance The million net addition is the slowest they have seen in the last few years The US market though I dont believe its saturated is going to be a slow growth one and considering the competition theyre going to see from YouTube its bound to move at a steady pace rather than a fast pace International markets as I detailed in my previous article is where the real growth in user base is going to come from The aggressive expansion into multiple countries in the last few years has helped the company gain significant numbers at a rapid pace But the problem as I noted earlier was where is the localized content to keep the train chugging along They are depending on the Englishlanguage content they have built for US customers and using that as a lure for the Englishspeaking population around the world Now they need to start building localized content in order to deeper penetrate markets theyve recently entered into My second point is that their business model is built on something so strongly viable that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Prime Video YouTube NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Red and every other paid streaming video company in the world do not need to reinvent the wheel This a business that was born of the creativity of Netflix and they have shown remarkable flexibility in changing directions as required by prevailing conditions In that sense Netflix literally blazed a path for other companies to follow With video consumption on the rise along with mobile usage paid streaming is here to stay And as long as that continues to be the case Netflix will stay close to the top of their industry segment Netflix and possibly YouTube Red are probably the only two companies in the world that have the ability and reach to bring a truly global user base to their respective ecosystems But whether its a behemoth like Google or an industry leader like Netflix that kind of width and depth is not something that can be built in a matter of a few quarters It needs a fivetotenyear time frame for that to be done effectively and thoroughly Investorspeak Fingers at the Ready The problem for Netflix is their valuation but what can you expect from a hypergrowth stock Earlier I suggested to my readers to keep their trigger fingers close to the buy button and wait for a subscription growth shocker instead of an earnings shocker to buy the stock and thats exactly what has happened now One important point here is that the companys valuation seems to go up and down based on the number of subscribers added every quarter If you want to buy into this great idea then the best time to do that is to not only wait for a earnings shocker but for a subscriptionaddition shocker similar to the one that happened in October Netflix has revised its estimates for Q since then but another shocker may just happen to shake the share price enough for you to get a foot in or add to your position So thats what I recommend you do now in my humble opinion I sincerely hope that the market is now ready to adjust the hypergrowth label to a more stable strong growth one so Netflix can continue its disruptions around the world My apologies for referring back to my older article so many times but when I keep reading article after article that subtly and sometimes bluntly suggests that Netflix is going to vanish as a business I just cant help it Now is the time to buy and lets hope for even more subscription shockers in the next few quarters so that you can add them for cheap I believe the business case for Netflix is strong and for any hypergrowth stock dollarcost averaging or building up into a position over a two to three year time period is the best way to go about it Please follow me if you like my work Theres lots more where that came from Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Services Music Video Stores </div></body></html>
