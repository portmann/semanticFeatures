This a business that was born of the creativity of Netflix, and they have shown remarkable flexibility in changing directions as required by prevailing conditions.In that sense, Netflix literally blazed a path for other companies to follow.With video consumption on the rise along with mobile usage, paid streaming is here to stay.And as long as that continues to be the case, Netflix will stay close to the top of their industry segment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix - and , possibly YouTube Red - are <b>probably</b> the only two companies in the world that have the ability and reach to bring a truly global user base to their respective ecosystems .  (Uncertainty) </span>But whether it's a behemoth like Google or an industry leader like Netflix, that kind of width and depth is not something that can be built in a matter of a few quarters.It needs a five-to-ten-year time frame for that to be done effectively and thoroughly.Investor-speak: Fingers at the Ready The problem for Netflix is their valuation, but what can you expect from a hyper-growth stock?<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>Earlier</i> , I <b>suggested</b> to my readers to keep their trigger fingers close to the buy button and wait for a subscription growth shocker instead of an earnings shocker to buy the stock - and that 's exactly what has happened now .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One important point here is that the company 's valuation <b>seems</b> to go up and down based on the number of subscribers added every quarter .  (Uncertainty) </span>If you want to buy into this great idea, then the best time to do that is to not only wait for a earnings shocker, but for a subscription-addition shocker similar to the one that happened in October 2015 .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix has revised its estimates for Q1 2016 since then , but another shocker <b>may</b> just happen to shake the share price enough for you to get a foot in or add to your position .  (Uncertainty) </span>So that's what I recommend you do now, in my humble opinion.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I sincerely <b>hope</b> that the market is now ready to adjust the `` hyper-growth '' label to a <i>more</i> stable `` strong growth '' one so Netflix can continue its disruptions around the world .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>My apologies for referring back to my <i>older</i> article so many times , but when I keep reading article after article that subtly ( and sometimes , bluntly ) <b>suggests</b> that Netflix is going to vanish as a business , I just ca n't help it .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Now is the time to buy , and let 's <b>hope</b> for even <i>more</i> `` subscription shockers '' in the next few quarters so that you can add them for cheap .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> the business case for Netflix is strong ; and for any hyper-growth stock , dollar-cost averaging or building up into a position over a two to three year time period is the best way to go about it .
