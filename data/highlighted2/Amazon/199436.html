Review just published its annual ranking of Best Performing CEOs in the World The noteworthy part picked up by the Financial Times is that last years numero uno Amazons Jeff Bezos fell from his perch to number based on Amazons poor social responsibility marks The new best CEO is Lars Rebien Sorensen of Novo Nordisk a biotech player best known for a diabetes drug The Harvard Business Review deserves credit for this small but important symbolic step to redefine corporate success away from purely financial considerations and to include broader societal impact As the story stated How did this mildmannered bespectacled executive land in the spot on our list Its partly due to his companys darkly fortuitous decision years ago to focus almost exclusively on diabetes treatment The runaway global growth of the disease has driven up the companys sales and stock price But his standing also reflects Novo Nordisks deep engagement with social and environmental issues which now factor in to our calculations Corporate social responsibility is nothing but maximizing the value of your company over a long period says Srensen who has been with the company for years In the long term social and environmental issues become financial issues Having said that the Harvard Business Review is only taking small steps in pressing for broader notions of performance and accountability The financial metrics count for of the total score and the social responsibility measures a mere But this is still a longoverdue move in a better direction Perhaps as important the Harvard Business Review methodology unwittingly allows the public to see which CEO is the most predatory by looking at the divergence between its financial standing versus its score on environmental social and governance ESG performance Now admittedly this is not identical to a measurement of impact on the community broadly defined For instance governance issues tend to be of more concern to shareholders than other stakeholders but it is true that the companies with the most insulated imperial CEOs have a tendency to play fast and loose as far as the law and regulations are concerned one example is Jamie Dimon who is still both chairman CEO and president of JP Morgan and managed to get away with appallingly lax internal controls and misrepresentations to shareholders and regulators and has also been widely reported to bully central bankers like Mark Carney and Ben Bernanke This image from the Financial Times article nicely sums up the case for Bezos as top predator And mind you this is even worse than

courteously made available so outsiders can see how they came up with their ratings Sadly but not surprisingly there are companies with large gaps between their financial performance scores and their ESG ratings After all this is feature not a bug of modern capitalism Salesforce which is second only to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in financial marks is in the ESG tally

Monsanto scores th in financial results and on ESG putting it well ahead of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Readers may also understandably wonder about how to devise an annual environmental social and governance performance rating when serious damage takes decades to inflict while financial performance is an annual affair The ESG rating is also black box From the HBR article To measure CEOs performance on nonfinancial issues HBR consulted with Sustainalytics a leading provider of environmental social and governance research and analytics Sustainalytics which works primarily with financial institutions and asset managers rates firms ESG performance on a scale from to Using the Sustainalytics data we ordered the CEOs from best to worst ESG scores to arrive at their ESG ranking For instance that Whole FoodsESG rating of no doubt due to its persistent cheating of customers its antiunion efforts and mayhap for being an upscale social responsibility poseur that pays workers less than a living wage Amazons rating of is closer to the bottom of the barrel But how do you score the damage done by say a Monsanto or by the wellfunded and effective climate denialism of an Exxon I spent some time thinking about how to come up with an annual Most Evil Company rating and realized it would be too hard to pick apart longterm versus shorterterm actions
