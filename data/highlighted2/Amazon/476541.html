( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Last January , when <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> traded at an 864 P/E ratio , it was Portfolio Armor 's top-ranked name . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>suggested</b> readers consider buying and hedging it .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Readers who did so were up <b>almost</b> 20 % over the next six months , net of hedging costs .  (Uncertainty) </span>On Thursday , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was again our site 's top-ranked name . We present an updated hedge for it.Although Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) has done a lousy job of monetizing its utility (as we've mentioned on occasion, e.g., Twitter Jumps The Shark ), it's great at capturing pithy market reactions from sharp observers.After shares of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) hit a new high last week following its earnings beat , LikeFolio founder Andy Swan offered the rejoinder above to value investors . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Readers <b>may</b> recall we were bullish on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> back in January ( Einhorn Shorted <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> - You Should n't ) , when we argued that although hedge fund manager David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital had shorted <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , investors should n't follow his lead . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the contrary , we suggested investors consider buying <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , which was the top-ranked name on the Portfolio Armor website at the time , provided they hedged to limit their downside <b>risk</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Greenlight 's most recent shareholder letter , reprinted at ValueWalk , does n't give a short thesis for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ; it just notes that it and Netflix were `` powerful momentum plays '' . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Presumably</b> though , as a value investor , Einhorn is offended by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's high valuation . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>And indeed, according to the valuation metrics below (data via Fidelity), the stock does look pricey.P/E ( 5 year avg ) <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> : 486 ; Industry Average : 337 . Price/Sales <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> : 2.8 ; Industry Average : 3.5 . These numbers all look high, and, except for Price/Sales, they are all well above the Internet retail industry average, which look high to begin with.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The metric a bearish value investor <b>might</b> focus on most here is the PEG ratio , since it takes growth into account , and even an investor as growth-oriented as Jim Cramer prefers stocks with PEG ratios below 2 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The main reason we 're bullish on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is that it 's currently Portfolio Armor 's highest-ranked name when ranked by potential return ( and has been one of its highest-ranked names since August ; as you can see here , it <b>appeared</b> in a hedged portfolio created on August 11th ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Potential return, in our terminology, is a bullish estimate of how a security will perform over the next six months.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In a follow up article , after <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> reported <b>disappointing</b> 4Q 2015 earnings ( Advantage Einhorn ? ) (Amazon: Surprise) </span>we discussed courses of action for hedged <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> shareholders . We concluded that they were likely best off staying the course: In our view, and in light of Portfolio Armor's updated potential return on AMZN (16%, down from 30% pre-Q4 earnings), staying the course would seem to make the most sense now.Since the hedge doesn't expire until July, you can hold the position through the next earnings release.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given that the cap on the collar is far above our updated potential return , it <b>probably</b> does n't make sense to buy-to-close the call leg now .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is also consistent with our research as part of our backtesting the hedged portfolio method .We found that, on average, the highest returns came from holding securities for six months, or until just before their hedges expired, whichever came first.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Essentially , this gave the underlying securities <i>more</i> time to recover from declines and generate <i>better</i> performance .  (Surprise) </span>If you had bought <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and hedged it when we wrote our article on January 22nd , and sold it just before your hedge expired in mid-July , you would have had a gain of 19.74 % , net of your hedging cost . As of Thursday 's close , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was again Portfolio Armor 's top-ranked name by potential return net of hedging cost ( Priceline ( NASDAQ : PCLN ) , the subject of our previous artice , was # 8 on the site 's ranking ) , with a potential return of 34 % over the next several months ( historically , actual returns have averaged 0.3 x the site 's potential return estimates , taking into account securities that ended up having negative returns ) . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>For investors who are long <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and want to limit their downside risk while having a chance of capturing that potential return , here is the optimal collar to hedge 200 shares of it against a greater-than-19 % decline as of Thursday 's close , while not capping your <b>possible</b> upside at <i>less</i> than 34 % by then ( screen captures via the Portfolio Armor iOS app ) : As you can see above , the cost of the put leg here was $ 4,620 , or 3.04 % of position value . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>But as you can see below, selling the call leg would have generated income of $870, or 0.57% of position value.So the net cost of the hedge would have been 2.46%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A few notes on this : The cost of the <b>optimal</b> collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In practice , an investor can often buy puts for <i>less</i> and sell calls for <i>more</i> ( again , at some price between the bid and the ask ) , so in reality , an investor would likely have paid <i>less</i> than $ 3,750 when opening this collar .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If you were willing to risk a <i>larger</i> decline , you <b>could</b> have entered a <i>larger</i> number than 19 in the `` threshold field '' and lowered your hedging cost .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This hedge <b>may</b> provide <i>more</i> protection than promised if the underlying security declines in the near future due to time value .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , if the underlying security spikes in the near future , time value can have the opposite effect , making it costly to exit the position early ( for an example of this , see this article on hedging Facebook - Facebook Rewards <b>Cautious</b> Investors <i>Less</i> ) .
