Armors topranked name We suggested readers consider buying and hedging it Readers who did so were up almost over the next six months net of hedging costs On Thursday <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was again our sites topranked name We present an updated hedge for it Although Twitter NYSE TWTR has done a lousy job of monetizing its utility as weve mentioned on occasion eg Twitter Jumps The Shark its great at capturing pithy market reactions from sharp observers After shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN hit a new high last week following its earnings beat LikeFolio founder Andy Swan offered the rejoinder above to value investors Readers may recall we were bullish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>back in January Einhorn Shorted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>You Shouldnt when we argued that although hedge fund manager David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital had shorted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>investors shouldnt follow his lead On the contrary we suggested investors consider buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>which was the topranked name on the Portfolio Armor website at the time provided they hedged to limit their downside risk Greenlights most recent shareholder letter reprinted at ValueWalk doesnt give a short thesis for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>it just notes that it and Netflix were powerful momentum plays Presumably though as a value investor Einhorn is offended by Amazons high valuation And indeed according to the valuation metrics below data via Fidelity the stock does look pricey PE year avg <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Industry Average PriceSales <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Industry Average These numbers all look high and except for PriceSales they are all well above the Internet retail industry average which look high to begin with The metric a bearish value investor might focus on most here is the PEG ratio since it takes growth into account and even an investor as growthoriented as Jim Cramer prefers stocks with PEG ratios below The main reason were bullish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is that its currently Portfolio Armors highestranked name when ranked by potential return and has been one of its highestranked names since August as you can see here it appeared in a hedged portfolio created on August th Potential return in our terminology is a bullish estimate of how a security will perform over the next six months In a follow up article after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>reported disappointing Q earnings Advantage Einhorn we discussed courses of action for hedged <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shareholders We concluded that they were likely best off staying the course In our view and in light of Portfolio Armors updated potential return on AMZN down from preQ earnings staying the course would seem to make the most sense now Since the hedge doesnt expire until July you can hold the position through the next earnings release Given that the cap on the collar is far above our updated potential return it probably doesnt make sense to buytoclose the call leg now This is also consistent with our research as part of our backtesting the hedged portfolio method We found that on average the highest returns came from holding securities for six months or until just before their hedges expired whichever came first Essentially this gave the underlying securities more time to recover from declines and generate better performance If you had bought <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and hedged it when we wrote our article on January nd and sold it just before your hedge expired in midJuly you would have had a gain of net of your hedging cost As of Thursdays close <span

sites ranking with a potential return of over the next several months historically actual returns have averaged x the sites potential return estimates taking into account securities that ended up having negative returns For investors who are long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and want to limit their downside risk while having a chance of capturing that potential return here is the optimal collar to hedge shares of it against a greaterthan decline as of Thursdays close while not capping your possible upside at less than by then screen captures via the Portfolio Armor iOS app As you can see above the cost of the put leg here was or of position value But as you can see below selling the call leg would have generated income of or of position value So the net cost of the hedge would have been A few notes on this The cost of the optimal collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls In practice an investor can often buy puts for less and sell calls for more again at some price between the bid and the ask so in reality an investor would likely have paid less than when opening this collar If you were willing to risk a larger decline you could have entered a larger number than in the threshold field and lowered your hedging cost This hedge may provide more protection than promised if the underlying security declines in the near future due to time value However if the underlying security spikes in the near future time value can have the opposite effect making it costly to exit the position early for an example of
