(Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>But as you can see below, selling the call leg would have generated income of $870, or 0.57% of position value.So the net cost of the hedge would have been 2.46%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A few notes on this : The cost of the <b>optimal</b> collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In practice , an investor can often buy puts for <i>less</i> and sell calls for <i>more</i> ( again , at some price between the bid and the ask ) , so in reality , an investor would likely have paid <i>less</i> than $ 3,750 when opening this collar .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If you were willing to risk a <i>larger</i> decline , you <b>could</b> have entered a <i>larger</i> number than 19 in the `` threshold field '' and lowered your hedging cost .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This hedge <b>may</b> provide <i>more</i> protection than promised if the underlying security declines in the near future due to time value .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , if the underlying security spikes in the near future , time value can have the opposite effect , making it costly to exit the position early ( for an example of this , see this article on hedging Facebook - Facebook Rewards <b>Cautious</b> Investors <i>Less</i> ) .
