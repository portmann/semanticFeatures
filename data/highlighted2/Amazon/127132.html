shares surged more than percent on Thursday as the online retailer posted an unexpected quarterly profit pushing its market value above that of WalMart Stores Inc WMTN the worlds largest retailer Combined with a bullish forecast for the third quarter upbeat comments from company executives on Amazons Prime delivery service and rapid growth in its cloud computing service <span

in the fourth quarter has often faced worries by investors that its heavy spending on new ventures will not actually pay off My quick take is that management has a lot of discretion over spending and appears to understand that investors prefer profits to losses said Michael Pachter analyst at Wedbush Securities If they keep delivering profits the stock should work Amazons shares had languished for much of last year as the company failed to deliver sustainable profits The shares traded as low as last October virtually half of the price reached in afterhours trade on Thursday Prime which for a year also provides exclusive access to certain movies music and Kindle books is getting new subscribers at rates higher than weve ever seen Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told analysts on a conference call Membership was growing faster outside the United States than inside helped in part by a recent oneday sale event called Prime Day <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>said It declined to disclose membership figures Growth has been fueled in large part by Prime growth and also item selection growth so its been a huge driver both in North America and international segments Olsavsky said in a separate call for reporters For the second quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>reported a profit of million or cents per share compared with a loss of million or cents per share a year earlier Revenue rose percent to billion Analysts on average had expected a loss of cents per share on revenue of billion It looks like they beat across every major revenue line said Colin Sebastian analyst with Robert W Baird Co That along with the surprise profit beat is icing on the cake so to speak Sales in North America the companys

comment on rising competition from new online retailers like Jetcom which offers annual memberships at half the price of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and promises savings on million products Jet which has so far raised million from top venture capital firms will list its discounted prices next to Amazons lowest price for the same products Weve been in competition with some of the biggest names in retail Olsavsky said so were used to competition but were focused on the customer The company forecast net sales would grow percent to percent to a range
