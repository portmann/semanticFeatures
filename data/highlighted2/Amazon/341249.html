class='textDiv'>Why Apples EBook Appeal Went Down In Flames Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha The US Supreme Court has declined to review Apples appeal in the ebook antitrust case Apple will now have to live with the terms of the judges decision in the case The refusal of the US Supreme Court to hear Apples NASDAQ AAPL appeal in the ebooks antitrust case underscores how poorly served Apple has been by its legal team in this matter Apple will now be required to abide by the terms of Judge Denise Cotes judgment of and the settlement Apple reached with the states This outcome leaves many Apple fans fuming at what they perceive as an unfair or political decision In fact the appeal never stood a chance Its been more than two years since I wrote Apples Antitrust Reality Distortion Field My stance on the case was very unpopular with Apple fans so I left the subject alone until the appeals process reached a conclusion I expected Apple to lose because Apple was enmeshed in a reality distortion field that kept it from a realistic appreciation of its legal position in the case I think Apple did make a mistake in letting itself get tangled up in the book publishers price fixing conspiracy which was already well underway before Apple came on the scene in late looking for publishers to participate in iBooks for the soon to be launched iPad But the biggest mistake Apple made was in not settling with the DOJ when it had the chance All the Publisher Defendants did and they all got off with their hands slapped and not a Monitor for any of them Here Apples selfinflicted reality distortion field blinded it to its own best interest Apple managements handling of the antitrust case should ring alarm bells with Apple investors At the very least it conveys a lack of pragmatic appreciation and respect for the governments power in these matters for good or ill At each stage in the case the Reality Distortion Field has led to unrealistic expectations Im still seeing that same kind of distortion field mirrored in the many comments of fans in reaction to the news reported by Bloomberg via Yahoo <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN had a monopoly on ebooks prior to Apples entry into the market with iBooks introduced concomitantly with the first iPad in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was engaged in predatory pricing often pricing ebooks below cost The assertions about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>were brought up by Apple in its appeal as well as by numerous Apple sympathetic journalists This is where Apple and Apples fans and investors were poorly served by Apples legal counsel Apples attorneys had to have realized that as damning as Amazons conduct might appear to the general public it was legally irrelevant to Apples case Attempting to put <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>on trial was the legal equivalent of a Hail Mary pass On the surface it seems to many fans that Amazons conduct must surely leave it vulnerable to legal action by the government Arent there Federal regulations against monopoly and predatory pricing Not exactly The Sherman Antitrust Act SAA under which Apple was sued by the Federal government doesnt ban either of those things A business monopoly is not considered harmful in itself The government historically has a somewhat ambivalent attitude towards monopoly The government grants monopolies on products and inventions through the patent and trademark system Even during the trust busting era at the turn of the th century the government was reluctant to ban monopolies outright So the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>had a near monopoly on ebooks was not in itself a violation of SAA The Federal government under its Constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce has nevertheless generally not tried to tell businesses how to be successful or even mandate that a business be profitable For good reason since a lot of businesses arent profitable at any given time In keeping with this somewhat hands off approach the Federal government doesnt try to tell businesses what to charge for goods and services In cases where the government has tried to regulate prices it generally hasnt worked very well If a business wants to charge less than cost for a good or service thats perfectly legal So neither of the attributes of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>that Apple fans tend to point to as so damning have any legal merit The fact that Apples attorneys pointed to these attributes in its appeal dressed up a little more than Ive presented also lacked merit So What Did Apple Do That Was So Wrong The part of SAA that Apple ran afoul of was in the matter of price fixing SAA says that companies cannot enter into conspiracies to set the price of goods or services The point here is that SAA wants the free market to set the cost of goods and services A price fixing conspiracy is considered inherently harmful because it short circuits the normal pricing mechanism of the free market Apples codefendants in the case all large book publishers all acknowledged that they had engaged in a conspiracy to fix the price of ebooks and settled the governments lawsuit under SAA Apple alone claimed that it had done nothing wrong This is where the reality distortion field got completely out of control Im sure that even now Apples management doesnt feel they did anything wrong Once again this is really irrelevant The case was never about right or wrong It was about violating very specific Federal regulations regarding business practices The right or wrong of Apples actions is open to debate The fact that they violated SAA is not The Supreme Court has made that very clear The evidence presented by the Federal government that Apple knew about the publisher price fixing conspiracy and entered into it willingly was really overwhelming The fact that Apple may have felt that it was doing a service to consumers by breaking the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>monopoly doesnt really matter There are positives and negatives to the appeal outcome The positive is that it removes what has been a needless and protracted source of distraction for Apple management It will hopefully lead to a more pragmatic and less adversarial tone towards the government and the Monitor assigned by Judge Cote to oversee antitrust compliance The main negative is that this case always had the potential to expand beyond ebooks and now that the governments case has been vindicated by the Supreme Court it still does Early in the case Apple blundered by allowing Eddy Cue who was instrumental in the ebook arrangements with the publishers to offer a business as usual defense If Apples handling of the ebooks matter really was business as usual then Apple could reasonably be suspected of having a much larger problem The upshot is that Apples arrangements with iTunes content providers will probably come under renewed scrutiny Investors can expect that Apple will be much more cooperative with the Federal government and take whatever corrective action is required There are times when Apple should push back on the government as in the FBI request to create an iPhone back door under the All Writs Act This really is about fundamental human rights The ebook price fixing case never was From now on investors can expect Apple to take regulatory matters such as SAA in stride Its practically a rite of passage for large American corporations nothing more I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking
