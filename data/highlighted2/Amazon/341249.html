(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to review Apple's appeal in the e-book antitrust case.Apple will now have to live with the terms of the judge's decision in the case.The refusal of the U.S. Supreme Court to hear Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) appeal in the e-books antitrust case underscores how poorly served Apple has been by its legal team in this matter.Apple will now be required to abide by the terms of Judge Denise Cote's judgment of 2013 and the settlement Apple reached with the states.This outcome leaves many Apple fans fuming at what they perceive as an unfair or political decision.In fact, the appeal never stood a chance.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's been <i>more</i> than two years , since I wrote Apple 's Antitrust Reality Distortion Field .  (Surprise) </span>My stance on the case was very unpopular with Apple fans, so I left the subject alone until the appeals process reached a conclusion.I expected Apple to lose, because Apple was enmeshed in a reality distortion field that kept it from a realistic appreciation of its legal position in the case.I think Apple did make a mistake in letting itself get tangled up in the book publishers' price fixing conspiracy, which was already well underway before Apple came on the scene in late 2009, looking for publishers to participate in iBooks for the soon to be launched iPad.But the biggest mistake Apple made was in not settling with the DOJ when it had the chance.All the Publisher Defendants did, and they all got off with their hands slapped and not a Monitor for any of them.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Here , Apple 's self-inflicted reality distortion field blinded it to its own best interest ... Apple management 's handling of the antitrust case should ring <b>alarm</b> bells with Apple investors .  (Uncertainty) </span>At the very least, it conveys a lack of pragmatic appreciation and respect for the government's power in these matters (for good or ill).At each stage in the case, the Reality Distortion Field has led to unrealistic expectations.I'm still seeing that same kind of distortion field mirrored in the many comments of fans in reaction to the news reported by Bloomberg (via Yahoo ).<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) had a monopoly on e-books prior to Apple 's entry into the market with iBooks , introduced concomitantly with the first iPad in 2010 . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was engaged in predatory pricing , often pricing e-books below cost . The assertions about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> were brought up by Apple in its appeal , as well as by numerous Apple sympathetic journalists . This is where Apple, and Apple's fans and investors were poorly served by Apple's legal counsel.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple 's attorneys had to have realized that as damning as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's conduct might <b>appear</b> to the general public , it was legally irrelevant to Apple 's case . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Attempting to put <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> on trial was the legal equivalent of a Hail Mary pass . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the surface , it <b>seems</b> to many fans that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's conduct must surely leave it vulnerable to legal action by the government . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Aren't there Federal regulations against monopoly and predatory pricing?Not exactly.The Sherman Antitrust Act (SAA), under which Apple was sued by the Federal government, doesn't ban either of those things.A business monopoly is not considered harmful in itself.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The government historically has a <b>somewhat</b> ambivalent attitude towards monopoly .  (Uncertainty) </span>The government grants monopolies on products and inventions through the patent and trademark system.Even during the "trust busting" era at the turn of the 19th century, the government was reluctant to ban monopolies outright.So the fact that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> had a near monopoly on e-books was not in itself a violation of SAA . The Federal government, under its Constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce, has nevertheless generally not tried to tell businesses how to be successful, or even mandate that a business be profitable.For good reason, since a lot of businesses aren't profitable at any given time.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In keeping with this <b>somewhat</b> hands off approach , the Federal government does n't try to tell businesses what to charge for goods and services .  (Uncertainty) </span>In cases where the government has tried to regulate prices, it generally hasn't worked very well.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If a business wants to charge <i>less</i> than cost for a good or service , that 's perfectly legal .  (Surprise) </span>So neither of the attributes of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> that Apple fans tend to point to as so damning have any legal merit . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The fact that Apple 's attorneys pointed to these attributes in its appeal , dressed up a little <i>more</i> than I 've presented , also lacked merit .  (Surprise) </span>So What Did Apple Do That Was So Wrong?The part of SAA that Apple ran afoul of was in the matter of price fixing.SAA says that companies cannot enter into conspiracies to set the price of goods or services.The point here is that SAA wants the free market to set the cost of goods and services.A price fixing conspiracy is considered inherently harmful because it short circuits the normal pricing mechanism of the free market.Apple's co-defendants in the case, all large book publishers, all acknowledged that they had engaged in a conspiracy to fix the price of e-books, and settled the government's lawsuit under SAA.Apple alone claimed that it had "done nothing wrong."This is where the reality distortion field got completely out of control.I'm sure that, even now, Apple's management doesn't feel they did anything wrong.Once again, this is really irrelevant.The case was never about right or wrong.It was about violating very specific Federal regulations regarding business practices.The right or wrong of Apple's actions is open to debate.The fact that they violated SAA is not.The Supreme Court has made that very clear.The evidence presented by the Federal government that Apple knew about the publisher price fixing conspiracy, and entered into it willingly was really overwhelming.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The fact that Apple <b>may</b> have felt that it was doing a service to consumers by breaking the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> monopoly does n't really matter . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>There are positives and negatives to the appeal outcome.The positive is that it removes what has been a needless and protracted source of distraction for Apple management.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It will <b>hopefully</b> lead to a <i>more</i> pragmatic and <i>less</i> adversarial tone towards the government and the Monitor assigned by Judge Cote to oversee antitrust compliance .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The main negative is that this case always had the potential to expand beyond e-books, and now that the government's case has been vindicated by the Supreme Court, it still does.Early in the case, Apple blundered by allowing Eddy Cue, who was instrumental in the e-book arrangements with the publishers, to offer a "business as usual" defense .<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If Apple 's handling of the e-books matter really was business as usual , then Apple <b>could</b> reasonably be suspected of having a much <i>larger</i> problem .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The upshot is that Apple 's arrangements with iTunes content providers will <b>probably</b> come under renewed scrutiny .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Investors can expect that Apple will be much <i>more</i> cooperative with the Federal government , and take whatever corrective action is required .  (Surprise) </span>There are times when Apple should push back on the government, as in the FBI request to create an iPhone "back door" under the All Writs Act .This really is about fundamental human rights.The e-book price fixing case never was.From now on, investors can expect Apple to take regulatory matters such as SAA in stride.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's practically a rite of passage for large American corporations , nothing <i>more</i> .
