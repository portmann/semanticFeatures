(Surprise) </span>So What Did Apple Do That Was So Wrong?The part of SAA that Apple ran afoul of was in the matter of price fixing.SAA says that companies cannot enter into conspiracies to set the price of goods or services.The point here is that SAA wants the free market to set the cost of goods and services.A price fixing conspiracy is considered inherently harmful because it short circuits the normal pricing mechanism of the free market.Apple's co-defendants in the case, all large book publishers, all acknowledged that they had engaged in a conspiracy to fix the price of e-books, and settled the government's lawsuit under SAA.Apple alone claimed that it had "done nothing wrong."This is where the reality distortion field got completely out of control.I'm sure that, even now, Apple's management doesn't feel they did anything wrong.Once again, this is really irrelevant.The case was never about right or wrong.It was about violating very specific Federal regulations regarding business practices.The right or wrong of Apple's actions is open to debate.The fact that they violated SAA is not.The Supreme Court has made that very clear.The evidence presented by the Federal government that Apple knew about the publisher price fixing conspiracy, and entered into it willingly was really overwhelming.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The fact that Apple <b>may</b> have felt that it was doing a service to consumers by breaking the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> monopoly does n't really matter . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>There are positives and negatives to the appeal outcome.The positive is that it removes what has been a needless and protracted source of distraction for Apple management.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It will <b>hopefully</b> lead to a <i>more</i> pragmatic and <i>less</i> adversarial tone towards the government and the Monitor assigned by Judge Cote to oversee antitrust compliance .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The main negative is that this case always had the potential to expand beyond e-books, and now that the government's case has been vindicated by the Supreme Court, it still does.Early in the case, Apple blundered by allowing Eddy Cue, who was instrumental in the e-book arrangements with the publishers, to offer a "business as usual" defense .<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If Apple 's handling of the e-books matter really was business as usual , then Apple <b>could</b> reasonably be suspected of having a much <i>larger</i> problem .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The upshot is that Apple 's arrangements with iTunes content providers will <b>probably</b> come under renewed scrutiny .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Investors can expect that Apple will be much <i>more</i> cooperative with the Federal government , and take whatever corrective action is required .  (Surprise) </span>There are times when Apple should push back on the government, as in the FBI request to create an iPhone "back door" under the All Writs Act .This really is about fundamental human rights.The e-book price fixing case never was.From now on, investors can expect Apple to take regulatory matters such as SAA in stride.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's practically a rite of passage for large American corporations , nothing <i>more</i> .
