The retail business is highly competitive and you can do everything right and still not make money.Below is one of Warren Buffett's rants on his experience: Shortly after purchasing Berkshire, I acquired a Baltimore department store, Hochschild Kohn, buying through a company called Diversified Retailing that later merged with Berkshire.I bought at a substantial discount from book value, the people were first-class, and the deal included some extras - unrecorded real estate values and a significant LIFO inventory cushion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>How <b>could</b> I miss ?  (Uncertainty) </span>So-o-o - three years later I was lucky to sell the business for about what I had paid.After ending our corporate marriage to Hochschild Kohn, I had memories like those of the husband in the country song, "My Wife Ran Away With My Best Friend and I Still Miss Him a Lot."Additionally, being the largest in retail does not guarantee you the top spot forever.Just ask Sears Roebuck & Co. who lost the largest U.S. retailer title in 1989 to guess who, Wal-Mart!Despite the slippery slope in retail, it is interesting to note that Wal-Mart is still the 9th largest position in Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio valued at over $3.4 billion as of September 30, 2015 according to the latest 13-F filings.Wal-Mart has many positive catalysts.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Currently , Wal-Mart 's gross margins are about 500 basis points <i>lower</i> than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , Wal-Mart is able to overcome this negative <b>variance</b> with its sheer size and scale that allows it to produce $ 17 billion in operating income compared to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's $ 2 billion or about 8.5 x. Wal-Mart 's President and CEO Doug McMillon asserts , `` We are uniquely positioned to win with the future of retail . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>We will be the first to deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale."He outlines his plan as follows: We will continue to win on value.We've won on value in the past and that won't change.Win on convenience.Convenience is increasingly important as customers want to save both money and time.We will always work to be great merchants whether in stores or online.We're focused on the key geographies for customer growth which are North America and China.We want to appeal to a blend of income levels the way we're approaching e-commerce, neighborhood markets, Sam's Club, grocery pickup and other areas we'll appeal to value conscious customers of all demographics.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Finally , Wal-Mart will be utilizing its $ 20 billion repurchase authorization over a two-year period ( <b>hopefully</b> at current prices or <i>lower</i> ) to create value for all shareholders .
