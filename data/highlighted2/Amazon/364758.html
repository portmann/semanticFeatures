( NASDAQ : NFLX ) | Seeking Alpha Next week Netflix will raise its monthly price for those subscribers that had been grandfathered into a <i>lower</i> price point .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The new price will be $ 2 <i>higher</i> and analysts expect it to impact 37 % of its domestic customer base .  (Surprise) </span>While a survey by UBS showed 41% of respondents said they’d leave the service if the price rose, the likely “churn�?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>may</b> be as low as 3 % to 4 % .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix has justified the move by citing the increased value and abundance of its original content on which it spends a large sum.Next week Netflix's (NASDAQ: NFLX ) pricing model is set to change.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It has become a big deal this week because many outlets are coming to the realization consumers have <b>probably</b> forgotten this was happening .  (Uncertainty) </span>And it's understandable as Netflix broke the news two years ago, but decided to ease its grandfathered customers into the transition.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Now that it 's here though it does beg the question , will it impact Netflix 's subscriber base and <i>more</i> importantly should it ?  (Surprise) </span>To recap, the jump for the "standard" plan, will go up to $2 to $9.99 a month.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Analysts have presumed this will impact 37 % of US customers , <b>roughly</b> 17 million people .  (Uncertainty) </span>In a survey conducted by UBS it was revealed that 41% of those respondents said that would be enough for them to cancel their service.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>First , to state the obvious , most people have <b>probably</b> forgotten what they pay for Netflix and only remember when their credit card expires and the auto-payment option needs to be updated .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I also have a hard time <b>believing</b> people would pull their account over a $ 2 a month increase .  (Uncertainty) </span>Likely a lot of this is bluster from people ticked off over the cable companies doing this every time they feel like it and turning that rage towards Netflix.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Many of them are all bark and no bite as that same UBS survey projects in actuality that drop <b>could</b> be as low as 3 % or 4 % .  (Uncertainty) </span>The difference here is that Netflix isn't your cable company and for those hardcore cord-cutter subscribers they'd rather make a deal with the devil and Frank Underwood than go back to the traditional way.Now I understand the media's fascination here, as when the company previously raised rates in 2011, 800,000 subscribers walked away.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix recognized it <b>may</b> have handled the situation wrong and that 's why it did a gradual step-up this time around .  (Uncertainty) </span>Here's the thing though, 2011 was a radically different time than 2016.House of Cards didn't even debut until 2013.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So yes , if Netflix raised my rate in 2011 when its biggest hits were acquired content , I <b>probably</b> would have dropped it as well .  (Uncertainty) </span>Now we have Cards, we have Orange Is The New Black, we have the Marvel TV universe and we even have new original movies … on top of tons of other content.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is worth mentioning though that yes it is true there is also <i>more</i> competition now .  (Surprise) </span>HBO (NYSE: TWX ), Showtime and just this week Starz (NASDAQ: STRZA ) (NASDAQ: STRZB ) have all gotten into the streaming game at various prices.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Of the three only Starz is <i>cheaper</i> , and that 's just by a $ 1 .  (Surprise) </span>But if you compare the content between those two alone then it is really not even a question.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The ironic part with Starz is that the reason for the service is part of its new emphasis on building up its original content , which is even <i>more</i> important now that its first-run deal with Disney ( NYSE : DIS ) for its films is expiring .  (Surprise) </span>Want to guess who Disney's new partner in that area is?Yep, Netflix.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Please keep in mind the point of this piece is n't to praise Netflix as the end-all option ( I know it <b>may</b> seem that way ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For me it 's <i>more</i> because I 'm seeing a ton of stories out there that look like they are being written just to rabble-rouse .  (Surprise) </span>Shareholders should be aware of the full story.This is something to take note of, but not something I think should cause a large-scale difference.I don't expect a sizable number of Netflix subscribers to jump ship because of this and if the $2 is really that important, the option is still there to jump down to the basic model.The only difference there is it's a standard definition feed and you only have the ability to watch on one screen versus two at the same time.Netflix has also already braced investors it does expect a small "churn" in customers, but reminds shareholders of its overall value.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The service plans to have 600 hours of original content this year , which is 150 hours <i>more</i> than 2015 .  (Surprise) </span>The Huffington Post breaks it down further, but the main takeaway here relates back to the argument of whether Netflix's "mass buying" strategy is financially valuable.This whole discussion should give you a reason of why in the company's eyes, it is.Netflix and even <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , Hulu and the other OTT/streaming services are only as good as its content and when that content has gotten this type of acclaim the value goes up and eventually that means the prices to access it does as well .
