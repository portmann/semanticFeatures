into a lower price point The new price will be higher and analysts expect it to impact of its domestic customer base While a survey by UBS showed of respondents said theyd leave the service if the price rose the likely churn may be as low as to Netflix has justified the move by citing the increased value and abundance of its original content on which it spends a large sum Next week Netflixs NASDAQ NFLX pricing model is set to change It has become a big deal this week because many outlets are coming to the realization consumers have probably forgotten this was happening And its understandable as Netflix broke the news two years ago but decided to ease its grandfathered customers into the transition Now that its here though it does beg the question will it impact Netflixs subscriber base and more importantly should it To recap the jump for the standard plan will go up to to a month Analysts have presumed this will impact of US customers roughly million people In a survey conducted by UBS it was revealed that of those respondents said that would be enough for them to cancel their service First to state the obvious most people have probably forgotten what they pay for Netflix and only remember when their credit card expires and the autopayment option needs to be updated I also have a hard time believing people would pull their account over a a month increase Likely a lot of this is bluster from people ticked off over the cable companies doing this every time they feel like it and turning that rage towards Netflix Many of them are all bark and no bite as that same UBS survey projects in actuality that drop could be as low as or The difference here is that Netflix isnt your cable company and for those hardcore cordcutter subscribers theyd rather make a deal with the devil and Frank Underwood than go back to the traditional way Now I understand the medias fascination here as when the company previously raised rates in subscribers walked away Netflix recognized it may have handled the situation wrong and thats why it did a gradual stepup this time around Heres the thing though was a radically different time than House of Cards didnt even debut until So yes if Netflix raised my rate in when its biggest hits were acquired content I probably would have dropped it as well Now we have Cards we have Orange Is The New Black we have the Marvel TV universe and we even have new original movies on top of tons of other content It is worth mentioning though that yes it is true there is also more competition now HBO NYSE TWX Showtime and just this week Starz NASDAQ STRZA NASDAQ STRZB have all gotten into the streaming game at various prices Of the three only Starz is cheaper and thats just by a But if you compare the content between those two alone then it is really not even a question The ironic part with Starz is that the reason for the service is part of its new emphasis on building up its original content which is even more important now that its firstrun deal with Disney NYSE DIS for its films is expiring Want to guess who Disneys new partner in that area is Yep Netflix Please keep in mind the point of this piece isnt to praise Netflix as the endall option I know it may seem that way For me its more because Im seeing a ton of stories out there that look like they are being written just to rabblerouse Shareholders should be aware of the full story This is something to take note of but not something I think should cause a largescale difference I dont expect a sizable number of Netflix subscribers to jump ship because of this and if the is really that important the option is still there to jump down to the basic model The only difference there is its a standard definition feed and you only have the ability to watch on one screen versus two at the same time Netflix has also already braced investors it does expect a small churn in customers but reminds shareholders of its overall value The service plans to have hours of original content this year which is hours more than The Huffington Post breaks it down further but the main takeaway here relates back to the argument of whether Netflixs mass buying strategy is financially valuable This whole discussion should give you a reason of why in the companys eyes it is Netflix and even <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Hulu and the other OTTstreaming services are only as good as its content and when that content has gotten this type of acclaim the value goes up and eventually that means the prices to access it does
