(Uncertainty) </span>There is considerable competition for dollars in each layer.The nature of these types of systems is that once a software stack selection is made, it can be very expensive to change.The cloud model is advantageous to companies such as Oracle because they can capture all the dollars that go into the entire stack, not just one or two pieces.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It can be costly for an organization to migrate an application and its data to the cloud , but <i>more</i> importantly for Oracle , it 's becomes difficult to move away .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>You have a situation where Oracle can capture much <i>more</i> of the customer spend , and then make it much <i>more</i> difficult for their competition to obtain that spend in the future .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Having a captive customer base can help maintain margin and incentivize customers to improve synergies by moving <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> to the public Cloud service .  (Surprise) </span>The numbers are mixed and the challenges are many.While everyone agrees that public Cloud adoption is growing, it's not clear how much of the growth is real or window dressing by the public Cloud providers.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There are a number of advantages for <i>smaller</i> customers or new system builds , but we have yet to see how many customers are truly migrating their large workloads to the Cloud .  (Surprise) </span>What to watch out for when reviewing the numbers As most readers are likely aware, public Cloud revenue is based on a subscription model rather than an upfront large capital purchase followed by annually recurring percentage charges.Oracle and others have discussed these difference in their earnings calls and have explained why this has lead to temporary drops in traditional licensing revenue.The big issue comes in understanding what a particular company is booking as public Cloud revenue and what is booked as traditional on-premise revenue.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Companies such as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , IBM , Oracle and Microsoft would like to show investors as much public Cloud revenue as <b>possible</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Growing public Cloud revenue shows that the company is making the transition to the new realities of the market and signals to investors that they can participate in the expected growing public Cloud market.To avoid targeting any one of these companies and how they operate, I'll provide an example of the type of thing you need to watch out for using a fictional story.Imagine you are the salesperson for a company that sells music on CDs.Your customers demand and love the flexibility CDs provide - that they own them, can lend them and completely control how they are played.They loved owning their own CD player and the comfort and security that provides as music is a critical part of their life.Your boss tells you that you will only now get commission on sales of digital music that's delivered through the internet.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>You try for a while but have trouble convincing <i>more</i> than a few customers to buy the new option other than CDs .  (Surprise) </span>In the meantime, your competitor is making significant inroads selling digital music.You come to find out that instead of selling a CD for $10, your competitor is selling the digital copy for $10 and throwing in a free CD copy of the same music.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If you were in this same position , can you think of other ways you can drive <i>more</i> digital music sales with minimal real demand ?  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You can see that it <b>may</b> look like public Cloud revenue is growing , but the customers <b>may</b> not actually be utilizing it .  (Uncertainty) </span>If they are not utilizing the Cloud, you don't get all the business benefits described above.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If companies such as Microsoft and Oracle are truly making huge inroads in enticing companies away from on-premise offerings , it will impact VMware 's earnings .  (Uncertainty) </span>VMware is the undisputed number one provider of the virtualization layer and is not offered as part of either the Microsoft or Oracle Cloud offerings.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Going forward , if we see the cloud numbers from Oracle and Microsoft growing rapidly , but do n't see some kind of flattening or decline with VMware ( and we have n't so far ) , I 'd <b>suggest</b> that means something is not quite adding up .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you are interested in investing in Microsoft or Oracle based on their booming cloud businesses , you might want to weigh the risk that their public Cloud revenue <b>may</b> actually be customers that are entitled to use the cloud , but are not actually taking advantage of it .  (Uncertainty) </span>In this case most of the advantages to Microsoft or Oracle are not being realized.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Technology , Application Software</div></body></html>
