While it would be nice for additional Siri capabilities, consumers will be looking at the newest operating system for its battery life and storage size.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Longer</i> battery life would be a key reason for consumers to upgrade to the iPhone 7 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I also <b>believe</b> the company should look at scaling back compatability as a way to drive upgrades .  (Uncertainty) </span>The size of the operating system is key because if it takes up too much storage space, consumers won't like the 16GB entry level iPhone.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Apple <b>may</b> end up splitting the iPhone , giving consumers <i>more</i> storage space options , and potentially helping average selling prices .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>seems</b> likely that at least one new iPhone model to be launched later this year will start with a base of 32GB of storage .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With a major focus on the growing service business , Apple <b>could</b> show off some improvements to Apple Pay .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the company does allow iOS users to send money between devices with a tap or through iMessage , the Apple Pay service <b>could</b> end up becoming a true replacement for PayPal ( NASDAQ : PYPL ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>This comes at a time where one prominent Apple analyst recently stated that only one out of five new iPhone owners is using Apple Pay.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This year 's biggest overhaul at WWDC is expected to come for the company 's music service , which is rumored to get a <i>simpler</i> design and <i>cleaner</i> backgrounds .  (Surprise) </span>At its most recent earnings report, the company stated it was over 13 million subscribers for the service, meaning that Apple Music brings in over $1 billion in annual revenues.While that number is about half of what Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) does currently on a yearly basis, it is small in the Apple universe.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Apple <b>could</b> look to grow this number by announcing an expansion of the service to <i>more</i> countries at WWDC .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>A third version of the Watch's operating system is expected at WWDC, but what about a second version of the actual product?<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>That <b>could</b> be a <b>surprise</b> at this year 's event , if Apple announces a launch date that 's in the near future .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the chart below , Apple has seen a decreasing market share percentage in the wearables category since the first model was launched <i>more</i> than a year ago .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>( Source : IDC reports - Q2 2015 , Q3 2015 , Q4 2015 , Q1 2016 ) Apple <b>may</b> wait to launch the next watch until the fall , gearing it up for the important holiday shopping season .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But if the company wants to get sales going , a launch in the next month or two would do the trick .  (Uncertainty) </span>This would also help stop some of the sales momentum seen by Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) with its smartwatch offerings.A new Apple Watch would also help Apple's revenue number as we now have year ago comparisons that are tough as slowing sales compete against the first few launch months.One recent Forbes article detailed how the latest software update for the Apple TV box didn't do much other than fix some behind the scenes issues.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The author of the article <b>wondered</b> if this meant Apple has something big planned for Apple TV at WWDC next month .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> a new version of the product comes , one that has the ability to handle 4K video .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The biggest <b>surprise</b> , however , would be if Apple finally launched its streaming service that has been in the works for quite some time .  (Surprise) </span>Apple's content plans have been talked about immensely, especially with recent news about a potential bid for Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ) or even Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While many do n't expect any news on this front , a streaming service reveal would be the big <b>surprise</b> that investors are looking for , and it certainly would help stem current revenue declines .
