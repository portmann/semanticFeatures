As consumers increasingly rely on their smartphones and tablets for most personal computing needs, the living room is becoming the last refuge of the non-mobile personal computer.Integration with mobile devices will become an important discriminator, and here, Apple has the advantage.Apple TV will be accessible from any iOS device, as well as Apple Watch.Siri based control will also be available through any iOS device.The iOS Continuity feature will be extended to Apple TV as well.Tasks and apps that are started on an iOS mobile device will become activated on the Apple TV (if desired) just by entering the room.Previous generations of Apple TV were experiments, iOS devices that weren't quite the equal of even the iPhone.The next generation promises to become much better integrated into the iOS ecosystem, and play a pivotal role in the home.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Other up and coming stars of the Apple pantheon might put in cameo <b>appearances</b> , such as the large ( 12-13 '' ) screen iPad Pro .  (Uncertainty) </span>But I really don't expect the Pro until October.Here the issue is production capacity for the iPhone 6s SOC.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I expect the supply of SOCs to be <b>somewhat</b> limited until TSMC ( NYSE : TSM ) comes on board as a second source to Samsung later in the year .  (Uncertainty) </span>Until October, I just don't think there will be enough of the 14 nm parts to support both the new iPhones and new iPads.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We could also see an <b>appearance</b> by Apple 's Watch OS2 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>WOS2 and iOS9 have been in beta more or less in tandem since WWDC , so WOS2 could roll out at the same time as the iPhone 6s simply because when the new iPhone is ready , the new iOS 9 will <b>probably</b> be ready as well .  (Uncertainty) </span>Will the new iPhone and Apple TV be enough to galvanize investor support and keep the recent bounce in Apple's share price going?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Probably</b> not .  (Uncertainty) </span>I know.Oh, cynical me.But really, when hasn't an iPhone launch been greeted with the utmost skepticism in the business media?As soon as the event is over, we'll be treated to a veritable avalanche of reasons why this next iPhone will flop.The processor is too slow.The camera doesn't have enough pixels.The screen isn't bright or colorful enough.Most importantly, the novelty of the big screen has worn off.The bloom is off the rose.Apple has had its day in the sun.We've all heard it before.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Many are realizing that China had been turned into just another bogeyman with which to <b>scare</b> Apple investors .  (Uncertainty) </span>Despite this, I don't expect the media negativity about Apple to abate until the fiscal Q4 earnings report at the earliest.I expect the real turnaround to be in January of 2016 when Apple reports December quarter results.Despite the fact that a new iPhone and Apple TV form a very credible basis for a special event, I can't escape the feeling that I'm missing something.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The size of the venue makes me suspicious that Apple has some big <b>surprise</b> planned .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 've been wracking my brain trying to come up with a <b>possible</b> new product .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple Car?Naaah, waaay too far in the future.If Apple even has a rolling test bed, I'm sure it's nothing they want to show at a special event.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The only other thing I can think of <b>might</b> have something to do with virtual/augmented reality .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple is known to have been hiring engineers to work in the field.Apple is also known to have obtained a patent for VR goggles that would use an iPhone as the display unit: I don't know that the patent would really serve as the basis of a viable product, but it shows where Apple wants to go.Apple wants to build on the iPhone as a highly capable portable computing device with very capable graphics and a retina caliber display.VR goggles have a geeky lack of coolness that is very un-Apple, so I can't see Apple getting serious about such a device.With augmented reality goggles such as the Microsoft HoloLens, the device at least has the potential to eventually become something people would wear in public without embarrassment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Apple <b>could</b> develop augmented reality glasses that were actually inconspicuous , it would have a huge hit on its hands .
