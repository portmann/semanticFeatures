( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Jun 29 2016 , 15:38 ET | By : Stephen Alpher , SA News Editor Beginning this week , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) quietly began offering for sale whole-bean and ground coffee under its new Happy Belly label - putting it in competition with the likes of Starbucks ( NASDAQ : SBUX ) . The WSJ one month ago reported <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> as planning four brands of private-label foods , diapers , and cleaning supplies to be sold exclusively to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime members . For the moment , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is not necessarily positioning these items as the low-cost offering . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Bags of Happy Belly cost $ 9.99 each - about $ 2 <i>more</i> than Starbucks ' breakfast blend , but $ 3 <i>less</i> than Starbucks ' French roast .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In-house brands like these potentially carry <i>higher</i> profit margins , partly thanks to savings on brand development and marketing .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>may</b> also be able to design the packaging to reduce shipping costs . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>I wish this annoyance would give some clarity...Like start paying a dividend or something.I don't know whether to invest or not.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Right now it just looks like a gelatinous ponzi scheme financed on expensive shares and <b>hopium</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>And rockets.To be kind, the Washington Post is engaging, the service fairly easy to use.Prime video is sucking in regard to selection.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> wo n't be paying a dividend any time soon and the very happy shareholders like it that way . If you are looking for dividends, go elsewhere.That said , look at a long-term chart of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . You would be happy with your investment from just about any time in the past.Of course, who knows what the future holds.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has been doing <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> of their own shipping . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They even leased 20 Boeing 767s <i>earlier</i> this year with an option to buy part of the leasing company .  (Surprise) </span>Not saying that UPS is n't safe , but <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will squeeze costs anywhere it can , including from UPS and other shippers . Neat!I'm a big fan of private-label foodstuffs - my favorite grocery store was F&E (RIP :(), now my favorite grocery store is TJ's, both heavily invested in their own quality private-label foodstuffs.Also a big fan of Costco and their Kirkland brand stuff.So I 'm looking forward to seeing what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does with this . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sadly , I do n't care at all about coffee , though , nor do I have babies ( thank goodness ) , so <b>hopefully</b> they 'll come out with something I 'll actually want to buy soon .
