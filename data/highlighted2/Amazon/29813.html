(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Following phenomenal returns since late 2011, Netflix is trading on hype and a flawed thesis.The bull case rests on a "virtuous cycle" that has never been proven.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The facts <b>suggest</b> the opposite cycle .  (Uncertainty) </span>Subscriber growth is stalling, content liabilities are skyrocketing, and operating expenses are rapidly climbing.The income statement is misleading; examining cash flows shows the rapidly weakening structure.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Despite being a loyal customer of seven years , I have also been a Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) bear for many years ( since late 2010 ) , and <b>surprisingly</b> , despite strong domestic subscriber growth and rapid international expansion , <b>nearly</b> all of the bear side arguments remain as valid as they were in 2011 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Bulls often focus on misguided shorts who missed a run from the mid-$60s in late 2011 to the upper $400s of today, an annualized return of over 75%.They are absolutely right.Shorting NFLX in late 2011 was a miserable call.However, the underlying short thesis remains intact despite the enormous market disconnect.The NFLX market outperformance also ignores the collapse of 2011, similar to how government economists like to begin their models in early 2009.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite the rampant gain in stock price , when compared to 2011 peaks close to $ 300 , NFLX has returned only 13 % annually versus S&P 500 ( NYSEARCA : SPY ) returns of <b>almost</b> exactly the same .  (Uncertainty) </span>There have been lots of discussions regarding the pricing of the stock market, including Robert Shiller's warning during mid-2014 due to a near record CAPE reading .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For those <b>unfamiliar</b> , Shiller is an economics Nobel Laureate , and is famous for correctly calling both the tech bubble and the housing bubble collapse within 1-2 years .  (Uncertainty) </span>His book, Irrational Exuberance , is a fantastic read, and he aptly released his 3rd edition in January 2015.He released his first book in March 2000, and the second edition in late 2005.Both books preempted the subsequent market crash by mere months.Only time will tell whether he will perform a hat trick, but fundamentally he has proven right that the market is nearing record valuations.This market bubble is compounded in the tech sector.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Stocks like Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) , LinkedIn ( NYSE : LNKD ) , Twitter ( NYSE : TWTR ) , and Netflix trade with average price-to-earnings ( P/E ) multiples of <b>nearly</b> 100x .  (Uncertainty) </span>Even by price-to-sales (P/S), the multiples are strong ranging from 5 to 20.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Ironically , of this batch of 4 stocks - Netflix is actually one of the ` cheapest ' with a P/E of around 100 and a P/S of <b>approximately</b> 5 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Despite common arguments that these are "good businesses," the current fundamentals and growth prospects do not justify these multiples.Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) were all fantastic businesses in 1999, yet long-term shareholders still got stuck with abysmal returns due to poor investment timing decisions.Regardless of your thoughts on the underlying stock market, NFLX is in need of strong subscriber growth, and ultimately revenue growth, not just to satisfy analysts and traders, but to stay afloat financially.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix has posted impressive subscriber growth over the past 5 years , but I <b>believe</b> we are very close to saturation in the US markets , and that international markets will continue to prove difficult in regards to profitability .  (Uncertainty) </span>The two most recent quarters present striking evidence of this coming "brick wall."The charts below highlight Netflix's y/y growth, both domestically and worldwide.While the domestic growth was strong throughout 2013, there is a clear trend of slowing growth.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The worldwide figures demonstrate the same trend , but the growth is much <i>stronger</i> due to the rapid global expansion of streaming availability and limited competition .  (Surprise) </span>The worldwide figures show the same trend, but growth is still above 30% year-over-year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix is increasingly <b>dependent</b> on international growth to meet analyst targets and investor expectations .  (Uncertainty) </span>The chart below highlights the rapid ascent of the (unprofitable) international subscriber count versus Netflix's total base.The entire Netflix bull case boils down to one argument, the "virtuous cycle."The operating results and growth projections can be packaged by analysts in many different ways, but the crux of the argument is that NFLX will use its global leverage and scalability to secure long-term favorable content agreements.It will then utilize pricing power to boost revenues, while simultaneously posting massive subscriber growth.This will result in revenue growth that will rapidly outpace content spending, ultimately leading to massive profits that justify the current valuations.This thesis has zero fundamental support, and defies basic business logic.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Without this thesis , NFLX is nothing <i>more</i> than a commodity middleman with a sideline content business .  (Surprise) </span>Essentially, a mixture of a Starz (NASDAQ: STRZA ) type bundler and a Lions Gate (NYSE: LGF ) type content procurer/producer.The below graph shows the year-over-year growth of revenues versus content cost growth, and shows the "virtuous cycle" thesis has failed to materialize.The Q4-14 results were the first time in NFLX history that revenues outpaced content liabilities, by a mere 0.2%, helped by both phenomenal seasonal results in the US, rapid international expansion, and a price hike during fall 2014 .These comparisons ignore the profound 'juicing' that NFLX used via a record-breaking marketing spend.During Q4-14, NFLX spent $204M on marketing and $76M on corporate expenses, annual increases of 59% and 64%, respectively.What did these massive campaigns yield?The lowest YoY subscriber growth in recent history.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It gets <i>worse</i> as the total content liabilities continue to skyrocket .  (Surprise) </span>During the last two quarters, NFLX posted the two highest annual increases in content liability growth.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>These are in % - values , the nominal growth is even <i>worse</i> .  (Surprise) </span>This out-of-control spending commitment is seen below.Reed Hastings is a smart man, and a brilliant business leader.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I honestly <b>believe</b> he wants Netflix to succeed and revolutionize the tech world .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>He wants to secure the best <b>possible</b> future for long-term shareholders .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, to accomplish this, with what is obviously a failed business model, management, and especially sell-side analysts, he must resort to a shell game of sorts.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Just as a shell game involves misdirection and appears as a game of skill , NFLX results are packaged as sustainable growth and <b>varying</b> metrics are placed forward to demonstrate a flawed thesis .  (Uncertainty) </span>This flawed thesis is the proposal of a virtuous cycle based on a flawed representations of cheap and easy growth, content bargaining power, and consumer pricing power.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The proof of a virtuous cycle is shifted from egg to egg <b>depending</b> on the most recent results - another descriptive word is `` spin . ''  (Uncertainty) </span>Are analysts focused on raw subscriber growth?NFLX plunges into international markets, and loses money hand over fist in order to boost these figures.Subscriber growth is a misdirection.Bears are focusing on a lack of unique content.NFLX will spend billions to create a plethora of shows and pay through the nose for Disney (NYSE: DIS ) exclusivity.Content power is a misdirection.Focused on cash flows?NFLX says it's going towards international growth."You have to spend money to make money."Bulls point instead to the income statement, the biggest misdirection of them all.If you've only looked at the income statement with a quick glance, the flawed bullish argument wins.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Growth looks nice there and NFLX <b>appears</b> to be building profits - it 's what Netflix 's management and bandwagon analysts want you to look at .  (Uncertainty) </span>Just don't peak under the hood and look at cash flows because then the thesis crumbles.I peaked under the hood and it's ugly.The analysis shot is posted below.I took publicly available numbers from Netflix's results page , specifically this document , and rearranged the numbers to prevent obscuration by irrelevant flows.Specifically, I removed the cash flows from buying, selling, and redeeming investment securities, which have no place in determining underlying profits.I also separated out NFLX's juicing of working capital - a one-time gainer, and common financial 'sin' that I lambasted Angie's List (NASDAQ: ANGI ) with back in 2013.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Smartly utilizing working capital is good - it 's pretending these results provide evidence of sustainable free cash flow that I <b>believe</b> qualifies as misleading .  (Uncertainty) </span>As seen in the above chart, business results are going in the wrong direction - fast!This chart, coupled with slowing subscriber growth, and rapidly ascending content costs should have potential investors running for the hills.As I think about Netflix investors eagerly awaiting the "promised land" of profits and cash flow, I am reminded of a quote from Gertrude Stein: "there is no there, there."<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In other words , once NFLX has exhausted all remaining avenues of subscriber growth , and has spent billions <i>more</i> on short-term content contracts , and billions <i>more</i> on exclusive content , investors will be left with a failed business model .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The virtuous cycle that has been promised to the <b>faithful</b> is nothing <i>more</i> than a poorly researched sham .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The sham is quickly unraveling, on both the content (above) and non-content side (below).I urge all interested readers, especially if you disagree with me, to read my early 2014 article in which I refute Icahn's thesis for owning Netflix.There's 6-7 pages of content there, of which most is relevant over a year later.I also urge readers to check out the bullish arguments for Netflix, the most recent of which was posted by James Godbout on 7 April 2015.Take the time to review the income statements, peruse the balance sheet, and examine the timing of debt issuances.Read all you can find about Netflix and then come to your own informed conclusion.Remember, this isn't about the Netflix monthly video streaming offering, it's about the investment proposition of purchasing the stock for $475/share.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> that Netflix offers a great product to its users and is greatly benefiting the average video consumer .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , I <b>believe</b> the current business model has multiple holes and the overarching thesis is completely flawed .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I also <b>believe</b> the recent results have been immensely skewed by NFLX bulls , primarily the mainstream analyst community .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> Netflix is similar to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) or Yahoo ( NASDAQ : YHOO ) in 1999-2000 , with fantastic consumer offerings but with weak profitability and poor business models . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Just as those firms were priced-to-perfection prior to the dot-com burst , I <b>believe</b> NFLX is currently priced to near perfection , despite fundamental proof of weakness .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> a phenomenal crash is coming soon .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I look forward to what I <b>believe</b> will be a lively discussion below .  (Uncertainty) </span>I am not an investment advisor, so there's no "advice" here, just a few ways in which I am considering playing what I perceive to be a phenomenal mispricing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Short-term <b>speculatively</b> , the out-of-the-money options expiring after earnings ( April 17 ) , such as the $ 400 puts , offer a 12-1 payout if NFLX drops 20 % after results ( priced around $ 1.50 ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>The at-the-money puts ($475) are priced for a breakeven at a 4.8% drop ($22 per contract), and would give a 4-1 payout with a 20% drop.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Longer</i> term , if you are as convicted as me , the $ 250 puts trade for around $ 3 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If NFLX hits a growth wall during mid-late 2015 , I believe the stock <b>could</b> easily lose 50-75 % of its current value ( 4x and 44x payout respectively ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As a pure short , for the long term , I do n't <b>believe</b> it 's attractive .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Insurance is always a necessity , and at-the-money calls ( $ 475 ) for January 2016 cost $ 65 ( 14 % implied upside in 8 months ) , which would result in a substantial drain on capital if NFLX stays in a similar trend .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The projected gain on <b>risk</b> ( $ 238 share price drop over $ 65 for the call ) is a maximum of 3.6 x and the breakeven is $ 410 .  (Uncertainty) </span>I personally have $420 and $390 puts for April 2015 and $100 puts for January 2016 (purchased over a year ago).If NFLX results are as expected, I plan to roll profits into $200-$250 Jan 16 strikes.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If results are different ( fundamentally positive ) , then I will <b>reexamine</b> my thesis .
