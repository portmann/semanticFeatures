( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha On Friday , Donald Trump said of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , `` If I become president , oh do they have problems . They're going to have such problems."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Six months ago , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's shareholders <b>might</b> have ignored such a statement by Trump , as many political pundits expected his candidacy to implode before any votes were counted . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Now, however, the votes have been counted in four states, and Trump has won the last three by wide margins.And he just picked up two governors' endorsements.For <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> longs looking to add some downside protection in light of this , we show a couple of ways to hedge the stock over the next several months . In a recent post ( Time To Consider Trump Insurance ?)<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>, we speculated on some companies that <b>might</b> be affected positively or negatively by the rise of Presidential candidate Donald J. Trump .  (Uncertainty) </span>One company we did n't mention was <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , but Trump mentioned it on Friday , and not in a positive way , as this tweet from CNBC shows ( screen captured below ) . That quote was preceded by Trump claiming that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> CEO Jeff Bezos had purchased the Washington Post to buy influence to help <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It would be one thing if Trump 's prospects of becoming President were slim , but , as the text at the bottom of that tweet shows , he got a major endorsement Friday by his former opponent Chris Christie , governor of New Jersey .  (Uncertainty) </span>And Trump was also endorsed by the governor of Maine the same day.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> did n't move much on this news , but if you 're long the stock and concerned it <b>might</b> take a hit as Trump gets <i>closer</i> to winning the GOP nomination , we 'll show a couple of ways of hedging it below . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you 'd like a refresher on options terms first , you <b>may</b> want to click over to our previous article on hedging Realty Income ( NYSE : O ) , and read the section titled , `` Refresher on Hedging Terms . ''  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of course , these hedges are n't just Trump insurance - they 'll limit your downside <b>risk</b> regardless of what causes the stock to drop .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We 'll use Portfolio Armor 's iOS app to find <b>optimal</b> puts and an <b>optimal</b> collar to hedge AMZN below , but you do n't need the app to do this .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You can find <b>optimal</b> puts and collars yourself by using the process we outlined in this article if you 're willing to take the time and do the work .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Whether you do it yourself using the process we outlined or use the app , an additional piece of information you 'll need to supply ( along with the number of shares you 're looking to hedge ) when scanning for an optimal put is your `` threshold '' , which refers to the maximum decline you are willing to <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This will vary depending on your <b>risk</b> tolerance .  (Uncertainty) </span>For the purpose of the examples below, we've used a threshold of 15%.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If you are <i>more</i> risk-averse , you <b>could</b> use a <i>smaller</i> threshold .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And if you are <i>less</i> risk-averse , you <b>could</b> use a <i>larger</i> one .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>All else equal , though , the <i>higher</i> the threshold , the <i>cheaper</i> it will be to hedge .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Here are the <b>optimal</b> puts as of Friday 's close to hedge 400 shares of AMZN against a greater-than-15 % drop by mid-July .  (Uncertainty) </span>As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above, the cost of this protection was $11,000, or 4.95% of position value.A couple of points about this cost: To be conservative, the cost was based on the ask price of the put.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In practice , you can often buy puts for <i>less</i> ( at some price between the bid and ask ) .  (Surprise) </span>The 15% threshold includes this cost, i.e., in the worst-case scenario, your AMZN position would be down 10.05%, not including the hedging cost.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>When scanning for an <b>optimal</b> collar , you 'll need one <i>more</i> figure in addition to your threshold , your `` cap '' , which refers to the maximum upside you are willing to limit yourself to if the underlying security appreciates significantly .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>One starting point for the cap is your estimate of how the security will perform over the time period of the hedge.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>For example , if you 're hedging over a seven-month period , and you think a security wo n't appreciate <i>more</i> than 5 % over that time frame , then it <b>might</b> make sense to use 5 % as a cap ; you do n't think the security is going to do <i>better</i> than that anyway , so you 're willing to sell someone else the right to call it away if it does <i>better</i> than that .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>We checked Portfolio Armor 's website to get an estimate of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's potential return over the next several months . Every trading day, the site runs two screens to avoid bad investments on every hedgeable security in the U.S., and then ranks the ones that pass by their potential return.Potential return , in the site 's terminology , is a high-end estimate of how a security will perform over the next several months , and the site calculated a potential return of 10 % for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , so we 'll use that as its cap . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As of Friday 's close , this was the <b>optimal</b> collar to hedge 400 shares of AMZN against a greater-than-15 % drop by mid-July , while not capping an investor 's upside at <i>less</i> than 10 % .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As you can see in the first part of the <b>optimal</b> collar above , the cost of the put leg was $ 7,640 , or 3.44 % , as a percentage of position value .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But if you look at the second part of the collar below , you 'll see the income generated by selling the call leg was slightly <i>more</i> , $ 10,380 , or 4.67 % of position value .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>So the net cost of this <b>optimal</b> collar was negative , meaning an investor would have collected $ 2,740 <i>more</i> from selling the call leg than he paid for the puts , an amount equal to 1.23 % of his position value .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Two notes on this collar hedge : To be conservative , the cost of the <b>optimal</b> collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls ; in practice , an investor can often buy puts for <i>less</i> and sell calls for <i>more</i> ( again , at some price between the bid and the ask ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So , in reality , an investor would likely have collected <i>more</i> than $ 2,740 when opening this collar .  (Surprise) </span>Although the threshold on this collar is 15%, and thresholds are calculated to take into account positive hedging costs, they don't take into account negative hedging costs.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>So , the worst-case scenario in this case , when taking into account the negative hedging cost , would be a decline of <i>less</i> than 15 % : <b>assuming</b> , conservatively , a negative cost of 1.23 % , the maximum drawdown here would be 15 % - 1.23 % = 13.77 % .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Similarly, the best case scenario wouldn't be 10%, the level at which this collar is capped, but 10% + 1.23% = 11.23%.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: ETFs & Portfolio Strategy , Portfolio Strategy & Asset Allocation, Technology , Editors' Picks</div></body></html>
