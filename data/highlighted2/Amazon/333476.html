(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As you can see in the first part of the <b>optimal</b> collar above , the cost of the put leg was $ 7,640 , or 3.44 % , as a percentage of position value .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But if you look at the second part of the collar below , you 'll see the income generated by selling the call leg was slightly <i>more</i> , $ 10,380 , or 4.67 % of position value .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>So the net cost of this <b>optimal</b> collar was negative , meaning an investor would have collected $ 2,740 <i>more</i> from selling the call leg than he paid for the puts , an amount equal to 1.23 % of his position value .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Two notes on this collar hedge : To be conservative , the cost of the <b>optimal</b> collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls ; in practice , an investor can often buy puts for <i>less</i> and sell calls for <i>more</i> ( again , at some price between the bid and the ask ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So , in reality , an investor would likely have collected <i>more</i> than $ 2,740 when opening this collar .  (Surprise) </span>Although the threshold on this collar is 15%, and thresholds are calculated to take into account positive hedging costs, they don't take into account negative hedging costs.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>So , the worst-case scenario in this case , when taking into account the negative hedging cost , would be a decline of <i>less</i> than 15 % : <b>assuming</b> , conservatively , a negative cost of 1.23 % , the maximum drawdown here would be 15 % - 1.23 % = 13.77 % .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Similarly, the best case scenario wouldn't be 10%, the level at which this collar is capped, but 10% + 1.23% = 11.23%.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: ETFs & Portfolio Strategy , Portfolio Strategy & Asset Allocation, Technology , Editors' Picks</div></body></html>
