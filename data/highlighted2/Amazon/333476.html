style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>If I become president oh do they have problems Theyre going to have such problems Six months ago Amazons shareholders might have ignored such a statement by Trump as many political pundits expected his candidacy to implode before any votes were counted Now however the votes have been counted in four states and Trump has won the last three by wide margins And he just picked up two governors endorsements For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>longs looking to add some downside protection in light of this we show a couple of ways to hedge the stock over the next several months In a recent post Time To Consider Trump Insurance we speculated on some companies that might be affected positively or negatively by the rise of Presidential candidate Donald J Trump One company we didnt mention was <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN but Trump mentioned it on Friday and not in a positive way as this tweet from CNBC shows screen captured below That quote was preceded by Trump claiming that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>CEO Jeff Bezos had purchased the Washington Post to buy influence to help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>It would be one thing if Trumps prospects of becoming President were slim but as the text at the bottom of that tweet shows he got a major endorsement Friday by his former opponent Chris Christie governor of New Jersey And Trump was also endorsed by the governor of Maine the same day <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>didnt move much on this news but if youre long the stock and concerned it might take a hit as Trump gets closer to winning the GOP nomination well show a couple of ways of hedging it below If youd like a refresher on options terms first you may want to click over to our previous article on hedging Realty Income NYSE O and read the section titled Refresher on Hedging Terms Of course these hedges arent just Trump insurance theyll limit your downside risk regardless of what causes the stock to drop Well use Portfolio Armors iOS app to find optimal puts and an optimal collar to hedge AMZN below but you dont need the app to do this You can find optimal puts and collars yourself by using the process we outlined in this article if youre willing to take the time and do the work Whether you do it yourself using the process we outlined or use the app an additional piece of information youll need to supply along with the number of shares youre looking to hedge when scanning for an optimal put is your threshold which refers to the maximum decline you are willing to risk This will vary depending on your risk tolerance For the purpose of the examples below weve used a threshold of If you are more riskaverse you could use a smaller threshold And if you are less riskaverse you could use a larger one All else equal though the higher the threshold the cheaper it will be to hedge Here are the optimal puts as of Fridays close to hedge shares of AMZN against a greaterthan drop by midJuly As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above the cost of this protection was or of position value A couple of points about this cost To be conservative the cost was based on the ask price of the put In practice you can often buy puts for less at some price between the bid and ask The threshold includes this cost ie in the worstcase scenario your AMZN position would be down not including the hedging cost When scanning for an optimal collar youll need one more figure in addition to your threshold your cap which refers to the maximum upside you are willing to limit yourself to if the underlying security appreciates significantly One starting point for the cap is your estimate of how the security will perform over the time period of the hedge For example if youre hedging over a sevenmonth period and you think a security wont appreciate more than over that time frame then it might make sense to use as a cap you dont think the security is going to do better than that anyway so youre willing to sell someone else the right to call it away if it does better than that We checked Portfolio Armors website to get an estimate of Amazons potential return over the next several months Every trading day the site runs two screens to avoid bad investments on every hedgeable security in the US and then ranks the ones that pass by their potential return Potential return in the sites terminology is a highend estimate of how a security will perform over the next several months and the site calculated a potential return of for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>so well use that as its cap As of Fridays close this was the optimal collar to hedge shares of AMZN against a greaterthan drop by midJuly while not capping an investors upside at less than As you can see in the first part of the optimal collar above the cost of the put leg was or as a percentage of position value But if you look at the second part of the collar below youll see the income generated by selling the call leg was slightly more or of position value So the net cost of this optimal collar was negative meaning an investor would have collected more from selling the call leg than he paid for the puts an amount equal to of his position value Two notes on this collar hedge To be conservative the cost of the optimal collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls in practice an investor can often buy puts for less and sell calls for more again at some price between the bid and the ask So in reality an investor would likely have collected more than when opening this collar Although the threshold on this collar is and thresholds are calculated to take into account positive hedging costs they dont take into account negative hedging costs So the worstcase scenario in this case when taking into account the negative hedging cost would be a decline of less than assuming conservatively a negative cost of the maximum drawdown here would be Similarly the best case scenario wouldnt be the level at which this collar is capped but Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article
