(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The company is enjoying far <i>more</i> growth from Office 365 than many observers think <b>possible</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It has an excellent chance to significantly exceed current analyst forecasts for both revenues and EPS.I think Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) shares are a buy.Not because the company pays a dividend.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That <b>may</b> appeal to many readers and investors ; I frankly prefer companies that have opportunities to invest their operating cash flow into high-return projects that will ultimately enhance growth and profitability .  (Uncertainty) </span>I think Microsoft's shares are a buy here because of the rather significant relative share price under-performance since the start of this year and in particular since the latest earnings release last month.MSFT's shares are down about 8% since the company's latest earnings release while the IGV software index is down about 1% over that same time period.I think the shares are a buy because of the relatively unfavorable sentiment/recommendation consensus amongst analysts.The concomitant of that is that analyst consensus estimates for both revenues and EPS have reached a level from which they can readily be exceeded .I even like the shares because Jim Cramer thinks that the company is not pushing into the cloud fast enough, and he recommends his viewers to stay away from the shares.And I think Microsoft's shares are a buy because the company is reaching the tipping point in several of its multiple transitions.I think that this is not well understood by much of the investment community.And I think the success of the transitions is going to lead to another period during which Microsoft regularly beats consensus expectations, not just for EPS but for top-line growth as well.The surest way to achieve positive alpha from an investment is to find a reasonably valued name that regularly beats the consensus forecast.When Microsoft completes its current round of transitions, that is what I expect to happen.And all of the transitions I am going to be discussing are well underway.They aren't nascent or conjectures about future strategy.The strategies that are going to restore this company to growth are happening now.To be fair, the cyclical trend that is retarding growth, primarily the very constrained IT spending environment , particularly in emerging countries, is also happening now.Timing in investments, as well as in life, is everything.I cannot attempt to call the specific quarter in which the success of Microsoft's multiple transitions becomes clear and becomes received wisdom across the board.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But because of the relative underperformance of the shares , I <b>believe</b> now is a good time for investors to either add to positions or to establish new ones and to overweight the shares in any tech portfolio run on anything other than a trading basis .  (Uncertainty) </span>I think most readers realize that the software industry is essentially all about transitions.Software companies have to reinvent themselves regularly or they will lose relevance and stagnate.A few years ago, Microsoft was in danger of becoming one of those companies.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Without a lengthy exposition of the styles of the three men who have been CEO of this company , I think it seems <b>apparent</b> that current CEO Satya Nadella has done a lot to shake up an aging dinosaur .  (Uncertainty) </span>And I think that the fruition of many of his efforts is in the process of being realized.And that is why I think Microsoft's shares are a buy.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Most readers heard of and read about the transition to cloud through which <b>almost</b> all <i>older</i> software companies and some new ones as well are going through .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Probably</b> many readers are having sensory overload about now in reading yet another article about a cloud transition .  (Uncertainty) </span>But the fact is that the cloud transition story has had a significant impact on Microsoft's reported results.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But there are other seemingly <i>less</i> obvious transitions that have been happening as well .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As these transitions , which will likely go on for several years <i>more</i> , become significant , they will positively impact reported results in a meaningful fashion .  (Surprise) </span>It is the combination of the multiple transitions rather than any single one that is likely to restore growth to this company and to foster the achievement of positive alpha for the shares.Microsoft's transition: The skin molting process is well underway Microsoft today is really a transition story on many fronts.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One transition that is easy to understand and is <b>probably</b> the most significant is the transition from revenues derived from perpetual licensing to revenues coming from ratable models .  (Uncertainty) </span>But overall, the company is actually going through multiple transitions on a simultaneous basis that have at least partially obscured what is really happening at the company.Are the parts that are rising, large enough when compared to the parts that are falling (primarily PC-based revenues) or stagnating to make this a decent investment.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The purpose of this article is to analyze the multiple transitions carefully to get a <i>better</i> sense of what success or failure really means .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is no realistic way I <b>might</b> cover , in a single article , all the issues and all of the debates that make up the dialog about investing in this company 's shares .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>An all-encompassing article would be far <i>longer</i> than what most SA readers want to read .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So , if you are looking for a discussion of the Surface laptop and tablet business , or an analysis of the company 's Lumia phone operations , it is n't going to be here ( Just for the record , however , the company 's phone business declined by 46 % year on year and sell through was <i>weaker</i> still leading to a build-up in channel inventory ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you want to read <b>speculation</b> as to whether MSFT will soon exit the phone business in the wake of that performance as it has exited the display advertising business , you will not find it here either .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I have even had to exclude Xbox from the overall analysis , just to keep the length of this article <b>somewhat</b> reasonable and maintain the focus ( I will mention that MSFT has achieved <i>more</i> than a little success with Surface whose revenues grew 61 % year on year to over $ 1 billion .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>That is impressive and in most companies a product line that achieved $1 billion of quarterly revenue ought to be considered as a significant business driver.But for this company, which did $22 billion in quarterly revenue during the March quarter, it is just 4.5% of the total.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And I <b>doubt</b> if anyone thinks that Surface growth of even double digits is likely to continue in the context of the overall PC market ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Perhaps <i>more</i> interesting was the comment during the conference call that the success of Surface is being driven by commercial/enterprise customers and <b>might</b> be seen as a validation of leveraging the entire MSFT stack .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And interesting as it <b>may</b> be , I have to exclude discussions of the relative success of the Microsoft Windows 10 free upgrade promotion and what will be the impact of its termination .  (Uncertainty) </span>I personally am not all that sure about how Microsoft is going to have 1 billion copies of Windows 10 running when it took free prices to get 300 million copies installed, but again, in the context of what I am trying to look at, it really doesn't matter all that much.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But overall , the reason to look at MSFT 's shares now as a vehicle to find positive alpha is that the shares have underperformed for about a month and have become misunderstood and even <b>somewhat</b> neglected .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In many areas within the IT space , 8 % <b>might</b> be viewed as a minor perturbation .  (Uncertainty) </span>But for a name like this, an 8% share price decline is a significant event and one that investors should take advantage of.Microsoft is a company that has really been in transition since Bill Clinton was in the White House since before iPhones were developed and before social media was a dream in Mark Zuckerberg's dorm room.The company did two things in those years and did them very well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Microsoft Windows was the operating system used on <b>almost</b> all PCs shipped and Microsoft Office had a similar quasi-monopoly position in the market for personal productivity tools .  (Uncertainty) </span>As founder Bill Gates gradually withdrew his genius from running the company, it began to stagnate and to make some very bad asset allocation decisions.Mr. Gates stepped down from the CEO position at Microsoft in 2000, but remained chairman and chief software architect until 2006.Hindsight, to be sure, is 20/20 and Microsoft's stagnation wasn't total.At the time, it surely didn't quite seem as though Microsoft was stagnating.The Xbox console was first released in November 2001.The company had a database product that was co-developed with Sybase that dated back to the late 1980s.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Many observers <b>believe</b> that the SQL Server release 7 in 1998 actually marked the company 's arrival on the enterprise data base scene .  (Uncertainty) </span>In 2001, Microsoft bought Great Plains software in order to enter the market for packaged ERP solutions, primarily sold to the SMB market.The next year, Microsoft bought Navision, a Danish software vendor which had a significant position in the European ERP market at the time.Microsoft started to offer primitive BI capabilities as part of its SQL Server 7 release at the end of the 1990s.By the 2005 release, Microsoft had a reporting service that looked like a primitive version of modern analytics solutions.In 2006, Microsoft bought a company called aQuantive and attempted to enter the digital advertising space to compete with Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The lest said about that foray , the <i>better</i> other than the company finally exited the business last year .  (Surprise) </span>But the fact is that other than X-Box, none of these forays into the enterprise world really moved the needle or became competitive with the major applications vendors and Business intelligence vendors of the era.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And so the share price remained <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> constant for years and years .  (Surprise) </span>The company needed to transition from heavy reliance on the PC for its growth but proved unable to do so.The shares made their all-time high as long ago as 1999 and for years and years thereafter, the stock price essentially stagnated with the exception of their reaction to the business climate during the Great Recession.Things started to change in 2013 and the shares appreciated by about 38% in what proved to be the last year of the tenure of former CEO Steve Ballmer.There are many observers who feel that Ballmer was an inept and non-visionary CEO.This really is neither a good time nor a place to join that debate.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Today the company is led by Satya Nadella , and as I have written <i>earlier</i> , it has emerged as the # 2 competitor in the world of the public cloud with revenues for Azure , its competitor to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Web Services ( AWS ) estimated at a current run rate of about $ 3 billion . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>$3 billion is not all that much revenue for a company forecast to do $91 billion in its current fiscal year.But it is a huge amount of MSFT's growth.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Overall , the company is forecast to shrink $ 2 billion this current fiscal year ( ends 6/30/16 ) during which Azure revenues will <b>probably</b> <i>more</i> than double .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Next year, consensus estimates forecast revenues to increase by 4% or $3.6 billion.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Almost</b> certainly , the growth in Azure revenues will be all of that or <i>more</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We will get to that transition which is far <i>broader</i> than just the growth in Azure revenues later .  (Surprise) </span>First, let's take a look at the transition from Microsoft's perpetual model to what the company calls its annuity revenues.It used to be that it was relatively simple to put together a forecast for Microsoft growth.During its years of slumber, it was merely necessary to look at the growth of the PC market.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Oh , the company sold enterprise software , but not enough to matter , and it even sold some BI software which contributed even <i>less</i> as a percentage of total revenues .  (Surprise) </span>And it had Xbox as well.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But MSFT has become a far <i>more</i> complex company at which to look as some of its transition strategies begin to reach meaningful levels .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It is <i>more</i> difficult than <b>might</b> be imagined to measure the pace of the company 's multiple transitions .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I am not sure to what extent the lack of transparency is deliberate or has some other motivation but it most certainly exists.For example, the company doesn't break out revenue between cloud/subscription and perpetual revenues on a global basis where those numbers can be analyzed and projected.We intuitively realize that cloud is rising and everything else is falling, and we know some bits and pieces of how that transition is progressing, but we don't know what the entire picture looks like.I think by now, that most users of Office do so on a subscription basis, but I would really like to see the numbers.It isn't that hard and many other transition companies such as Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) or Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK ) and others make it simple.About the only significant statistic we have in the earnings press release, which likely speaks to the transition to a ratable model, is the change in deferred revenues.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As it happens , the growth in deferred revenues last quarter was significantly <i>stronger</i> than it had been for some time , but is that a trend ?  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We really have to <b>speculate</b> and <b>speculate</b> on what that means in terms of the completeness of the company 's transition .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company's CFO, Amy Hood , commented about the transition as follows: "We're continuing to expect a strong mix to the clouds.We're continuing to expect ARPU (Annual Revenue Per Unit) increases…and installed base growth.So really in that segment, it's the PC weakness in our traditional transactional Office business that's impacting the segment.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In Intelligent Cloud , it 's a very similar dynamic ... And in <i>More</i> Personal Computing , the largest change in that segment is frankly the phone ... '' In other words , Microsoft 's revenue issues are n't those associated with overall demand , but those associated with a switch from perpetual license to what the company is fond of calling its annuity business .  (Surprise) </span>It is far better from a forecasting viewpoint for Microsoft to have an issue with its transition than to have an issue with demand or market share.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It would be , <b>perhaps</b> , <i>more</i> helpful in assessing its transition if the company chose to be <i>more</i> transparent , but that is not going to be the case .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>But here and there management does talk about some significant numbers.For example, on this latest conference call, management talked about its Office 365 commercial seats growing at 57% year on year while consumer seats of Office 365 grew by 79%.The company, within Office 365, has recently rolled out E5, which costs $35/month, up from $22 for the soon-to-be-retired E4.The new plan includes such things as Delve Analytics and Advanced Threat Protection.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Really no need for readers to concern themselves about the feature/function improvements of E5 except to note that it is going to foster a significantly <i>greater</i> dollar volume of bookings growth , all of it of course in the cloud , i.e. ratable than what it is replacing .  (Surprise) </span>Indeed, last quarter, the company saw a 35% quarter-over-quarter growth of monthly active users of its premium information protection service that is part of the expanded capability of E5.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And contrary to the belief of some investors , the TAM of Office 365 is far <i>greater</i> with E5 than with came before .  (Surprise) </span>Office 365 is a growth proposition for Microsoft even if it is not showing up just yet in overall top-line numbers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In an answer to the question of an analyst the CFO said : `` In terms of overall , rough orders of magnitude , the Intelligent Cloud segment has the least <b>exposure</b> to the transactional business .  (Uncertainty) </span>It is…20%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But that 20 % , right , tends itself in quarter to the <b>volatility</b> you see .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The Productivity and Business Process segment has a bit <i>more</i> transactional <b>exposure</b> ... '' So , to an extent , we do have some quantification regarding the progress of MSFT 's transition .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is certainly in later innings , but the perpetual tail is still large enough to wag the <i>larger</i> dog .  (Surprise) </span>I do think it is fair to point out that Microsoft does have to contend with macro headwinds.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is a large company and it certainly has <b>exposure</b> to world-wide macro trends .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If server shipments in <i>lesser</i> developed nations decline significantly because of global economic growth issues , MSFT is going to be impacted .  (Surprise) </span>But overall, as the CFO put it: "Our annuity numbers and renewal numbers were very good in Intelligent Cloud.And in fact, they came right where we expected in terms of unearned balances, i.e. deferred revenues."Beyond the impact of the transition to cloud in terms of revenue growth, the transition is also impacting reported gross margins.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Gross margins , at least initially are <i>lower</i> for cloud-based solutions than they are for traditional transactional business .  (Surprise) </span>Microsoft is a huge company with plenty of "old" business, so the company's gross margins aren't impacted all that much by this transition.GAAP gross margins in the latest reported quarter declined from 67% to 62%.Overall, management is forecasting that non-GAAP gross margins are to decline 200 bps this year and 200 bps next year.None of that is really going to be "lost" in the sense that by definition, annuity revenues are just that…annuities.Much of the gross margins that aren't getting reported this year or next year are sitting in the various deferred revenue accounts.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Ultimately , the company 's gross margins are likely to increase as annuity revenues grow as a percentage of the total and <i>more</i> of them are made up of products that are on renewal rather than on their first lease cycle .  (Surprise) </span>Summing up, the first major transition, that of moving the preponderance of this company's revenues from perpetual to ratable, is nearing an end.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There will be quarters , as the March quarter , in which the company 's perpetual revenues fall short and that will take a toll of some kind on expected margins and growth , but that <b>exposure</b> is lessening quarter by quarter as the company 's revenue model transitions to a new paradigm .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Business segment reporting - One of the issues that tends to conceal <i>more</i> than it reveals at Microsoft these days .  (Surprise) </span>Microsoft for the last few quarters has chosen to report its revenues in three "new" buckets.Obviously it isn't that the businesses represented are new, but just the classifications.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>These are Productivity and Business Process , Intelligent Cloud and <i>More</i> Personal Computing .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>None of the titles are exactly congruent to what investors <b>might</b> think they mean .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>For example , while it seems logical to include sales of Surface in <i>More</i> Personal Computing , it seems far <i>less</i> clear cut that Bing search advertising sales <b>might</b> reside in that bucket .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Certainly the intelligent cloud bucket, while it contains Azure, also contains many other revenue streams that are only peripherally cloud related.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If you think that <i>More</i> Personal Computing is the location for all of the revenue associated with ... well software sold by Microsoft that is used on PCs , you would have to guess again .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And again , if you thought that Office 365 was revenue related to the <i>More</i> PC Category , you would have to modify that expectation because it really is reported as part of productivity and business process .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I have no intention of trying to review what is going on in each of the three reporting segments of the company.In my opinion, there simply aren't uniform demand drivers in any of the segments.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I liked the old segment reporting scheme much <i>better</i> , but this is what we have .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It was far <i>more</i> interesting , at least to this writer , when Microsoft chose to break its revenue into buckets that have <i>more</i> consistent growth rates .  (Surprise) </span>While this company does sell lots of revenue to consumers like myself, the growth parts of its business ought to be in the revenues that come from increasing its market share in the apps area and from the explosive current and longer-term growth of Azure.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The issue I have with the way that Microsoft reports its revenues is that it makes it <b>almost</b> impossible to quantify some long-term growth rate expectations with any degree of specificity .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Each of the company 's three business segments is made up of some slow-growth areas and some faster-growth areas and each of the segments has <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> revenue company from annuity streams .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Overall , while Microsoft has been able to grow revenues to some extent over the past three years from $ 77 billion in fiscal '13 to an estimated $ 86 billion this year , over that three-year span , it has not been able to increase its gross margins ( they were $ 57 billion in fiscal 2013 , they rose to $ 60.5 billion last year , and this year they will <b>probably</b> be around $ 55 billion this year ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I do n't imagine that any growth investor or even GARP investor is going to be excited about a 3.5 % top-line growth per year , even if part of the explanation of that number lies in the strong dollar and another part of the explanation lies in the transition to <i>more</i> of a ratable model over the time period .  (Surprise) </span>The company has bought back enough shares to reduce diluted outstanding shares from 8.4 billion to 8 billion over three years .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That is just <i>less</i> than a 5 % decrease in outstanding shares , but that does n't get the sales per share growth rate above 5 % .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Overall , operating income in FY 2013 was $ 26.8 billion and it is likely to be a bit <i>more</i> than $ 23 billion in the current fiscal year .  (Surprise) </span>Operating cash flow growth was from $28.8 billion in fiscal 2013 to a projected $31.6 billion for fiscal 2016.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But the business transition that I am most interested in , and which is seemingly the least heralded , is the market share opportunities that this company has in what it calls the intelligent cloud where <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> applications will run either natively or on some kind of hybrid basis .  (Surprise) </span>Microsoft has had an applications business and a data base business now for many years as I commented about earlier.And it has painfully built up an offering in the Business Intelligence space as well such that Gartner recently ranked it as the #1 company in the space although some of the commentators on past articles I have written, who themselves are users of the technology, disagree with Gartner's conclusions.But that is not the real point either.The real point here is that Microsoft, for the first time ever, so far as I can tell, is leveraging the move to cloud computing to sell its entire suite of database and application products.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We know , for example , that with the success of Azure has come a comparable success of Microsoft 's SQL Server whose revenues on Azure <i>more</i> than doubled last quarter .  (Surprise) </span>We know as well, that the company's CRM seats doubled last quarter and 80% of those seats deployed in the cloud (Why it is that cloud deployed CRM is not part of the intelligent cloud is a classification question well beyond the ability of this poor writer to quite understand).An example of what I see happening is the ability that Microsoft had to grow its Dynamics AX revenues from ERP by double digits last quarter.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>That is not a shabby achievement and is far <i>more</i> of an accomplishment than many readers <b>might</b> appreciate in that the two leaders in the space , Oracle ( NYSE : ORCL ) and SAP ( NYSE : SAP ) have shown declining revenues in that product area - or so one infers .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>On MSFT's conference call, the company talked about new use cases for Dynamic AX that are based on its stack of IoT, business intelligence and advanced analytics capability.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The real point I am suggesting is that for the first time in <b>perhaps</b> a generation , there is an opportunity for a vendor to take market share from Oracle in the relational data base area .  (Uncertainty) </span>And also for the first time in a great while, as users transition to the cloud, some of them are rethinking their relationship with their traditional software suppliers and are migrating to an all Microsoft paradigm.Someone asked the CFO if she would comment on the company's new long-term growth outlook and of course she declined to answer.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And if she is n't forecasting , anything I <b>might</b> write about long-term growth prospects for the company would be in the nature of a gratuitous guess .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But this company does have a significantly <i>higher</i> long-term growth potential than the 5 % that is currently the analyst consensus expectations .  (Surprise) </span>The additional growth will be both a product of completing the company's migration from perpetual to a ratable model.And that growth is likely to be a product of the company's accelerate success as it uses the massive adoption of Azure to pull through many other applications.That alone is a dramatic transition from past practice.These days, IT spending is extremely constrained.Gartner says it is growing at -.5% this year.That is a fierce headwind for a company like this with operations in most areas that are impacted by IT spending.I think the net of what I wanted to point out is that from being a share donor when it comes to overall IT spending, this company is in the process of becoming a share gainer as its transitions finally bear some fruit.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I do n't think that it will come as a <b>surprise</b> to readers that MSFT 's shares are not <b>nearly</b> as cheap as they were in 2013 before they <i>more</i> than doubled through the end of last year .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>As I pointed out, most financial metrics for this company have made very unspectacular progress over that time frame.At this point, the company has an EV/S of 3.6X .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Its P/E based on forward earnings estimates , and what I <b>believe</b> to be highly conservative guidance , is 18X .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company's best valuation metric is its free cash flow yield, which is in the range of 6.9%.The company has a current dividend yield of 2.82% and it has returned $6.4 billion to shareholders last quarter in the form of both dividends, ($2.8 billion) and repurchase of shares ($3.7 billion net) out of operating cash flow for the period of $10.4 billion.On most valuation metrics, MSFT's shares are priced as though they were in the GARP category.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think that the transitions discussed above are starting to have a visible impact on enough components of the income statement to <b>suggest</b> that next year 's consensus growth forecast of 4 % can readily be beaten , and with the leverage this company has through constraining OpEx , it can easily beat the current consensus of $ 2.89 in EPS for FY ' 17 .  (Uncertainty) </span>And I see the company being able to do that, even at its scale3, for several years to come.And that, in short is the case for positive alpha for Microsoft's shares.Microsoft is in the midst of multiple transitions that are masking the real health of its operations.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It has been transitioning its revenue model from perpetual license to subscription for the time now and that journey is <b>nearly</b> complete .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Indeed , in the last quarter , in the company 's commercial business segment , its annuity revenue mix reached 86 % of the total up 400 bps from the year <i>earlier</i> quarter .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company 's commercial cloud business , which includes a <b>variety</b> of revenue streams as well as Azure , has reached an annual run rate of $ 10 billion and its revenues have again been forecast to double by management over the next two years .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It seems likely that few analysts or investors actually <b>believe</b> that the company is going to achieve that kind of goal .  (Uncertainty) </span>Were that to happen, and nothing else changed in the company's revenue generation, achieving that forecast would yield 5% annual revenue growth.Like many other companies in the software space transitioning from perpetual to ratable revenues, gross margins have been under some pressure and they are decreasing by 200 bps this year and are likely to contract another 200 bps in FY '17.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These gross margin declines will <b>almost</b> certainly be made up over future years as the base of revenues coming from the balance sheet starts to grow significantly .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In addition to the impending completion of the trend toward annuity revenues growing as a proportion of the total , the company <b>appears</b> to be on the cusp of a transition in which it uses the advantages of the success of Azure to improve the performance of its data base , ERP , business intelligence and analytic products .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For the first time in <b>perhaps</b> a generation , some of that business is up for grabs as users migrate to the cloud , much of which is not coming from their historic vendors .
