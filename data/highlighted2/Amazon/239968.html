( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha The decision by GE to close data centers and commit to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's cloud is the year 's biggest tech story . Even open source can no longer compete with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's lock-in . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The realization that Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Web Services now dominates public cloud has caused the value of that stock to <i>more</i> than double this year . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>But it has also changed the terms of the open source debate, something I have covered for a decade now, and thus the entire tech marketplace.Thanks to the Supreme Court non-decision that allows Application Program Interfaces, or APIs, the directions for connecting to software, to be protected by copyright, the AWS cloud is now proprietary.But nobody cares.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It had long been <b>believed</b> by technologists that open source OpenStack would replace public cloud with a private-public `` hybrid '' where enterprises avoided lock-in .  (Uncertainty) </span>But General Electric 's ( NYSE : GE ) announcement a few months ago that it will go `` all-in '' with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and start closing data centers has changed the rules of the game . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Suddenly , moves like Wal-Mart 's ( NYSE : WMT ) to `` open source '' its OneOps code in order to let companies avoid <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> lock-in <b>appear</b> futile , and its request that companies help it build another open source cloud stack is drawing guffaws from technology writers who a year ago were cheering any effort to evade <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's dominance . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>As open source guru Tim O'Reilly noted recently, "there's ideological open and there's pragmatic open."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Cheap , accessible <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> represents pragmatic open , and that <b>may</b> well be open enough . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Not everyone is yet willing to cede control of the future to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's cheap cloud . Because Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) has a cheap cloud, and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is not throwing up a white flag either.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Companies that <b>depend</b> on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's cloud while competing with it in other areas , like Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) , are desperate to keep the door open for alternatives . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>This is why Netflix has released its own open source tool, Spinnaker.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The idea is that customers should be able to simultaneously manage workloads on Google and Microsoft Azure even as they remain <b>dependent</b> on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>I 'm with you , but I have one foot out the door , is the message , even if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has a firm hold on the other foot . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For those who do n't understand why the value of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stock has doubled , <b>maybe</b> this discussion of open source politics can demonstrate the point . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's aggressive $ 1 billion/quarter CapEx spend , and regular price cuts , succeeded in giving its cloud a dominant position against companies that other pieces of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> - the store and the media operation - also compete against . It is becoming increasingly clear to technologists that resistance to this trend is futile , that even the largest tech companies must find a way to live in an <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> world , rather than fight it . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And this is probably the biggest business story of the year , <b>maybe</b> of the decade .  (Uncertainty) </span>Because if even open source has surrendered to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's API , there 's no one to stand in its way . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
