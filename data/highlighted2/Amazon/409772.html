I see no evidence that iCloud today is even as robust as AWS was then, and I am seeing the same kinds of outages today that plagued AWS back in the day.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This tells me that Apple is years behind on its cloud investment , if it is going to create the kinds of revenue streams analysts are <b>hoping</b> for , and if it expects to control that business , rather than doing what Netflix does and pass it on to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( which will then offer its own services in direct competition ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Apple is holding its annual Worldwide Developer Conference next week, and a new version of iOS is reportedly in the works, as well as refreshing App Store services and software.But if these are not backed up by heavy investment in cloud, to the tune of billions of dollars every quarter, I can't see increasing my present Apple position, and if the stock crawls over $100 again I am selling.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Personal Computers</div></body></html>
