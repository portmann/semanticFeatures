longer we are in the investment business the more skeptical we become about the investment crowds ability to identify which innovative companies are truly disrupting competing companies Last week August a sharp correction occurred in the prices of television and other media stocks seemingly based on concerns that Netflix NASDAQ NFLX and other internetbased streaming services would kill the TV business As longduration common stock pickers who hold media securities we got thinking about longterm changes in media We wondered if the Buggles were right when they debuted on MTV in proclaiming that Video Killed the Radio Star From a security selection process standpoint can you predict ahead of time which innovations permanently damage existing moats Are companies like Netflix and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN going to wipe out the formats which preceded them and completely ruin the competitive position of formerly profitable businesses How do common stocks which the crowd deems out of favor perform compared to the companies which appear to have the brightest futures I heard you on my wireless back in Lyin awake intent on tuning in on you In when they heard a song on the wireless television was becoming the hot new technology Radio was all the rage in the s s and s By the s however radiorelated stocks were severely threatened as Texaco and Colgate sponsored variety television shows with hosts like Milton Berle Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis The problem with theorizing that video would kill the radio star is exposed in the following line in the song Those who were bearish on the radio business forgot that you cant watch TV in your car and its hard in many other venues to watch anything Instead in the s s and s you listened Radio continued to be in my mind and in my car Recently Sirius NASDAQ SIRI Pandora NYSE P and other competitors have invaded the space of advertisingbased radio stations Those who assumed the death of the radio business in as MTV got incredibly popular ended up missing out on additional decades of profitability The next phase of competition threatened the TV business itself In the mids the VCR and cable access became available This appeared to threaten the advertisingbased franchise of TV networks like CBS Corp NYSE CBS and NBC After all who likes to watch commercials and who doesnt like a large and growing choice of what to watch These forces legitimately weakened the moat of the TV networks The three main broadcast networks had a blessed oligopoly for about three decades Even at todays lowered prices CBS has a billion stock market capitalization and it more than doubled its earnings from to Now Netflix comes and investors are afraid that it is going to take over the entire TV entertainment industry Here is how Charlie Ergen the CEO of Dish Network NASDAQ DISH described the situation to Wall Street Journal writer Joe Flint in an August piece entitled Cord Cutting Weighs on Pay TV Netflix is the most powerful content aggregator in the world today and theres nobody thats even close Dish Chief Executive Charlie Ergen said Wednesday on the companys earnings call He said kids are happy to watch SpongeBob from and thats just as fresh to them as SpongeBob from So the world has changed Rewritten by machine on new technology And now I understand the supernova scene Today year old Americans represent our largest population group and are the first generation to be entirely internet savvy It only makes sense that investors would favor technology rewritten by machine on new technology over content creation and traditional choices They see themselves as part of the supernova scene In an overgeneralized way having millions of unmarried twentysomethings is a dream for the Netflix Amazons Apples and Facebooks of the world Folks between and years old predominately live in historically overpriced apartments spend money on restaurants Chipotle NYSE CMG Shake Shack NYSE SHAK Panera Bread NASDAQ PNRA drink craft beer pay for cell serviceinternet access and watch a limited amount of TV via Netflix to save money Every generations modus operandi leads them to think that they wont do what the prior generations did Dont worry The Buggles covered that as well Once the millennials marry and have kids once we get to meet your children it should be amazing how the millennial spending patterns will change and formerly unattractive activities become mainstream to them When you marry have kids and buy a house life changes dramatically Our guess is that the average millennial couple will have Netflix cable a DVR watch local TV news read locally written newscommentary and access a great deal of it on their wireless devices Remember the radio stations and TV networks lost market share along the way but enjoyed a doubling of the population from the end of World War II to today Regardless of which distribution method is used entertaining content is always what allows most media companies to survive and prosper I recently asked the CFO of then Gannett and now Tegna NYSE TGNA Victoria Harker what they needed to do to succeed in the next ten to twenty years Her answer was We need to create great content Mr Flints Wall Journal Street article quoted Nomura Securities on the subject What the market is saying is that these are uncertain times because we are transitioning from one form of distribution to another said Nomura Securities analyst Anthony DiClemente But over the long term he said media companies that create the best content will remain providers of a scarce resource and therefore will maintain their place of value in the ecosystem We think DiClemente hits the nail on the head Its less about the distribution and more about content creation This matters because most investors seem much more concerned with distribution as evidenced by the PE multiples of the supernova media companies Historical studies like the one on the left show that video isnt likely to kill the radio star instead it shows that cheap stocks outperform average and expensive ones The lowest PE stocks on the left had the highest average appreciation and the high PE ones had the lowest Plus the dividends were significantly higher among outoffavor lowPE stocks As we like to say valuation matters dearly In conclusion sometimes new technology does kill a business Automobiles did kill horsedrawn buggies by replacing them between and Electronic photography did to the camera and film business as autos did to oats and hay While we think The Buggles proclamation made for great content we dont think their prediction played out in a way that was helpful to longduration common stock investors Based on PE ratios there might be more money made betting on millennial adoption of some of the traditional ways of life and technologies than there is paying nosebleed multiples for Netflix As contrarians we find this compelling Two events in the last year highlight the staying power of premium content provided by traditional television distribution First CBS secured the rights to Thursday Night Football from the NFL Network and saw the audience numbers soar in the NFL season Second the first Republican debate for the Presidential election cycle drew the secondlargest audience in the history of cable television Historical statistics and human observation would argue that after the recent stock price weakness cable access network television and their local affiliates are attractively priced and are subject to low expectations They also provide content that they control and that remains highly valued by millions of customers Maybe the aging of the millennials and the blossoming of families will grow their customer base in the next
