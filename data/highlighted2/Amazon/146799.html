Folks between 22 and 35 years old predominately live in historically overpriced apartments, spend money on restaurants (Chipotle (NYSE: CMG ), Shake Shack (NYSE: SHAK ), Panera Bread (NASDAQ: PNRA )), drink craft beer, pay for cell service/internet access and watch a limited amount of TV via Netflix to save money.Every generation's modus operandi leads them to think that they won't do what the prior generations did.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Do n't <b>worry</b> , The Buggles covered that as well : Once the millennials marry and have kids , once we get to meet `` your children , '' it should be <b>amazing</b> how the millennial spending patterns will change and formerly unattractive activities become mainstream to them .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>When you marry, have kids and buy a house, life changes dramatically.Our guess is that the average millennial couple will have Netflix, cable, a DVR, watch local TV news, read locally written news/commentary and access a great deal of it on their wireless devices.Remember, the radio stations and TV networks lost market share along the way, but enjoyed a doubling of the population from the end of World War II to today.Regardless of which distribution method is used, entertaining content is always what allows most media companies to survive and prosper.I recently asked the CFO of then Gannett and now Tegna (NYSE: TGNA ), Victoria Harker, what they needed to do to succeed in the next ten to twenty years.Her answer was, "We need to create great content!"<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Mr. Flint 's Wall Journal Street article quoted Nomura Securities on the subject : ` What the market is saying is that these are <b>uncertain</b> times because we are transitioning from one form of distribution to another , ' said Nomura Securities analyst Anthony DiClemente .  (Uncertainty) </span>But over the long term, he said, media companies that create the best content will remain 'providers of a scarce resource,' and therefore will maintain their place of value in the ecosystem.We think DiClemente hits the nail on the head.It's less about the distribution and more about content creation.This matters because most investors seem much more concerned with distribution, as evidenced by the P/E multiples of the "supernova" media companies.Historical studies, like the one on the left, show that video isn't likely to kill the radio star; instead, it shows that cheap stocks outperform average and expensive ones.The lowest P/E stocks on the left had the highest average appreciation, and the high P/E ones had the lowest.Plus, the dividends were significantly higher among "out-of-favor" low-P/E stocks.As we like to say, valuation matters dearly!<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In conclusion , <b>sometimes</b> new technology does kill a business .  (Uncertainty) </span>Automobiles did kill horse-drawn buggies by replacing them between 1905 and 1925.Electronic photography did to the camera and film business, as autos did to oats and hay.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While we think The Buggles ' proclamation made for great content , we do n't think their <b>prediction</b> played out in a way that was helpful to long-duration common stock investors .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Based on P/E ratios , there <b>might</b> be more money made betting on millennial adoption of some of the traditional ways of life and technologies than there is paying nosebleed multiples for Netflix .  (Uncertainty) </span>As contrarians, we find this compelling.Two events in the last year highlight the staying power of premium content provided by traditional television distribution.First, CBS secured the rights to Thursday Night Football from the NFL Network and saw the audience numbers soar in the 2014 NFL season.Second, the first Republican debate for the 2016 Presidential election cycle drew the second-largest audience in the history of cable television.Historical statistics and human observation would argue that after the recent stock price weakness, cable access, network television and their local affiliates are attractively priced and are subject to low expectations.They also provide content that they control and that remains highly valued by millions of customers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> the aging of the millennials and the blossoming of families will grow their customer base in the next five years .
