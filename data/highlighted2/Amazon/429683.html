The importance of cloud based apps is not so much in Web apps that are accessed through a browser as in the services and support that cloud apps can provide to mobile apps in general.Everything from video and music streaming to Web based shopping relies on cloud apps.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As I 've pointed out , Apple currently <b>seems</b> to want to rely on partnerships with companies such as IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>The problem with this division of labor is that it deprives Apple's extensive base of developers (iOS, tvOS, macOS, watchOS), with tools for cloud apps that they can use in a frictionless, integrated way with the current Xcode tools for app development.Apple is missing a huge opportunity, and it's being perceived as falling behind.To Do 4: In past WWDC's, Apple has been creeping up on the enterprise web services business, by offering developers some useful tools, but stopping short of full cloud based apps.This year, Apple needs to go all in.Period.And the logical tool for this Open Swift.Open Swift gives Apple a tremendous opportunity to simultaneously create a robust enterprise web services business, as well as afford developers the best way to enhance the power and utility of mobile apps.My belief is that Apple created Open Swift with this in mind, and we'll see this come to fruition at WWDC.I wrote recently on the Watch's ultimate destination as a disruption of the smartphone , taking over many communications functions such as voice calling and messaging.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the context of where Google and Qualcomm ( NASDAQ : QCOM ) are going with connected smart watches , it 's clear that the trend is for <i>greater</i> standalone capability which includes an independent LTE connection for voice and data .  (Surprise) </span>I don't expect Apple to be at the bleeding edge, here.Apple will hang back and learn from the mistakes of the first movers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Also , the technology is still a little immature and <b>probably</b> does n't come up to Apple 's `` user experience '' standards .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But Apple needs to make the Watch <i>more</i> capable and independent , and the next version of watchOS can be expected to <b>anticipate</b> this .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To Do 5 : The key advances in Watch hardware will be a <i>faster</i> processor with <i>more</i> memory and storage , combined with standalone WiFi capability .  (Surprise) </span>This will allow the watch to perform messaging functions, as well as download apps without being tethered to an iPhone.I expect that the next watchOS will reflect these changes.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Apple needs to show the next watchOS at WWDC , although it 's <i>less</i> critical until a revised version of the Watch makes its <b>appearance</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It's part and parcel to the sorry state of the coverage of Apple that there is so much focus on trivialities such as whether Mac OS X will be rebranded macOS.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 'm just <b>assuming</b> it .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 'm also <b>assuming</b> that not much of interest will be shown for the new macOS itself .  (Uncertainty) </span>It would be nice if Apple would cease its idiotic stance on convergence and endow macOS devices with a touch screen, but I don't see that happening, and I don't consider it critical.It would be a nice to have.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I consider all five of the to-dos to be must haves , and lack of progress in a combination of these areas <b>may</b> be cause for me to reevaluate my rating of the stock .  (Uncertainty) </span>The absolutely critical areas are the ones I've identified above: iOS multitasking for iPhone, and significant progress in Siri and search.Failing to make progress in these areas in and of themselves will trigger a reevaluation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , I 'm <b>optimistic</b> that we 'll see good progress in these and other areas and remain long Apple .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I continue to recommend it as a buy for investors with 3-5 year investment horizons ( <b>pending</b> the outcome of WWDC ) .
