class='textDiv'>Amazons AWS The Myth Of Scale And FirstMover Advantage Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN recently joined the billion club ie Amazons market capitalization exceeded billion Moreover the stock price has been on a bit of a tear since July of this year Much of the dare I say euphoria seems to surround Amazons cloud computing offering <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services AWS In particular AWS is seen as the disruptor in one of the most profitable areas of information technology namely Enterprise IT Now AWS has plenty of competition in this space Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT IBM NYSE IBM Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Oracle NYSE ORCL to an extent plus regional champions However there is an AWS devourer of worlds argument made by proponents that roughly revolves around AWS having huge scale and a massive firstmover advantage To quote from a slightly dated article at Enterprise Tech James Hamilton vice president and distinguished engineer for AWS has revealed the size and scope of the AWS cloud just to remind everyone that it has first mover advantage and that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is absolutely committed to building out this business and the infrastructure that supports it Scale is perhaps the most important thing and no one needs to teach an online retailer like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>anything about that With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>there is very little talk of public cloud and that is because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>believes that by its nature cloud means it cannot be private Over the long haul <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>believes the massive scale of the public cloud will mean that very few organizations will run their own datacenters The article further points out that Every day AWS installs enough server infrastructure to host the entire <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>etailing business from back in when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the retailer was onetenth its current size at billion in annual revenue Heres the server math <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has regions around the globe where it has datacenter capacity Each of those regions have at least two availability zones with a total of availability zones across all of the regions This includes the new region that was launched in Frankfurt Germany two weeks ago These availability zones provide isolation and redundancy at a local level for workloads like a kind of fault tolerant system akin to Tandem or Stratus only at a datacenter and services level than by literally lockstepping bits as they move through two systems Each availability zone has at least one datacenter and some have as many as six datacenters In January at reInvent Hamilton said that the US East region had more than ten datacenters all by itself but in his presentation at reInvent he said that no zone had more than six datacenters The idea is that customers architect their applications to run across different availability zones for local data protection and then across multiple regions for an even higher level of availability <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>scales up the capacity in each availability zone by adding whole new datacenters That sounds pretty sobering as far as competitors are concerned However there is a flaw in this whole line of reasoning which is often made in discussions of scale as a source of competitive advantage Namely scale as a competitive advantage is usually a local phenomenon for example WalMarts NYSE WMT US scale doesnt give it much of an edge in say Australia The rest of this article elaborates on this in the context of AWS in Europe and certain data residency laws similar remarks also apply to issues of latency data gravity etc but in order to keep things simple I will not discuss these here AWS is hosted in multiple locations in the world ie there are multiple data centers that run the workloads and store the data that you put on AWS When you deploy services on AWS you must choose a region on which to host The regions are completely isolated from each other and can only communicate via the internet this has implications for inputoutput costs but that is also a discussion for another time A full list of currently available regions can be found here For the purposes of this article the key thing to note is that there are two regions in Europe and the corresponding data centers are located in Frankfurt Germany and Dublin Ireland Since this is important let me belabor the point The only European countries that AWS currently has data centers in are Ireland and Germany Of course this doesnt mean that if you are in Europe you have to be in these countries to use AWS All it means is that these are the countries in which your computing resources and data will be sitting However do note as quoted above AWS expects customers who need maximum resiliency to achieve this by running applications in several regions In most countries the US and European countries in particular there are extremely stringent laws regarding where data originating in said countries may be stored This is particularly relevant to the sort of data that financial services firms telecoms and health services deal with or even say employee records for an arbitrary firm In many countries data simply cant move legally beyond their borders other countries require strict assurances for privacy and data governance What this means is that if you are a financial services firm or a telecom or a retailer or a in the UK or the Netherlands or France or and are looking to move a computing workload that handles sensitive data to the cloud then AWS isnt even an option Doesnt matter how much capacity AWS has is adding etc Remember in Europe the only datacenters that AWS currently has are in Ireland and Germany lets even ignore the fact that all AWS services arent available in every region Now certainly AWS can add and has plans to add data centers to address this issue However the point is In this regard AWS simply does not have a firstmover advantage in many countries compare AWS footprint with that of Microsoft Google and IBM The total scale of AWS is irrelevant with regards to resources that are subject to local considerations such as data residency and privacy laws Of course one can point out that there are plenty of areas where these sort of data residency issues are not a problem However let me point out that at least anecdotally financial services telecoms etc are where the largest profit pools in Enterprise IT lie Let me further point out that this is the sort of problem that isnt solved by simply opening a new data center in a country Lets take Germany as an example AWS now has datacenters in Frankfurt So one would imagine that this makes it easy for a financial services firm in Germany to use AWS for sensitive workloads Unfortunately this is simply not true The key words are resilience and auditability As mentioned earlier AWS expects customers to architect maximum resiliency by running applications in multiple regions This is a complete nogo as far as sensitive data goes In fact even for nonsensitive data there are practical issues with replicating data but that is a bit tangential from the main thrust of the current article Auditability at risk of over simplifying refers to what you as a financial services firm in Germany say tell your regulator when they come knocking and ask you where your regulated data is stored who has access to it etc Naively it would seem that simply pointing out that all your sensitive stuff is sitting in AWS Frankfurt region would be sufficient However reality is different There is a difference between pointing to AWS or any other cloud provider and knowing the precise location and access to the data rack unit network port server network interface controller etc A certain level of granular transparency is required which AWS does not at least at the moment provide As I alluded to earlier these sort of local considerations dont just apply to data residency laws They also apply to issues of network latency and the like we dont yet know how to circumvent the limitations imposed by the speed of light Furthermore these local considerations arent just with respect to geography and physical location For instance AWS provides a one size fits all model for IT infrastructure regardless of what a specific organizations needs may be This has large implications for performance For example the entire architecture of AWS is born from the lessons <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>learnt from the needs of its retail operation This is not necessarily optimal or even good enough for other uses In other words AWS scale and firstmover advantage is not as large as might seem at first glance In many areas it is even nonexistent We only use your contact details to
