(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The stock is up nearly 6.5 % since then , but the S&P index is up <b>almost</b> 16 % during the same period .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The trend since the start of the year has been almost straight down - a loss of 13 % taking <b>nearly</b> $ 40 billion off the market cap .  (Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft next reports earnings on April 23, with the " whisper number " of 52 cents/share in earnings coming in well below the 68 cents per share earned for the same quarter last year.Expectations, in short, are muted.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Is an upside <b>surprise</b> <b>possible</b> ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's <i>more</i> likely a downside one .  (Surprise) </span>The company's problems are easy to see.Just go looking at PCs.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Most PCs running Windows these days retail at $ 500 , and you can get many for <i>less</i> .  (Surprise) </span>When it comes to retail pricing, Microsoft is presently in a race to the bottom of the pricing pyramid with the Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) Chromebook.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Its best <b>hope</b> for getting its average selling price up is the Surface Pro 3 - a $ 1,000 machine it has manufactured itself that has drawn decent reviews , but has n't exactly drawn a flood of buyers .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In contrast , Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) just announced its latest MacBook at $ 1,300 , and its desktop units can cost $ 2,000 or <i>more</i> , give or take .  (Surprise) </span>Apple can barely keep these models in stock, while the dirt-cheap Microsoft product languishes on the shelves.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Microsoft has some <b>hope</b> for Windows 10 , but that is still in public beta , and wo n't be officially released until the middle of the year .  (Uncertainty) </span>As a show of just how far behind the company has fallen, Microsoft has promised free upgrades for a year to owners of Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 machines.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This means any financial benefits from the launch wo n't show up until the third quarter , and it 's <i>more</i> likely any big money wo n't come in for another year after that .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's also <b>possible</b> it wo n't come in at all .  (Uncertainty) </span>Note that the future of the Windows Phone line is also tied to Windows 10 - the desktop and phone operating systems will be the same.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft 's Azure cloud is doing fairly well , but while the company claims to bring in <i>more</i> revenue on it than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) does on its AWS cloud , it 's an apples-to-oranges comparison , since Microsoft is comparing software revenue to pure cloud infrastructure . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The product roadmap for 2015 is littered with upgrades to existing software and a serious effort to work with open source , which <b>could</b> include an open source version of Windows itself .  (Uncertainty) </span>Again, great for customers, great for users - not so great for the vendor.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Microsoft is moving its enterprise development to the cloud , and this <b>could</b> hit IBM Corp. ( NYSE : IBM ) hard - but it wo n't mean a big increase in revenues .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Its Xbox is still a hit , but gaming too is moving to the cloud - even the day of the big game machine <b>may</b> be over .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Microsoft keeps showing it knows 3D , and HoloLens <b>could</b> finally take the technology mainstream - but again , do n't expect bottom line results until 2016 , at the earliest .  (Uncertainty) </span>All of which makes 2015 a year of transition for Microsoft.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Negative <b>surprises</b> are <i>more</i> likely than positive ones .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It went into the year with Windows and Office , and it <b>may</b> come out with games , HoloLens and Cloud .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The success of all the new stuff is <b>speculative</b> , however , and the losses are baked into the cake .  (Uncertainty) </span>If you want to sit on your Microsoft position and wait for the future, you're welcome to it.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But I think you 're much <i>better</i> off in tech companies that are winning right now .
