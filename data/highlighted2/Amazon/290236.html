With Orange, we have no idea what it means because we only know where the numbers were at that time.Now keep that in mind when I tell you this.The data also showed most of the viewership for these shows came in its first week and then declined in subsequent weeks.To give you an example, Master of None drew 11% of audiences in week one and dropped to 8% in week two.Narcos started at 17% and then slipped to 4%.The other number that jumped out was that of those stats (for Netflix) during prime time, only 20% of people in the 18-34 demo were streaming Netflix, whereas 46% preferred watching traditional TV.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The point NBC is trying to make is that people are binge-watching and then moving on , whereas people consistently come back to its programming every week which makes them ( in some areas ) a <i>more</i> valuable investment .  (Surprise) </span>Reaction so far has been mixed.On one hand, this is the information people have been clamoring for, but on the other, it's incomplete, and we haven't heard anything from Netflix (at the time of this posting).People are also a little freaked out that this data came from audio signals gathered from our phones (again though voluntary gathered).Yet, looking at the numbers, you can see why NBC is so giddy to share them.If Netflix's shows don't reach over 5 million viewers an episode, then that means as NBC President of Research & Development Alan Wurtzel said "the reports of our death have been greatly exaggerated."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In other words , Netflix , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Hulu are not stealing as many viewers as once <b>believed</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>He went on to say "the notion that the broadcast model is broken or dying - it really isn't."He's right and wrong.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>He 's right in that 5 million viewers is n't going to <b>scare</b> anyone , but he 's wrong in that 5 million viewers is still <i>more</i> than the amount of people who watched the fledging NBC comedy Telenovela last Monday night ( 3.61 million to be exact ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As Vox.com pointed out 5 million is also <i>more</i> than the amount of viewers Parks & Recreation had for its series finale ( 4.71 million ) .  (Surprise) </span>What Wurtzel and NBC are trying to do is dispel the notion that streaming services are going to take over the world.Instead he's trying to show they are a partner that can work with the networks.This isn't a "either/or" situation (unless you want it to be).It's essentially similar to subscribing to HBO, but instead of watching it through your cable provider, you are watching it through your Internet provider.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>All of that <b>seems</b> to get lost in the shuffle because NFLX held back information which only made us want it <i>more</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Realistically though, did anyone really think Netflix was pulling in 15 or 20 million viewers on average for its shows?I mean this shouldn't have been a big shock.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The numbers revealed are actually very respectable , and in many cases , <i>higher</i> than what a cable network or premium network earns for its programming .  (Surprise) </span>It's not easy to launch a network, and Netflix has helped create a business model that works, and in some ways, that is backed up by this data.The truth is though that despite the curtain being lifted a little bit, nothing is going to change.Netflix's shows are still very high quality, and they are still going to get buzz, and they are still going too nominated for awards.As a result, they are still going to get subscriptions.What I'm interested to see is how Netflix will respond.Remember, NFLX also gets a turn at TCA, and that day comes on Saturday.You can bet these numbers will come up and you can bet the company will have answers.</div></body></html>
