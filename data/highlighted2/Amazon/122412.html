(Uncertainty) </span>That�s an ambitious plan � one that will require both focus and execution and some partnerships to pull off and a plan to slay offline payments .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> even some partnerships that start with another F word Financial Institutions .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As an independent network now , partnering with FIs to issue PayPal accounts <b>could</b> be one of the sources of value that PayPal can now unlock .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Doing so <b>could</b> not only give PayPal the chance to add <i>more</i> PayPal users to its roster , but also enable FIs to drive top of wallet position with a digital player that has <i>more</i> acceptance than anyone else online and via mobile and one that also plays on a global stage today .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Engagement and experience is critical to getting consumers on board.And, the fastest way to a merchant�s heart is to bring them lots and lots of consumers bearing digital-enabled accounts.Much has been made of the merchant-friendliness (or unfriendliness) of all of the payments schemes in market today � plastic or digital, PayPal included.Merchants have been said to push back on new payments schemes because they cost too much or they don�t deliver access to enough of the right data or they cede control of the consumer relationship.At the end of the day, the payments scheme that merchants find most merchant-friendly is the one that brings customers through their doors because it�s how consumers want to pay them.Of course, merchants push back when presented with new ways to pay.It�s often non-trivial to enable something new � big merchants have lot of things to integrate with and small merchants have constrained resources.Today, when merchants push back on new things, it�s often because they�re not convinced that there�s enough consumer demand if they go to the trouble of changing their systems to accommodate it.That�s why, today, offline, the dominant payments scheme is still the network-branded plastic card.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Of course , Apple Pay and Android Pay are betting that there will be enough EMV and NFC terminal refreshes to drive usage of their payment schemes <i>longer</i> term .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And if that was all that had to happen , maybe in a couple of years , they <b>might</b> be right .  (Uncertainty) </span>But, there�d also have to be enough consumers with enough of the right devices using them at those stores to tip the engagement and frequency scales.That�s where one has to step back and map the next three to five years carefully to see how the consumer�s use of the device that every single one of them have all over the world � mobile phones and apps and access to the Internet � can enable a different offline experience � by doing it via an online experience.Will the economics of how these schemes come together influence that?On some level, but only because it will have to support and incent consumers to use it and use it consistently.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Access to data will enable a variety of new business models that can better link the economics of the experience to the <b>likelihood</b> of conversion .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And completion among all of these players will likely intensify as new initiatives emerge to embed payments in a host of financial services and commerce experiences , loyalty and incentive schemes are designed and launched , new merchant relationships are formed and <i>more</i> retail acceptance is pursued .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And as a <i>more</i> consistent payments experience is designed that helps consumers move with ease across all of the channels they use to shop and buy today .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And as I hinted at <i>earlier</i> , some interesting mashups form that <b>could</b> turn the notion of merchant-friendly as we are thinking of it today , on its head .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Of course, payments is a highly competitive space these days and aside from the card networks (for now) no one really has it made in the shade.Payments and financial services is a scale business that takes time � and money � to develop.And change that requires consumers and merchants to buy in.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And while mobile and the cloud have given innovators <i>more</i> opportunities to create options that <b>could</b> change merchant and consumer behavior , most of them won t since they ll never get to scale .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>So, that�s why � the harsh reality of being a public company and reporting results to Wall Street every 90 days notwithstanding � I don�t think that �Day 1� of PayPal as an independent payments company has them starting off behind the proverbial payments eight ball.In fact, the issue is whether they can use their newfound independence to increase their lead and keep everyone else way back as it has so far.You�ve heard my views on PayPal.Now here�s how a few executives � including one executive who used to run strategy for PayPal, the CEO of a partner company and a couple of competitors � in the payments business see it.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And , of course , we ll have PayPal at our Retail Reinvention summit in Chicago in two weeks to talk about all of this and <i>more</i> in one of their first public <b>appearances</b> since becoming a public company .
