class='textDiv'>The A B Cs Of PayPals Next Act PayPal Holdings Inc NASDAQPYPL Seeking Alpha Jul PM ET About PayPal Holdings Inc PYPL EBAY Includes AAPL AMZN BABA GOOG GOOGL by Karen Webster Back in PayPal was about percent of eBays total revenues Last week and the last time that both would report as a single company PayPal was just about half of eBays reported revenues The competitors that Id pop to the top of PayPals worry list arent Apple and Google and their Pay schemes but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Alipay Today is the day that Carl Icahn has been waiting for The day that PayPal NASDAQ PYPL begins trading as a company independent of the parent he said made it impossible to recognize and monetize the value that was buried beneath the eBay NASDAQ EBAY facade Back in the year the iPhone was introduced and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN and eBay were both celebrating their th birthdays PayPal was about percent of eBays total revenues By that had become just about a third and in it was reported to be percent Last week and the last time that both would report as a single company PayPal was just about half of eBays reported revenues Analysts estimate that eBay will have an billion revenue hit as a result of the split As a single entity eBay not only masked PayPals value it also masked eBays challenges in operating in an increasingly crowded and competitive space Much has been written about PayPals and eBays futures as separate companies Most seem to believe that eBay will be worse for wear given its struggle to hone in on a distinguishing strategy that will drive revenues and profit Thats not hard to imagine But most also share the belief that PayPal will face some tough headwinds too particularly as it goes up against two that most characterize as its strongest competitors Apple NASDAQ AAPL Pay and Android Pay PayPal will surely face headwinds everyone does and will as the digital payments landscape evolves and shakes out and a lot of formidable competition But the competitors that Id pop to the top of PayPals worry list arent Apple and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and their Pay schemes but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Alipay Why and why that matters I also think will be decided by a few key things Lets call them the A B Cs of digital payments dominance The payments problem to crack isnt offline where cards work well and just about everywhere in the developed world but online and via mobile where using card products is a real pain And there acceptance matters for the obvious reason consumer engagement and habituation something Ill get to later The data is pretty conclusive and you know it well Merchants are capitalizing on the consumers use of mobile and other connected devices to help them discover what they want to buy on the Web in apps and in other marketplaces But theyre missing out on converting those shoppers to buyers given the dreadful experience of filling out forms and entering payments information there And although everyone is chasing that space in a big way PayPal has a running head start in getting their button to appear on lots of merchant checkout pages According to PayPals investor deck you can find PayPal on percent of the largest US online retailers sites and nearly percent of those across Europe the Middle East and Africa On last weeks earnings call CEO Dan Schulman said that PayPal is also now on percent of top mobile apps PayPals Braintree also powers Pinterest buy buttons which enable acceptance in a marketplace that million visitors a month go to to draw inspiration from what others see and have bought so that they can buy too and a front door into a backdoor PayPal enablement on the sites of those merchants too All told PayPal says that its reach is something on the order of million merchants and developers with payment enabled apps including those who sell crossborder a market opportunity that PayPal says drove billion in volume last year Its hard to find another digital buy button that comes even close today I repeat not even close and that is so important for understanding just where PayPal is in the competitive race these days <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>off of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>isnt for sure Its trying really hard to persuade merchants to add the familiar pay with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>button to their merchant checkout pages too But lets face it not being off <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>hasnt exactly hurt them as a marketplace Amazons strategy has been to bring as many merchants and merchandise inside Amazons virtual walls as it possibly can and nearly percent of the items sold are in fact items from its marketplace merchants <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fresh pulls in grocery and food services companies off <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for purchase on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Pantry offers consumers a slew of brands theyd see on the aisles of their favorite grocers Of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>owns a few merchants itself including Zappos and Shopbop But you wont find the big Internet retailers with storefronts on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and you wont find <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>payment options on any of the big Internet retailers So for now at least <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>isnt close to competing with PayPal for acceptance Alipay is another story It is a bigger better version of PayPal but really mainly in China and for the Chinese Now its focused on garnering acceptance off Alibaba NYSE BABA where merchants remain willing and able to welcome those million Alipay users who use their mobile devices to shop and buy Of course getting Alipay users initially was a bit like shooting fish in a barrel there were no other alternatives for the Chinese consumer to use online Thats why many merchants believe that the quickest path to incremental value is to open their doors to the Chinese consumer with an Alipay account who want to buy off Alibaba often from a luxury brand But for Alipay the acceptance game isnt just about retail and shopping its about much more like sending money to another person and paying bills and acceptance that enables engagement habituation and preference But face it Alipay is a long way from getting nonChinese consumers outside of China to use Alipay and from getting big nonChinese retailers who want to sell outside of China signed up Which is a nice segue into the second thing that matters a whole lot when playing the digital payments game Its easy to pigeonhole PayPal as just a buy button on a checkout page which is of course one of its primary functions and how it started PayPal CEO Dan Schulman describes PayPal as the company that he believes will democratize the movement of money between people and businesses The recent acquisition of Xoom punctuates that statement pretty well Xoom is a way for US consumers to send money outside of the US to important receive markets where they can use PayPal to receive money but also oh by the way now buy stuff using the mobile devices that are pervasive in those markets Xoom becomes a convenient way to establish a user base in those markets markets like India China the Philippines Mexico all now easily PayPalenabled But before that PayPal had invested in any number of services companies and capabilities designed to make PayPal more interesting for consumers and also more valuable to merchants small and large PayPal Credit built off of its Bill Me Later acquisition in offers transactional credit on purchases of or more giving both consumers and merchants a tool to increase sales Working Capital provides credit for merchants based on receivables and PayPal Here is its Squarelike solution which offers SMBs all of the bakedin value of PayPals retail services portfolio Buyer protection raises the comfort level of consumers that theyre protected if something goes wrong Offers and loyalty programs automatically linked to checkout at participating merchants makes it easier for consumers to redeem offers that sync with their buying habits and preferences Braintrees payment enablement and gateway services offer an easy way for developers to payment enable their apps including enabling Apple Pay its recent expansion of OneTouch Checkout for online and mobile purchases reduces the number of steps involved in using PayPal to checkout <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a similar yet slightly different consumer and merchant portfolio a set of services for small businesses including a Squarelike competitor and access to working capital the ultimate in oneclick checkout and a loyalty program that is the envy of many a retailer Prime which offers free twoday shipping on qualifying purchases Alipay is part of Ant Financial which includes a variety of financial services targeted to consumers and businesses money market funds financial services and wealth management a micro lending platform and a bank Each has invested in creating a platform that goes well beyond the retail payments experience at checkout and neither is pinning their futures on preserving the existing checkout experience in the store Each believes that the opportunity to transform commerce is a function of using connected devices to transform the point of sale experience <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>through Dash buttons that turn washing machines into pointofsale devices yes I am obsessed with mine or PayPal via apps that enable a consumer to be checked into a store and be served with relevant offers to then checkout via that app or Alipay via the ability for a Chinese consumer to buy tickets from foreign merchants But that is just scratching the surface Todays consumer retail and financial services experience is a heterogeneous mix of devices channels and operating systems including at a single merchant or even a financial institution At the moment of course theres not a single payment method that enables a consistent experience across the various permutations of those devices channels operating systems and geographies much less a single provider who can enable that for a consumer And when a consumer mixes in anything crossborder it gets even more complicated Platformbased schemes are betting on the long game a long game that is about driving offline acceptance where consumers have to be persuaded that using a mobile wallet occasionally for now given lack of acceptance is less frictionfilled than pulling out a card and using it everywhere Mobile apps are part of their focus too but constrained by access to the specific devices and mobile software platforms that support them And the browser part of their roadmap is TBD a channel where the bulk of online commerce still happens today PayPal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Alipay both have placed their bets on the device the mobile phone and apps that enable them to play across any connected device and any channel today and tomorrow Each has invested in apps that work regardless of devices owned or operating systems downloaded and where friction runs rampant when trying to transact on a small screen Each of course is also paying attention to the long game offline enablement but playing that game a bit differently Their game seems to be about enabling a mobile device and an experience independent of technology and device at a merchant location Each is also solving for another C related merchant problem conversion At the moment the area of greatest concern for merchants is online conversion where cart abandonment is high PayPal and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>each have their pitch for why their button can help to fix that problem something <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>says shows a x conversion anytime their button is present and where PayPal is seeing its volume skyrocket Alipays conversion pitch is to merchants seeking to serve Chinese consumers without any other payment method available to them PayPals crossborder pitch to merchants and consumers is not just an easy way to pay and be paid but a way to break the logjam of dealing with an unknown merchant by offering buyer protection and payment only upon delivery Offline conversions are much trickier since thats a function of getting consumers into stores where once there the data says theyll buy This is where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>PayPal and Alipay each have their strategies to finetune but where Apple Pay and Android Pay face their own challenges with limited acceptance Well have to wait to see how PayPal with its acquisition of Paydiant solves for the offline conversion problem facing merchants And whether Amazons definition of offline isnt a physical retailer but the consumers home where pantries and closets and bathrooms and laundry rooms and home offices and family rooms become the physical places that consumers shop and have purchased items delivered to them a day or two later This is the one word that will separate the winners from the alsorans in the race for digital dominance and where PayPal has the most work to do Schulman acknowledged as much last week when he said that his goal and that of PayPals entire team is to get consumers who use PayPal two or three times a month to use it two or three times a week Acceptance is a start But as weve seen with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>which is only accepted on one place acceptance is a function of being in the places that consumers want to shop and do it a lot One of PayPals biggest hurdles in not having a lot of acceptance a few years back was the hassle of remembering the password each time a consumer wanted to use it Recovering a lost password was a major hassle That has since changed and OneTouch removes the friction once associated with checking out using PayPal Alipay solved the engagement and frequency puzzle by expanding the set of things that its users could do with an Alipay account pay bills shop offline pay for taxis and buy tickets invest and bank <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>solved the engagement problem by expanding the number of items that consumers can buy from them and becoming one of the first places if not the first place that consumers turn to when they have something they want to buy which in turn generated visits two or three times a week PayPals engagement strategy seems to be to go broad like Alipay eg financial services such as crossborder PP Xoom social PP Venmo SMB lending and retail credit services PayPal Working Capital and Credit and deep expanding the retail points of acceptance online and via mobile PayPal and Braintree and creating incentives for consumers to use it at checkout consumer credit PayPal Credit and offers and promotions PayPal Media Thats an ambitious plan one that will require both focus and execution and some partnerships to pull off and a plan to slay offline payments Maybe even some partnerships that start with another F word Financial Institutions As an independent network now partnering with FIs to issue PayPal accounts could be one of the sources of value that PayPal can now unlock Doing so could not only give PayPal the chance to add more PayPal users to its roster but also enable FIs to drive top of wallet position with a digital player that has more acceptance than anyone else online and via mobile and one that also plays on a global stage today Engagement and experience is critical to getting consumers on board And the fastest way to a merchants heart is to bring them lots and lots of consumers bearing digitalenabled accounts Much has been made of the merchantfriendliness or unfriendliness of all of the payments schemes in market today plastic or digital PayPal included Merchants have been said to push back on new payments schemes because they cost too much or they dont deliver access to enough of the right data or they cede control of the consumer relationship At the end of the day the payments scheme that merchants find most merchantfriendly is the one that brings customers through their doors because its how consumers want to pay them Of course merchants push back when presented with new ways to pay Its often nontrivial to enable something new big merchants have lot of things to integrate with and small merchants have constrained resources Today when merchants push back on new things its often because theyre not convinced that theres enough consumer demand if they go to the trouble of changing their systems to accommodate it Thats why today offline the dominant payments scheme is still the networkbranded plastic card Of course Apple Pay and Android Pay are betting that there will be enough EMV and NFC terminal refreshes to drive usage of their payment schemes longer term And if that was all that had to happen maybe in a couple of years they might be right But thered also have to be enough consumers with enough of the right devices using them at those stores to tip the engagement and frequency scales Thats where one has to step back and map the next three to five years carefully to see how the consumers use of the device that every single one of them have all over the world mobile phones and apps and access to the Internet can enable a different offline experience by doing it via an online experience Will the economics of how these schemes come together influence that On some level but only because it will have to support and incent consumers to use it and use it consistently Access to data will enable a variety of new business models that can better link the economics of the experience to the likelihood of conversion And completion among all of these players will likely intensify as new initiatives emerge to embed payments in a host of financial services and commerce experiences loyalty and incentive schemes are designed and launched new merchant relationships are formed and more retail acceptance is pursued And as a more consistent payments experience is designed that helps consumers move with ease across all of the channels they use to shop and buy today And as I hinted at earlier some interesting mashups form that could turn the notion of merchantfriendly as we are thinking of it today on its head Of course payments is a highly competitive space these days and aside from the card networks for now no one really has it made in the shade Payments and financial services is a scale business that takes time and money to develop And change that requires consumers and merchants to buy in And while mobile and the cloud have given innovators more opportunities to create options that could change merchant and consumer behavior most of them wont since theyll never get to scale So thats why the harsh reality of being a public company and reporting results to Wall Street every days notwithstanding I dont think that Day of PayPal as an independent payments company has them starting off behind the proverbial payments eight ball In fact the issue is whether they can use their newfound independence to increase their lead and keep everyone else way back as it has so far Youve heard my views on PayPal Now heres how a few executives including one executive who used to run strategy for PayPal the CEO of a partner company and a couple of competitors in the payments business see it And of course well have PayPal at our Retail Reinvention summit in Chicago in two weeks to talk about all of this and more in one of their first public appearances since becoming a
