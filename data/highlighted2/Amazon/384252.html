( NASDAQ : NFLX ) | Seeking Alpha We 've long held the belief that Netflix is nothing <i>more</i> than a content delivery platform , one of many to be exact .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Recent developments indicate that Netflix is becoming <i>more</i> like a traditional TV network .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the midst of this shift , the stock continues to be wrongly valued as a tech stock , which creates significant downside <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Shares of Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) plunged 12 % after-hours on Monday after its earnings report revealed <i>weaker</i> than expected subscriber growth .  (Surprise) </span>Most notably, domestic subscriber growth continued to slow.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> shockingly , at 2.5 million the company 's projections for its second quarter net subscribers additions are far below expectations ( 4 million ) .  (Surprise) </span>We think this news should break the spell that has kept investors blind of the poor economics and competitive position of Netflix.This stock remains highly overvalued.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Even if valued at a premium to its much <i>more</i> profitable traditional media peers , the best investors can <b>hope</b> for the stock is $ 58/share .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We think $ 30/share is the <i>more</i> likely eventuality .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is a simple law of business that any discretionary product appeals to <i>fewer</i> consumers when it becomes <i>more</i> expensive .  (Surprise) </span>How many customers do you think McDonalds (NYSE: MCD ) would lose if it raised prices by 11% across the board?It would be a lot, and Netflix is no different.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In our original Danger Zone call on Netflix in November of 2013 , we predicted that Netflix would have to raise prices in order to have any <b>hope</b> of generating cash flow and that raising prices would undermine customer growth .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Our November 2013 report provides historical precedence for how price hikes affect the company 's customer growth : Netflix `` shed <b>almost</b> 1 million subscribers in 2011 when it announced a new $ 16 price for streaming and DVD rental services , up from the previous amount of $ 10 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Customers in this space have many choices , and they will quickly and easily flock to a <i>lower</i> price option whenever needed . ''  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Investors should not be <b>surprised</b> that Netflix lowered guidance for subscriber growth for Q2 after announcing that many long-time users will face price increases starting in <b>May</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix raised the price for new subscribers from $ 7.99 to $ 9.99 / month two years ago , and now long-time users are being `` un-grandfathered '' and will have to pay the new , <i>higher</i> rate .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>These users have many <i>more</i> options for streaming video than they did in 2011 .  (Surprise) </span>For years, Netflix had one significant advantage over its streaming competitors: its massive library of movies and TV shows.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As Netflix has pushed <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> into original content recently , it can no longer afford that massive catalog of licensed content .  (Surprise) </span>Over the past two and a half years, its content library has shrunk by 32% .Figure 1 shows a data series we've graphed in multiple previous articles on Netflix.Before we discussed the massive increase in the company's content obligations.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Now , it 's notable that those obligations have increased <i>slower</i> than revenue in two out of the past three years ( 2013 and 2015 ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We also <b>predicted</b> that Netflix would have to move into producing <i>more</i> original content in order to justify charging customers <i>more</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We doubt few investors believed the company <b>could</b> ever generate enough cash flow to justify its valuation by charging consumers to see re-runs .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Unfortunately for Netflix , the <i>more</i> it shrinks its content library and raises its price , the <i>less</i> there is to distinguish it from the multitude of other streaming services flooding the market .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Investors should think of Netflix <i>less</i> like a high-flying tech company and <i>more</i> like a traditional video content provider , like CBS ( NYSE : CBS ) or Viacom ( NASDAQ : VIAB ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Both those companies have <b>roughly</b> double the revenue of Netflix , but CBS 's enterprise value is 24 % <i>lower</i> , and Viacom 's is 40 % <i>lower</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>At its core, Netflix is merely a content delivery platform - and one of many.From <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) video services to CBS All Access to HBO Go , Outerwall 's Red Box ( NASDAQ : OUTR ) and Dish Network 's Sling TV etc. . There is no shortage of competition in this space, and none of them stand out as offering anything that is really unique.Netflix is attempting to separate itself by creating original content only available to Netflix subscribers, but it is not the only player in that game.The first mover advantage in streaming video for Netflix has eroded rapidly.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It no <i>longer</i> looks like a singular entity in the on-demand video space .  (Surprise) </span>Instead, it's one of many players in an increasingly crowded field searching for eyeballs.It's still the leader, but where's the competitive advantage needed for pricing power?Figure 2 shows the striking valuation gap between Netflix and TV networks such as CBS, Viacom, and HBO parent Time Warner.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Despite having a similar return on invested capital ( ROIC ) , Netflix is valued with an Enterprise Value / Revenue ratio between 2-3 times <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>One <b>could</b> argue that NFLX deserves a premium over these other stocks due to its international growth opportunities and popularity among <i>younger</i> viewers .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Still, it's hard to justify the massive premium at 7.4.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> a generous 4x multiple to 2015 revenue , NFLX is worth $ 58 share .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We suggest the 4x multiple only for the sake of argument and do not <b>believe</b> the stock deserves a premium valuation to companies that actually generate significant free cash flow and have sustainable competitive advantages .  (Uncertainty) </span>Even with the post-earnings drop, Netflix has unreasonable profit growth expectations baked into its stock price.In order to justify a $98/share valuation, Netflix must grow after-tax profit ( NOPAT ) by 22% compounded annually for 18 years.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In this scenario , Netflix would need to maintain an average ROIC of 32 % , far <i>higher</i> than we 've ever seen from a media company .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A <i>more</i> realistic ROIC target would be for Netflix to hit 14 % , the same as Viacom , within the next decade .  (Surprise) </span>If the company can do that and grow NOPAT by 16% compounded annually for 10 years, the stock is worth $30/share.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even those expectations <b>could</b> be a serious challenge for a company that burned $ 1.6 billion in cash during its last fiscal year .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This stock has a lot of downside <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As the market grows <i>more</i> aware of the competition Netflix faces , it will become <i>harder</i> to sustain its sky-high valuation .  (Surprise) </span>Investors would be smart to take their profits while they can.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Time Is Running Out : Companies Can not Lose Money Forever It is hard to see how Netflix can differentiate itself enough from the competition to charge the <i>higher</i> prices it needs to generate the profits already embedded in its $ 98 stock price .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In fact , we <b>wonder</b> if Netflix can make any money and continue to maintain its new , <i>lower</i> customer growth goals .  (Surprise) </span>Per Figure 3, Netflix's cumulative free cash flow burn since 2003 is over $3.5 billion .<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If they have not been able to make money so far , what makes investors <b>believe</b> they will make <i>more</i> money in the future in an increasingly competitive market ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For how long , will the market tolerate these losses in the face of <i>slower</i> growth and <i>more</i> competition ?  (Surprise) </span>The bottom line here is that the Netflix business model is incapable of delivering the combination of revenue growth and cash flow implied by its valuation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Original content creation is expensive and <b>risky</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Most big networks and movie studies are owned by <i>larger</i> media conglomerates .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The strong cash flows and deep pockets of media conglomerates enable them to absorb losses when original content <b>risks</b> do n't pan out ( e.g. Disney 's John Carter ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix continues to burn cash, and it will be forced to keep leveraging its balance sheet or diluting existing investors to fund operations.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So far , Netflix has been able to pay employees with stock and take on <i>more</i> debt to fund its operations .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These funding sources could put the company at <b>risk</b> if the market turns against it .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix has $1.3 billion in employee stock option liabilities.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If the stock price starts to fall , all of a sudden those employees are making a lot <i>less</i> money , and Netflix <b>could</b> find itself with the same struggle to retain talent that crushed LinkedIn ( NYSE : LNKD ) and Twitter ( NYSE : TWTR ) recently .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We saw the market turn on Netflix today just from <b>disappointing</b> guidance numbers for subscribers .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We expect to see further <b>disappointment</b> on the subscriber growth front as Netflix tries to balance raising prices and fending off competition .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company becomes <i>more</i> competitively boxed in every day .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> recently announced it will offer its streaming video service as a standalone option for $ 8.99 / month , $ 1 <i>less</i> than Netflix . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>As <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> joins with Hulu to pressure Netflix on the low-cost side , HBO remains an imposing threat on the premium side . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix content chief Ted Sarandos has said the company 's goal `` is to become HBO <i>faster</i> than HBO can become us . ''  (Surprise) </span>The difference?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix has 80 million subscribers , HBO has <b>nearly</b> 140 million .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix wants to go head to head in original streaming content against a network with <i>more</i> subscribers , <i>more</i> resources , and a much <i>longer</i> history of creating the original programming that keeps subscribers coming back for <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span>A recent survey found that 41% of Netflix subscribers say they won't accept any price increase.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That number is undoubtedly <i>higher</i> than the reality , but it speaks to the increasing price sensitivity and the difficulty Netflix will have in trying to raise prices and continue growing subscribers at the breakneck rate the market expects .
