nearby A dedicated searchable localized page for trading products is something that eBay has not yet implemented Aside from aggressively promoting hyperlocal advertising to its advertisers Facebook NASDAQ FB also wants to enable localization awareness for ordinary people to trade goods inside Facebook Facebook is currently testing a Buy Sell button in New Zealand and Australia This is a very important development because it could lead to a better version of eBay NASDAQ EBAY inside Facebooks web and mobile platforms As far as I know localization awareness is still not available to eBay sellers The desktop version of the Buy Sell Facebook page being tested shows only products for sale by vendors located within a certain city or municipality There is also a search engine box and like eBay items for sale are organized into different categories People who cant seem to sell their used or new items on eBay might eventually find Facebook a worthy alternative The experimental Buy Sell ButtonPage is a big improvement over the Sell Something feature that is available to Facebook Groups Trading new and used items on Facebook groups has no search ability and sellers are often located in faraway locations Consider this buy sell group that was created for trading cars and car accessories among residents of the City of Manila The lack of location awareness feature allowed vendors outside Manila Batangas and Laguna provinces to still post their items The technology and talent acquired by Facebook from purchasing product search engine specialist TheFind last March is obviously helping toward making Facebook a viable store for online shopping Marrying the product search technology of TheFind with Facebooks location awareness technology is a decisive move that could help Zuckerbergs company compete with eBay and other ecommerce portals Location awarenessenabled advertising is a cheaper and better alternative for small businesses to promote their people located near their area of business The same principle applies to Facebooks hyperlocalized version of trading goods online It has several advantages compared to eBays current business model Selling items on Facebooks Buy Sell platform is likely to be cheaper and faster than using eBay Since the buyer and seller are located near each other delivery costs of sold items is minimized A short minute drive to pickupdeliver an item sold through Facebook is superior to any day express courier delivery It is also possible for prospective buyers to personally inspect items through a facetoface meeting with a vendor Product return or refund is also easier done when the people are located within the same area Like eBay Facebook can monetize trades on its experimental Buy Sell Page service by charging business or professional sellers a small fee per item posted or sold Facebook can also allow users to use their local bank accounts and not just credit cards to buy Credits to buy physical goods Facebook Credits is losing steam because it is only being used to buy ingame items on social games Webbased gaming is on a big decline It is time for Facebook to enable its payments service to include processing online trading of actual products Testing a localized ecommerce platform is one more reason to go long on FB Facebook certainly has a far higher number of active and loyal users than eBay or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN has now Enabling billion people to quickly search buy and receive products from their friends neighbors and town mates is a believable future scenario Fasttracking the implementation of a localized Buy Sell platform in all countries could generate new revenue for Facebook Credits or a new digital wallet service Peertopeer buy and sell transactions should go hand in hand with digital payments The peertopeer Money transfer feature implemented on Facebook Messenger app is still free because it was deemed to be just another feature to improve user stickiness and as a means to show more ads to people FB investors will likely agree with me that digital wallets should be monetized through transaction fees and not through advertising Alpha Omega Mathematica also agrees with the Buy rating made by TipRanks analysts for Facebook Alpha Omega Mathematica still believes that Facebook can sustain its impressive growth in sales and net income Facebook has outpaced its peers Getting involved in ecommerce is another fuel that will help maintain or improve the growth of Facebook Disclosure I amwe are long FB
