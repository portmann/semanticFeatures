(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>As far as I know, localization awareness is still not available to eBay sellers.The desktop version of the Buy & Sell Facebook page being tested shows only products for sale by vendors located within a certain city or municipality.There is also a search engine box and, like eBay, items for sale are organized into different categories.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>People who ca n't seem to sell their used or new items on eBay <b>might</b> eventually find Facebook a worthy alternative .  (Uncertainty) </span>The experimental Buy & Sell Button/Page is a big improvement over the Sell Something feature that is available to Facebook Groups.Trading new and used items on Facebook groups has no search ability and sellers are often located in faraway locations.Consider this buy & sell group that was created for trading cars and car accessories among residents of the City of Manila.The lack of location awareness feature allowed vendors outside Manila (Batangas and Laguna provinces) to still post their items.The technology and talent acquired by Facebook from purchasing product search engine specialist, TheFind, last March is obviously helping toward making Facebook a viable store for online shopping.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Marrying the product search technology of TheFind with Facebook 's location awareness technology is a decisive move that <b>could</b> help Zuckerberg 's company compete with eBay and other e-commerce portals .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Location awareness-enabled advertising is a <i>cheaper</i> and <i>better</i> alternative for small businesses to promote their people located near their area of business .  (Surprise) </span>The same principle applies to Facebook's hyper-localized version of trading goods online.It has several advantages compared to eBay's current business model.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Selling items on Facebook 's Buy & Sell platform is likely to be <i>cheaper</i> and <i>faster</i> than using eBay .  (Surprise) </span>Since the buyer and seller are located near each other, delivery costs of sold items is minimized.A short 20-minute drive to pick-up/deliver an item sold through Facebook is superior to any 1-day express courier delivery.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is also <b>possible</b> for prospective buyers to personally inspect items through a face-to-face meeting with a vendor .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Product return or refund is also <i>easier</i> done when the people are located within the same area .  (Surprise) </span>Like eBay, Facebook can monetize trades on its experimental Buy & Sell Page service by charging business or professional sellers a small fee per item posted or sold.Facebook can also allow users to use their local bank accounts (and not just credit cards) to buy Credits to buy physical goods.Facebook Credits is losing steam because it is only being used to buy in-game items on social games.Web-based gaming is on a big decline.It is time for Facebook to enable its payments service to include processing online trading of actual products.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Testing a localized e-commerce platform is one <i>more</i> reason to go long on FB .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Facebook certainly has a far <i>higher</i> number of active ( and loyal users ) than eBay or <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) has now . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Enabling 1.49 billion people to quickly search , buy , and receive products from their friends , neighbors , and town mates is a <b>believable</b> future scenario .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Fast-tracking the implementation of a localized Buy & Sell platform in all countries <b>could</b> generate new revenue for Facebook Credits or a new digital wallet service .  (Uncertainty) </span>Peer-to-peer buy and sell transactions should go hand in hand with digital payments.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The peer-to-peer Money transfer feature implemented on Facebook Messenger app is still free because it was deemed to be `` just another feature to improve user stickiness and as a means to show <i>more</i> ads to people . ''  (Surprise) </span>FB investors will likely agree with me that digital wallets should be monetized through transaction fees - and not through advertising.Alpha Omega Mathematica also agrees with the Buy rating made by TipRanks analysts for Facebook.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Alpha Omega Mathematica still <b>believes</b> that Facebook can sustain its impressive growth in sales and net income .  (Uncertainty) </span>Facebook has outpaced its peers.Getting involved in e-commerce is another fuel that will help maintain or improve the growth of Facebook.Disclosure: I am/we are long FB.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .
