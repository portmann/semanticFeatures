(Amazon: Surprise) </span>FedEx's (NYSE: FDX ) CEO is in a dangerous state of denial and is missing the point.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , Uber ( Private : UBER ) , Lyft ( Private : LYFT ) and other customers and competitors <b>may</b> not be able to chip away much of FedEx 's sales this year . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>But that's not the point at all.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The point is that they will slowly but surely and with increasing speed and effect keep stealing FedEx 's most-lucrative routes and segments and aim at lowering delivery prices in order to negotiate <i>better</i> fees with FedEx .  (Surprise) </span>This will hurt FedEx's sales only a bit but it will absolutely destroy FedEx's margins.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>FedEx 's CEO <b>probably</b> thinks <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> wants to take over FedEx 's entire business whereas in reality <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> most likely just wants to destroy FedEx 's margins to save money and take the most lucrative business ( including its internal delivery business ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Naturally, United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS ) will be impacted as well.But new competition and margin pressure is not the only issue for FedEx.The current valuation of 15x forward non-GAAP adjusted earnings (that still ignores net debt) is a problem as well, especially in connection with the following factors: FedEx operates in an oligopoly with UPS and USPS in the U.S. and with DHL internationally.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After the <b>pending</b> TNT Express ( OTCPK : TNTEF ) acquisition , its external growth opportunities will be very limited due to further mergers having a slim chance of being approved by antitrust regulators .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So , the top-line growth is most <b>probably</b> peaking and there are very few new organic growth opportunities at the high ROI that FedEx 's current business generates .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Margins are most <b>probably</b> peaking as well .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Profits have been rising much <i>faster</i> than top-line growth partly due to cost cutting .  (Surprise) </span>This margin expansion trend is clearly unsustainable.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>FedEx currently operates very close to the highest margins of the past decade and we are arguably , significantly <i>closer</i> to the top of the business cycle than to its bottom .  (Surprise) </span>FedEx is a very capital-intensive business with high-fixed costs.It even touts this as their major advantage.I see it as a weakness if the industry starts changing.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>FedEx 's CEO correctly argues that no customer accounts for <i>more</i> than 3 % of its sales , and it will take time and money for competitors to make a major dent in sales .  (Surprise) </span>But what the CEO is missing to mention is that even a small drop in sales will have an outsized impact on operating profits, due to the high operating leverage that works both ways as well as because of the negative product margin mix when the company loses the most lucrative business first.Given the cyclicality, strong operational leverage and at least some financial leverage - FedEx also is an excellent hedge of a long U.S. stock portfolio against a potential U.S. and global slowdown.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In short , FedEx is a good short candidate in the long run , but <b>may</b> see some strength for one or two <i>more</i> quarters .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even FedEx 's CEO boasts of the high margins and advertises them to the entire world in case some competitor or customer missed the fact : `` If we were to isolate our e-commerce business one <b>could</b> argue that FedEx is one of the most profitable e-commerce companies in business today . ''  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This boasting about high margins is bound to keep motivating <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and other FedEx customers to build small , flexible networks of their own to service their most lucrative deliveries and put pressure on FedEx to negotiate <i>better</i> rates . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>History is littered with lessons of CEOs underestimating competitors and the industry's potential fast-paced change.FedEx's CEO sees his industry in the narrow definition of competitors, considering only the big three that control 95% of the U.S. shipments, failing to see new entrants and, most importantly, to see its own customers as its competitors.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>So , while I agree with FedEx 's CEO that it would take time and money to seriously take on FedEx , I <b>believe</b> the negative effects on FedEx will be <i>stronger</i> than what the CEO and the markets expect , and they also will happen <i>sooner</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I will debunk FedEx CEO's statement that it would take "way too much time and money" to take on FedEx.Time and money are totally irrelevant for some customers/competitors , such as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Here is why.First, money is not an issue.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We live ( whether I like it or not ) in an era of ZIRP and NIRP , where strong companies are flush with cash and are able to borrow even <i>more</i> - at <b>almost</b> no cost or issue - new shares at high valuations .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In this "funny money" era, a startup like Uber can grow from nothing to a $62B valuation in five years.Moreover , it is not without interest that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Jeff Bezos participated in one of the earliest Uber funding rounds through his Bezos Expeditions . I see a clear connection there with the current <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ventures into FedEx 's territory via planes and drones . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As a side note , Uber 's current valuation is 30 % <i>higher</i> than FedEx 's .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When Uber 's valuation grows to $ 100B and Uber takes over FedEx with its stock , I <b>believe</b> that will be a clear sign of the peak of this bubble cycle , similar to AOL 's takeover by Time Warner 15 years ago , at the dot.com bubble peak .  (Uncertainty) </span>How much time would it take, really, to hurt FedEx?If you have the money and use a leasing business model instead of building or owning the infrastructure and the fleet, the time drastically contracts.Plus, markets are always forward-looking.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even if competitors start chipping away at FedEx 's most lucrative business very slowly , the markets will discount some of the erosion forward and this <b>could</b> mean weakness for FedEx 's stock as soon as the current earnings euphoria fizzles and as soon as the TNT revenues are reflected in the numbers in several quarters from now .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has always been focused on the long picture , so time does not matter for the company , as long as the investment makes sense in the very long run . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is known for taking a long-term view and not caring about margins at all in the short run . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>When <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> just masters to take care of a majority of its own deliveries , this would hurt FedEx only to the tune of <b>roughly</b> 3 % of sales and a bit <i>more</i> in margins . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>This sounds benign.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , what if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> drops the A-bomb and runs their delivery network at zero margins or even at a loss , significantly undercutting FedEx 's margins - either with the goal of attracting new clients at the beginning , or simply because their goal <b>may</b> not be to take over FedEx 's business , but to depress their margins to save on delivery costs paid to them ? (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Something akin to what Google is doing with its Fiber business.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Pushing existing providers to innovate and offer <i>better</i> and <i>cheaper</i> services .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A similar move <b>could</b> push down FedEx and UPS margins on a majority of their business , not just <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ~ 3 % business with FedEx . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Think about it.Is there a business that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> entered where margins have not dropped ? <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a poster example of zero-cost capital , a zero-margin model . This is going to destroy FedEx's (and UPS') high-margin, high-ROI model.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While FedEx owns most of its fleet , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is renting , making it much <i>more</i> flexible to scale up and down as needed . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>This is in line with the low-margin , low-risk , high scalability approach of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Unlike FedEx 's fat margins , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> operates practically close to breakeven , so they do n't provide such a strong incentive by competitors to take <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's share . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> FedEx 's CEO is downplaying the threats facing the company .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and other competitors will chip away at FedEx 's attractive high-margin business , naturally attacking the most lucrative routes and segments first and aiming to <i>lower</i> FedEx 's margins and their own costs . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The capital-intensive FedEx will slowly, but surely, underperform.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I 'm bearish on FedEx in the long run , though I see one or two <i>more</i> quarters of strong results which will likely drive the stock price <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise) </span>I 'm also bullish on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in the long run , but the price is stretched .
