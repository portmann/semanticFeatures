class='textDiv'>Why You Should Own Alibaba Alibaba Group Holding Limited NYSEBABA Seeking Alpha What makes Alibaba stand out as a profitability trailblazer in an industry plagued by nonexistent profit margins What are the three elements of their business that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would do well to learn from Alibaba NYSE BABA in many ways looks to be a mirror image of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN At the very least they seem to be inspired in the past by the company that took the retail market online Alibabas cloud computing service is another example The company did exactly what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>did turn a cost center into a profitmaking business In Amazons case that business now rivals its core retail business in terms of profitability Now however things seem to have turned around Amazons Dragon Boat idea of connecting sellers in one continent to buyers in another seems to be inspired by none other than Alibaba Moreover since Alibaba started putting together the pieces for crossborder trade <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can only stand by and watch as the Chinese profitability machine enters Amazons own domain of international sales But those seem to be the only parallels one can draw between the two companies Alibabas profitability alone sets it apart from any other major ecommerce or retail company in the world In Alibaba earned billion in sales with net profits touching billion thats almost one billion more in profits than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>which did nearly nine times Alibabas sales But one year of data does not a trend make Lets take a closer look at Alibabas operational efficiency and profitability to see if theyre really sustainable into the future Just a quick look at their profit margin numbers in the last few quarters makes you question if its an anomaly How can a company that earns most of its revenue from China alone be more profitable than retail stalwarts such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>WalMart NYSE WMT and eBay NASDAQ EBAY that have global footprints First of all Alibaba is a marketplace earning fees for connecting buyers to sellers online It does not buy products from manufacturers and then try and sell them to customers That one difference in their business model puts them in a category thats different from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and WalMart but not eBay Because Alibaba is primarily a commissionsbased business theyre able to shed much of the overhead burden that retailers and etailers are encumbered with Think of it in terms of a real estate agent versus a real estate seller The former connects the right buyer to seller processes the necessary paperwork closes the deal and pockets the commission Thats Alibaba and eBay On the other hand WalMart is similar to a real estate investor who buys homes finds buyers and does all the work so the buyer only has to sign on the dotted line and write the check <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does the same but they want to have it all They want to buy and sell their goods and be a broker to several third party sellers at the same time In terms of business models all three work and very well too Amazons billion and WalMarts billion in sales are testament to that However thats not where their profitability comes from What they keep in the end is a much smaller percentage than what Alibaba or even eBay keep as you saw in the operating profit comparative graph above The second key to profitability is the way Alibaba handles its logistics and lastmile delivery Contrary to what most etailers do the company has a handsoff approach to its logistics That might seem counterintuitive when you consider that the typical etailer is paranoid about having control over their delivery capabilities Make no mistake Alibaba is as meticulous about errorfree delivery as any company but they do it with a twist For the most part they allow the seller to choose a delivery company that will fulfill the order The selected logistics company is then tasked with the pickup of the product warehousing linehaul and last mile delivery Alibabas Cainiao Logistics takes on the job of selecting vendors for delivery sharing data and overall management of the process and that gives them the level of control they need as well as the data to drive their business to higher levels of efficiency Leveraging its technology expertise Alibaba then facilitates visibility for both buyer and seller to keep track of the products delivery life cycle The process of only doing the supervisors job with respect to delivery is what I believe to be one of the key aspects of Alibabas profitability one that puts them far ahead of even companies like eBay with a similar sales model The establishment of a separate logistics division is a big move so their current model is geared to collecting all the data they need to optimize delivery routes and create a profitable division if they choose to start their own delivery system The third advantage Alibaba has over other etailers is the solid working relationships theyve built with all their partners and vendors For example when Alibaba created Cainiao Logistics in it was a whollyowned subsidiary of a joint venture between five express delivery companies in China Talk about convincing enemies to be friends and work together so everyone benefits in the end Id almost say it was the Tao of business building At the other end of the spectrum is the typical etail model which pits vendors against each other for the cheapest price and ends up hurting the relationship in the process Most ecommerce companies have a lovehate relationship with their vendors and partners case in point is Amazons pseudosymbiotic relationship with UPS NYSE UPS despite being their biggest customer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does not have the relationship with UPS that Alibaba enjoys with its logistics partners This positioning of Alibaba as a great friend of all businesses has been helping the company to no end I only wish <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and just about every other retailer online or offline could take a leaf out of their book and let go of their obsession about controlling everything they touch There is a huge amount of variance in market size growth estimates for the Chinese retail ecommerce segment Techcrunch says its growing at per annum and will hit trillion by AT Kearney puts that at trillion after crossing billion in emarketer says it will hit billion a year earlier in All the estimates however agree that there will be doubledigit growth over the next four to five years As the Alpha etailer in China Alibabas revenues will grow in proportion to that figure Weve already seen them growing their top line by doubledigit percentages quarter over quarter over the past couple of years The company is still in growth phase and will be for several years to come With their careful foray across the border theyre not going to be making the mistakes eBay or even <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>did for that matter Their profit margins give them the leverage they need to experiment outside the country but I believe theyll follow the same course of action they did when expanding their China business That is evaluate possible synergies keep risks low and build a backbone on which to overlay their business model Even at this seemingly high price point theres still a safety net if youre keen on adding BABA to your portfolio If you enjoyed reading this
