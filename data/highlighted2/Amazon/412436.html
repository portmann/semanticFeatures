Google however has its advertising business which acts as a cash cow that can help fund its efforts elsewhere.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> the advertising business is what helps bolster the valuation case for Google .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 30.92, which is expensively priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past.On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 18.2 is currently fairly priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now.The 1-year PEG ratio (1.69), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 1-year horizon), tells me that the company is fairly priced based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 18.25%.The company has great near-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 18.25%.In addition, the company has great long-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 16.22%.On a financial basis, the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity and investment.The company sports return on assets, equity, and investment values of 11.4%, 14%, and 12.8%, respectively, which are all respectable values.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>From a chartist perspective the stock <b>appears</b> to be in middle ground territory on the relative strength index when compared to the <i>broader</i> market with a bit of positive moment but it <b>appears</b> to be weakening right now as seen from the MACD chart below .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>As far as my holding in the name goes, it is an original holding when I started the portfolio and I am currently up on the name about 17.6%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I am not buying any additional shares in the name right now and will not look at adding anymore shares until I see the name below $ 652 because I <b>believe</b> that is where it has value .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I have selected $ 652 because it is the midway point of the 52-week high but for the short-term <b>volatility</b> I will be looking at purchasing options plays in the name until it gets to a level I want to own <i>more</i> shares .
