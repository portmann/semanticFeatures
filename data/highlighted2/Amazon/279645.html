Message From The Year About The Future Of Your TV Consumerist Whoops It looks like portions of our site are being blocked Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator Bookmark Post Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Comments the future soon predictions cable pay tv cord cutting cord cutters broadcast channels hdtv k data caps ott overthetop Thirty years ago in you actually used your TV to watch broadcast or cable signals live as things aired Twenty years ago in you probably still had cable but you probably also had a DVR freeing you to watch programming at your leisure much to the chagrin of advertisers Ten years ago in you may or may not have decided to cut the coaxial cord but even if you had cable odds were high you complimented it with some kind of streaming service But by today Jan if you even remember what cable was thats probably because you only see it at your grandparents house And yet what we have now is in so many ways the same as TV was ten years ago The new year is a great time to pause think about the months to come and reflect on how we got to where we are today In the world of TV weve come so far so fast that it could make your head spin All the change that brought us to where we sit today at the dawn of really began to snowball in a big way in late So on this new years day this seemed like a good time to do a retrospective about the last ten years and look at how we got to where we are today First though it would be remiss not to mention the two big technological developments that set us on this path even though they happened outside of our tenyear window The first was the launch of YouTube just over years ago way back in it was subsequently purchased by Alphabet Inc back when the company was called Google in Prior to that many attempts at Internet video had been made but most involved awkward downloads and longforgotten tech like RealPlayer or QuickTime all of which had reputations for bogging down users computers and frankly just not working right Ask your grandparents how it hard was to view trailers or other stuff in the s But streaming video became a reality for millions when YouTube went big and it laid the groundwork for what would come next The other major development was the advent of subscriptionbased bingeable streaming video That came three years later when Netflix until then primarily a DVDbymail movie rental company opened up video streaming as a bonus for its customers in January though was the year when the tide really began to turn which is why it makes a great starting point for our history That was the year when Comcast finally had more Internet subscribers than TV ones That was the year when streaming video became more than of all Internet traffic That was the year when big broadcasters and premium channels alike began to offer streamingonly overthetop OTT subscription options And it was even the year when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>took its first baby steps into being the cable company millions of us use today As we sat here ten years ago watching the clock turn over to start a few of the cable companies were starting to take their own first steps out of cable Comcast had a little baby streaming service in tests and a company called Time Warner Cable then Charter then purchased in by AnheuserBusch InBev Miller Volkswagen Northrup Grumman with million subscribers was considering dumping the cable box and letting its service start being an app The stage was set Although programming had been delivered in bundles of channels through terrestrial providers for thirty years the age of the cordcutter was ascendant Netflix <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Hulu had proven that you could not only deliver programming without being a linear ie the opposite of ondemand network but succeed at it Early shows like Transparent and Orange is the New Black paved the way for the online distributors to prove that they were just as much a prestige network as any HBO and consumers bought it By January of and into then basically everything anyone wanted was available overthetop A generation of cordcutters nearly all the socalled millennials who by this point were as old as or and in charge of their own households had broken with cable for good The TiVo was invented when they were They were the first digital generation Cable was for dinosaurs and grandparents But the marketplace was deeply fragmented and getting worse A consumer would pay a year to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>another a month to Netflix and Hulu and maybe each to a couple of online versions of premium channels to get everything that she wanted to see plus for broadcast networks she either had to cough up another per month or fiddle with a digital antenna and overtheair access providing she even lived someplace where she got a good signal For between and a month having to assemble all your own crap and not even having a single DVR or unified search feature to turn to seemed like an awful lot of work Outsourcing that work consumers would realize was the value a cable package still added But prices were constantly on the rise and so some consumers especially the younger primarily mobileusing ones still preferred to piece things together themselves So in and it both was and wasnt surprising to see the traditional cable bundle break up more and more It was still widespread though by the last quarter of analysts found that there were still over million traditional payTV cable or satellite subscribers in the US and even now that number still hasnt ever dropped below million But by a number of the three five or eightyear contracts that programmers and distributors had agreed on before the ascendance of broadband TV had finally expired and new contracts focused on the digital space were able to arise In short there were new players in town and some of them would even end up playing against themselves <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>announced its first overthetop bundle service in late to launch in early Its starting lineup included all of the Discovery and AMC networks along with some but not all Disney properties no ABC only highlights from ESPN and several of the premium channels Starz HBO as addon options They smartly offered the bundle at a steep subsidized discount to their Prime consumers on top of the regular annual Prime fee getting cable would only cost a year less than a month As compared to an average cable company bill of per month it was a nobrainer for millions of consumers who already enjoyed watching <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>content A little over a later Netflix even added its content to the package for an extra a month same as HBO Comcast meanwhile started bringing their cablefree cable bundles online at about the same time though they began with only a tiny handful of pilot cities and were slow to roll out nationwide Their Internetonly subscribers were eligible to buy a programming package that included all of the NBCUniversal networks all of the Discovery networks all of the AMC networks and all of the Scripps networks as well as access to EPSN and ABC but not the Disney channel or any of their kids channels and all the same premium HBO or Starz addon content for significantly less than the cost of a standard cable package delivered through a settop box But Comcast could pull one string that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could not zerorating Comcast unlike <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was an Internet infrastructure company as well as a payTV company Through the teens they gradually unrolled data caps across their footprint and by January they enforced a GB monthly cap on all users nationwide with a fee for unlimited data All of those <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>TV subscribers of course still had to get their Internet from somewhere A Comcast OTT bundle was exempted from Comcast Internet data caps An <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>TV bundle was not The other TVInternet providers werent far behind Comcast Verizon and ATT launched their comparable packages in late Charter which had only finished its merger with Time Warner Cable and Bright House in December took longer theirs launched at the end of Smaller providers meanwhile had been sticking with the Internet biz but dropping TV altogether since as early as It took until for the big lawsuit to land That was when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sued Comcast Charter Verizon and ATT in the nowlandmark <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>v Comcast The big AtoZ argued in summary that the way in which ISPs overthetop noncable cable bundles were being treated preferentially was against the FCCs Open Internet Rule of and anticompetitive and against antitrust law It wasnt a blocking or throttling issue that was settled once and for all in when the ISPs failed lawsuit against the FCC over net neutrality got smacked down by the Supreme Court Rather the big AtoZ argued that the infrastructureowning companies preferential treatment of their own video services an anticompetitive measure under antitrust law Although they did also contend it was in violation of the FCCs Open Internet Rule The issue of data caps became pressing more quickly than most consumers had anticipated The shift to K video the adoption of streaming VR gaming content and the sheer amount of streamingonly television produced all at once came together to make GB or even look laughably low in a household with three or more members A significant enough number of households felt constrained by data restrictions that they opted to stick with programming packages distributed by their ISPs instead of by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>or one of the other nascent businesses and so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>had a strong case The wheels of justice turn slowly though and a surprisingly protracted government shutdown in bumped the proceedings even farther It was before a federal court found in favor of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>All of the ISPs of course appealed and it was before the appeals court found in their favor And thats how we came to where we sit now The Supreme Court heard arguments about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>v Comcast this fall in October but we wont know how its going to play out for a few months still and the future of TV as we know it hinges on the outcome Charter is no longer a defendant they came to an agreement with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and have since permitted their app to be accessed on all devices and amended their data policy so that most customers are not subject to a cap or limit Comcast and ATT however have doubled down So where will we be sitting another decade from now on New Years Day Theres A New Streaming Option In Town For MLB Games But
