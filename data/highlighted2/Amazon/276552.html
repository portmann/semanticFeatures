Embassy Suites by Hilton Spend Get Back Get a onetime statement credit by using your connected Card to spend a total of on room rate and room charges when you pay for your stay with Embassy Suites by Hilton from to Tweet AmexEmbassy Each separate card including authorized users may have different offers available to them In addition adding an offer to one card may remove the same offer from another card Although as commenter Oleg notes If you have multiple cards and you activated for an offer on one of them this offer may disappear from others You can open several web browser tabs retrieve each card separately and apply for an offer Here are the various ways to access these offers Access via social media at AmExOfferscom Facebook Twitter Foursquare and TripAdvisor Not everyone can access every offer but the ones on Twitter tend to be available to everyone You can track these on their Favorites page Thanks for the headsup My account also has off X at grocery stores says NJ NY CT only I had a bunch of these curious if anyone else is seeing the one Steve mentions above either via AmEx directly or twitterFB thanks for the tip checked my account saw lots of offers including the ones mentioned abovealas I rarely shop but might be able to use the Ticketmaster offer for US Open tennis tickets just wanted to update everyone I used my Amex at Whole Foods wine store where prices are actually reasonable not Trader Joes like but reasonable and qualified for off supermarket purchase Minutes after the transaction they sent an email confirmation and credited the within business days to my account Consider me impressed Does anyone know does the purchase have to be all at once to get the credit or could I spend at Homedepot one week and then another the next Purchase must be all at once for this promo It may be easier to just buy a Home Depot gift card if you need to spread out the purchases Today I went to the HD Charlotte NC and when I tried to buy HD gift card the manager says that they got a memo from Atlanta that for all gift cards they would take only Check or Cash but no Credit Card Nvtech you can always buy their gift card online Credit cards are accepted there no need to argue with crazy store managers who come up with these selfinvented policies Just thought Id post a little tip something I learned from experience if you have more than one user on your Amex card be aware that each card has a different number and has to be activated for an offer separately I discovered this when my wife made a purchase but we didnt get the credit for the offer because SHE hadnt activated it on HER card even though they both are on the same account If you have multiple cards and you activated for an offer on one of them this offer may disappear from others You can open several tabs retrieve each card separately and apply for an offer Doh I read your post too late What if I activated an offer on one card and the offer has already disappeared from my other card Any way to get it back Would twitter and fb and the amex website have different offers or are they all the same for the same person Victoria I believe once you click there is no way back Although the offer still could be available on facebook and twitter Corporate cards are usually issued by large companies of employees All of the Corporate cards I have used have been clearly marked on the front They are not the same as small business cards which do indeed work with these special offers Through the account page under the offer for you I also grabbed a credit for a or more purchase on Amazoncom Thats just a no brainer Grab it if its available Also SmartFinal sell several store gift cards including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Macys etc and the fine print does not seem to exclude it If you have nothing else to buy you can just get three <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>cards in different transactions Just did the Smart Final offer We were gonna be buying a bunch of flights through Southwest for the summer well Amex just gave us in free airfare as they have gift cards at Smart Final Did not received any of the above offers on Amex Called and yes they said that this is definitely targeted so interesting since we use Amex for everything if the place of business takes it After years will be saying hasta la vista when Costco doesnt take it anymore I use ATT Uverse for TV I signed up for both the TV and the phone offers not knowing which one it would trigger I received two email notifications for using the card once Wonder if Ill get a double bonus Did you charge If so it might trigger both bonuses like you speculated I might try the same with Fios Thanks Got the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>one Nice Did the GC as well spend at amazon for sure in the next mont week Does anyone know if its possible to get these offers on the Fidelity Amex Card I login and dont see the offers anywhere on their website Neither I nor my wife got the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>or Verizon offers In fact the majority of offers we received were with companies weve never heard of which might be the purpose of the offers I clicked through to read the details of the cell phone deal and was disappointed to find it wont work for me Payments for prepaid cell phone purchases plans or services do not qualify Notify me of followup comments by email Previous Chase Freedom Review SignUp Bonus Cash Back at <span style='background-color:
