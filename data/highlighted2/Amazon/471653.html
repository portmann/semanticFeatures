And not to be overlooked: Exxon Mobile (NYSE: XOM ) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX ) also early Friday.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But the focus this morning <b>may</b> be on Facebook , Ford , and ConocoPhillips .  (Uncertainty) </span>On the plus side, Facebook came in way above estimates, with earnings of 97 cents per share on revenues of $6.44 billion.Analysts had expected 82 cents per share on revenues of $6.02 billion, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate.Facebook's ad business took off during the quarter, and most of it was mobile ad revenue, which analysts saw as a positive sign.ConocoPhillips, however, reported a loss of 86 cents per share, or $1.1 billion, Analysts expected a loss of 61 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters.The company cited a difficult pricing environment.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Those <i>less</i> than stellar results put <i>more</i> importance into tomorrow 's reports from XOM and CVX and raise attention around the energy sector .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Could</b> things be <i>worse</i> than investors had thought ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>And Ford reported earnings of 52 cents a share, below expectations for 60 cents.Flat North American sales ganged up with losses in Asia to take a bite out of the company's results.Also, Ford's executives, on their earnings call, brought up Brexit, Britain's decision to leave the European Union, saying it will cost Ford about $200 million this year and grow to $400 million to $500 million next year, Bloomberg reported.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the last few weeks , there 's been <i>less</i> talk about Brexit , but Ford 's earnings put it back in the spotlight .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For anyone feeling bewildered by all the earnings reports coming down the pike , it <b>may</b> be useful to take a look back at what earnings season has told us to date .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Before Ford and ConocoPhillips missed so badly this morning , close to 70 % of reporting companies had beat analyst expectations , a rate that 's slightly <i>higher</i> than normal .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Maybe the mostly strong earnings hint that the Fed was onto something Wednesday when it once again opened the gates to the possibility of a rate hike yet this year , noting that `` near-term <b>risks</b> to the outlook have diminished . ''  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The Fed kept rates unchanged , which did n't <b>surprise</b> investors , but there 's <i>more</i> talk now that a rate hike <b>could</b> come before the end of the year .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Remember , though , that the election in November looms , and <b>sometimes</b> political pressures can factor into the timing of a fall rate hike .

(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>George was the only member of the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) to vote in favor of raising rates at this week 's meeting , George , who voted in June to keep rates unchanged , had hinted publicly <i>earlier</i> this month that she 'd changed her thinking , saying , `` The economy is at or near full employment and yet short-term interest rates remain at historic lows .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Keeping rates too low can also create <b>risks</b> . ''  (Uncertainty) </span>But George's hawkish view didn't resonate with other Fed members this week, evidently.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although the Fed 's statement noted that near-term <b>risks</b> to the economic outlook have diminished , it also said inflation remains low and business fixed investment has been `` soft . ''  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Could</b> <i>more</i> Fed members come around to George 's point of view at the next meeting in September ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's <b>possible</b> , but a lot of data and earnings lie between now and then .

(Surprise) </span>Keep an eye on other big multi-national companies reporting this week, including Ford and some of the major U.S. pharmaceutical firms, to see if this trend continues.Ford cited the strong dollar as a factor in its weak Asian performance in the Q2.The dollar rose this week to its highest levels vs. the euro in a month, and the yen retreated against the dollar on Wednesday after reports that the Japanese government would inject new stimulus into the economy.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A <i>stronger</i> dollar makes it <i>harder</i> for U.S. companies to sell their products overseas .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>On the plus side , it can help make imports <i>cheaper</i> for U.S. consumers , and it 's likely one of the reasons for oil 's sharp recent plunge , another factor that <b>could</b> potentially help consumers .
