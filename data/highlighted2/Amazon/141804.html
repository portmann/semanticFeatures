even the most optimistic forecasts at a time when traditional retailers are struggling to grow their market Amazons established footprint in online retail leadership pace in the cloud computing market and strategic investments in drone technology give it an unparalleled advantage over other largecap internet companies Yet for all its upside Amazons extremely high PE ratio has supported the contrarian case against buying the company However more scrupulous investors understand theres a reasonable tradeoff between shortterm profitability and future growth While some investors may be alarmed by Amazons PEG ratio of compared to just and for Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Barnes Noble NYSE BKS respectively the company has clearly taken the high road when it comes to expansion And as the latest quarterly earnings demonstrated profitability isnt as elusive as some make it out to be We take a look at the smart money investors to discern if their sentiments are aligned with ours on a
