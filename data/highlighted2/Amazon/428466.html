A shareholder who owned 100 shares of it and hedged with the collar above then had $59,638 in AMZN stock plus $3,460 in puts, and if he wanted to buy-to-close his short call position, he would have needed to pay $755 to do that.So, his net hedged position value on January 22nd was ($59,683 + $3,460) - $755 = $62,343.AMZN closed at $726.64 on Wednesday, June 8th, up 21.8% from its closing price on January 22nd.The investor's shares were worth $72,664 as of 6/8, his put options were worth $32, and if he wanted to close out the short call leg of his collar, it would have cost him $368.So, ($72,664 + $32) - $368 = $72,328.$72,328 represents a 16% gain from $62,343.* So, although AMZN was up by 21.8% at the time of the calculations above, if the investor hedged with this collar wanted to exit his position on Wednesday, his gain would have been limited to 16%.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Note that the difference there ( 5.8 % ) is a bit <i>higher</i> than the initial hedging cost ( 4.54 % ) .  (Surprise) </span>In tests of our hedged portfolio method, we got the best results by holding hedged positions for 6 months or until just before their hedges expire, which would be next month, in this case.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The best-case scenario here is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> keeps going up and is up 30 % or <i>more</i> from the January 22nd closing price by mid-July . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>In that case, the investor would be up about 25.5% from the January 22nd closing price, net of his hedging cost.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The worst-case scenario is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> plummets from here , and the investor is down no <i>more</i> than 15 % from the January 22nd closing price by mid-July . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>That maximum decline includes the hedging cost (i.e., not counting the hedging cost, the investor would be down about 10.5% from where he bought it in January).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>An Updated Potential Return And Hedge For <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's no <i>longer</i> our site 's top-ranked stock , but our site is still bullish on it , estimating a potential return of 13.6 % for it over the next several months . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>We were able to raise our upside cap to 14% without raising the cost of hedging, so we used that as the cap in the hedge below.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This was the <b>optimal</b> collar to hedge 100 shares of AMZN against a <i>greater</i> than 15 % drop between now and late January , while not capping your upside at <i>less</i> than 14 % by then : As you can see above , the cost of the put leg of this collar was $ 2,765 or 3.81 % of position value .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But if you look below , you 'll see the income generated by selling the calls was a bit <i>more</i> : $ 3,140 or 4.23 % of position value .  (Surprise) </span>So the net cost was negative: the investor would have collected an amount equal to $375 or 0.52% of position value, when opening this hedge.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Note that , to be conservative , the cost here was calculated using the ask price of the put and the bid price of the call ; since , in practice , an investor can often buy puts for <i>less</i> and sell calls for <i>more</i> ( at some price between the bid and ask , in both cases ) , an investor opening this hedge on Wednesday would likely have collected <i>more</i> than $ 375 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>* An <b>imprecision</b> of our loss calculation method here is that the last prices of the options occurred <i>earlier</i> in the day than the last price of the stock .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>For simplicity's sake, we've used the last prices of all three here, but if you sliced this a different way - say, using the intra-day price of the stock at the time the options traded, or using the midpoint of the bid/ask spread of the options at the close - the results would have been similar.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: ETFs & Portfolio Strategy , Portfolio Strategy & Asset Allocation, Technology</div></body></html>
