Compute Stick has a very promising future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Newegg are now accepting preorders for the Intel Compute Stick A Windows or Linux OSpowered Tiny PC concept is still a better traditional productivity tool than Androidpowered products I am a happy owner of a inch Android Smart TV However I still look forward to buying the Windows Intel NASDAQ INTC Compute Stick Newegg is selling a Linux OS Intel Compute Stick <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN is also one of the online sellers slated to sell the Compute Stick I want a PConaStick that runs Windows to make up for the limited Android OS experience on my current smart TV I believe that a tiny energy efficient HDMI device that can run Adobe NASDAQ ADBE Photoshop CC on a inch full HD p monitor is a very useful productivity tool As a freelance graphic artist showcasing portfolios to prospective clients is convenient when one can just stick in a x x inch device like the Intel Compute Stick into a clients HDMIequipped TV or computer monitor The most obvious advantage is that I do not have to carry a laptop or tablet when I have the Compute Stick The Intel Compute Stick is not much bigger than a regular USB thumb drive and could easily fit the small coinpocket of my jeans Impressing clients is better done when you can do onsite demonstrations of Photoshop image manipulation of wedding photos or product ad layouts Since Adobe has still refused to port Photoshop CC to Android or Chrome OS architecture no Android TV dongle stick could help me do this wowtheprospectiveclient trick to get a paycheck Tiny PCs like the Compute Stick have a place in the corporate environment The quadcore Intel Atom SoC of the Compute Stick plus the GB of RAM makes it strong enough to run most Windows applications Budgetconstrained corporate IT managers could do well in buying Compute Sticks to cheaply upgrade year old office desktop computers that still run on Windows hardware configurations The Intel Compute Stick has more useful peripheral ports than Apples NASDAQ AAPL new MacBook Air Adding a wireless or nonwireless keyboardmouse is not a problem Apples Intel Core Mpowered MacBook Air has only one USBType C port for peripherals like keyboards or external DVDwriters USB TypeC is not compatible with regular USB or standard input or external storage devices My point is that the Intel Compute Stick has the potential to be a businessoriented product It is not only a mere dongle stick to turn dumb TV sets into smart appliances The Intel Compute Stick has one fullsize USB and one microUSB port for power The microUSB power supply says this computer is far more energy efficient than any desktop or laptop computer The Compute Stick also has a microSD slot for storage expansion to add to the GB internal flash drive of the Windows Compute Stick The cheaper Linux version has only GB of internal storage so the microSD slot expansion port is very useful I firmly believe that the PC product is not dying I say it is maturing to include nontraditional form factors IDC keeps reporting that the PC market continues to decline However I am confident that Intels revolutionary Compute Stick concept has the potential to help reverse this downtrend The portability energy efficiency and fullsize PC productivity capability of the tiny Compute Stick is ideal for school home and office use Furthermore Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT is enthusiastically backing the Compute Stick concept Microsoft has partnered up with Daewoo Lucoms to create a clone of the Intel Compute Stick in South Korea Moneybags Microsoft has the marketing budget to make the supersmall Windows PConaStick a mainstream global computing product Another company BeeLink is also coming up with a clone of the Intel Compute Stick The BeeLink product has the same specs of the Intel one Since Microsoft is behind the Lucoms Windows PC stick I expect it to be cheaper than the Intel Compute Stick After all Microsoft owns the Window OS The reason why the Windows Intel Compute Stick is a lot more expensive than the Linux version is that Microsofts offer of free Windows license is not yet applied to HDMI sticks because they do not have display screens like inch or inch tablets Once Microsoft rectifies this glaring mistake Intelpowered PC sticks sales could take off The issue of nonqualification of screenless PC sticks has inspired Chinese OEM firms to create cheap Trial Versiononly Windows OSpowered PC HDMI dongle sticks The easy method of cracking and making a trial version of Windows fully functional means Intel could be selling a lot of its Atom chips to whoever is making those cheap clones of the Compute Stick Microsoft does not make money from cracked trial versions but Intel benefits if more OEMs continue to bypass Windows OS licensing to create cheaper versions of the Compute Stick I believe that Windows Compute Stick products could hit below once Microsoft finally realizes that PC Sticks are a good way to get more advertising eyeballs Microsoft is planning to give free upgrades to pirated copies of Windows and Windows computer users once Windows is released It might be inevitable that Microsoft will have to give away free Windows licenses to tablets smartphones computers PC sticks and other computing products like HDMI dongle PC sticks After all Microsofts arch nemesis Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL already gives away free Android and Chrome OS licenses to all OEMs regardless of what products they create and sell INTC is a Buy Microsofts
