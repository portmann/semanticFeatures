(Surprise) </span>I am a happy owner of a 32-inch Android Smart TV.However, I still look forward to buying the $149 Windows Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Compute Stick .Newegg is selling a $110 Linux OS Intel Compute Stick.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) is also one of the online sellers slated to sell the Compute Stick . I want a PC-on-a-Stick that runs Windows to make up for the limited Android OS experience on my current smart TV.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> that a tiny , energy efficient , HDMI device that can run Adobe ( NASDAQ : ADBE ) Photoshop CC on a 32-inch full HD 1080p monitor is a very useful productivity tool .  (Uncertainty) </span>As a freelance graphic artist, showcasing portfolios to prospective clients is convenient when one can just stick in a 5.8 x 3.4 x 2.8 inch device like the Intel Compute Stick into a client's HDMI-equipped TV or computer monitor.The most obvious advantage is that I do not have to carry a laptop or tablet when I have the Compute Stick.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The Intel Compute Stick is not much <i>bigger</i> than a regular USB thumb drive and <b>could</b> easily fit the small coin-pocket of my jeans .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Impressing clients is <i>better</i> done when you can do on-site demonstrations of Photoshop image manipulation of wedding photos or product ad layouts .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Since Adobe has still refused to port Photoshop CC to Android or Chrome OS architecture , no Android TV dongle stick <b>could</b> help me do this ` wow-the-prospective-client ' trick to get a paycheck .  (Uncertainty) </span>Tiny PCs like the Compute Stick have a place in the corporate environment.The quad-core Intel Atom SoC of the Compute Stick plus the 2GB of RAM makes it strong enough to run most Windows 8.1 applications.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Budget-constrained corporate IT managers <b>could</b> do well in buying $ 149 Compute Sticks to cheaply upgrade 5-year old office desktop computers that still run on Windows 7 hardware configurations .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Intel Compute Stick has <i>more</i> useful peripheral ports than Apple 's ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) new MacBook Air .  (Surprise) </span>Adding a wireless or non-wireless keyboard/mouse is not a problem.Apple's Intel Core M-powered MacBook Air 2015 has only one USB-Type C port for peripherals like keyboards or external DVD-writers.USB Type-C is not compatible with regular USB 3.0 or 2.0-standard input or external storage devices.My point is that the Intel Compute Stick has the potential to be a business-oriented product.It is not only a mere dongle stick to turn dumb TV sets into smart appliances.The Intel Compute Stick has one full-size USB and one micro-USB port for power.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The micro-USB power supply says this computer is far <i>more</i> energy efficient than any desktop or laptop computer .  (Surprise) </span>The Compute Stick also has a microSD slot for storage expansion to add to the 32-GB internal flash drive of the Windows Compute Stick.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>cheaper</i> Linux version has only 8GB of internal storage so the micro-SD slot expansion port is very useful .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I firmly <b>believe</b> that the PC product is not dying .  (Uncertainty) </span>I say it is maturing to include non-traditional form factors.IDC keeps reporting that the PC market continues to decline .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , I am <b>confident</b> that Intel 's revolutionary Compute Stick concept has the potential to help reverse this downtrend .  (Uncertainty) </span>The portability, energy efficiency, and full-size PC productivity capability of the tiny Compute Stick is ideal for school, home, and office use.Furthermore, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is enthusiastically backing the Compute Stick concept.Microsoft has partnered up with Daewoo Lucoms to create a clone of the Intel Compute Stick in South Korea.Moneybags Microsoft has the marketing budget to make the supersmall Windows PC-on-a-Stick a mainstream global computing product.Another company, BeeLink , is also coming up with a clone of the Intel Compute Stick.The BeeLink product has the same specs of the Intel one.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Since Microsoft is behind the Lucoms Windows PC stick , I expect it to be <i>cheaper</i> than the $ 149 Intel Compute Stick .  (Surprise) </span>After all, Microsoft owns the Window OS.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The reason why the Windows Intel Compute Stick is a lot <i>more</i> expensive than the Linux version is that Microsoft 's offer of free Windows 8.1 license is not yet applied to HDMI sticks because they do not have display screens like 8-inch or 7-inch tablets .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Once Microsoft rectifies this glaring mistake , Intel-powered PC sticks sales <b>could</b> take off .  (Uncertainty) </span>The issue of non-qualification of screenless PC sticks has inspired Chinese OEM firms to create cheap $90 Trial Version-only Windows 8.1 OS-powered PC HDMI dongle sticks.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The easy method of cracking and making a trial version of Windows 8.1 fully functional means Intel <b>could</b> be selling a lot of its Atom chips to whoever is making those cheap $ 90 clones of the Compute Stick .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft does not make money from cracked trial versions but Intel benefits if <i>more</i> OEMs continue to bypass Windows OS licensing to create <i>cheaper</i> versions of the Compute Stick .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I believe that Windows 10 Compute Stick products <b>could</b> hit below $ 100 once Microsoft finally realizes that PC Sticks are a good way to get <i>more</i> advertising eyeballs .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft is planning to give free upgrades to pirated copies of Windows 7 and Windows 8 computer users once Windows 10 is released.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>might</b> be inevitable that Microsoft will have to give away free Windows 10 licenses to tablets , smartphones , computers , PC sticks , and other computing products like HDMI dongle PC sticks .  (Uncertainty) </span>After all, Microsoft's arch nemesis Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) already gives away free Android and Chrome OS licenses to all OEMs regardless of what products they create and sell.INTC is a Buy.Microsoft's eventual shift toward free OS for everything is great for Intel's x86 processor business.Source: Intel: The PC-On-A-Stick Revolution Is Here Disclosure: The author is long INTC, MSFT, AAPL.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) The author wrote this article themselves , and it expresses their own opinions .
