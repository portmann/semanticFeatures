Walmartcom Creating a Shipping Service like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Debt RoundUp I was jumping on Walmartcom yesterday to look to see if they had any cool sales going on As the home page loaded I noticed an interesting banner that Id hadnt seen before Now if youve shopping on Walmarts online site then you are used to their promotional banners Typically its for the season or Fathers Day but this was different This smelled like the beginnings of an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime type shipping service Below is the banner ad I saw on the site Theres not secret on this blog that I have an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime account Ive had it for years and I enjoy it Heck I even wrote a post breaking down the costs to see if Prime is worth the yearly price tag Now thats highly dependent on a number of factors but for me it is worth it Not only that but I share my <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime account with my sister for the shipping benefits You can see from the above banner that this is a pilot program When I clicked the Join Waitlist button I was greeted with a signup form that only asked for my email address and my zip code What is Walmarts Unlimited Shipping Service Well they havent provided a lot of detail around it yet Im assuming they are going to roll it out slowly in order to test the viability of the program There have been reports that the Prime shipping benefits costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>quite a bit of money one reason for the price increase but who knows If you order some large things that would normally cost to ship then thats where you get a deal Walmarts unlimited shipping service is just that Only for shipping They say they will give you unlimited shipping for a year for only They offer fast shipping days or faster and its on a number of products in their best selling categories I dont know how large a selection that is but Walmart is the largest brickandmortar retailer so they have quite a bit of product to choose from Would you pay a year for unlimited shipping on Walmartcom Click To Tweet As with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Im going to assume this will be restricted to specific products Walmart does actually have a marketplace where they allow other retailers to sell on Walmartcom I would assume those sellers products arent eligible for Walmarts unlimited shipping service All in all I think this could be the start of a little offerings feud between Walmartcom and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Now Im OK with that Typically when big retailers begin an offerings feud its the customer that wins with lower prices and better services Typically I did just sign up for the waitlist because I want to know more about it I dont shop on Walmartcom enough to justify the price tag but I know quite a few people do I have seen that Walmart does offer free shipping on orders over so that could put a lot of weight into the decision to use this service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a free shipping option of but I typically shop when I need a product quickly and dont want to fill my cart with addons just to hit the free shipping threshold Thats one reason I have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Im a business owner blogger father and husband I used credit cards too much and found myself in over in debt I paid it off started this blog and my financial life has changed I now talk about fighting debt and growing wealth here I run a Wordpress management company along with another blog It is Empowered Shopper which helps people get information about products they want to buy I have very little faith that something like this would be somehow made frustrating and appear cheap because thats just sort of the hallmark of WalMart Im not even saying that by reputation but really by personal experience I simply dont enjoy WalMart and I know I definitely would not go out of my way to pay for this I have very little faith that something like this would be somehow made frustrating and appear cheap because thats just sort of the hallmark of WalMart Im not even saying Mint has a better budgeting function but Personal Capital just added it to their iPhone app Im interested to see how it works You are correct whatever someone chooses just Ive used Mint for quite a while now and use it primarily for the budgeting function What ever app you choose is a personal choice the most important thing is I actually used your advice on ways to save money when buying products in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>I found great deals on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Warehouse Deals I was lucky to have gotten a Sorry to hear about your issues with them It can be hit or miss when
