( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha On yesterday 's earnings call , FedEx ( NYSE : FDX ) executive Mike Glenn dismissed rumors that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) <b>might</b> be preparing to create a serious competitor to the `` big three '' shippers , saying that doing so would simply take too long and cost too much . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>"It is very clear that e-commerce is now enabling the full scale of retail revolution.There are several important trends worth noting.First, referring to a specific peak day is quickly becoming a thing of the past.As evidenced this year, there were multiple days where volumes exceeded 25 million packages as consumer buying habits are changing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We view this as a positive , as Mother Nature can <b>sometimes</b> play havoc with last minute e-commerce shoppers .  (Uncertainty) </span>Smoothing sales throughout peak season is a trend that will benefit retailers and transportation companies alike.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We <b>believe</b> online shoppers will have increasing incentives to order <i>earlier</i> in the holiday season .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>`` Second , <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> retailers are fulfilling e-commerce orders from individual stores or what we call store-to-home delivery .  (Surprise) </span>FedEx is well positioned to service this growing market in the years ahead with our broad portfolio of services including metro delivery and same day services."Third, we are seeing a significant increase in non-traditional items now being purchased online, mattresses to new swing sets and big-screen TVs just to name a few.We welcome this opportunity, but it is important that we price these items accordingly to account for the operational complexities such as manual sortation to person delivery etc.As a result, we will be adjusting the initial handling surcharge for FedEx Ground.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Today , if a package length is <i>greater</i> than 60 inches an additional handling surcharge will be applied .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Beginning June 1, the maximum length will be reduced from 60 inches to 48 inches.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> 48 inches is appropriate as it is the standard length of an LTL pallet .  (Uncertainty) </span>It is important to remember that the primary value proposition of e-commerce is the ability to order a product online and have it reliably delivered to the consumer."In that regard, FedEx ( FDX ) is and will continue to be a key enabler for e-commerce in the years ahead.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>By our estimates , <i>more</i> than 95 % of all e-commerce orders today are delivered by one of three entities in the United States .  (Surprise) </span>FedEx, the USPS with whom we have a strategic relationship to transport the priority mail, and UPS (NYSE: UPS ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In fact , if we were to isolate our e-commerce business one <b>could</b> argue that FedEx is one of the most profitable e-commerce companies in business today .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>`` I 'd also like to clarify some of the public discussion and <b>speculation</b> concerning <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( AMZN ) adding some direct transportation capabilities . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>First , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a valuable customer that we worked with for many years and we expect to work with them for many years to come . Weâ€™ve been in constant dialogue with them to understand their transportation needs as they've experienced significant growth.We 've been aware of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's need for supplemental capacity related to inventory management , which is driving some of the investments they are making in transportation . "Large retailers have long had their own transportation capabilities, primarily to enable movement and positioning of inventory across their store and fulfillment locations.While recent stories and reports of a new entity competing with the three major carriers in the United States grabs headlines, the reality is it will be a daunting task requiring tens of billions of dollars in capital and years to build sufficient scale and density to replicate existing networks like FedEx.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>`` It is also important to note that no one FedEx customer represents <i>more</i> than <b>approximately</b> 3 % of total revenue .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Additionally , other than the Postal Service , no single customer represents <i>more</i> than <b>approximately</b> 3 % of revenue for FedEx Express , FedEx Ground , or FedEx Freight .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We manage these relationships carefully to ensure we do n't become overly <b>dependent</b> on any one customer .  (Uncertainty) </span>We expect these industry trends and dynamics to accelerate this coming holiday season and we will continue to affect the industry year around.FedEx is well-positioned to provide innovative solutions and to meet this growing demand."In a note Tuesday , RBC discussed <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's attempts to build its own distribution network : `` <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is seeing its outbound shipping costs rise at rate well in excess of sales growth . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is trying to build a global supply chain to reduce costs and create <i>deeper</i> customer relationships . '' (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The key challenge here is the disparity between <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's net sales growth and shipping expense growth , as witnessed in the chart below : <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has also experienced delivery delays during peak season , which <b>appears</b> to be the focus of FedEx 's comments above that `` peak days are becoming a thing of the past . '' (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Still , RBC agrees that given the costly and lengthy nature of building its own delivery chain , it 's <i>more</i> likely <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will take a <i>slower</i> approach : `` All in , we <b>believe</b> it is likely <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will make a concerted effort to take over ever <i>larger</i> portions of its supply chain , '' the report said . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>`` However , a full-blown <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> parcel delivery operation would likely take years to complete , so we <b>believe</b> FDX -LSB- FedEx -RSB- and UPS would have time to react .
