class='textDiv'>FedEx It Would Take <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Way Too Much Money And Time To Compete With Us Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha On yesterdays earnings call FedEx NYSE FDX executive Mike Glenn dismissed rumors that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN might be preparing to create a serious competitor to the big three shippers saying that doing so would simply take too long and cost too much It is very clear that ecommerce is now enabling the full scale of retail revolution There are several important trends worth noting First referring to a specific peak day is quickly becoming a thing of the past As evidenced this year there were multiple days where volumes exceeded million packages as consumer buying habits are changing We view this as a positive as Mother Nature can sometimes play havoc with last minute ecommerce shoppers Smoothing sales throughout peak season is a trend that will benefit retailers and transportation companies alike We believe online shoppers will have increasing incentives to order earlier in the holiday season Second more and more retailers are fulfilling ecommerce orders from individual stores or what we call storetohome delivery FedEx is well positioned to service this growing market in the years ahead with our broad portfolio of services including metro delivery and same day services Third we are seeing a significant increase in nontraditional items now being purchased online mattresses to new swing sets and bigscreen TVs just to name a few We welcome this opportunity but it is important that we price these items accordingly to account for the operational complexities such as manual sortation to person delivery etc As a result we will be adjusting the initial handling surcharge for FedEx Ground Today if a package length is greater than inches an additional handling surcharge will be applied Beginning June the maximum length will be reduced from inches to inches We believe inches is appropriate as it is the standard length of an LTL pallet It is important to remember that the primary value proposition of ecommerce is the ability to order a product online and have it reliably delivered to the consumer In that regard FedEx FDX is and will continue to be a key enabler for ecommerce in the years ahead By our estimates more than of all ecommerce orders today are delivered by one of three entities in the United States FedEx the USPS with whom we have a strategic relationship to transport the priority mail and UPS NYSE UPS In fact if we were to isolate our ecommerce business one could argue that FedEx is one of the most profitable ecommerce companies in business today Id also like to clarify some of the public discussion and speculation concerning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>AMZN adding some direct transportation capabilities First <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a valuable customer that we worked with for many years and we expect to work with them for many years to come Weve been in constant dialogue with them to understand their transportation needs as theyve experienced significant growth Weve been aware of Amazons need for supplemental capacity related to inventory management which is driving some of the investments they are making in transportation Large retailers have long had their own transportation capabilities primarily to enable movement and positioning of inventory across their store and fulfillment locations While recent stories and reports of a new entity competing with the three major carriers in the United States grabs headlines the reality is it will be a daunting task requiring tens of billions of dollars in capital and years to build sufficient scale and density to replicate existing networks like FedEx It is also important to note that no one FedEx customer represents more than approximately of total revenue Additionally other than the Postal Service no single customer represents more than approximately of revenue for FedEx Express FedEx Ground or FedEx Freight We manage these relationships carefully to ensure we dont become overly dependent on any one customer We expect these industry trends and dynamics to accelerate this coming holiday season and we will continue to affect the industry year around FedEx is wellpositioned to provide innovative solutions and to meet this growing demand In a note Tuesday RBC discussed Amazons attempts to build its own distribution network <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is seeing its outbound shipping costs rise at rate well in excess of sales growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is trying to build a global supply chain to reduce costs and create deeper customer relationships The key challenge here is the disparity between Amazons net sales growth and shipping expense growth as witnessed in the chart below <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has also experienced delivery delays during peak season which appears to be the focus of FedExs comments above that peak days are becoming a thing of the past Still RBC agrees that given the costly and lengthy nature of building its own delivery chain its more likely <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will take a slower approach All in we believe it is likely <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will make a concerted effort to take over ever larger portions of its supply chain the report said However a fullblown <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>parcel delivery operation would likely take years to complete so we believe FDX FedEx and UPS would have time to react
