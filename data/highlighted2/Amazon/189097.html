(Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>1 , 2015 3:41 PM ET | About : Verizon Communications ( VZ ) , Includes : AMZN , NFLX by : Learn Bonds At a time when streaming has become increasingly commoditized , live content will give Verizon ( NYSE : VZ ) a leg up on Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) services . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Since both of them lack live programs , they <b>may</b> have to rethink their strategy to stay competitive .  (Uncertainty) </span>The emphasis on live streaming will open up Verizon to a new source of long term revenue.Data access is the future of telecom.And VZ is positioning itself to grab a big chunk of that pie.Verizon will be in the driver's seat.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Since it 's the link between content creators and consumers , it need not <b>worry</b> about creating content or demand for it .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Additionally , given the huge size of its network , content creators like NFL are <i>more</i> than likely to pick VZ as their distribution partner .  (Surprise) </span>The downside in all this is pretty low.Verizon does not incur the large costs associated with content and demand creation.This is something that will likely affect Netflix's balance sheet as it shifts to original programming .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In short , Verizon 's Go90 strategy should keep the firm 's return on invested capital ( NASDAQ : ROIC ) comparatively <i>higher</i> for the medium term .  (Surprise) </span>Speaking of ROIC, Verizon has been super efficient in managing the capital it invests.Its ROIC has jumped from 5 percent at the end of 2006 to the current 8 percent.Every year since 2008, VZ has been able to generate positive economic earnings.As a result, shareholders are happy.Verizon is among the largest telecom service providers in the country.AT&T (NYSE: T ), Sprint (NYSE: S ), T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ) are all big names.But despite the intense competition, VZ remains the strongest stock because it has the highest ROIC.In fact, its ROIC is twice as high as closest rival AT&T.This gives VZ significant pricing power to withstand price competition.Another major advantage is the strength of Verizon's network.PC Mag recently rated Verizon Wireless as the fastest mobile network in the U.S. Consumers doesn't hesitate to pay for a fast connection.This is exhibited by VZ's sector leading 133 million subscriber base.Not resting on its laurels, Verizon recently announced the trial of its 5G network.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With data speeds up to 50 times <i>faster</i> than the current 4G network , expect VZ 's growth momentum to pick up steam once that rolls out .
