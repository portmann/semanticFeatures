Reasons Office Is A Key To Microsofts Growth Microsoft Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Microsofts Office cross platform capabilities are a critical factor to future success Truly unlimited storage and a top productivity suite equals a huge value for Microsoft customers For years Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Office productivity suite was a software product that lived on the hard drive of each users computer Today the Office suite still gives users that PC based experience but with far more perks In fact Microsoft has increased the value proposition behind Office and now there are reasons this service is a key to the companys future growth Not that long ago if you wanted Office on an Apple NASDAQ AAPL Mac you had to settle a somewhat outdated software package Many Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL proponents still scoff at the idea of paying for Office when they can use Google Docs for free Still other users might save their work from an open source solution like OpenOffice to their Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN Cloud Drive to avoid the issue all together On the mobile side of things there wasnt such a thing as Office apps on iOS Android users had Office apps but they were limited to smartphones and not full featured Even once Office came to the iPhone iPad users were left using the web versions of the Office programs The first reason Office is key to Microsofts growth is the productivity suite can now be used on all devices with similar capabilities There are slight differences in format of course but in large part if you want to get work done it no longer matters what device you use This is a more significant development than some investors may realize First it means that Microsofts Office suite and the huge profits from its sale are no longer limited to PC or Mac users A few years ago the idea that someone could subscribe to Office from iTunes or Google Play would have been laughable In Microsofts last earnings report consumer revenue increased but was held back by weakness in the Windows division Going forward as Windows revenue stabilizes from the preXP support levels Office stands to generate a bigger piece of the Consumer Devices pie The fact that this cross platform idea is working is obvious from the number of Office users In the last year Office users jumped by more than to million This level of growth is significant because users that are subscribing to the service are less likely to switch to a competing option In addition these subscriptions allow Microsoft to generate predictable annual cash flow as opposed to unpredictable upgrade licensing sales When Office only offered the user multiple installs of these Office programs it might have been difficult to justify this price relative to for a single software license Many Google users would laugh at the idea of paying a year for something that Google Docs does for free Apple users might look at the option of paying around each for Pages Numbers and Keynote and think Microsoft users were crazy However the value proposition changed dramatically late last year when Microsoft announced OneDrive would offer unlimited cloud storage to Office subscribers This is the second reason Office is a key to Microsofts future growth Popular cloud backup services by companies like CrashPlan or Carbonite cost around a year To purchase terabyte of storage through Google or Apple costs and respectively on an annual basis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>offers unlimited storage for a year That being said at this price <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>offers no productivity suite and also limits video storage to videos of minutes or less With the top productivity suite and unlimited storage at a price its competition cant match Microsoft should continue to see increased growth in its Office user base That is very good news for Microsofts future earnings and could steal customers from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Cloud Google Drive and iCloud all at the same time Did Microsoft just hurt PCs and improve its chances in the tablet and smartphone business As if the PC business didnt have enough problems Microsoft might have just struck another blow toward the death of this business Ironically this is the third reason Office is the future of Microsofts growth Each of the companies weve looked at has a business model that encourages users to move toward cloud based solutions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime uses cloud storage for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Video as well as Amazons Cloud Music and Photos Googles Drive YouTube and Google Docs are all cloud based solutions Apples iCloud is based on the ubiquitous availability of information That being said Office s unlimited storage combined with tablet and smartphone apps for Office begs the questionwhy use a PC As more customers move toward using their smartphone and tablets and Microsoft continues to develop better Office apps users wont need a traditional PC to be productive Since users also wont have to worry about localized storage hard drive size ceases to be a consideration In the end Microsofts Office and its upcoming unlimited storage abilities should continue to move traditional Office users toward the subscription model This strong value proposition also should bring in users that otherwise might subscribe to online backup systems Google Drive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Cloud Drive and others This should produce a more consistent cash flow and earnings stream for Microsoft going forward Needless to say better earnings and cash flow is something Microsoft investors will gladly welcome Source Reasons Office Is A Key
