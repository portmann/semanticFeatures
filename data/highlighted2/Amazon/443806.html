These secular trends will drive growth for years to come.However, the US economy is fundamentally weak and the stock market is a Fed-created bubble.GDP in the first quarter increased at a 0.5% annualized rate, the lowest amount since Q1 2014 (and this is with manipulated inflation numbers).Consumer spending has stalled and the unemployment figures are misleading.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The low unemployment rate is a product of low labor force participation , while the strong jobs gains in recent months ( with the exception of last month ) are the result of employers firing full-time workers and replacing them with <i>more</i> part-time employees .
