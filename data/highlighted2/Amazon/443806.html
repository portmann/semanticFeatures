anticipate a better entry point <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is expensive for a reason The firm has one of the strongest moats in the consumer sector and is poised to benefit from a number of secular growth trends These include deeper ecommerce penetration and increased mobile usage particularly in emerging markets the continued rise of the Internet of Things and a shift toward digital media consumption <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has grown its infrastructure in India where an estimated billion people will be online by and has taken on Alibaba with its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>China offering The rise of the Internet of Things and the transfer of massive amounts of data online has created a huge market

usage in the US compared to just three years ago These secular trends will drive growth for years to come However the US economy is fundamentally weak and the stock market is a Fedcreated bubble GDP in the first quarter increased at a annualized rate the lowest amount since Q and this is with manipulated inflation numbers Consumer spending has stalled and the unemployment figures are misleading The low unemployment rate is a product of low labor force participation while the strong jobs gains in recent months with the exception of last month are the result of employers firing fulltime workers and replacing them with more parttime employees Most of the job gains have occurred in the service sector and are lowskill minimum wage jobs This is the reason for the disconnect between strong job growth and weak productivity and output growth Last month we finally got a weak job reading one that paints a more accurate picture of the US economy The Fed knows the US economy is too weak to handle a rate hike but Yellen cannot admit as much as her future at the Fed depends on Clinton becoming president Brexit gives her the excuse she needs to keep rates where they are for the rest of Yellens refusal to raise rates will improve market sentiment and drive valuations higher It wont be long before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>recovers and investors can earn a nice shortterm return if they buy the dip But we think its a better idea to wait until after the election when either the Fed normalizes rates and pricks the bubble or is forced to admit that the economy is weak as the data increasingly contradicts everything they claim The Fed can only paper over the cracks for so long and we expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to fall to a more attractive level in after the fundamental economic weakness becomes more evident At that point it will be a much better time to invest Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks
