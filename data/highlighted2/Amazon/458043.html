the Internet Being Ruined Freakonomics Freakonomics Our latest Freakonomics Radio episode is called Is the Internet Being Ruined You can subscribe to the podcast at iTunes or elsewhere get the RSS feed or listen via the media player above Its a remarkable ecosystem that allows each of us to exercise control over our lives But how much control do we truly have How many of our decisions are really being made by Google and Facebook and Apple And perhaps most importantly is the Internets true potential being squandered Below is a transcript of the episode modified for your reading pleasure For more information on the people and ideas in the episode see the links at the bottom of this post And youll find credits for the music in the episode noted at the end of thetranscript Until August of most people had not heard of Ferguson Mo And then suddenly everyone had An yearold black resident of Ferguson was shot and killed by a white police officer This led to protests chaos more violence The police in Ferguson responded with tear gas and stun grenades ZEYNEP TUFEKCI So on Twitter I noticed that theres a protest in Ferguson that was being met with a lot of police presence Zeynep Tufekci is a professor at the University of North CarolinaChapel Hill She studies the social impact of technology As the Ferguson story was unspooling she was trying to keep up on Twitter and Facebook TUFEKCI There was all this talk on Twitter about what looked like real police overreaction Millions of tweets were apparently sent during this day where people were concentrating on whats going on and I switched to Facebook in the middle of all of this And on Facebook this whole event that had consumed my Twitter feed didnt exist Nothing And then Id switch back to Twitter and it was the topic There were so many people talking about it And Id go to Facebook and Id see nothing So I started switching my algorithm to reverse chronological on Facebook which shows the posts your friends made in order of time rather than Facebooks algorithm And when I do that I would see people talking about Ferguson But Facebooks very sticky in terms of its algorithm It would just switch me back I would try to see what my friends were saying and Facebook would switch me back to its algorithm which would show me the Ice Bucket Challenge Which is great I mean thats a great thing for people to do to donate to research for a disease but it was all over my feed Nothing but Ice Bucket for a while And that was because that challenge was very suited to Facebooks algorithm which likes things that people click like on And it also likes things where you upload your own video and people were uploading their videos of pouring water over their head It was perfect for Facebooks algorithm so it basically took over Facebook Meanwhile this disturbing difficult important conversation about US policing and race relations which would later become a large movement could only exist on Twitter where there was no algorithm and it was peoples interest that was driving the conversation Todays episode of Freakonomics Radio is about the Internet Yep the Internet As we all know it is a remarkable ecosystem that allows each of us to exercise a certain amount of control a certain amount of leverage over our livelihoods our interactions with friends and family and strangers maybe even over our politics But how much leverage and control do we really have Is the Internet really the great democratizer the great decentralizer that we were told it would be Or is all that leverage being recentralized to powerful institutions different ones than in preInternet days but powerful institutions just the same There have always been gatekeepers in every aspect of life throughout history so its not surprising the Internet has them wed be naive to expect otherwise But one of the most intoxicating promises of the Internet was that it would foster a new dimension of openness and independence So on todays show how well is that promise being kept Its pretty easy to argue that the Internet has been a transformative technology although some people argue that it hasnt been That for all its shiny and sexy features it isnt so much a new new thing as it is a sort of booster shot for existing technologies Email and other Internet communication may be faster more flexible and cheaper than snail mail and the landline phone and the telegraph but its still just communication You may be extremely reliant on Uber or Spotify or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but we already had cars and music and catalog stores You may be downright addicted to Facebook or Twitter but we already had well mouths and ears and friends and enemies How transformative has the Internet been for you Your answer probably depends on a lot of factors at what age you started using it exactly how and how deeply you engage with it and maybe the degree to which you want your Internet engagement curated whether by Facebook or Google or as a users agreement might put it by any and all platforms now known or hereafter devised The Internet will of course keep changing and its already changed a lot How did it get to where it is How closely does the modern Internet resemble its original design Those are some of the questions well be trying to answer today The episode was inspired by a recent issue of Daedalus the Journal of the American Academy of Arts Sciences The issue was called The Internet and it featured essays by some of the scholars youll be hearing from in this episode Lets begin at the beginning of the Internet withFreakonomics Radios senior producer Christopher Werth CHRISTOPHER WERTH David Clark first got his hands on a computer in the mids when he was a student at Swarthmore College The IBM computer the school bought was thisbig clunky contraption It filled an entire classroom And he says everyone took turns using it DAVID CLARK At the time I was an electrical engineer and when this computer showed up it actually came with a book with all the schematics And I sat there and I read them and I studied the operating system and I was hooked WERTH Not long after that Clark switched to computer science and went on to get a PhD at MIT In fact hes still there as a senior research scientist at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab But in the s and s Clark was part of a small looseknit group of engineers in academia and at government agencies in the United States and Europe who fantasized about linking all those big clunky computers together so that people all over the world could collaborate They tinkered they experimented and ultimately figured out what this network that would later be called the Internet should look like how it should work and function And to this day Clark says everything we do online sits on top of this largely invisible underlying structure they created For example Clark was a key figure in developing the basic language of the Internet which passes information back and forth by breaking it up into these little pieces called packets CLARK Basically what it does is it numbers all the packets in sequence When theyre received it puts them back in the right order If theres a missing packet it gets sent again So eventually the sequence of packets gets reassembled and then thats handed on to the application at the receiving side WERTHThe important thing to bear in mind he says is that there was no central blueprint for the Internet when it was being developed Engineers like himself and others just had this notion of connecting computers together over long distances And he says it really could have gone any number of ways CLARK We were making this up from scratch as we went And there werent any design principles there werent any guideposts to help us This was a new uncharted territory So recognizing that this is an engineered artifact its not something that just happened helps you to understand that it could have come out different WERTH That is not to say the Internet wouldnt have happened at all In the s there were technologists who were already dreaming about this stuff CLARK One of the really notable visionaries in this area was a man called JCR Licklider Everybody called him Lick And he was a genuine visionary ARCHIVAL TAPE OF JCR LICKLIDER Computer technology has been moving in a way that nothing else people have ever known has moved Heres a field that gets a thousand times as good in years WERTH Licklider was also a director at the Department of Defenses Advanced Research Projects Agency or ARPA It was responsible for the creation of ARPAnet a precursor to the kind of Internet Lick envisioned in the s CLARK Some of the papers he wrote back then are amazing for their predictive quality He talked about interactive chat He talked about the Web although he didnt call it the Web of course We didnt have that name for it But he talked about services online banking and financial services He talked about games shopping online All of these ideas were floating around as potential applications once we built this global network of computers and that was wellarticulated in the s What we were doing in the s was trying to build it WERTHBut people like Clark didnt have any experience in building a network for sharing information at that scale At the time the only thing that had come close had been built by telephone companies And he says they had a very specific use for that network CLARK It was for carrying phone calls And theres a major distinction between the Internet and the telephone system which is that telephones are pretty stupid WERTH Meaning that a telephone itself doesnt really do much its the networks theyre connected to that have all the smarts Telephones are really only good for making and receiving phone calls CLARK All the intelligence in the telephone system is in the switches Thats where phone numbers are translated Thats where calls are forwarded Thats where resources are allocated WERTH Computers however arent stupid They can perform a lot of different functionsTheyre what engineers call generalpurpose devices CLARK And those of us who were building the Internet wanted to build a generalpurpose network to hook generalpurpose computers together WERTH A network that wasnt focused on one specific company the way the phone network at the time was built around ATT or focused on one specific function They wanted it to be versatile For example the first system for sending emails was invented by a computer programmer named Ray Tomlinson in the early s He designed it for the people working on ARPAnet so that theyd have an easier way to communicate with each other And for a long time after it was commercialized Clark says email was the innovative application CLARK Back then to say that you were on the Internet meant that you had an email address So we could have built a network that was dedicated to email but we didnt want to do that We wanted to build a network that was general because that made it possible to introduce new applications without modifying the network WERTH And to accomplish that Clark says they needed to do the opposite of what telephone companies had done In this case it was the network not the devices that needed to be stupid CLARK In fact we wanted to build what we have called the dumb net And our whole goal was to make sure that the network was completely ignorant of what the user was trying to do It just sees data come in one side and it forwards the data and delivers it to the other side Its up to you what that data is And in that respect the core of the Internet is very very simple because we assumed that all the smarts the application code and stuff like that was running on these computers at the edge So in some sense we took the design principle of the telephone system and turned it inside out Thats basically what occupied us during the s What happened in the s is that we had to deal with issues of scale We had a sense of hooking up all the computers in the world The thing that confused us was we misunderstood how many computers there were going to be And then the personal computer comes along And there was this moment when we realized Oh there are not going to be hundreds of thousands of computers There are going to be hundreds of millions of computers WERTH Hundreds of millions of computers The s of course saw the introduction of the World Wide Web And we should be clear the Web and websites that you visit online are accessed through the Internet They are two different things even though we often use those terms interchangeably By according to the Pew Research Center percent of Americans were using the Internet And for the people who ventured online in those early days WERTH That is Yochai Benkler Hes a professor at Harvard Law School and a director at the Berkman Center for Internet Society BENKLER The experience of being a user in that earlier moment was very much one of discovery of constantly being able to stumble on new things That part of it was exhilarating WERTH People were writing on the web creating their own websites and new online communities all of which began disrupting the institutions media and commerce and so on that had been in place for decades BENKLER There were welldefined control points or tollbooths that someone could sit at and decide You get to innovate you dont get to innovate You get to communicate with people you want to communicate you dont get to communicate That changed dramatically with the Internet and you saw a radical decentralization of the ability to speak and innovate and communicate without permission Power was decentralized WERTH And thats basically how we think about the Internet today disrupting and sometimes replacing traditional institutions and industries But as the Internet has grown and the number of global users has topped billion people Benkler says theres been this really worrisome shift with a handful of companies Facebook Apple Google that now have an outsize influence on how we all use the Internet BENKLER What we have seen in the last seven or eight years is that around those open spaces we created in the first two decades a new set of control points is beginning to emerge on the net TUFEKCI Were seeing the birth of a new center of power real powerWe depend on these technologies that have been in many ways wonderful and fascinating and theyve greatly enriched my life but these companies have major power and theyre making significant decisions unilaterally So theres a whole host of new questions that havent even been explored WERTH Like whether were trading that open and exhilarating Internet for a more insular siloed Internet experience like the way Facebook prefers the Ice Bucket Challenge over police protests showing us things it thinks well like instead of what might actually be important Or Yochai Benkler says take the seemingly innocuous shift from the desktop to the mobile Internet BENKLER More than half of Internet access if you think of time and particular uses is now moving to the smartphone WERTH Which has also prompted Internet users to migrate from generalpurpose web browsers to singlepurpose apps your Facebook app your Twitter app your Wall Street Journal app BENKLER When browsers first came out in the s the idea was here is a universal standard for describing what it is you want to say or show and if you use that universal language then anyone using any device can implement this reader And essentially what the browsers did was they decentralized power from the operating system If you were writing for Windows you needed to write for Windows in this way If you were writing for Apple you needed to write for Apple in that way Once you could write something on the web you could write to this general purpose reader the browser and anything could run What happened with the app is that you got specialpurpose containers if you will for every kind of content So you shifted from a generalpurpose platform thats based on open standards and anyone can write what they want to a platform that says Write a very special program that fits only your data Its a complete transformation WERTH To understand that transformation Zeynep Tufekci says just look at the veryproprietary iPhone ecosystem thats been created by Apple TUFECKI It designs the phone and then it designs the operating system and then it decides what apps are available on the operating system or not WERTH iPhone users have to go through ApplesApp Store to add almost anything to their devices And if youre one of the hundreds of thousands of outside developers who produce apps for the iPhoneyou cant just put your app out there Theres an approval process And Yochai Benkler says Apple has been known to reject apps that it finds objectionable BENKLER For example someone developed a game that essentially criticized the manufacturing conditions and the worker conditions at the Chinese company Foxconn that was putting together the iPhone That got banned on the App Store and removed from the App Store TUFEKCI There was another app that was blocked that sent out a notification every time a drone had been used to kill people So it was a political statement to say Look this is how much were using drones to do this And the App Store wouldnt approve this WERTH Apple we should mention has about a percent share of the market for mobileoperating systems in the United States and roughly percent globally TUFECKI Which means if youre not in the App Store youre done because you lost every Apple phone out there WERTH And while these may sound like fairly minor examples Benkler says consider the deal that Apple made to restrict the use of Skype when it first became available on the iPhone in At the time ATT was the iPhones exclusive carrier And ATT essentially told its customers by the way we have this rule about Skype WERTH Skype was not allowed on ATTs cellular spectrum which Benkler says was unfortunate because Skype was this breakthrough technology It had finally figured out a way to carry voice calls over the Internet BENKLER Skype innovated in a way that basically was by many people thought theoretically impossible They didnt need permission If they had needed permission from somebody who runs voice services to put the application on they would have not gotten permission because it would have been considered too poor too weak cant work And yet it did But when Skype comes on the iPhone the first time ATT doesnt want it to be run in competition with its voice service WERTH And to be clear this appapproval business is not confined to Apple Benkler says Google has a long list of reasons it can reject an app for Android its own mobileoperating system And the same goes for Facebook which has a large community of developers who build products and services around Facebook BENKLER You have to persuade Apple or Google and Facebook to let you in Thats the critical point CLARK And this is a very different sort of industrial structure than we imagined when we built the InternetSo theres a kind of regulation or curation of the Internet experience WERTH And he admits that curation can have advantages More control can make it harder for malicious software to get through Clark says security is perhaps one thing he and others should have done differently when the Internet was first being developed CLARK One decision we made is that we wanted to make it possible for any computer to establish a connection to any other On the other hand it opens up a range of problems when all those other computers in the world try to attack you Maybe it wasnt as important as we thought that it be equally easy for every computer in the world to talk to every other one And in fact I would say we sort of overempowered the user if I can say that WERTH And maybe those security concerns whether theyre from hackers or terrorists or government institutions are whats driving some of the shift towards a more regulated curated Internet environment The concern Clark says is that the degree of control that offers will simply allow companies to exploit their market power to make more money CLARK And what we see today with the powerful players and I consider Google and Apple and Facebook to be quite powerful players is I would say a carefully thoughtthrough and notsurprising attempt to build durability into their dominance BENKLER And then the question becomes where does the next Google where does the next Skype where is the next platform going to come that wont need permission of somebody who is already there in power to let them in The Internet in its relatively short history has already evolved a lot As weve been hearing on the show today the shape and pace of this evolution was hardly foreordained its architects intentionally created a wideopen design that would encourage innovation So far most of this innovation has come from America where the Internet itself came from primarily at least This too was hardly foreordained Here is a passage from a book called How Not to Network a NationThe Uneasy History of the Soviet Internet by Benjamin Peters In late September a year after the ARPANET went online the Soviet cyberneticist Viktor Glushkov boarded a train from Kiev to Moscow to attend what proved to be a fateful meeting for the future of what we might call the Soviet Internet The Politburo convened that day to hear Glushkovs proposal and decide whether to build a massive nationwide computer network for citizen use or what Glushkov called the AllState Automated System the most ambitious computer network of its kind in the world at the timeIt was to connect tens of thousands of computer centers and to manage and optimize in real time the communications between hundreds of thousands of workers factory managers and regional and national administrators But the Soviet Internet didnt happen As Peters writes it was hardly for want of Soviet technical capability But instead because of quote entrenched bureaucratic corruption and conflicts of interest at the heart of the system And so the Internyet In America meanwhile a young Sovietborn computer scientist named Sergey Brin whose father and grandfather were both mathematicians in the Soviet Union went on to be a cofounder of Google a company that essentially owns huge swaths of the Internet and which last year earned north of billion in online ad revenue roughly a third of the global total So as humble as the Internets beginnings may have been the financial stakes have become very very high In fact one reason that European governments are trying to rein in the dominance of tech firms like Google and Facebook and Uber is that the vast majority of profits of those online platforms even when used in Europe are flowing back to American firms But beyond the billions of dollars that are up for grabs theres something perhaps even more valuable human mindshare We began this episode with the police shooting and subsequent protests in Ferguson Mo TUFEKCI There was all this talk on Twitter about what looked like real police overreaction Zeynep Tufekci had noticed that while Twitter was full of Ferguson news Facebooks algorithm and its emphasis on what people Like had largely missed the protests TUFEKCI Id go to Facebook and Id see nothing And the fact that there wasnt even an editor to hold responsible and say You guys are designing a computer program that is making decisions that has significant consequences for what we as a public discuss And I cant even tell whats going on let alone ask somebody What is going on was to me a very telling moment These complex algorithms are having all these downstream effects that nobody is really thinking or systemically researching partly because Facebook holds all the private data and partly because its so untransparent that its hard to study This is not saying Facebook was intentionally censoring Ferguson news In fact that would have been an easier story Then we would have said Oh how horrible Its more complex Its not that Facebooks censoring anything directly its that Facebook is unleashing these computer programs that are designed to make Facebook advertiserfriendly and that are designed to keep us on the site We spoke to Tufekci a few weeks before some people began arguing that Facebook has been censoring news or at least massaging it When you have a lot of control over an environment as Facebook does it must be tempting to shape that environment if only subtly a bit more to your liking The incentives might be financial or social or moral or some combination thereof Google for instance recently stopped allowing ads for payday loans the highinterest shortterm loans that we discussed in a recent episode called Are Payday Loans Really as Evil as People Say But what most troubles someone like Zeynep Tufekci who studies the social impact of technology is how much of this technology is being well wasted Back to Facebook TUFEKCI Theres all these really smart engineers Theyre the brightest computer scientists and all theyre thinking about is How do I keep someone on Facebook for more minutes Whats the exact combination of things that will keep them staying on the site for as long as possible so we can show them as much advertisement as possible And given the amazing revolutionary fascinating disruptive potential of the Internet it really feels like a waste to have this much intelligence and smarts being used to figure out how to keep you clicking on ten more animal videos Basically Facebook is an environment in which youre structurally architecturally encouraged to be positive and liking things And that means that most peoples feeds are dominated by happy news Mine is dominated by engagements marriages new babies doing cute things Now what I want to do is I want to tell my friend Im glad you had a baby And of course when I see one I click on Like But Facebook interprets that as Show me even more babies And that means a lot of other things I really care about and post about theyre hardly seen because the primary signal is this Like button And you might say Well its a company and the point of it is to make money So of course its just going to try to keep you on the site Well thats true except what this company is producing isnt just widgets its producing our new stcentury public sphere If I want to connect to people all over the world they all use Facebook so Ive got to be on Facebook too Theres this feedback cycle which means Facebook is more valuable because a lot of people are already on Facebook In fact they had a very interesting experiment in which Facebook was trying to figure out how hiccups in the program were affecting the users So they made their mobile sites crash on purpose And they wanted to know how many times they could crash it before somebody gave up using Facebook But they couldnt make people give it up People would just keep coming back The reason for it isnt some abstract thing Its because that is where your friends and your family and your acquaintances are Of course youre going to come back Its a very human thing to to connect with their friends because theres no alternative Look I have to say Ive written articles about how great Facebook is for opposing authoritarianism So its not like Im antiFacebook In fact I care about it deeply But it also feels dangerous because we know from Facebooks own experiments that slight tweaks to its feed and its algorithm have the potential to influence things like voter turnout and have the potential to even throw close elections And we know this from Facebooks own published research If Facebook doesnt like a political candidate and tweaks a few lines of code so that its algorithm slightly suppresses positive stories about that candidate even if you share them people in your feed never see it for example youd never know this happened But it would have a global effect Im not saying Facebook is doing it Im just saying youd never know We dont even have any clue whats actually going on what that algorithm is actually doing So its not just that Facebook is a significant public space Its also a place where you can be effectively nudged by the central entity that has an enormous amount of data about you Now you have things like Twitter that create an environment that is not shaped by an algorithm but theyre under great pressure by Wall Street to turn to a kind of Facebookalgorithmic feed that is designed to make it more advertiserfriendly Advertisement is a teeny tiny tiny slice of human experience but its dominating our online experience This seems ridiculous to me And that I think has been the Internets major turning point Because the dilemma that Internet companies faced as they were scaling up was which financing model to choose And they could either try to charge the user some amount or you could go with advertisers They chose the ad financing which means you have to please Wall Street and advertisers which means you have to have a certain kind of experience online So we as Facebooks users may have a moral claim because its our content that makes the place run but Facebook is responsive significantly to its advertisers Think of all the things that cant be adequately addressed by a medium that is geared towards advertiserfriendliness CLARK And of course theres only a certain amount of money thats flowing into the Internet The advertising model means that a lot of the Internet is free CLARK Facebook is free Twitter is free CLARK As more and more people build applications on the Internet and try to support those applications off of advertising in some sense there may not be enough advertising money to go around Just as a rough number theres an organization called the Interactive Advertising Bureau which tracks how much money is spent on interactive ads And very roughly speaking in the United States the amount of money spent per broadband household is about a month And if youre a broadband customer you pay a certain amount of money a month for your broadband In this country it runs a month for broadband internet access which is to say that the totality of what Im calling the free Internet or the advertisingsupported internet experience is being supported on less money per month per household than youre paying for the broadband access And theyre big players in that space like Google who are earning a lot of that money Facebook is earning a lot of that money So wheres the money to support the small players coming from And of course there is a lot of tension around advertising because in order to show you just the most perfect ad for you they are tracking your behavior they are modeling you demographically and people are very upset about the degree to which everybody in the world seems to know everything about you CLARK Its possible were going to go to a different revenue model for the Internet in which more and more of the application services that you use are in fact paid for by some sort of fee that you pay as opposed to being supported by advertising And maybe some consumers would be happier with that because there might be less of this tracking of your behavior On the other hand maybe its only privacy advocates who are worried about all that tracking We dont quite know TUFEKCI At the moment if Im using a new service Im always looking for ones that have a small fee of some sort I want to be their customer I dont want to be advertised to or my data sold So Im trying to find things like that And we need a new kind of innovation that allows a small amount of payment to be dispersed over the Internet so that theyre not all dependent on the advertising I know a lot of people want to use sites that are free And I just want to say that comes with real costs BENKLER The way economists would talk about it is externalities By using this very convenient streamlined framework you are embracing a system that makes innovation and creativity and dissent a little bit harder And the question becomes how do we start to build systems that will make it as convenient as possible to follow the practices that actually improve our innovation environment improve our democratic or creative discourse environment without making it so hard that essentially people constantly need to wear a hairshirt in order to make that happen Thats hard Thats a challenge So far that challenge has mostly been handled by government regulators The FCC for instance last year issued an Open Internet Order to enact what it calls strong sustainable rules grounded in multiple sources of legal authority to protect the Open Internet and ensure that Americans reap the economic social and civic benefits of an Open Internet today and into the future President BarackObama himself has been a cheerleader for net neutrality CLARK Theres a fear and I understand the fear that powerful players who control the pipes or the wires to your house will somehow use the leverage to influence the experience you have and maybe selectively charge people for using the network or perhaps favor their own applications or their friends applications over thirdparty apps The FCCs order prevents broadband and cellular providers from manipulating their networks in order to either punish or favor certain online channels Benkler says he could see the FCC weakening Apples control over the iPhone BENKLER You could imagine the App Store being so closely tied to the smartphone which is so closely tied to cellular Thats something where you could see netneutrality extending one layer up This is not the US governments first attempt at leveling the online playing field In the Department of Justice brought an antitrust case against Microsoft for bundling a Microsoft web browser Internet Explorer with its Windows operating system Now maybe you cant blame Microsoft for trying to monopolize web traffic just as you couldnt blame a thcentury railroad baron for trying to monopolize rail traffic But Microsoft did not get away with it Facing a breakup of the company it settled with the Justice Department and allowed other web browsers into its operating system As it happens Microsoft had already done a pretty good job of putting rival browsers out of business BENKLER The antitrust case essentially came too late But the critical component was the fact that you actually had development of a free and opensource software alternative in the form of Firefox Firefox is the browser developed by the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation It has roughly percent of US market share in browsers But with more than percent is the Chrome browser Microsofts Internet Explorer is still hanging on with about percent And then Safari has nearly percent Safari belongs to Apple Chrome to Google So no unfamiliar names there But Yochai Benkler argues that the biggest challenge to an open Internet is that most consumers just dont know much or maybe care much about how the online universe really works BENKLER Educating consumers to care about the information environment in the same way that they care about the physical environment in their consumption choices is going to be absolutely critical I think finding a way to create some sort of a health or an ingredients label that some independent organization can say Here are the components of what goes in to your information product Heres how they deal with privacy Heres how they deal with creative innovation Heres how they deal with work practices Thats in some sense the holy grail because once you actually find a way to standardize our understanding of what are the practices we find problematic and applying them to different services the work of getting people to understand that they need to care about our information environment no less than we need to care about our physical environment will be a little easier Its hard to shape consumer practices Its hard to get people to recycle it took years Its hard to get people to care about the ingredients of what they eat but its possible Weve seen it done over and over again At the moment Id say that people just dont know And the critical first step is to get people to care and to find ways that are easy for people to read that are a decent representation of the problems embodied by the products they so love In Benklers view and maybe yours too the Internet has the potential to create a more engaged and creative society The risk he says is that gatekeepers and profiteers and others will turn it into a more passive ecosystem less interactive than it could be more like watching television BENKLER Thats the badcase scenario We are not talking about Big Brother and all the misery We are talking about something that is much more like Brave New World and we are pretty happy on the whole daytoday and we dont know what the options are beyond that because we have more or less been shaped and manipulated to enjoy what we are enjoying You could argue that being manipulated to enjoy what we are enjoying is not the worst thing in the world Perhaps the healthiest way to assess the Internet at this moment in history is just to acknowledge that we cant really predict at all how its going to keep evolving right We humans are pretty bad at predicting everything else why should the future of the Internet be any different Its easy and perhaps natural to occasionally get hysterical about any new technology and the Internet we have to remind ourselves is still relatively new Every time we learn that a terrorist group has used the Internet to recruit members theres a call to somehow alter the Internet to prevent that But technologies themselves are pretty neutral If I was the guy who discovered fire you might have seen it primarily as a threat Hey Dubner get that outta here Youre going to burn down the whole cave Itd probably take me a while to persuade you that fire is actually pretty useful for cooking food and keeping warm I think most of us would agree that the Internet has proven pretty useful in certain doses and circumstances But only a fool would think that youre not going to get burned now and again Freakonomics Radio is
