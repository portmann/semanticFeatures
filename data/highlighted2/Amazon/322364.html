( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is in a unique position of enjoying rapid growth , but suffers from a flat net income condition . As shipping costs increase with shipping volumes, AMZN needs to find a way out of the maze...and Prime isn't helping one bit despite its "success".<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) shipping problems are what you <b>could</b> call a well-known secret . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As the company 's business grows , its shipping costs expand equally fast , putting it in <b>somewhat</b> of a dilemma .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>AMZN 's rapid growth makes it stand out for another reason - it 's <b>possibly</b> the only company in the world where the revenue path is exponential but net profit remains flat .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Weakest Link : The Cost of Shipping They say a chain is only as strong as its weakest link , and this is where <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's supply chain is at its weakest - the cost of shipping the sheer volume of products the company deals with and getting them to individual customers . As the e-commerce top dog , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> offers unparalleled convenience . At the click of a button, people have come to expect their product to be delivered right to their doorstep.It is this very convenience that differentiates online sellers from brick-and-mortar retailers.Next in importance is the element of choice.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>No brick-and-mortar retailer can ever <b>hope</b> to match the range than an online retailer can .  (Uncertainty) </span>Not even Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ).To put this in perspective , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sells over 250 million different products , of which only 52 million are books . WMT, on the other hand, only manages a relatively meager 4.2 million individual products despite having revenues over five times that of AMZN.While all this is well and good, Wal-Mart doesn't have to contend with the logistics costs of last-mile shipment.In order to be truly value-oriented , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> must deliver to its customers ' homes . And that's where the problem begins.What originally started out as a convenience and choice advantage now turns out to be one of the most painful overheads a company can imagine.Below , I 've put together some data on what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> actually made and spent ( gross and net ) between 2011 and 2015 on shipping its products . From the divergence of the two graph lines , the problem is clear : <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> needs to control its shipping costs now rather than later . Admittedly, it has done a brilliant job of keeping the cost of shipping-related expenses as a percentage of net sales at a steady 4.7% since 2012, but the last leg of fulfillment remains the most expensive part of the supply chain.As you can clearly see from the graph below, the growth in terms of size and scale did not have a significant impact on reducing shipping costs.Since 2012, it added a whopping $50 billion in sales, but shipping as a percentage of sales remains stuck at the same level year over year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There seem to be no economies of scale at work in the business of online retailing , but what 's exacerbating the problem even <i>more</i> is the success of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>According to one source , the average order per Prime member (excluding digital sales) was $47.31 in June 2012.Even if we retain that figure for 2015, at a spend of $1,500 , that means at least 30 orders over the course of a year.Now , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> already offers free shipping for products over $ 35 , so a Prime customer making an order of $ 47.31 on average merely gets upgraded to two-day shipping free of cost . The cost of that shipping for the test order that I took to the final checkout page showed me this: Look at that two-day shipping cost for a $50 product.If I were an "average" Prime customer, the company would essentially be footing a bill of $13.38 X 30 orders per year, or $400!This is what I fail to understand: how can an average $400 shipping cost per customer be supported by a $99 subscription?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Out of that gross mismatch is where I <b>believe</b> lawsuits such as this are coming from .  (Uncertainty) </span>I cannot imagine that a company would spend anywhere near $400 per customer from its own pocket to meet the shipping needs of each "average" Prime member paying $99 a year.It just doesn't make sense.No matter how you tweak those numbers - lower/higher per-order value, lower/higher spend per Prime customer or lower/higher average orders per year per customer, the end result will still be the same - there's a $400 charge to ship 30 orders worth $50.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>My math might be off because of several other factors , but I 'm sure that I 'm <b>approximately</b> right rather than completely off the mark .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The best <b>possible</b> way out for the company is to enter into the shipping and logistics segment and thereby directly compete with logistics partners like UPS ( NYSE : UPS ) and FedEx ( NYSE : FDX ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>But the company knows that this will jeopardize any preferential treatment it currently receives as UPS's biggest customer, for example.With margins already sliver thin, this isn't something it can afford.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Nevertheless , AMZN <b>seems</b> to be putting together the technology and capability in bits and pieces , all the while claiming that its intent is to `` complement '' its current vendors during peak season .  (Uncertainty) </span>Here are some of its recent activities in that direction : In 2014 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> moved in to acquire a 4.2 % stake in Yodel , a U.K.-based parcel delivery service ; it also bought a 25 % stake in Colis Prive , a French delivery service company and took that to 100 % last year . These two were minor acquisitions far away from AMZN's home ground in the United States so they didn't cause that many ripples.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But when the company started negotiating a lease for 20 cargo planes , analysts went berserk <b>speculating</b> on what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's intent was . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>To further complicate the matter, this was shortly after the company made the news for acquiring a conspicuously large consignment of trucks to aid delivery.A few weeks ago , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> China was awarded a license to operate as an ocean freight forwarder - a move that will allow the company to ship directly from Chinese factories to consumers in the United States . Now, when you look at the pieces together, it makes sense.The company has a license to ship products to the U.S.; has a fleet of cargo carriers to take those consignments to various warehouses around the country; and has a shiny new fleet of trucks that can be used for last-mile delivery.Light bulb!<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do n't <b>believe</b> the analysts had it right when they said <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was going to take UPS and FedEx head-on . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I think what 's happening is that AMZN is merely trying to reduce its shipping fee and gain <i>more</i> control over customer experience .  (Surprise) </span>Besides, this is happening on a miniscule scale to what the likes of UPS or FedEx are capable of.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does intend to compete with logistics giants , it would have to invest billions of dollars into technology , hardware and manpower . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>It doesn't (yet) have the expertise it requires to manage shipping operations country-wide in the United States.All of its key acquisitions in this domain are happening outside the country, and in small but steady increments.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> it 's gearing up to handle a significant portion of its own shipping needs while slowly acquiring the expertise required to run such an operation efficiently ; but not moving so fast that it will upset its current arrangements with local and national shippers within the United States .  (Uncertainty) </span>Strategically, I think the company is doing the right thing: protecting its interests by focusing on its customers' needs and their obligations to shareholders.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Investor-speak : What to Expect from AMZN There have been several reports on how <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is trying to get into the delivery business and topple UPS , FedEx and DHL , but I think that 's just imaginative <b>speculation</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In fact , I 'm <b>surprised</b> that highly respected publications would even buy into that sort of faulty deductive reasoning .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Gain <i>more</i> control over the shipping component of its supply chain in order to avoid or at least mitigate the effects of peak season demand .  (Surprise) </span>Understand the logistics business by acquiring the know-how and technology one piece at a time.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Prepare for any <b>unexpected</b> rises in shipping costs , which will severely impact its bottom line and , therefore , its already faltering profitability as a company .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Reduce its <b>dependency</b> on major carriers across the world .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As I briefly mentioned <i>earlier</i> , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> faces the unique problem of a flat profit margin despite aggressive sales growth year after year . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I expect this trend will continue for several <i>more</i> quarters until one of these things happens : AWS becomes a significant contributor to the bottom line .  (Surprise) </span>As the competition intensifies within the e-commerce space, there will be plenty of opportunities to buy into AMZN.This is not the company to get into for the short term.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You will have to put on your telescopic goggles and increase your exposure whenever opportunities arise , which , I <b>believe</b> , there will be plenty of over the next few years .
