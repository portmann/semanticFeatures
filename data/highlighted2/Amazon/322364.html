class='textDiv'>Amazons Pursuit Of Shipping Excellence Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is in a unique position of enjoying rapid growth but suffers from a flat net income condition As shipping costs increase with shipping volumes AMZN needs to find a way out of the mazeand Prime isnt helping one bit despite its success Amazons NASDAQ AMZN shipping problems are what you could call a wellknown secret As the companys business grows its shipping costs expand equally fast putting it in somewhat of a dilemma AMZNs rapid growth makes it stand out for another reason its possibly the only company in the world where the revenue path is exponential but net profit remains flat Amazons Weakest Link The Cost of Shipping They say a chain is only as strong as its weakest link and this is where Amazons supply chain is at its weakest the cost of shipping the sheer volume of products the company deals with and getting them to individual customers As the ecommerce top dog <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>offers unparalleled convenience At the click of a button people have come to expect their product to be delivered right to their doorstep It is this very convenience that differentiates online sellers from brickandmortar retailers Next in importance is the element of choice No brickandmortar retailer can ever hope to match the range than an online retailer can Not even WalMart NYSE WMT To put this in perspective <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sells over million different products of which only million are books WMT on the other hand only manages a relatively meager million individual products despite having revenues over five times that of AMZN While all this is well and good WalMart doesnt have to contend with the logistics costs of lastmile shipment In order to be truly valueoriented <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>must deliver to its customers homes And thats where the problem begins What originally started out as a convenience and choice advantage now turns out to be one of the most painful overheads a company can imagine Below Ive put together some data on what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>actually made and spent gross and net between and on shipping its products From the divergence of the two graph lines the problem is clear <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>needs to control its shipping costs now rather than later Admittedly it has done a brilliant job of keeping the cost of shippingrelated expenses as a percentage of net sales at a steady since but the last leg of fulfillment remains the most expensive part of the supply chain As you can clearly see from the graph below the growth in terms of size and scale did not have a significant impact on reducing shipping costs Since it added a whopping billion in sales but shipping as a percentage of sales remains stuck at the same level year over year There seem to be no economies of scale at work in the business of online retailing but whats exacerbating the problem even more is the success of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime According to one source the average order per Prime member excluding digital sales was in June Even if we retain that figure for at a spend of that means at least orders over the course of a year Now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>already offers free shipping for products over so a Prime customer making an order of on average merely gets upgraded to twoday shipping free of cost The cost of that shipping for the test order that I took to the final checkout page showed me this Look at that twoday shipping cost for a product If I were an average Prime customer the company would essentially be footing a bill of X orders per year or This is what I fail to understand how can an average shipping cost per customer be supported by a subscription Out of that gross mismatch is where I believe lawsuits such as this are coming from I cannot imagine that a company would spend anywhere near per customer from its own pocket to meet the shipping needs of each average Prime member paying a year It just doesnt make sense No matter how you tweak those numbers lowerhigher perorder value lowerhigher spend per Prime customer or lowerhigher average orders per year per customer the end result will still be the same theres a charge to ship orders worth My math might be off because of several other factors but Im sure that Im approximately right rather than completely off the mark The best possible way out for the company is to enter into the shipping and logistics segment and thereby directly compete with logistics partners like UPS NYSE UPS and FedEx NYSE FDX But the company knows that this will jeopardize any preferential treatment it currently receives as UPSs biggest customer for example With margins already sliver thin this isnt something it can afford Nevertheless AMZN seems to be putting together the technology and capability in bits and pieces all the while claiming that its intent is to complement its current vendors during peak season Here are some of its recent activities in that direction In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>moved in to acquire a stake in Yodel a UKbased parcel delivery service it also bought a stake in Colis Prive a French delivery service company and took that to last year These two were minor acquisitions far away from AMZNs home ground in the United States so they didnt cause that many ripples But when the company started negotiating a lease for cargo planes analysts went berserk speculating on what Amazons intent was To further complicate the matter this was shortly after the company made the news for acquiring a conspicuously large consignment of trucks to aid delivery A few weeks ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>China was awarded a license to operate as an ocean freight forwarder a move that will allow the company to ship directly from Chinese factories to consumers in the United States Now when you look at the pieces together it makes sense The company has a license to ship products to the US has a fleet of cargo carriers to take those consignments to various warehouses around the country and has a shiny new fleet of trucks that can be used for lastmile delivery Light bulb I dont believe the analysts had it right when they said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was going to take UPS and FedEx headon I think whats happening is that AMZN is merely trying to reduce its shipping fee and gain more control over customer experience Besides this is happening on a miniscule scale to what the likes of UPS or FedEx are capable of If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does intend to compete with logistics giants it would have to invest billions of dollars into technology hardware and manpower It doesnt yet have the expertise it requires to manage shipping operations countrywide in the United States All of its key acquisitions in this domain are happening outside the country and in small but steady increments I believe its gearing up to handle a significant portion of its own shipping needs while slowly acquiring the expertise required to run such an operation efficiently but not moving so fast that it will upset its current arrangements with local and national shippers within the United States Strategically I think the company is doing the right thing protecting its interests by focusing on its customers needs and their obligations to shareholders Investorspeak What to Expect from AMZN There have been several reports on how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is trying to get into the delivery business and topple UPS FedEx and DHL but I think thats just imaginative speculation In fact Im surprised that highly respected publications would even buy into that sort of faulty deductive reasoning Gain more control over the shipping component of its supply chain in order to avoid or at least mitigate the effects of peak season demand Understand the logistics business by acquiring the knowhow and technology one piece at a time Prepare for any unexpected rises in shipping costs which will severely impact its bottom line and therefore its already faltering profitability as a company Reduce its dependency on major carriers across the world As I briefly mentioned earlier <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>faces the unique problem of a flat profit margin despite aggressive sales growth year after year I expect this trend will continue for several more quarters until one of these things happens AWS becomes a significant contributor to the bottom line As the competition intensifies within the ecommerce space there will be plenty of opportunities to buy into AMZN This is not the company to get into for the short term You will have to put on your telescopic goggles and increase your exposure whenever opportunities arise which I believe there will be plenty of over the next few
