Now, when you look at the pieces together, it makes sense.The company has a license to ship products to the U.S.; has a fleet of cargo carriers to take those consignments to various warehouses around the country; and has a shiny new fleet of trucks that can be used for last-mile delivery.Light bulb!<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do n't <b>believe</b> the analysts had it right when they said <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was going to take UPS and FedEx head-on . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I think what 's happening is that AMZN is merely trying to reduce its shipping fee and gain <i>more</i> control over customer experience .  (Surprise) </span>Besides, this is happening on a miniscule scale to what the likes of UPS or FedEx are capable of.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does intend to compete with logistics giants , it would have to invest billions of dollars into technology , hardware and manpower . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>It doesn't (yet) have the expertise it requires to manage shipping operations country-wide in the United States.All of its key acquisitions in this domain are happening outside the country, and in small but steady increments.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> it 's gearing up to handle a significant portion of its own shipping needs while slowly acquiring the expertise required to run such an operation efficiently ; but not moving so fast that it will upset its current arrangements with local and national shippers within the United States .  (Uncertainty) </span>Strategically, I think the company is doing the right thing: protecting its interests by focusing on its customers' needs and their obligations to shareholders.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Investor-speak : What to Expect from AMZN There have been several reports on how <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is trying to get into the delivery business and topple UPS , FedEx and DHL , but I think that 's just imaginative <b>speculation</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In fact , I 'm <b>surprised</b> that highly respected publications would even buy into that sort of faulty deductive reasoning .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Gain <i>more</i> control over the shipping component of its supply chain in order to avoid or at least mitigate the effects of peak season demand .  (Surprise) </span>Understand the logistics business by acquiring the know-how and technology one piece at a time.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Prepare for any <b>unexpected</b> rises in shipping costs , which will severely impact its bottom line and , therefore , its already faltering profitability as a company .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Reduce its <b>dependency</b> on major carriers across the world .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As I briefly mentioned <i>earlier</i> , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> faces the unique problem of a flat profit margin despite aggressive sales growth year after year . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I expect this trend will continue for several <i>more</i> quarters until one of these things happens : AWS becomes a significant contributor to the bottom line .  (Surprise) </span>As the competition intensifies within the e-commerce space, there will be plenty of opportunities to buy into AMZN.This is not the company to get into for the short term.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You will have to put on your telescopic goggles and increase your exposure whenever opportunities arise , which , I <b>believe</b> , there will be plenty of over the next few years .
