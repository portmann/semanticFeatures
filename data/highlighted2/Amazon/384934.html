( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Investors <b>may</b> be <b>wondering</b> if there is still upside in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's share price given its stellar performance . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A free cash flow perpetual growth model with reasonable <b>assumptions</b> indicates that upside still remains .  (Uncertainty) </span>With a market capitalization of $ 296bn and a P/E of 505 <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) is one of the most glamorous growth stocks out there . Because <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's valuation is clearly reliant upon future earnings growth it is difficult to generate a valuation that has a high degree of certainty . Even the slightest change in growth projections has a dramatic impact on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's potential upside or downside . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In order to gauge <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> as an investment we must ask ourselves the following : What are the underlying <b>assumptions</b> we must make about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's barriers to entry ? (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Are both of the findings to the above reasonable and is there still room for additional upside?We will see that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is still being undervalued by the market even given the awesome outperformance it has achieved to date . Let 's dive right into it with a perpetual growth model for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's free cash flows . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Years 0-5 are <b>variable</b> and for year 6 and beyond we apply a perpetual growth rate to free cash flow discounted by WACC .  (Uncertainty) </span>The image below displays the top line results.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I will discuss the <b>assumptions</b> behind these results soon .  (Uncertainty) </span>The above matrix indicates that at a perpetual growth rate of 2 % in free cash flows after year 5 and a WACC of 9.7 % , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is worth $ 765.50 a share . This gives us 22% upside from the current price of $627.90.You will notice that this figure is broadly in line with analyst consensus of $740.84.As you can see <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's valuation is very sensitive to small adjustments to the rate of perpetual growth and WACC . We can see that right now <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is trading at around an implied 1.5 % perpetual growth in free cash flows after year 5 and an implied 10.7 % WACC . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In other words the market is still valuing <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> relatively <b>cautiously</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We can see that I have <b>assumed</b> YoY revenue growth halves from 22 % to 11 % by 2021 and that EBITDA and free cash flow margins continue to improve as scale is achieved .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It also has been <b>assumed</b> that in order to finance growth no additional equity or debt will be raised .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is worth noting that the potential addition of debt would reduce <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's WACC and boost its valuation , although this increases interest expense and the <b>probability</b> of insolvency . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The issue of barriers to entry is critical to this valuation model.In theory a company cannot produce profitable growth if there are no barriers to entry.Investment will always end up equaling return.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Because we have <b>assumed</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's growth will be profitable <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> must hold onto their competitive advantages in order to justify this valuation . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's competitive advantage over the likes of Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) is their low cost and strategically placed warehousing as well as their investment in low-cost product distribution channels . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> the above is very reasonable .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Retailers with <i>higher</i> cost structures like Wal-Mart are miles behind <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's online investment and they are unlikely to ever catch up . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>On top of this <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> benefits from the secular growth in global e-commerce . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the valuation side of things halving revenue growth over the next five years also <b>could</b> be seen as being conservative given their track record .  (Uncertainty) </span>A 2% terminal free cash flow growth also is reasonable.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The addition of debt is still <b>possible</b> and hence a reduction in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's current 9.68 % WACC also is <b>possible</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The WACC of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's peers currently sits at 8.6 % and giving <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> this WACC would cause the valuation to jump to $ 890.36 a share . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To conclude , this valuation is still based upon uncertain future <b>variables</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>We must use our experience and knowledge of the industry to ascertain whether <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's currently implied growth and discount rates are justified given their competitive advantages . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I <b>believe</b> that the current price is not only justified but there is likely even <i>more</i> upside ahead based on the findings of this model .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite all of this , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is clearly not a suitable investment for conservative value investors as actual future performance could deviate significantly from what has been <b>assumed</b> in my model . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As I have demonstrated <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's fair value is extremely sensitive to <b>assumptions</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Furthermore some investors <b>may</b> feel <i>more</i> comfortable with a <i>greater</i> margin of safety by buying <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's future profitable growth at a <i>steeper</i> discount than 22 % . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Bonus : Complete list of <b>assumptions</b> for years 0-5 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I have included a complete list of the <b>assumptions</b> underpinning this model in the below image .
