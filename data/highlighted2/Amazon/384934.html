<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Too Expensive Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Investors may be wondering if there is still upside in Amazons share price given its stellar performance A free cash flow perpetual growth model with reasonable assumptions indicates that upside still remains With a market capitalization of bn and a PE of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN is one of the most glamorous growth stocks out there Because Amazons valuation is clearly reliant upon future earnings growth it is difficult to generate a valuation that has a high degree of certainty Even the slightest change in growth projections has a dramatic impact on Amazons potential upside or downside In order to gauge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as an investment we must ask ourselves the following What are the underlying assumptions we must make about Amazons barriers to entry Are both of the findings to the above reasonable and is there still room for additional upside We will see that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is still being undervalued by the market even given the awesome outperformance it has achieved to date Lets dive right into it with a perpetual growth model for Amazons free cash flows Years are variable and for year and beyond we apply a perpetual growth rate to free cash flow discounted by WACC The image below displays the top line results I will discuss the assumptions behind these results soon The above matrix indicates that at a perpetual growth rate of in free cash flows after year and a WACC of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is worth a share This gives us upside from the current price of You will notice that this figure is broadly in line with analyst consensus of As you can see Amazons valuation is very sensitive to small adjustments to the rate of perpetual growth and WACC We can see that right now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is trading at around an implied perpetual growth in free cash flows after year and an implied WACC In other words the market is still valuing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>relatively cautiously We can see that I have assumed YoY revenue growth halves from to by and that EBITDA and free cash flow margins continue to improve as scale is achieved It also has been assumed that in order to finance growth no additional equity or debt will be raised It is worth noting that the potential addition of debt would reduce Amazons WACC and boost its valuation although this increases interest expense and the probability of insolvency The issue of barriers to entry is critical to this valuation model In theory a company cannot produce profitable growth if there are no barriers to entry Investment will always end up equaling return Because we have assumed that Amazons growth will be profitable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>must hold onto their competitive advantages in order to justify this valuation Amazons competitive advantage over the likes of WalMart NYSE WMT is their low cost and strategically placed warehousing as well as their investment in lowcost product distribution channels I believe the above is very reasonable Retailers with higher cost structures like WalMart are miles behind Amazons online investment and they are unlikely to ever catch up On top of this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>benefits from the secular growth in global ecommerce On the valuation side of things halving revenue growth over the next five years also could be seen as being conservative given their track record A terminal free cash flow growth also is reasonable The addition of debt is still possible and hence a reduction in Amazons current WACC also is possible The WACC of Amazons peers currently sits at and giving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>this WACC would cause the valuation to jump to a share To conclude this valuation is still based upon uncertain future variables We must use our experience and knowledge of the industry to ascertain whether Amazons currently implied growth and discount rates are justified given their competitive advantages I believe that the current price is not only justified but there is likely even more upside ahead based on the findings of this model Despite all of this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is clearly not a suitable investment for conservative value investors as actual future performance could deviate significantly from what has been assumed in my model As I have demonstrated Amazons fair value is extremely sensitive to assumptions Furthermore some investors may feel more comfortable with a greater margin of safety by buying Amazons future profitable growth at a steeper discount than Bonus Complete list of assumptions for years I have included a complete list of the assumptions underpinning this model in the below image This is for the benefit of those who want to know exactly what has been assumed throughout this analysis Thanks
