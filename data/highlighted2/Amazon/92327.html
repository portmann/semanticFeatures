class='textDiv'>Amazoncom A New Gauntlet Is Thrown Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Several developments took place Most are interesting but lowimpact However one of the developments can have a large impact on Amazoncom Amazoncom has not yet responded to that true gauntlet thrown in its general direction That said I expect Amazoncom to respond during Q There will be a large impact on its earnings once it does respond There have been a few developments of notice regarding Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN as of late These developments deserve notice both because of what Amazoncom did and because of what it didnt do Ill cover these developments in this article One of the recent news is that Amazoncom will start reporting its true revenues to local tax authorities in the UK Germany Italy and Spain This is in place of its present practive of funneling most of the revenues through Luxembourg to avoid taxes Since Amazoncom isnt really that profitable overall in its International operations one ought not to expect a major increase in taxes from this move Still some increase is to be expected which given Amazoncoms very low profit base can always be relevant For instance we have the following WSJ linked abovesubscription required quote The UK generally considered more businessfriendly also recently passed a budget that increased taxes for companies deemed to be aggressively trying to avoid taxes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>said it paid million million of taxes in the UK on million of revenue in according to the most recently available public filings So apparently Amazoncom reported just million in revenue in the UK in Now according to Amazoncoms K this revenue was as high as billion in that same year billion with GBPUSD which isnt far from where it stood during most of is billion or around x more than what Amazoncom was supposedly reporting Thus if those taxes were to follow the same proportion it would still imply something like an additional million cost This is something to be monitored as Amazoncoms use of Europes diverging VAT value added tax rates might also be at stake If that were so those could imply higher prices for endcustomers which could then have a larger impact on sales Another development has to do with Amazoncom launching a program where small light and cheap items will have free shipping This is so even if the customer is not a Prime member and doesnt meet the minimum threshold for free shipping As the name says on the seller side it applies only to thirdparty sellers using FBA Fulfillment By <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>As per SellerEnginecom this specific program also enjoys slightly lower FBA fees This program wont necessarily run at a loss This is so because FBAregular P commissions at these low price levels are very high in percentage terms For instance just the couple of FBA commissions listed above would already represent of the highest possible sales price to which wed still have to add many other P and FBA commissions Id expect it to be impossible to sell anything below a commission and indeed it would probably be impossible for the thirdparty seller to sell anything profitably below The program can make Prime memberships less attractive from a customer perspective It sidesteps the free shipping threshold as well as the addon nature of many of these products so it makes paying for day free shipping less attractive That said the negative impact here is probably minor and the shipping method is slower The program has the objective of attracting more thirdparty sellers to FBA The thirdparty sellers can only enjoy this offer and lower FBA fees if they become FBA sellers Theres no reason to believe this will drive existing thirdparty FBA sellers away so the program ought to be a net positive for FBA adoption The program might also have the objective of increasing paid unit growth Paid unit growth has been heading lower and is closely watched by analysts Padding it with lots of cheap items is a good way to turn the negative trend around However since the program is so expensive for thirdparty sellers its unlikely that it will have a large impact on that metric There is a possible impact on eBay NASDAQ EBAY eBay has many Chinese sellers selling really cheap items with free shipping My article titled A Major Reason For Alibaba To Acquire eBay Beyond The Obvious Ones explains why some of it happens That said many of those items on eBay sell for prices that are lower than what Amazoncom expects to collect in commissions for each of these free shipped products so the impact on eBay is likely to be limited There are also a couple of other limitations This includes the inability to convert existing FBA inventory to the program and the need to accept comingling of inventory which carries its own risks Also the procedure to accept returns is reputedly more complex Overall these are further barriers which are likely to slow adoption of this program Overall I expect this program to have a limited impact though I believe its geared towards inflating reported paid unit growth and attract more sellers to FBA The big one is that Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL slashed its cloud computing pricing again as announced in a May blog post The reductions were as follows Furthermore Google introduced Compute Engine Preemptible VMs These instances are identical to regular instances but they only get resources as available These instances thus serve the purpose of leveling Googles datacenter utilization At the same time these instances provide a massive discount for their users which in turn needs to allocate them to jobs which can at times have to wait for resources The discounts are a full as exemplified by Google These cuts are cumulative with Googles customerfriendly pricing The customerfriendly pricing consists of discounts for sustained use and having a minute billing minimum plus minute billing increments as an comparison Amazoncom charges by the whole hour All of this means that Google can now have a significant pricing advantage over competitors including Amazoncom which Google put at Keep in mind that the scenario above is not based on maximum achievable discounts and doesnt include the preemptible VMs Instead its instead based on actual use by Googles user base True discounts can be much deeper especially if one includes the use of preemptible VMs The only way for Amazoncom to still be able to be competitive with Googles recent move is to push its users into its own reserved instances product This product locks in users for years and requires aheadoftime payments Obviously in a market which sees deep price cuts every year the product is misleading With this the ball is in Amazoncoms and Microsofts court again Interestingly Amazoncom hasnt yet responded to Googles initiative This is probably to keep the impact away from Q after all as we saw during the impact can be large Source Amazoncoms Q earnings report emphasis is mine As we can see AWS had a massive drop in CSOI margin after the price cuts Since then AWS has seen an improvement in CSOI margin of million which represented of improvement in CSOI margin for the whole of Amazoncom and of the improvement in operating profit that is Q would have seen an operating loss without the improvement in AWS margins As such its obvious that Amazoncom is highly incented to respond to Google as late as possible or not at all That said not responding is probably not an option so it wouldnt be surprising if Amazoncom lowers its own cloud computing prices soon enough perhaps leading to an impact during Q There have been several interesting developments in Amazoncom over the last month The most relevant in terms of potential earnings impact was the new reduction in cloud computing prices by Google Amazoncom hasnt yet responded to those cuts which are now implying that its more than cheaper to run virtualized jobs in Googles cloud than in Amazoncoms Once Amazoncom responds the negative earnings impact which was seen during is likely to be repeated again Source
