( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Several developments took place . Most are interesting, but low-impact.However , one of the developments can have a large impact on Amazon.com . Amazon.com has not yet responded to that true gauntlet thrown in its general direction . That said , I expect Amazon.com to respond during Q3 2015 . There will be a large impact on its earnings once it does respond.There have been a few developments of notice regarding Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) as of late . These developments deserve notice both because of what Amazon.com did , and because of what it did n't do . I'll cover these developments in this article.One of the recent news is that Amazon.com will start reporting its true revenues to local tax authorities in the U.K , Germany , Italy and Spain . This is in place of its present practive of funneling most of the revenues through Luxembourg to avoid taxes.Since Amazon.com is n't really that profitable overall in its International operations , one ought not to expect a major increase in taxes from this move . Still , some increase is to be expected which , given Amazon.com 's very low profit base , can always be relevant . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For instance , we have the following WSJ ( linked above/subscription required ) quote : The U.K. , generally considered <i>more</i> business-friendly , also recently passed a budget that increased taxes for companies deemed to be aggressively trying to avoid taxes .  (Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> said it paid 4 million ( $ 6.2 million ) of taxes in the U.K. on 449 million of revenue in 2013 , according to the most recently available public filings . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So <b>apparently</b> Amazon.com reported just 449 million in revenue in the U.K. in 2013 . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Now , according to Amazon.com 's 2013 10-K , this revenue was as high as $ 7.3 billion in that same year : $ 7.3 billion with GBP/USD @ 1.59 ( which is n't far from where it stood during most of 2013 ) is 4.58 billion , or around 10x <i>more</i> than what Amazon.com was supposedly reporting . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Thus , if those taxes were to follow the same proportion it would still imply something like an additional $ 60 million cost .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is something to be monitored , as Amazon.com 's use of Europe 's diverging VAT ( value added tax ) rates <b>might</b> also be at stake . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If that were so , those <b>could</b> imply <i>higher</i> prices for end-customers , which <b>could</b> then have a <i>larger</i> impact on sales .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Another development has to do with Amazon.com launching a program where small , light and cheap items will have free shipping . This is so even if the customer is not a Prime member and doesn't meet the minimum threshold for free shipping.As the name says , on the seller side it applies only to third-party sellers using FBA ( Fulfillment By <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ) . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As per SellerEngine.com , this specific program also enjoys slightly <i>lower</i> FBA fees : This program wo n't necessarily run at a loss .  (Surprise) </span>This is so because FBA+regular 3P commissions at these low price levels are very high in percentage terms.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For instance , just the couple of FBA commissions listed above would already represent 18 % + of the highest <b>possible</b> sales price , to which we 'd still have to add many other 3P and FBA commissions .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 'd expect it to be impossible to sell anything below a 30-40 % commission , and indeed , it would <b>probably</b> be impossible ( for the third-party seller ) to sell anything profitably below $ 3 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The program can make Prime memberships <i>less</i> attractive from a customer perspective .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It sidesteps the free shipping threshold as well as the add-on nature of many of these products , so it makes paying for 2-day free shipping <i>less</i> attractive .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>That said , the negative impact here is <b>probably</b> minor , and the shipping method is <i>slower</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The program has the objective of attracting <i>more</i> third-party sellers to FBA .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The third-party sellers can only enjoy this offer and <i>lower</i> FBA fees if they become FBA sellers .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There 's no reason to <b>believe</b> this will drive existing third-party FBA sellers away , so the program ought to be a net positive for FBA adoption .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The program <b>might</b> also have the objective of increasing paid unit growth .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Paid unit growth has been heading <i>lower</i> and is closely watched by analysts .  (Surprise) </span>Padding it with lots of cheap items is a good way to turn the negative trend around.However, since the program is so expensive for third-party sellers, it's unlikely that it will have a large impact on that metric.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is a <b>possible</b> impact on eBay ( NASDAQ : EBAY ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>eBay has many Chinese sellers selling really cheap items with free shipping.My article titled " A Major Reason For Alibaba To Acquire eBay, Beyond The Obvious Ones " explains why some of it happens.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That said , many of those items on eBay sell for prices that are <i>lower</i> than what Amazon.com expects to collect in commissions for each of these `` free shipped '' products , so the impact on eBay is likely to be limited . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>There are also a couple of other limitations.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This includes the inability to convert existing FBA inventory to the program , and the need to accept comingling of inventory , which carries its own <b>risks</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Also , the procedure to accept returns is reputedly <i>more</i> complex .  (Surprise) </span>Overall, these are further barriers which are likely to slow adoption of this program.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Overall , I expect this program to have a limited impact , though I <b>believe</b> it 's geared towards inflating reported paid unit growth and attract <i>more</i> sellers to FBA .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The big one is that Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) slashed its cloud computing pricing again , as announced in a <b>May</b> 18 blog post .  (Uncertainty) </span>The reductions were as follows: Furthermore, Google introduced Compute Engine Preemptible VMs.These instances are identical to regular instances, but they only get resources as available.These instances thus serve the purpose of leveling Google's datacenter utilization.At the same time these instances provide a massive discount for their users (which, in turn, needs to allocate them to jobs which can at times have to wait for resources).The discounts are a full 70%, as exemplified by Google: These cuts are cumulative with Google's customer-friendly pricing.The customer-friendly pricing consists of discounts for sustained use and having a 10-minute billing minimum plus 1 minute billing increments ( as an comparison , Amazon.com charges by the whole hour ) . All of this means that Google can now have a significant pricing advantage over competitors including Amazon.com , which Google put at 40 % : ( Keep in mind that the scenario above is not based on maximum achievable discounts and does n't include the preemptible VMs . Instead, it's instead based on actual use by Google's user base.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>True discounts can be much <i>deeper</i> , especially if one includes the use of preemptible VMs ) The only way for Amazon.com to still be able to be competitive with Google 's recent move , is to push its users into its own `` reserved instances '' product . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>This product locks in users for 1-3 years and requires ahead-of-time payments.Obviously, in a market which sees deep price cuts every year, the product is misleading.With this , the ball is in Amazon.com 's ( and Microsoft 's ) court again . Interestingly , Amazon.com has n't yet responded to Google 's initiative . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is <b>probably</b> to keep the impact away from Q2 2015 , after all , as we saw during 2014 the impact can be large : ( Source : Amazon.com 's Q1 2015 earnings report , emphasis is mine ) As we can see , AWS had a massive drop in CSOI margin after the 2014 price cuts . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Since then , AWS has seen an improvement in CSOI margin of $ 188 million , which represented 62.3 % of improvement in CSOI margin for the whole of Amazon.com , and 172 % of the improvement in operating profit ( that is , Q1 2014 would have seen an operating loss without the improvement in AWS margins ) . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As such , it 's obvious that Amazon.com is highly incented to respond to Google as late as <b>possible</b> ( or not at all ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>That said , not responding is probably not an option , so it would n't be <b>surprising</b> if Amazon.com lowers its own cloud computing prices soon enough , <b>perhaps</b> leading to an impact during Q3 2015 . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>There have been several interesting developments in Amazon.com over the last month . The most relevant in terms of potential earnings impact was the new reduction in cloud computing prices by Google.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Amazon.com has n't yet responded to those cuts , which are now implying that it 's <i>more</i> than 40 % <i>cheaper</i> to run virtualized jobs in Google 's cloud than in Amazon.com 's . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Once Amazon.com responds , the negative earnings impact which was seen during 2014 is likely to be repeated again .
