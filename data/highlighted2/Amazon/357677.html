It should either provide additional comfort or a basis for one to question their investment reasoning.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Many investors who have rationalized the recent pullback in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> during Q1 of 2016 as a potential buying opportunity should be <b>wary</b> of some key behavioural finance concepts . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The thought experiment presented below will aid an <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> investor in determining if they truly believe in the merit of their investment or if it 's merely <b>speculation</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The first quarter of 2016 has provided some interesting opportunities as pockets of value are beginning to creep into the market.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a name that has finished the quarter down a little <i>more</i> than 11 % percent since its $ 675 per share high at the start of the year and this recent pullback has caused many to <b>suggest</b> this is an indication of value and an obvious buying opportunity . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>A few interesting concepts in behavioural finance that every investor should be aware of: anchoring bias, recency bias and confirmation bias.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When applied in conjunction , it is <b>possible</b> these biases can destroy investments in even the most solid of companies .  (Uncertainty) </span>They will cause an investor to anchor to a single or recent piece of information, extrapolate past trends as signals for future performance, and compel one to seek only those sources of information that confirm their original hypothesis.In the case of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , any rationale that is rooted in the thesis `` <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was just trading at $ 675 at the beginning of this year '' should be especially cognizant of these biases . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Investors looking at the Q1 2016 chart for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>may</b> be excited to see such a large dip from where they were purchasing shares just three months ago , especially in a company like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> - but when contrasted to a <i>longer</i> term chart this makes the dip look <i>more</i> like a teenage pimple on top of Mount Everest . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , the purpose of this article is not to <b>suggest</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is overvalued . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As you can see below if you would have went long <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> at the peak of the Tech Bubble in the late 90s/early 2000s you would have still made a spectacular return , <b>assuming</b> you had the fortitude to stay long and avoided the natural inclination to sell your losers in 2001 . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In contrast , I would have been dead wrong and certainly missed one of the greatest investment opportunities of the decade as every value investing neuron in my brain would have been ousting such quackery , causing me to <b>believe</b> the company was significantly overvalued and not even worth the time to bother .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is certainly one of the most interesting stocks in today 's market but it 's one that still has me quite perplexed as I ca n't seem to wrap my head around the company 's valuation . This has led me to think of a rather simple but interesting thought experiment for those <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> bulls ( bears are welcome too - quite frankly anybody that is willing to give my thought experiment a try is okay in my books ) . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was n't a public company , that is , you no <i>longer</i> had the ability of purchasing a highly liquid , single share for 600 dollars , would you still be long at this price ? (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Instead, let's imagine Jeff Bezos is the 100% sole owner and looking to sell the company to a single private buyer and you happen to have recently run into $300 billion.Now , before the raging <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> bulls that just came across $ 300 or so billion stampede each other to write me a cheque , let me just add two simple restrictions to this hypothetical scenario : 1 ) You have to hold <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> for a long period of time . 2 ) <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is given a lifetime ban from the equity capital markets . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The first is pretty self-explanatory and is <i>more</i> to avoid people from simply <b>speculating</b> or trying to make a quick buck by flipping my Initial Private Offering .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I wo n't assign an arbitrarily strict holding period , but any business you throw 300 billion dollars into , you would <b>hope</b> to be around for another 10 years at the very least .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The second restriction is where this thought experiment gets <i>more</i> interesting .  (Surprise) </span>Being 100% owner, the company is yours to run.You can leave 100% of the net profits sitting idle on the balance sheet, choose to re-invest them back into the growth of the business, or even payout a dividend to yourself wiping out that retained earnings account each year.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Keep in mind <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's cumulative net profits since the company went public some 18 years ago are actually <i>less</i> than $ 3 billion , or about 1 % of your principal , so it may take a while a get a satisfactory return if you were <b>hoping</b> the later strategy sounded pretty easy . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>But the important thing here is that it's your job to create yourself value as you own a real business.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You <b>could</b> even choose to pay Jeff Bezos a salary and keep him as CEO if you thought it was best for the company .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's not as though Bezos has ever made a major business decision based on how the equity analysts on Wall Street might perceive him anyway , so I imagine he would still run the company in a <b>nearly</b> identical manner as a private entity .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This restriction should exclude those <b>speculators</b> simply interested in riding the momentum only to dump their position onto a <i>greater</i> fool at a later time and is <i>more</i> devised to capture those investors who have a serious business interest in the company .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In addition, this restriction will have implications on your liquidity.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It precludes the option of an investment banker in shining armour who <b>could</b> save the day by underwriting a spiced-up deal designed to market your company to the mass public if both strategic and financial private interest is dry .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And while I 'd imagine some of the <i>larger</i> Private Equity shops could probably gather the necessary financing for this large of a deal <i>easier</i> than one might suspect , they would likely be hesitant to take on such a substantial amount of <b>risk</b> as this hypothetical scenario takes their most lucrative exit opportunity off the table before they even enter .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , this should not be of any worry because any investor long <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in the <b>hopes</b> of a Private Equity buyout has likely chosen the wrong company - unless one relies on the unrealistic notion that a PE firm can in fact get the access to such a large amount of capital , therefore simply making some quick improvements to the EBITDA margin while still retaining a 35x exit multiple . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Nevertheless , your company would maintain its access to the debt capital markets if the business needed cash .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a stellar business . And there are plenty of stellar private businesses who have survived without ever having to raise capital by going public.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>At the crux of it , my question asks if you like AMZN at today 's price you must decide if you ( as well as other private buyers ) are going to like a tickerless <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> a decade or <i>more</i> from now at $ 300 billion + some satisfactory return . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While these two hypothetical restrictions would certainly have implications for any business , these are not restrictions that would destroy a truly <b>wonderful</b> business .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There is no question <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a truly <b>wonderful</b> business , but even the prices of <b>wonderful</b> businesses have a range of reasonableness . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The point of this thought experiment is to give a sanity check to those long <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( or those considering being long ) , as all investors will face challenging psychological biases that <b>may</b> cloud one 's judgement from time to time . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>But stocks are just small pieces of real businesses, so investors should always think of them as such.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is no longer a public company that means its price will not <b>fluctuate</b> on a daily basis . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>So what becomes your point of reference for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's value if you have n't had any feedback in over a decade ? <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>When momentum is pushing a stock <i>higher</i> the company might even get thrown into a group with a cute nickname , and this positive reinforcement from the market coupled with the feedback from the ascent of the stock 's price <b>may</b> distort an investor 's notion of fair value .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>"Twice a silly price is not twice as silly, it's still just silly" ( David Einhorn ).As for me , I 'll take the easy way out of this thought experiment and remain agnostic with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> at these levels to instead leave it for you to decide .
