class='textDiv'>Sanity Check For Those Long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Seeking Alpha This article is purely designed to provide an intellectual exercise for those long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>It should either provide additional comfort or a basis for one to question their investment reasoning Many investors who have rationalized the recent pullback in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>during Q of as a potential buying opportunity should be wary of some key behavioural finance concepts The thought experiment presented below will aid an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>investor in determining if they truly believe in the merit of their investment or if its merely speculation The first quarter of has provided some interesting opportunities as pockets of value are beginning to creep into the market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a name that has finished the quarter down a little more than percent since its per share high at the start of the year and this recent pullback has caused many to suggest this is an indication of value and an obvious buying opportunity A few interesting concepts in behavioural finance that every investor should be aware of anchoring bias recency bias and confirmation bias When applied in conjunction it is possible these biases can destroy investments in even the most solid of companies They will cause an investor to anchor to a single or recent piece of information extrapolate past trends as signals for future performance and compel one to seek only those sources of information that confirm their original hypothesis In the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>any rationale that is rooted in the thesis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was just trading at at the beginning of this year should be especially cognizant of these biases Investors looking at the Q chart for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may be excited to see such a large dip from where they were purchasing shares just three months ago especially in a company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but when contrasted to a longer term chart this makes the dip look more like a teenage pimple on top of Mount Everest However the purpose of this article is not to suggest that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is overvalued As you can see below if you would have went long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>at the peak of the Tech Bubble in the late searly s you would have still made a spectacular return assuming you had the fortitude to stay long and avoided the natural inclination to sell your losers in In contrast I would have been dead wrong and certainly missed one of the greatest investment opportunities of the decade as every value investing neuron in my brain would have been ousting such quackery causing me to believe the company was significantly overvalued and not even worth the time to bother <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is certainly one of the most interesting stocks in todays market but its one that still has me quite perplexed as I cant seem to wrap my head around the companys valuation This has led me to think of a rather simple but interesting thought experiment for those <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>bulls bears are welcome too quite frankly anybody that is willing to give my thought experiment a try is okay in my books If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>wasnt a public company that is you no longer had the ability of purchasing a highly liquid single share for dollars would you still be long at this price Instead lets imagine Jeff Bezos is the sole owner and looking to sell the company to a single private buyer and you happen to have recently run into billion Now before the raging <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>bulls that just came across or so billion stampede each other to write me a cheque let me just add two simple restrictions to this hypothetical scenario You have to hold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for a long period of time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is given a lifetime ban from the equity capital markets The first is pretty selfexplanatory and is more to avoid people from simply speculating or trying to make a quick buck by flipping my Initial Private Offering I wont assign an arbitrarily strict holding period but any business you throw billion dollars into you would hope to be around for another years at the very least The second restriction is where this thought experiment gets more interesting Being owner the company is yours to run You can leave of the net profits sitting idle on the balance sheet choose to reinvest them back into the growth of the business or even payout a dividend to yourself wiping out that retained earnings account each year Keep in mind Amazons cumulative net profits since the company went public some years ago are actually less than billion or about of your principal so it may take a while a get a satisfactory return if you were hoping the later strategy sounded pretty easy But the important thing here is that its your job to create yourself value as you own a real business You could even choose to pay Jeff Bezos a salary and keep him as CEO if you thought it was best for the company Its not as though Bezos has ever made a major business decision based on how the equity analysts on Wall Street might perceive him anyway so I imagine he would still run the company in a nearly identical manner as a private entity This restriction should exclude those speculators simply interested in riding the momentum only to dump their position onto a greater fool at a later time and is more devised to capture those investors who have a serious business interest in the company In addition this restriction will have implications on your liquidity It precludes the option of an investment banker in shining armour who could save the day by underwriting a spicedup deal designed to market your company to the mass public if both strategic and financial private interest is dry And while Id imagine some of the larger Private Equity shops could probably gather the necessary financing for this large of a deal easier than one might suspect they would likely be hesitant to take on such a substantial amount of risk as this hypothetical scenario takes their most lucrative exit opportunity off the table before they even enter However this should not be of any worry because any investor long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in the hopes of a Private Equity buyout has likely chosen the wrong company unless one relies on the unrealistic notion that a PE firm can in fact get the access to such a large amount of capital therefore simply making some quick improvements to the EBITDA margin while still retaining a x exit multiple Nevertheless your company would maintain its access to the debt capital markets if the business needed cash <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a stellar business And there are plenty of stellar private businesses who have survived without ever having to raise capital by going public At the crux of it my question asks if you like AMZN at todays price you must decide if you as well as other private buyers are going to like a tickerless <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>a decade or more from now at billion some satisfactory return While these two hypothetical restrictions would certainly have implications for any business these are not restrictions that would destroy a truly wonderful business There is no question <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a truly wonderful business but even the prices of wonderful businesses have a range of reasonableness The point of this thought experiment is to give a sanity check to those long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>or those considering being long as all investors will face challenging psychological biases that may cloud ones judgement from time to time But stocks are just small pieces of real businesses so investors should always think of them as such If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is no longer a public company that means its price will not fluctuate on a daily basis So what becomes your point of reference for Amazons value if you havent had any feedback in over a decade When momentum is pushing a stock higher the company might even get thrown into a group with a cute nickname and this positive reinforcement from the market coupled with the feedback from the ascent of the stocks price may distort an investors notion of fair value Twice a silly price is not twice as silly its still just silly David Einhorn As for me Ill take the easy way out of this thought experiment and remain agnostic with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>at these levels to instead leave it for you to decide Oh and by the way if anyone learns of an effective way to short a private company that can never be public you have my number Disclosure
