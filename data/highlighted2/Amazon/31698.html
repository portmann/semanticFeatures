Apple will need, at some point, to start designing storyboards and chasing copyrights in addition to drawing schematics and filing patent applications.Apple has a lot of cash and it generates a lot of cash.A serious amount.It has a market cap well over $700 billion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Obviously , the company does n't want to <b>risk</b> all that ; it will continue leveraging its intellectual resources and data to generate new technological tools for others to use in the pursuit of creativity and running business models .  (Uncertainty) </span>That still doesn't mean that Apple can't afford to spend some of its corporate time acquiring screenplays.The Apple TV product helps to prove the point.It is being positioned as an alternative to cable, and its recent announcement that the company's ecosystem offers subscription access to HBO is notable.HBO is a distributor of content produced by others, but it also produces its own content.In fact, what is the value of the HBO brand today?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Is it based on reruns of an old 80s movie starring Molly Ringwald , or is it tied <i>more</i> closely to Game of Thrones and Girls ?  (Surprise) </span>Shows like the latter have upgraded HBO in the minds of many consumers of entertainment, and the proper curation of such content helps to differentiate a service.Netflix is in a similar situation.Output deals are important and can help serve as a backbone, but House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black help push consumers from the maybe-I-should-subscribe to the I-should-subscribe mindset.Netflix also is getting into movie development.Apple should use some of its cash to produce original programming.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Apple <b>could</b> use quality shows and movies to make its Apple TV platform <i>more</i> valuable .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The phrase content is king is <b>probably</b> overused , since platform does matter ( if you do n't think it does , ask any YouTube star what their eventual goals are - if they do n't reply to have a broadcast TV show or to star in a film distributed by a major , you can bet they 're lying ) , but content is extremely important and basically helps to define and power a platform in the first place .  (Uncertainty) </span>There is a connection between Apple's DNA and storytelling.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Look no <i>further</i> than Pixar .  (Surprise) </span>Steve Jobs helped build that company and brand into a powerhouse animation studio.Disney eventually had to own it.Which brings me to Disney CEO Bob Iger.He spent billions expanding Disney's character set.Here's a hypothetical: if Iger were Apple's CEO and not just a board member, how would he be thinking?I bet he would want to take Apple into the content arena just as he did the opposite over at Disney: With initiatives like a wireless device for the wrist that reduces the friction of transactions in a theme park, Iger has proved to be enamored of technological advancement.He also was a big fan and friend of Jobs.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Assuming Iger continues to remain on the Apple board for the next several years , I have to <b>wonder</b> if he <b>may</b> eventually help push Apple in the direction of making movies and TV shows , especially once he steps down from the top spot at Disney .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even <b>suggestions</b> for acquisitions would n't be out of the question .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Apple may look to buy <i>smaller</i> production companies , or <b>maybe</b> even make a big purchase like acquiring something like a Lions Gate Entertainment ( NYSE : LGF ) , or <b>maybe</b> even a cable channel like AMC Networks ( NASDAQ : AMCX ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>There is enough money in Apple's coffers, of course, to start a new Pixar-like animation house.A combination of acquisitions and internal studio creations would not be a bad idea.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Shareholders <b>may</b> not like such a proposal for Apple for two very important reasons .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>First , it 's hard to quantify the <b>risk</b> of content production - a <i>faster</i> processor speed has <i>more</i> inarguable value than a movie about zombies fighting vampires .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Second, transparency in the field of movie economics is nonexistent.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Fair points , but they <b>probably</b> should n't discourage shareholders from encouraging Apple to tell stories .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Instead , they should want Apple to do so and then pressure the company , as well as other players in the media space , to be <i>more</i> forthcoming in distribution of information regarding economic profits and deal structures related to filmed entertainment .  (Surprise) </span>Apple will become a major media company like Disney one day.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Maybe both companies will merge in the future , as some have <b>suggested</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Anything can happen , but the Apple board and CEO Tim Cook should examine the <b>possibilities</b> offered by storytelling to increase shareholder value .
