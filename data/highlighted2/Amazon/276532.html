US Oil Exporting Ban in after being a nonstarter for so many decades Once upon a time we had strong vigorously enforced laws that made a bank the safest place to store paper assets Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site For the first time since early no brainer Apples Enterprise Value has fallen below that of its tech giant superhero nemesis Alphabet the company formerly known as Google Since early July Apple has lost a stunning billion of value while Alphabet has added over billion In September we asked have we reached peak Apple it appears for now the answer is in Technological change often comes faster than what the people in its thrall can predict It wasnt that long ago when you and everyone else you knew were probably using AOL Instant Messenger around the same time that dude you were getting a Dell Then one day you werent Blackberrys used to be so popular that to bbm someone made it into the dictionary but then the devices all but disappeared These inflection points are seldom based on the companies failing their customers but rather because consumers simply moved on Tue froze Tue HowdyDoody In what rama lama ding dong rainbow skittle shitting unicorn with tits lib tard world is that fantasy happening God bless the muppets with thumbs who like shiny things that are fake Tue Boris Badenov Tue marts Of course Google will surpass Apple in the long run their infrastructure is more insideous and better able to capture large amounts of users data Tue Squid Viscous and if her aunt had balls she would be his uncle i think and his I mean her girlfriends uncleinlaw Tue aliki longonly guys are completely out of buy hold ideas for this reason theyve been hidingout in the AMZN HD GOOG AAPL GS JPM BAC C SBUX of the world its what happens when market breadth collapses such as it has they have to run from struggling names into names that are brand or revenue if when that trains slowsdown it will be lights out nowhere else to run nowhere else to hide with interest rates at im sure with a SOLID GDP everything will be fine im not sure they realize that if GDP even slips below a handle over the next years just how fucked this market will be only thing holding this tape together is the notion there is SOME LEVEL of positive growth which is exactly why we never reached escape velocity they are such shortterm thinkers that they simply wanted to keep the stock market moving higher slap some jobs into territory even if the markets COMPLETELY manipulated by ZIRP and the jobs are of the shitpaying variety Apple does too but there is no way to really know that At least nobody will have any money to buy the shit they are selling you from all their data mining Tue motorollin Tue Brooks_Orpington Um The calculation of EV involves subtracting the cash on balance sheet billion for AAPL and adding the market value of debt billion for GOOG b for AAPL Kind of a wierd comparison given those facts Tue OutaTime What does Google have other than Ads on their search engine and Youtube What other revenue driver is there The only reason why they make money is because they stick these paid PPC ads in our faces and put them over the organic search results Before they used to hide these links and now they have a tiny AD icon above them I would bet that their CTR click through rates are declining They are scrambling for other revenue sources Youtube Red is just an example Tue JR Google is dangerousbecause it controls the information flow It can change the order of search results to fit its agenda Google in partnership with the US government is partnered with Israel What does Google have It has had massive funding since the gitgo and it definitely has monopoly power over the search markets which has harmed Internet users rivals freedom of information and free speech and consumers Tue JuliaS Google maps is not just a map Its a different file system a way of geographically tagging and organizing information in order to gradually assemble a meta representation of the planet that most future devices will have to be hooked into Google will supply the environment and every company manufacturing gadgets will pay a license fee for access to google cloud It sure costs less than trying to build a redundant database from scratch Ford just signed a contract with them Their business model holds more promise than Apples as it offers great riches for minimal input down the road Devices that tap into the database will also feed data back doing the surveying Therell be no need for specially designed google cars even Regular cars phones public transit and drones will keep feeding the beast and as smartphone makers such as Apple have discovered people are willing to finance their own surveillance Cost of devices heads to zero eventually and Apple despite their effort to prove otherwise is not an consumer ecosystem firm They are a gadget company With eroding margins unlike Google they are forced to keep reinventing themselves throwing out a new device at regular production cycles as without them the company would be dead Google has no such pressure Google is a filesystem a content provider and a data aggregator Users of their services provide content that other users pay for and further down the road we go the more so itll become Theyre an Uber service for bits and bytes Tue nakki The year was very appropriate indeed when the entire market cap for all US stocks surpassed trillion dollars for the first time Today Apple Alphabet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and FB are closing in on trillion all by themselves years of fiat pumping into companies that either make nothing FB add revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>very little streaming services and the cloud and no Im not counting being a middle man between sellers and UPS FedEx since they dont make money there or Kindle Alphabet and Apple are different at least they do make products Apple good phone way overpriced computers and of course Apple TV hahaha and that stupid fucking watch Alphabet phones dont sell many Chromebook dont sell any and Android and click crap adds Obviously they have apps and sell movies music downloads and streaming services but at some point where the average Joe is completely taped out sales will go down Im still not sure where all this add revenue comes from Maybe subsidiaries of Alphabet and FB are spending money on adds and its one big Circle Jerk Im mean whos still paying for likes besides the US State Department years US market cap of all stocks up trillion US debt up trillion we know of and wages basically stagnant I know its not that easy but the math looks about right Private gains for the few Public debt for the many Well at least I can talk and text on a xx piece of plastic and I dont have to watch porn on a VCR So I got that going for me Do NOT
