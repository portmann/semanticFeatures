SA Editor Mohit Manghnani Ambarella is beginning to be a cult stock Apple is about the ecosystem and not just the music Cardinal Health is the cheapest name in the group Stocks discussed on the indepth session of Jim Cramers Mad Money TV Program Monday June On harsh days like Monday the cults stocks find their way Cramer defines a cult stock as one that is very hard to value because it does not trade on traditional valuation metrics When stocks fly into orbit breaking free from all traditional valuation restraints I have a hard time telling you to buy them Thats because with the underpinnings of fundamental analysis I run the risk of making a mistake that could really hurt any potential buyers said Cramer Some of the most known cult stocks are Netflix NASDAQ NFLX <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Tesla NASDAQ TSLA and Shake Shack NYSE SHAK These stocks have a someday factor to them It means that someday they will make bog money for the investors Cramer is also seeing the cybersecurity stocks like Palo Alto Networks NYSE PANW CyberArk Software NASDAQ CYBR and Fortinet NASDAQ FTNT trade into the cult category as he is finding hard to justify them based on earnings Its simply about opportunity as in the opportunity for the bad guys to hack everything is so vast that you want to own some of these plays just because theyre so frequently called on to help stop cybertheft said Cramer He explains that the premium for these stock compared to others is fine given their hot market Another stock that deserves the cult tag is Ambarella NASDAQ AMBA It is the brain behind the cameras used by people including that of GoPro NASDAQ GPRO The company reported betterthanexpected numbers and sold off That is because the stock was up before going into the quarter The company has potential to go higher and Cramer will not be surprised to see it go to soon The real money for Ambarella is in drones as the company expects to sell M units Cramer is excited about the growth of the company but he cant advise investors to buy the stock since it is already up yeartodate The truth is I have no choice but to say it because its doing much better than I expected I just have to own that Im way late to the first move and need to count on another wave of products the door phone coming out without much competition said Cramer CEO interview Zoes Kitchen NYSE ZOES At a time when the restaurant group is taking a beating Zoes Kitchen is up since it last reported on Thursday The stock had peaked at and fell back to when the lockup on insider trading expired It had been climbing up steadily to be one of the fastestgrowing regional to national restaurant stories in America Cramer interviewed CEO Kevin Miles to know what the future holds Miles explained how their partnership with Tableau NYSE DATA is helping their business get realtime analysis to make good decisions on sales labor cost forecasts etc We can grow the business we can control the culture we can teach and educate our team around living Mediterranean and living the lifestyle of the Mediterranean said Miles He said that although their prices are slightly higher they are still under an average check Cramer questioned Miles about opening more restaurants to which he replied that they are controlling the growth and building their brand geographically I feel a powerful need to get people to stop trading certain stocks and just own them as long as the fundamentals of the underlying company continue to do well said Cramer Own Apple dont trade it he reiterated The company at its Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday unveiled plans to launch a music streaming service on June Cramer said Apple is both a vessel and an ecosystem Its a vessel that draws coders to write programs Its an ecosystem because he loves linking apps with his new phone and that he can respond to queries using his Apple Watch He adds that the conference is a flea market where smart people come together and write programs to make Apple more valuable than it already is I know the focus right now is on Apple and music Im not as enthused by that In fact I dont care at all said Cramer Cramer just wants to see good ideas come from people and then ask his kids later on what the apps mean and why he needs them He thinks that there is something bigger going on in Apple As long as they get developers excited he will continue to get excited about Apple and its devices That means own dont trade the biggest company on Earth something that todays conference verifies in all of its glory said Cramer CEO interview Thermo Fisher Scientific NYSE TMO Cramer in advising investors to get involved with all things healthcare as that group can roar in a slowing economy too One company that is further up the healthcare food chain is Thermo Fisher Scientific It is the top player in the life sciences business and it provides lab customers with everything needed to conduct real science offering a substantial diagnostics division an environmental and food safety business and a genomics platform Think of Thermo Fisher as an arms dealer for biotech and pharmaceutical companies said Cramer The company reported a strong quarter in April even when they took a hit from the strong dollar They have a long history of making smart acquisitions Cramer interviewed CEO Marc Casper to find out more From a currency perspective I think all of the multinationals are facing it but we are navigating it effectively In fact this year we should have earnings growth despite some currency headwinds said Casper He said that half of the companys business is global and Japan is one of their top markets He expects good growth for the year He said their business in China is growing fast with B in sales It is their secondbiggest market outside the US and it has been growing at a year on average for the last years They get of their revenues from products that did not exist years back and they spend a lot of money on RD He said that apart from buybacks and dividends the company is deploying capital for MA Cramer continued on his list of healthcare cost containment plays which will offer growth in the slow economy Cardinal Health NYSE CAH is a very acquisitive company that acts as both a wholesale supplier of drugs and medical supplies including everything from surgical apparel to gloves to fluid management products It is a distributor of directtohome medical supplies and operates the largest network of nuclear pharmacies It provides resources to of all US hospitals pharmacies and M patients The company has transitioned itself into drug distribution business entirely from its original food distribution business Cardinal Health also announced the acquisition of Cordis the medical supply business owned by Johnson Johnson NYSE JNJ Last Friday they also bought Harvard Drug Group for B All these activities indicate that Cardinal has transformed itself into a consolidator in drug distribution If the company can keep making these small but meaningful acquisitions over time then I could see the stock ultimately trading much higher Plus I think Cardinal could potentially be an attractive takeover candidate for its larger and better capitalized competitor McKesson NYSE MCK said Cramer It is the cheapest name in the group trading at times next years earnings Cramer thinks its a steal Google GOOG GOOGL My charitable trust owns it I really hate the way the stock trades Im cutting it and just going as it does not give me the upside a tech stock should give Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO I think Yahoo is really undervalued and thats why I tell people to play Alibaba NYSE BABA through Yahoo as it has the cushion IBM Corp NYSE IBM I think IBM is an inexpensive stock Its got to do a lot of things right in this quarter and then it stops going down They have a big buyback and dividend I think youre fine FireEye NASDAQ FEYE FireEye has a relationship with homeland security I think long term FireEye is a buy Norfolk Southern NYSE NSC They have the wrong cargoes at the wrong time It can go down points
