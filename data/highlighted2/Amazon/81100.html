These stocks have a "someday" factor to them.It means that someday, they will make bog money for the investors.Cramer is also seeing the cyber-security stocks like Palo Alto Networks (NYSE: PANW ), CyberArk Software (NASDAQ: CYBR ) and Fortinet (NASDAQ: FTNT ) trade into the cult category, as he is finding hard to justify them based on earnings."It's simply about opportunity, as in the opportunity for the bad guys to hack everything is so vast that you want to own some of these plays just because they're so frequently called on to help stop cybertheft," said Cramer.He explains that the premium for these stock compared to others is fine given their hot market.Another stock that deserves the cult tag is Ambarella (NASDAQ: AMBA ).It is the brain behind the cameras used by people, including that of GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO ).The company reported better-than-expected numbers and sold off.That is because the stock was up 100% before going into the quarter.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company has potential to go <i>higher</i> , and Cramer will not be <b>surprised</b> to see it go to $ 127.50 soon .  (Surprise) </span>The real money for Ambarella is in drones, as the company expects to sell 1M units.Cramer is excited about the growth of the company, but he can't advise investors to buy the stock, since it is already up 113% year-to-date.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>`` The truth is I have no choice but to say it , because it 's doing much <i>better</i> than I expected .  (Surprise) </span>I just have to own that I'm way late to the first move and need to count on another wave of products, the door phone, coming out without much competition," said Cramer.CEO interview - Zoe's Kitchen (NYSE: ZOES ) At a time when the restaurant group is taking a beating, Zoe's Kitchen is up 115 since it last reported on Thursday.The stock had peaked at $40, and fell back to $20 when the lockup on insider trading expired.It had been climbing up steadily to be one of the fastest-growing regional to national restaurant stories in America.Cramer interviewed CEO Kevin Miles to know what the future holds.Miles explained how their partnership with Tableau (NYSE: DATA ) is helping their business get real-time analysis to make good decisions on sales, labor, cost forecasts, etc. "We can grow the business, we can control the culture, we can teach and educate our team around living Mediterranean and living the lifestyle of the Mediterranean," said Miles.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>He said that although their prices are slightly <i>higher</i> , they are still under $ 10 an average check .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Cramer questioned Miles about opening <i>more</i> restaurants , to which he replied that they are controlling the growth and building their brand geographically .  (Surprise) </span>"I feel a powerful need to get people to stop trading certain stocks and just own them as long as the fundamentals of the underlying company continue to do well," said Cramer."Own Apple, don't trade it," he reiterated.The company, at its Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, unveiled plans to launch a music streaming service on June 30.Cramer said Apple is both a vessel and an ecosystem.It's a vessel that draws coders to write programs.It's an ecosystem because he loves linking apps with his new phone, and that he can respond to queries using his Apple Watch.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>He adds that the conference is a flea market where smart people come together and write programs to make Apple <i>more</i> valuable than it already is .  (Surprise) </span>"I know the focus right now is on Apple and music.I'm not as enthused by that.In fact, I don't care at all," said Cramer.Cramer just wants to see good ideas come from people and then ask his kids later on what the apps mean and why he needs them.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>He thinks that there is something <i>bigger</i> going on in Apple .  (Surprise) </span>As long as they get developers excited, he will continue to get excited about Apple and its devices."That means own, don't trade, the biggest company on Earth, something that today's conference verifies in all of its glory," said Cramer.CEO interview - Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE: TMO ) Cramer in advising investors to get involved with all things healthcare, as that group can roar in a slowing economy too.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>One company that is <i>further</i> up the healthcare food chain is Thermo Fisher Scientific .  (Surprise) </span>It is the top player in the life sciences business, and it provides lab customers with everything needed to conduct real science, offering a substantial diagnostics division, an environmental and food safety business and a genomics platform."Think of Thermo Fisher as an arms dealer for biotech and pharmaceutical companies," said Cramer.The company reported a strong quarter in April, even when they took a hit from the strong dollar.They have a long history of making smart acquisitions.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Cramer interviewed CEO Marc Casper to find out <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span>"From a currency perspective, I think all of the multi-nationals are facing it, but we are navigating it effectively.In fact, this year, we should have 4-6% earnings growth despite some currency headwinds," said Casper.He said that half of the company's business is global, and Japan is one of their top 5 markets.He expects good growth for the year.He said their business in China is growing fast, with $1B in sales.It is their second-biggest market outside the U.S., and it has been growing at 30% a year on average for the last 5 years.They get 20% of their revenues from products that did not exist 4 years back, and they spend a lot of money on R&D.He said that apart from buybacks and dividends, the company is deploying capital for M&A.Cramer continued on his list of healthcare cost containment plays which will offer growth in the slow economy.Cardinal Health (NYSE: CAH ) is a very acquisitive company that acts as both a wholesale supplier of drugs and medical supplies, including everything from surgical apparel to gloves to fluid management products.It is a distributor of direct-to-home medical supplies, and operates the largest network of nuclear pharmacies.It provides resources to 75% of all U.S. hospitals, 20,000 pharmacies and 1.5M patients.The company has transitioned itself into drug distribution business entirely from its original food distribution business.Cardinal Health also announced the acquisition of Cordis, the medical supply business owned by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ).Last Friday, they also bought Harvard Drug Group for $1.15B. All these activities indicate that Cardinal has transformed itself into a consolidator in drug distribution.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>`` If the company can keep making these small but meaningful acquisitions over time , then I <b>could</b> see the stock ultimately trading much <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Plus , I think Cardinal <b>could</b> potentially be an attractive takeover candidate for its <i>larger</i> and <i>better</i> capitalized competitor McKesson ( NYSE : MCK ) , '' said Cramer .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It is the cheapest name in the group, trading at 17.9 times next year's earnings.Cramer thinks it's a steal.Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ): "My charitable trust owns it.I really hate the way the stock trades.I'm cutting it and just going, as it does not give me the upside a tech stock should give."Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ): "I think Yahoo is really undervalued, and that's why I tell people to play Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) through Yahoo, as it has the $8 cushion."IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM ): "I think IBM is an inexpensive stock.It's got to do a lot of things right in this quarter, and then it stops going down.They have a big buyback and dividend.I think you're fine."FireEye (NASDAQ: FEYE ): "FireEye has a relationship with homeland security.I think long term, FireEye is a buy."Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC ): "They have the wrong cargoes at the wrong time.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It can go down 10 points <i>more</i> , and then stabilize .
