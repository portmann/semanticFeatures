(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In this article , I will give a number of reasons why I <b>believe</b> he is wrong and why Apple is structurally not able to catch up anytime soon .  (Uncertainty) </span>First, I think there are some inaccuracies in Hibben's piece that I would like to comment on.Let me preface a critique with something nice: I really enjoy Mr. Hibben's Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) coverage and I know nobody can be an expert on everything, but I think he is wrong here based on my familiarity with the field.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A one sentence summary of his article would be that Mark Hibben is optimistic about Apple closing the perceived AI gap based on him <b>believing</b> it to be not very large in the first place , and second that Apple can easily deal with this by R&D , acquisitions and so forth .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In his article , he states : If it were any other company besides Apple , I would <b>probably</b> have bought the argument concerning secrecy .  (Uncertainty) </span>But this is Apple.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , I <b>doubt</b> that Apple 's AI activities have attracted much attention from the media .  (Uncertainty) </span>We all know Apple's just a device company, right?And what the media want to know is what the next iPhone looks like.It's media attention that leads to information leaks out of Apple.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>First , I would like to point out that `` this is Apple '' is not an argument but pure <b>faith</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>History is littered with companies who seemed like they <b>could</b> do no wrong while they were at the top and no right when something new came along and they did not react in time .  (Uncertainty) </span>IBM (NYSE: IBM ) was on top before Microsoft came along.Microsoft looked invincible in the 90s.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To claim that a single technology company is the permanent historical exception is an unreasonable position and needs <i>more</i> specific arguments why that should be so .  (Surprise) </span>Second, there is the secrecy argument.To this I would say that the AI world is not a large anonymous block.The community is driven by thought leaders in a few large tech organizations and a number of research clusters.It does not go unnoticed when Uber raids the CMU robotics department, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) hires Yann LeCun or Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) Harvard's Ryan Adams.Yes, Apple hires PhD engineers for Siri and acquires some small startups here and there, but Apple most definitely does not get any big names in the field on board to take the lead.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You <b>might</b> think it is not important for Apple to have big names on board , but the reason they are big names is that they have demonstrated vision and leadership in the field .  (Uncertainty) </span>Others want to work with them.Their projects can completely transform a business.For instance, the team around Jeff Dean at Google has been responsible for MapReduce, the Google File system and many other tools that have made Google able scale to billions of users.The same Jeff Dean and his Google Brain team have then gone on to the Google Brain project, DistBelief and Google's move into deep neural networks, now TensorFlow as their general deep learning framework, and the Tensor Processing Unit.This is what Apple is lacking in software/AI and it would require a serious concerted effort from top management to lure people like that to the company.Right now, the only thing Apple can offer is money and I don't think they are focused enough to really go out there and convince someone.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The founders of Siri have long moved on and founded a new virtual assistant startup , viv.ai , which looks technologically much <i>more</i> sophisticated than Siri and I have <b>doubts</b> they would be willing to sell to Apple again .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Apple has had its own Jeff Dean in product design, Jonathan Ive.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I have been <b>wondering</b> why management has not recognized that it needs to put substantially <i>more</i> effort into finding someone like that for their software side .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Mr. Hibben further contends that Apple 's gap has mostly to do with search and tries to illustrate it by using Siri versus Google : Although Arment <b>may</b> overstate the gap between Apple and its competitors in AI , there is a gap , and it 's mostly to do with that key AI function of search .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple's search capability just isn't as good as its competitors Well, this is sort of like looking at the exhaust of a Ferrari and a Fiat Punto and then concluding that the Fiat must have an exhaust problem, but that should be easy to fix, because it is just an exhaust after all, right?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>First , search is actually a task that can be performed well with ` traditional ' statistical machine learning , it is a combination of information retrieval and <b>probabilistic</b> ranking .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is why search <b>could</b> already become a killer application 15-20 years ago - precisely because sophisticated AI was not required .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Recently , deep neural networks have provided us with a general model for non-linear function <b>approximation</b> inspired by how the brain processes sensory inputs , e.g. in the visual cortex .  (Uncertainty) </span>This has also improved applications like search by virtue of recurrent networks being able to capture sentence structures efficiently.However, this is really just a consequence of the fact that deep neural networks are just very powerful tools in general, not that search is a particular AI topic right now.Apple is lagging in search because it is lagging in deep learning, and that means it is lagging in all areas of AI.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Let me make this as clear as <b>possible</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple is not just behind a little in one topic of AI.Apple is behind in the whole infrastructure, management mentality and work environment needed to catch up.Apple is the BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ) of AI.Like BlackBerry did not recognize the value of touch screens soon enough, Apple missed out on the importance of the cloud, distributed systems infrastructure and data processing tools, and then ultimately AI.To be competitive in AI today, you need a whole infrastructure stack.I know, I know, "hundreds of millions of users in the iCloud."To that, I would respond that the iCloud is technically not particularly hard because it's something called an embarrassingly parallel problem: the iCloud deals with the data of individuals and user data is completely independent from other users' data.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is quite literally just a question of setting up <i>more</i> data centers , load balancers , servers .  (Surprise) </span>This is nice for Apple because it is easy and nice for its users since they are assured nothing is done with their data.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the other hand , Apple is now lacking the kind of expertise companies like Google have built over the past decade while analyzing data from all their products and users to improve <b>suggestions</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Bottom line, Apple will not catch up on AI anytime soon.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A few <i>more</i> Siri engineers can not compete with thousands of Google or IBM or Microsoft engineers who have spent over a decade on building the software infrastructure and doing the research that is finally coming to fruition in the second half of this decade .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Siri SDK will very likely be a ` me too ' product and I would not be <b>surprised</b> if it is technically inferior to Google/Microsoft/viv .  (Surprise) </span>ai.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>AI research is at a stage where being competitive requires enormous infrastructure to deal with the data , it is not just about the research itself any <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Apple will continue to sell their devices and generate handsome profits from them in the coming years, but they missed the train on AI and a reality check here is important.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even if management completely turned themselves around on the issue and Apple opened up a high-profile research unit that was allowed to publish ( very important to researchers ) and had endless resources , it would take a couple of years .  (Uncertainty) </span>Unfortunately, I just don't see Apple doing that.If you enjoyed this article, scroll up and click on the "Follow" button next to my name to see updates on my future articles on software, machine intelligence and cloud computing in your feed.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Technology , Personal Computers, Editors' Picks</div></body></html>
