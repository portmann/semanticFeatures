(Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Investors should note that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> currently trades at a valuation of <b>nearly</b> 120 times this year 's expected earnings per share . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Much of that premium is because of investors ' <b>optimism</b> for AWS growth and profitability .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While Azure 's revenue for this year will only represent about 7.7 % of Microsoft 's annual revenue of $ 90.8 billion , the division 's growth rate and the potential for <i>wider</i> profit margins <b>could</b> lift the overall valuation for Microsoft 's stock , much the way <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's valuation is much <i>higher</i> than it would be as a simple online retailer . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>For the past several quarters, Microsoft has been selling its "Office" suite of products (including Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint) to a subscription-based revenue model.Under this platform, users pay either a monthly or an annual subscription fee to have access to the latest version of these products.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>By adopting this subscription model , Microsoft is able to capture <i>more</i> reliable revenue from its products , instead of relying on new releases of the suite to drive large one-time sales events .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Investors should appreciate this model because it helps to smooth out revenue and create <i>more</i> visibility for future quarters .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The model turns out to be <i>more</i> profitable over the long run as well .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>According to a recent Barron 's article ( subscription required at link ) , Microsoft <b>believes</b> that the new model will boost average revenue for each user by 1.8 times .  (Uncertainty) </span>The article also states that there are now 18 million retail customers using the new subscription revenue model and 25% of the company's corporate users have also adopted this model.Offering software through a subscription model, and using the cloud to distribute the software and store much of the data is a model that has been excellently employed by Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ).<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Investors <b>appear</b> quite taken with this subscription model as Salesforce commands a valuation of <i>more</i> than 104 times expected earnings for this year .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>(CRM operates with a January 31 fiscal calendar).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft 's sheer size and <i>slower</i> growth rate will prevent the company from trading at a triple-digit forward PE .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But the company 's multiple <b>could</b> certainly expand as it adopts a subscription revenue model that adds <i>more</i> value to each customer and leads to <i>more</i> reliable periodic revenue .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share.While this only nets out to an annual yield near 2.6%, Microsoft should be able to significantly increase its dividend over time.The company's last dividend (recorded on November 17th), represented an increase of 16% over the August dividend.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> importantly , Microsoft has been increasing its dividend every year ( except for 2009 ) since the company began paying a dividend in August of 2004 .  (Surprise) </span>Today, Microsoft currently has $5.4 billion - or about $12.41 per share - in cash on its balance sheet.This gives the company plenty of cash to use for future dividend increases, or for a special dividend such as the $3.08 dividend paid to investors in November of 2014.Microsoft has also been using its massive cash position to buy back shares of stock and reduce the overall share count.At the end of 2013, there were 8.3 billion shares outstanding.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Today , that number has dropped by <b>nearly</b> 4 % to 7.99 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Fewer</i> shares outstanding means that <i>more</i> cash is available per remaining share .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With Microsoft 's stock now trading at a high valuation ( <i>more</i> on that in a moment ) , it is becoming <i>less</i> strategic for the company to use cash to buy back shares .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Investors wo n't be pleased to see the company using cash to pay a <i>higher</i> price for its own shares , and so there will be <i>more</i> pressure on management to use the $ 5.4 billion to pay out investors .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Later this year , I expect Microsoft to announce another dividend increase - <b>possibly</b> much <i>more</i> than the 16 % increase from 2015 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Meanwhile, the 2.6% yield is still 25% above the 2.08% yield on the S&P 500.Buy Microsoft Despite The High Valuation Today, shares of MSFT are trading near 20.5 times expected earnings.This represents a peak valuation compared to anytime over the past five years.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A high valuation for shares of Microsoft make sense , simply because the company 's prospects today are <i>better</i> than they have been at any time in the past five years .  (Surprise) </span>Under Nadella's leadership, the company has become innovative and responsive to changes in the business environment.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Not only is Microsoft improving its products to make them <i>more</i> user friendly , the company is also selling these products in a manner that makes them <i>more</i> accessible to consumers ( and ironically drives <i>more</i> lifetime value per customer ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The Barron 's article mentioned above stated that shares of MSFT <b>could</b> rise by 30 % over the next 18 months .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That projection <b>may</b> wind up being too conservative .  (Uncertainty) </span>According to YCharts, Analysts are expecting MSFT to earn $3.33 per share in fiscal 2018.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If Microsoft continues to execute on its growth strategy with Azure , and the company is able to convince analysts of the <i>higher</i> customer value as a result of subscription-based products , that projection <b>could</b> increase to $ 3.75 or <i>more</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If investors are willing to pay 25 times earnings for this $ 3.75 estimate ( a valuation that implies significant growth expectations , but still falls short of the valuation placed on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Salesforce.com ) , the stock would reach a share price of $ 93.75 . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>This represents a 69% increase over the next 18 months, giving investors a strong potential return alongside a healthy (and growing) dividend yield.This is why Microsoft is one of my favorite income investments for 2016.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Technology</div></body></html>
