''  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While Comcast might be hoping that 's the case - a lack of in-building mobile 5G coverage would make the technology <i>less</i> of a threat to fixed-line broadband services - many firms are working on solutions ( using smart antennas and <b>sometimes</b> small-cell access points ) to get 5G to work indoors without putting up an antenna outside .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Separately, Comcast is upping its monthly data cap from 300GB to 1TB.The WSJ recently took a look at how data caps have limited cord-cutting… and led to a growing number of FCC complaints along the way.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Bloomberg : Qlik receives <b>preliminary</b> bids from P-E firms - It looks like another enterprise tech firm is due to be sold to P-E , this time with an assist from prolific activist Elliott Management .

(Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The fundamental user growth/engagement challenges Twitter has faced in recent years - appealing to a <i>larger</i> base of social media users , keeping users from feeling overwhelmed by a Timeline firehose that can feature a lot of duplicate and promotional content , and finding ways for non-celebrities to get followers and likes/retweets without engaging in social media marketing antics - are still very much in place .

(Uncertainty) </span>Huawei is still #3, with IDC estimating the company's share jumped to 8.2% from 5.2%.Notably, two lesser-known Chinese Android OEMs (Oppo and Vivo) took the fourth and fifth spots from two better-known ones (Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGF ) and Xiaomi (Private: XI )).Needless to say, the Android phone market remains quite competitive… and that's fueling the rise of high-end hardware at mid-range price points.Separately, the WSJ observes 1 in 7 Americans still don't own a smartphone, and that many of them have no interest in buying one.The Register's Trevor Pott: Is VMware the power it once was?- Pott reports seeing diminished interest among "influential" individuals, as well as some vendors, in attending VMware's (NYSE: VMW ) annual VMworld conference (runs from Aug. 28-Sep.1 this year).He thinks this is due to the diminished strategic importance of VMware 's vSphere/ESXi server virtualization platform in an IT landscape where <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services increasingly looms large . Pott: "A picture is slowly emerging of the future of IT.In the middle is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , or at the very least software and services built on top of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Around that lies everything else; a web of public, private and service provider-hosted workloads radiating out like a spider's web.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is a future where VMware <b>could</b> still be the glue that binds together the data center , however , that data center is but one point along the edges of tomorrow 's IT design . ''  (Uncertainty) </span>Beyond all of that, vSphere/ESXi is facing growing competition from Microsoft's Hyper-V and open-source virtualization solutions such as Xen and KVM.However, as its Q1 numbers show - vSphere-related license bookings declined sharply, but bookings for PC/mobile, SDN/network virtualization, and storage virtualization offerings saw strong growth - VMware isn't blind to these trends.SA contributor Doug Young: LinkedIn Networks In China With Low-Key Approach - Observes LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) has picked up over 20M Chinese users and 600 local corporate clients (including Alibaba and Huawei), even as Facebook, Twitter, and other social networking platforms remain shut out of the Middle Kingdom.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Young : `` LinkedIn 's ability to avoid controversy -LSB- in China -RSB- is <b>probably</b> due in large part to its low-key approach and its choice of an industry veteran with experience in both the US and China to head its local operations .
