still has X higher sales and owns over stores WMTs free cash flow dwarfs AMZNs WalMarts supply chain and nearly billion in cumulative CAPEX is a huge barrier to entry We owned a modest amount of shares with a cost basis of since April and added more yesterday at WalMart Stores Incs NYSE WMT surprise announcement caught the market off guard leading a to sell off on massive volume In fact WMT traded X higher volume of million shares compared to million shares on a normal trading day Essentially WalMart revealed to Wall Street that it was planning higher than anticipated capital expenditures and strategic investments that will result in a FY earnings decline here is yesterdays press release Lost in the panic selling was the fact that WalMart will buy back billion worth of stock Source October WMT press release Please note all Unless otherwise noted screen shots enclosed below are from WalMarts FY annual report As someone who prides myself from an investment perspective on running towards the fire not away from it I love buying good companies when others investors are panicking As people are well aware I have written two bullish articles on Volkswagen OTCQX VLKAY and bought shares at in late September and then more at when it retested the lows VLKAY has since rebounded to and traded as high as That said although I love buying on weakness and trying to correctly identify overreactions I am very selection as there are at least one or two blows up every week to chose from in the market especially lately This WalMart news fits the description of what I look for and we bought shares at yesterday We owned shares since April Given yesterdays announcement many analysts have been quick to mark this as the sign post of WMTs decline and proclaim WMT is a value trap I dont think this is the case Investors are underestimating WMTs amazing supply chain and sheer pricing power compared its competitors This supply chain and plus store count required approximately billion in gross capital expenditures over the years The conventional wisdom is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN is eating everyones lunch and yesterdays announcement means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is well on its way to slaying the giant I think these sentiments are utter nonsense WMT will still has over X higher sales than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>WMT can and will right the ship As an aside the great Bill Miller was on CNBC yesterday and he was gloating about how traditional metrics like cash flow are meaningless and how GAAP earnings dont matter He then went on to say that AMZN will be worth more When pressed he said it could easily be worth more than billion or per share Hyperbolic talk like this leads me to believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is topping out Also it is no secret that I am not a fan of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as I have written two recent negative pieces here on Seeking Alpha By the way the bond market rates WalMarts long term corporate debt at Aa and AA by Moodys and SP respectively stores and billion in revenue as of FY As I said before this is a very capital intensive business and very hard to replicate Although WalMarts debt is elevated at billion it is very manageable in the context of its size Also remember it is very rare to be rated AA by the credit agencies Im not sure investors are appreciating this fact at the moment WalMarts dividend is secure and the fears of a value trap have irrationally led to panic selling I think this storm will pass and WalMart is making the right investments by raising wages investing in its online division and substantially increasing its share buyback program As I said we added more shares yesterday at Lastly dont be surprised if one or two activist investors join Warren Buffett and end up buy a few billion dollars
