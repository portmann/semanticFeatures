(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We owned a modest amount of shares with a cost basis of $ 59.44 since April 2012 and added <i>more</i> yesterday at $ 60.40 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Wal-Mart Stores , Inc. 's ( NYSE : WMT ) <b>surprise</b> announcement caught the market off guard leading a to 10 % sell off on massive volume .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In fact , WMT traded 8X <i>higher</i> volume of 81 million shares compared to 10 million shares on a normal trading day .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Essentially , Wal-Mart revealed to Wall Street that it was planning <i>higher</i> than <b>anticipated</b> capital expenditures and strategic investments that will result in a FY16 earnings decline ( here is yesterday 's press release ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Lost in the <b>panic</b> selling was the fact that Wal-Mart will buy back $ 20 billion worth of stock .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Source : October 14 , 2015 WMT press release Please note all : ( Unless otherwise noted - screen shots enclosed below are from Wal-Mart 's FY15 annual report ) As someone who prides myself ( from an investment perspective ) on running towards the fire not away from it , I love buying good companies when others investors are <b>panicking</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As people are well aware , I have written two bullish articles on Volkswagen ( OTCQX : VLKAY ) and bought shares at $ 24.44 in late September and then <i>more</i> at $ 23.09 when it retested the lows .  (Surprise) </span>VLKAY has since rebounded to $29.25 and traded as high as $30.50.That said, although I love buying on weakness and trying to correctly identify overreactions, I am very selection as there are at least one or two blows up every week to chose from in the market, especially lately.This Wal-Mart news fits the description of what I look for and we bought 200 shares at $60.40 yesterday.We owned 50 shares since April 2012.Given yesterday's announcement, many analysts have been quick to mark this as the sign post of WMT's decline and proclaim WMT is a value trap.I don't think this is the case.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Investors are underestimating WMT 's <b>amazing</b> supply chain and sheer pricing power compared its competitors .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This supply chain and 11,400 plus store count required <b>approximately</b> $ 178 billion in gross capital expenditures over the years .  (Uncertainty) </span>The conventional wisdom is that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) is eating everyone 's lunch and yesterday 's announcement means that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is well on its way to slaying the giant . I think these sentiments are utter nonsense.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>WMT will still has over 4.5 X <i>higher</i> sales than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>WMT can and will right the ship.As an aside the great Bill Miller was on CNBC yesterday and he was gloating about how traditional metrics like cash flow are meaningless and how GAAP earnings don't matter.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>He then went on to say that AMZN will be worth `` <i>more</i> '' .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>When pressed he said it <b>could</b> easily be worth <i>more</i> than $ 500 billion or $ 1,100 per share .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Hyperbolic talk like this leads me to <b>believe</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is topping out . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Also , it is no secret that I am not a fan of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> as I have written two recent negative pieces here on Seeking Alpha . By the way, the bond market rates Wal-Mart's long term corporate debt at Aa2 and AA by Moody's and S&P respectively.11,453 stores and $485.6 billion in revenue as of FY15.As I said before, this is a very capital intensive business and very hard to replicate.Although Wal-Mart's debt is elevated at $41 billion, it is very manageable in the context of its size.Also, remember it is very rare to be rated AA by the credit agencies.I'm not sure investors are appreciating this fact at the moment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Wal-Mart 's 2.98 % dividend is secure and the fears of a value trap have irrationally led to <b>panic</b> selling .  (Uncertainty) </span>I think this storm will pass and Wal-Mart is making the right investments by raising wages, investing in its online division, and substantially increasing its share buyback program.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As I said , we added <i>more</i> shares yesterday at $ 60.40 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Lastly , do n't be <b>surprised</b> if one or two activist investors join Warren Buffett and end up buy a few billion dollars worth of WMT shares .
