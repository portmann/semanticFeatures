class='textDiv'>Netflix And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Are We Keeping Score Right Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Netflix routinely cites peak traffic data to show it continues to dominate video streaming This is almost certainly true but the data it uses does have a flaw While Netflix NASDAQ NFLX continues to generate its share of both bullish and bearish commentary here on Seeking Alpha and elsewhere one thing that is not in dispute is that Netflix is a pureplay streaming stock Unlike <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN or other competitors it has no other business to fall back on That means that aside from actual subscriber numbers the most important thing for investors to know is simply whether or not people are actually watching Netflix Is it continuing to draw viewers to its content Has another competitor begun to eclipse it It has become almost a matter of routine that every three or six months when Sandvine and other Internet research companies update their downstream traffic reports nothing changes Netflix is way out in front YouTube is a distant second and everyone else is so small they are actually further behind YouTube than YouTube is behind Netflix <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>iTunes Hulu all the big Internet names None of them can catch Netflix As Netflix management never tires of reminding everyone Sandvine traffic data features prominently in most Netflix earnings statements Last quarter they revealed the Sandvine numbers for which showed Netflix at of peak download traffic and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Video at only And that is all of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Video including purchases and rentals as well as Prime streaming which presumably is only a fraction of the whole In fact Prime and Video transactions combined barely match iTunes or Hulu which each offer one but not the other Apparently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime is getting trounced I have no doubt that Netflix is indeed far bigger than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Instant Video However I have recently begun to have doubts that the gap is as big as this Whats more if and when that gap ever does shrink substantially I dont think Sandvine will even know until the process is well underway The fault is not with Sandvine but rather with the assumptions some make when they read its data Sandvine is very careful to note when it releases the numbers that it is releasing a peak download report what is taking up the pipes when data traffic is at its highest The assumption is that Internet traffic at peak time probably looks not too different from what it looks like the rest of the day at least on the consumer side The whole point of Netflix and other services is to offer an ondemand library of content whenever you want it so there is no reason for customers to suddenly prefer another service off peak times They dont have to match a broadcast schedule or wait for a program to come on In the main I think this assumption is probably valid However there is one major difference between Netflix and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>that might be skewing the data Last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>made a significant change to their online video strategy Since Prime Instant Video has allowed members to download their videos for offline viewing But the option had always been limited to Fire devices including the Fire tablets and the Fire phone But as of September st downloads are available on all iOS and Android devices The feature is one of the few clear advantages Prime Instant Video has over Netflix which does not offer downloads on any of its content When the download option was limited to Fire devices it didnt affect the data much Amazons Fire Phone was a colossal bust and even its tablets have never really matched the sales volume of the iPad and Android But now every Prime member can take advantage of downloads on their mobile device even without a Fire The reason this matters is that downloads are not reflected in Sandvines data Sandvine is measuring data traffic not viewing The viewing is essentially imputed from the download data But if a customer downloaded a Prime title earlier in the day they dont show up in the data even if they are watching in the evening at peak time the same as the Netflix customers are Those who would dismiss this as a minor detail should not be so quick to assume in my opinion The impact of being able to timeshift viewing of streamed titles could potentially be quite significant Anecdotally I know for a fact that some people I know personally are using their Prime memberships to download regularly But of course that proves nothing and it is impossible to know how widespread the phenomenon is What is not in dispute however is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>now offers customers the option of using Prime Video this way and so far its competitors largely dont YouTube allows downloads for its Red customers but YouTube does not have contracts with major content providers to provide complementary streaming video Netflix and Hulu do not offer downloads at all So if downloads are happening in large numbers they are almost certainly almost all accruing to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>even from customers who would otherwise use Netflix And most of the activity is probably hidden from our view While Amazons share of peak traffic is small streaming videos share is extremely large The combined totals for Netflix YouTube Hulu and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>were of peak download traffic So if the total demand for downloads is equal to even of the demand for peak live streaming that would add percentage points to Amazons total tripling it Even if half of NetflixHulu subscribers dont have Prime as has been speculated even three percentage points would double Amazons total Of course one could just as easily turn the argument around and say that downloads during peak hour to be watched later are being counted so it all evens out But I do not believe as many downloads take place during peak hour The most common reason to download as many have noted is to have entertainment ready in a dead zone where Internet connection is not feasible On a plane a road trip etc When traveling out of the house in other words The whole reason peak hour is peak hour is that it corresponds to when the most people watch TV In other words to the evenings when everyone has gotten home settled on the couch and turned on Netflix They call it primetime for a reason after all Peak hour is primetime is home time I would make the smallest of intuitive leaps and guess that not many people are traveling or preparing to travel during peak hour If they were it wouldnt be peak hour So downloads are probably taking place earlier in the day when people are getting ready to walk out the door I am in a way suggesting that downloads could multiply Prime streaming fold which is what it would take to get Prime into Netflix territory But it could be proportionally significant which in the context of a growing baseline is especially important Sandvines endyear numbers showed Netflix up basis points from its April report Meanwhile <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was up more than basis points If that kind of growth is showing up in the peak report and theres more growth hidden in the downloads <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may be gaining on Netflix a lot faster than we think And if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>continues to grow it may be hitting onehalf when we think its hitting onethird or pulling even when we think its hitting onehalf Only <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>knows for sure if this is happening or not and of course they arent saying However investors would be wise to take Netflixs claim to dominance of streaming video with perhaps a little more salt than in years past Just as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>hides most of its profits by reinvesting them into new business lines it may have found a way to hide its streaming growth as well while it quietly builds a new empire to rival the streaming kings Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to
