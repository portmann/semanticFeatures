(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflixâ€™s first quarter earnings did not do the company any favors and came at a terrible time.Netflix 's biggest rival <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> made two big moves in the last few days , helping the company close the gap . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix revealed it had gained <i>more</i> subscribers than expected , but is not forecast to keep that growth going in the second quarter .  (Surprise) </span>Streaming media overall is growing by leaps and bounds, and regardless of earnings Netflix still carries the bulk of the appeal.Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) has not had a good few weeks.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>First , a reminder of its price increase for grandfathered customers returned to the news cycle , then chief rival <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) one-upped them in securing additional <b>exposure</b> in the film space . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Then , on top of that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> rolled out monthly subscription options in an attempt to lure <i>more</i> customers . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Depending</b> on which side of the equation you fall on here you can find good news and bad , though I have a sneaking suspicion the bad is going to rule the day .  (Uncertainty) </span>But regardless, this is coming at a time where streaming media is firmly under the microscope and everyone is debating what happens next.So how bad were the numbers?Well in the spirit of full disclosure let's do a quick look at both before discussing the implications.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The good news is Netflix surpassed earnings expectations for the first quarter and added <i>more</i> subscribers than expected .  (Surprise) </span>The bad news is that growth is not projected to hold in the second quarter.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Netflix 's subscriber growth in the January-to-March period was a gain of 6.7 million , which was <i>higher</i> than its <b>prediction</b> of 6.1 million .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Of that number over four million came from international customers , which is credited to Netflix 's launch in 130 countries <i>earlier</i> in the year .  (Surprise) </span>That in itself is a big win especially for as hard as Netflix has pounded the drum on global expansion in recent years.The problem and what sent the stock down double digits in after-hours trading is that the second quarter isn't expected to see similar gains.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Netflix has said it <b>believes</b> it will add two million <i>more</i> international subscribers with another 500,000 on the domestic front .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For a company banking this much on overseas audiences to help boost its business , you can see why it spooked investors for a <i>smaller</i> return to come this soon .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Some have suggested the decline could be linked to a <i>lower</i> catalog count of content in foreign markets as well as reports that Russian crowds have n't been as wowed as <b>hoped</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Netflix also didn't do itself any favors by not having any new update on the prospects of its hoped-for launch in China.Of course the common thread here is content.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix spent $ 5 billion in acquiring new content in 2016 and CEO Reed Hastings has said he expects to use the money from the upcoming rate hikes for <i>more</i> content , especially in films .  (Surprise) </span>That then leads to the question, is Netflix's original programming paying off?And is streaming still gaining steam?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It really all <b>depends</b> on who you ask .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For example , a Morgan Stanley survey released <i>earlier</i> this month showed Netflix not only leads the pack , but it knocked previous winner HBO ( NYSE : TWX ) from the top slot .  (Surprise) </span>Netflix jumped from 23% to 29% as the first choice for original content with HBO tumbling from 31% to 18%.Showtime , Hulu , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Starz all were represented in the single-digit range . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The other interesting thing about that poll is that it found Netflix users were <i>more</i> likely to also subscribe to a traditional linear service ( HBO , Showtime or Starz ) than non-Netflix subscribers .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite what some people <b>believe</b> this is n't an `` either/or '' scenario which the numbers from the survey back up .  (Uncertainty) </span>Still it shows this is not a passing fad and Netflix is making some incredible gains as a leader in the field.The problem is that when you're a company like Netflix that has done so well in such a quick period of time, the macro and micro implications weigh the same.We are in a position now where the industry is so transfixed on streaming media that it has forced linear companies to find a way to re-create their business model.In effect, the field is diluting itself.Netflix and its rivals likely expected this type of news as well as the subsequent shareholder reaction.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> especially has been stacking the deck extra hard here the last few days and is <b>hoping</b> to cash in . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The timing here on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's one-two punch of announcements was part of a smart and precisely executed plan by executives at just the right time . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So what does Netflix have on deck in the second quarter that <b>could</b> move the needle and combat its opponents ?  (Uncertainty) </span>The streamer has seven new shows set for launch in the next few months, including Orange Is The New Black and Bloodlines, while also adding new movies such as the Ricky Gervais headlined Special Correspondents, and the Paul Rudd topper The Fundamentals of Caring.What investors are especially going to be on the lookout for is how Netflix's first foray into the talk-show format does when it bows.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Chelsea , starring outspoken comedian Chelsea Handler will debut in <b>May</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>This represents the next step in the streamer's grand plan that has also included an expansion into multi-camera (i.e. laugh-track) comedies such as Fuller House and The Ranch.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It 's a process across the board no matter which company in this space you want to look at and while Monday 's earnings <b>may</b> be a setback for Netflix , it 's important for all investors in this field to realize today 's results are just one battle in a much <i>larger</i> war .
