( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> only meeting past expectations yet stock has doubled . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Stronger</i> dollar will further impact international business .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>One of the best performing sectors this year has been technology and online retail giant <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , which has seen its shares <i>more</i> than double . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>On Monday, shares hit another new high, mainly due to growing enthusiasm around AWS.However, shares seem like they are peaking in the near term, and this year's gains are not going to be repeated in 2016.The latest leg up came after a strong Q3 report , highlighted by the tremendous growth in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Investors cheered the segment 's 78 % year-over-year revenue growth , along with its operating margin that <b>nearly</b> tripled the year ago period 's value .  (Uncertainty) </span>The Q3 beat and decent guidance has analyst estimates on the rise.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , investors should realize that revenue and EPS estimates for 2015 are actually below where they were going into the Q3 2014 report , while shares have <i>more</i> than doubled since then .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 'm a little concerned that the stock 's rally has gotten ahead of itself , as I do n't know if AWS will be able to meet fast rising expectations in 2016 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Last week, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) made a key cloud hire , adding former VMWare (NYSE: VMW ) CEO Diane Greene to lead the firm's cloud operations.Google also is acquiring another firm that Greene founded, Bebop, a developer platform for enterprise software.My concern is that investors will lose interest in AWS when growth rates in 2016 start to slow and profitability gains come to a crawl.The last two quarters have seen year-over-year revenue growth of 81% and 78%, respectively, numbers that will be hard to match next year as prior period values start to rise significantly.Over the past year, AWS' operating margin went from 8.4% to 25.0%, and gains of that size will be hard to replicate.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Google turns out to be a large competitor in this fast-growing space , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>might</b> even see margins contract as it is forced to cut prices to remain competitive . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Another item that worries me , and this is not <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> specific , is the continued rise in the US Dollar as many are <b>anticipating</b> a rate hike from the Federal Reserve in December . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Since the Q3 report , as seen in the chart below , the Dollar Currency Index has risen by <i>more</i> than three percent .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>worries</b> me because the international business represented one-third of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Q3 sales . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Analysts are currently about $ 900 million above the midpoint of company Q4 revenue guidance , which <b>worries</b> me given the dollar 's strength .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>On a related note , investors have started to send interest rates <i>higher</i> and they <b>could</b> go up even <i>more</i> if we get that hike from the Fed .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>While <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's sales were up 23 % in Q3 over the prior year period , interest expenses soared from $ 49 million to $ 116 million . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>worries</b> me because <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's trailing 12 month debt ( liabilities to assets ) ratio continues to rise , seen below . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If the balance sheet worsens , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will need to take on <i>more</i> debt or potentially raise equity . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Either situation is bad because interest costs will reduce net income , or dilution will hurt EPS , making it hard to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to triple EPS in 2016 as analysts are expecting . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The final thing that <b>worries</b> me is that the stock itself has become a bit overextended .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As seen in the chart below , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> shares are <b>nearly</b> $ 100 above their 50-day moving average . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>I added arrows to show what happens when the stock gets too far above this key technical level, and the past three times it has meant a flat stock for months.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is a potential short opportunity here for investors who <b>believe</b> the stock has peaked , because a pullback to the rising 50-day is n't out of the question .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> shares hit a new high on Monday , but I 'm <b>worried</b> that the stock has peaked in the short term . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>AWS enthusiasm <b>seems</b> to be spreading like wildfire , but what happens when growth rates naturally slow and competitors like Google start to strengthen ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Analyst estimates are actually below where they were going into the Q3 2014 report , and the stock still trades for 120 times expected next year 's earnings ( which <b>assumes</b> they triple ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>On the technical front, the stock is way ahead of its 50-day moving average, which has led to months of stagnation in the past.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> investors have an opportunity here to fade the rally , with a short opportunity existing until the stock trades down to that key technical level .
