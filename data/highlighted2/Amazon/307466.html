Angie's List, on the other hand, has really seen a slowing growth rate for revenue in 2015.For example, the company reported $83.5 million in revenue for Q1 2015, followed up by a 4.5% increase to $87.3 million Q2; however, this changed drastically with the Q3 report, where revenue actually declined by $300k.At the same time, we saw a continual increase in the stock throughout the fourth quarter.I find that to be a heavy contradiction.Furthermore, panning to the bottom line, we see that in Q2 2015 they reported a net loss of $8.3 million and while breaking positive in Q3 2015, they were just above water with $100k in net income.It's scary to see that they are trading at such a high P/E with this kind of earnings base.OCF is back in the red to complement Q3 and Q4 2014, now at just -$1.8 million.We can clearly credit this to the low net income level and cash burn.Free cash flow has been negative three out of the last four quarters and currently is at -$11.3 million.TTM FCF is -$19.95 million.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's because of these weak metrics and non-correlating trading pattern that I begin to <b>wonder</b> just how profitable can Angie 's List be when Revenue and EPS continue to level off .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The company actually can not afford to have a slowing growth rate and I think that 'll start become <i>more</i> <b>apparent</b> after the February earnings report .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Take a look at the revenue and EPS projections below : In defining an entry and exit point , we see that the RSI is relatively flat at 45.4 and with the stock in between its two primary moving averages , it 's been in a very normal , low <b>volatility</b> trend for really the last sixty days .  (Uncertainty) </span>After the rapid upside experienced this fall, especially with the push from the rejected IAC bid, the stock pushed past $10/share.Especially considering the 51% cushion for the risk/reward scenario, I'm looking at a PT $5 before this stock becomes competitive on an acquisition front again.Below is the last six months of trading.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Naturally , there are different strategies you could choose to implement with options or other instruments to hedge your risk on ANGI , but I <b>believe</b> the picture is clear .  (Uncertainty) </span>As an added bonus, this stock currently doesn't yield anything, so there's no dividend consideration to factor into your potential short.The company currently trades at a 3m average volume of 863,364 shares, which while low, still provides ample liquidity for getting in and out.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe , furthermore , we 're not going to see any problems with potential acquisition speculation until my PT is hit , and even then we <b>may</b> not see attention .  (Uncertainty) </span>Finally, there is no stock repurchase program in place and the current short interest is 9.56%.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Angie 's List is set to report earnings in mid-February , so there are still a few <i>more</i> weeks left to capture some <i>lower</i> <b>volatility</b> , but I think that ER is going to be a real wake-up call for current longs .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The company will regret not taking IAC 's offer as I <b>believe</b> the only direction for these shares is <i>lower</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Especially if <i>broader</i> market selloffs occur , like what we saw for a majority of January trading , this is going to be an accelerated short .  (Surprise) </span>The value-add component of this company just isn't as unique as it used to be.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Going up against a competitor who has the financial resources to scale the same business in a <i>faster</i> way is just a knockout punch .  (Surprise) </span>I'll personally be initiating a short in ANGI this week.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Technology</div></body></html>
