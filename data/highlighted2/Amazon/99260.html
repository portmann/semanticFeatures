class='textDiv'>Netflix Stock Has Peaked Netflix Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha The stock split doesnt make the current high valuation any lower Netflix trades at bubble levels this cannot be sustained over the long term Netflix NASDAQ NFLX recently announced a for stock split This will not change the valuation of the stock which is currently trading at bubble levels similar to how dotcom companies were trading back in The stock split may result in a psychological benefit for retail investors who may view the stock as more affordable However the current valuation is so high I just cannot get behind the stock at these levels There are numerous reasons why I think the stock has peaked and I think it is likely to move lower I see Netflix stock as an irrational frenzy as it trades at X next years expected EPS Meanwhile the SP is trading at X next years earnings I understand that companies are awarded above average PE ratios for above average growth but a forward PE of over is just not rational or sustainable in my opinion I could see Netflix having a PE of but is just too far away from the norm Netflix investors must have forgotten that valuations this high do not last forever This looks like a return to the irrational valuations of tech stocks back in Netflix also has an unusually high PEG of I typically like to see companies trading with a PEG under or even below one This shows that the PE ratio is too high based on the companys year projected EPS growth The price to book ratio also is unusually lofty at Compare this to the SP s price to book ratio of and it is easy to see how far away from average Netflix trades in terms of its balance sheet The price to sales ratio also is high at This is even higher than Amazons NASDAQ AMZN price to sales ratio of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>investors typically defend the high PE ratio with the companys reasonable price to sales ratio However Netflix does not have a low price to sales ratio to defend its bubblelevel PE Ultimately any valuation metric that you look at shows that Netflix is trading at irrationally high levels I dont think that these levels are sustainable given that the company has other challenges with its fundamentals I am a strong advocate of companies that can grow their business while maintaining positive free cash flow This is the money that is used to pay dividends and for share repurchases However Netflix has been spending more on CapEx than it has in operating cash flow resulting in negative free cash flow This has happened for the past three years It also happened in Q The company has to spend a lot in CapEx to continue its growth If the company is unable to be left with free cash flow after CapEx spending Netflix will not have quality earnings Therefore I dont think that investors will keep pushing up the price of the stock especially at such lofty valuation levels Another declining metric for Netflix is its return on equity ROE The companys ROE has declined steadily in to below Therefore Netflix is getting a lower return for every shareholder invested dollar This shows that operational profitability is in decline I would expect a company with high growth to maintain ROE over but Netflix is not maintaining this level This is another red flag for the stock as its valuation is so far above average When investors catch onto this I think the stock is likely to sell off Carl Icahn is likely looking at some of the same things that Im pointing out in this article His recent announcement that he sold his Netflix position is likely to be followed by other investors as they realize that it is time to take profits due to the valuation and fundamental issues facing the company Icahn started his position at a better valuation made his profit and is moving on Hes an intelligent investor so I think that other large investors are likely to follow suit thus putting downward pressure on the stock price Netflix faces plenty of competition from large companies such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Apple NASDAQ AAPL Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA Verizon NYSE VZ and ATT NYSE T <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Instant Video offers unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows plus members get free day shipping for items purchased from the site Apple offers a wide selection of movies on iTunes Verizon FiOS is now offering smaller bundles of TV channels at a lower price to attract consumers considered cord cutters who signup for Netflixtype services instead of paying for standard cable TV services FiOS customers can now choose among certain small bundles of channels depending on what programs they prefer I think that this is likely to catch on with other cable providers such as Comcast and ATT Comcasts Xfinity and ATTs UVerse do offer a variety of channel bundles However I think that they may become even more flexible by offering pick and choose bundles of smaller packages to gain and retain the cord cutting value consumers All of this competition is likely to cause a reduction in Netflixs market share Netflix is trading at irrational valuation levels and the stock is due for a sizable correction The negative free cash flow declining ROE and increasing competition are likely to cause investors to take profits and drive the stock lower The company had multiple negative EPS revisions for and over the past few months but the stock kept rising The trade now looks tired I think that the stock recently peaked and is likely to fall further I wouldnt be surprised to see a drop of similar to the corrections seen last year All told there are better stocks to choose from in this market Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no
