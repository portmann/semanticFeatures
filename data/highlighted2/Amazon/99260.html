( NASDAQ : NFLX ) | Seeking Alpha The stock split does n't make the current high valuation any <i>lower</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Netflix trades at bubble levels â€“ this cannot be sustained over the long term.Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) recently announced a 7 for 1 stock split.This will not change the valuation of the stock, which is currently trading at bubble levels similar to how dot-com companies were trading back in 1999.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The stock split <b>may</b> result in a psychological benefit for retail investors who <b>may</b> view the stock as <i>more</i> affordable .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>However, the current valuation is so high, I just cannot get behind the stock at these levels.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There are numerous reasons why I think the stock has peaked and I think it is likely to move <i>lower</i> .  (Surprise) </span>I see Netflix stock as an irrational frenzy as it trades at 208X next year's expected EPS.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is trading at 17.7X next year's earnings.I understand that companies are awarded above average PE ratios for above average growth, but a forward PE of over 200 is just not rational or sustainable in my opinion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>could</b> see Netflix having a PE of 30 , but 200 is just too far away from the norm .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix investors must have forgotten that valuations this high do not last forever.This looks like a return to the irrational valuations of tech stocks back in 1999.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix also has an <b>unusually</b> high PEG of 22 .  (Uncertainty) </span>I typically like to see companies trading with a PEG under 2 or even below one.This shows that the PE ratio is too high based on the company's 5-year projected EPS growth .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The price to book ratio also is <b>unusually</b> lofty at 21.6 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Compare this to the S&P 500's price to book ratio of 2.82 and it is easy to see how far away from average Netflix trades in terms of its balance sheet.The price to sales ratio also is high at 7.08.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is even <i>higher</i> than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) price to sales ratio of 2.23 . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> investors typically defend the high PE ratio with the company 's reasonable price to sales ratio . However, Netflix does not have a low price to sales ratio to defend its bubble-level PE.Ultimately, any valuation metric that you look at shows that Netflix is trading at irrationally high levels.I don't think that these levels are sustainable given that the company has other challenges with its fundamentals.I am a strong advocate of companies that can grow their business while maintaining positive free cash flow.This is the money that is used to pay dividends and for share repurchases.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , Netflix has been spending <i>more</i> on CapEx than it has in operating cash flow , resulting in negative free cash flow .  (Surprise) </span>This has happened for the past three years.It also happened in Q1 2015 .The company has to spend a lot in CapEx to continue its growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the company is unable to be left with free cash flow after CapEx spending , Netflix will not have quality earnings .  (Uncertainty) </span>Therefore, I don't think that investors will keep pushing up the price of the stock, especially at such lofty valuation levels.Another declining metric for Netflix is its return on equity (ROE).The company's ROE has declined steadily in 2015 to below 15.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Therefore , Netflix is getting a <i>lower</i> return for every shareholder invested dollar .  (Surprise) </span>This shows that operational profitability is in decline.I would expect a company with high growth to maintain ROE over 15, but Netflix is not maintaining this level.This is another red flag for the stock as its valuation is so far above average.When investors catch onto this, I think the stock is likely to sell off.Carl Icahn is likely looking at some of the same things that I'm pointing out in this article.His recent announcement that he sold his Netflix position is likely to be followed by other investors as they realize that it is time to take profits due to the valuation and fundamental issues facing the company.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Icahn started his position at a <i>better</i> valuation , made his profit , and is moving on .  (Surprise) </span>He's an intelligent investor, so I think that other large investors are likely to follow suit, thus putting downward pressure on the stock price.Netflix faces plenty of competition from large companies such as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) , Comcast ( NASDAQ : CMCSA ) , Verizon ( NYSE : VZ ) , and AT&T ( NYSE : T ) . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Instant Video offers unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows plus members get free 2-day shipping for items purchased from the site . Apple offers a wide selection of movies on iTunes.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Verizon FiOS is now offering <i>smaller</i> bundles of TV channels at a <i>lower</i> price to attract consumers considered `` cord cutters '' who sign-up for Netflix-type services instead of paying for standard cable TV services .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>FiOS customers can now choose among certain small bundles of channels <b>depending</b> on what programs they prefer .  (Uncertainty) </span>I think that this is likely to catch on with other cable providers such as Comcast and AT&T.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Comcast 's Xfinity and AT&T 's U-Verse do offer a <b>variety</b> of channel bundles .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , I think that they <b>may</b> become even <i>more</i> flexible by offering pick and choose bundles of <i>smaller</i> packages to gain and retain the `` cord cutting '' value consumers .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>All of this competition is likely to cause a reduction in Netflix's market share.Netflix is trading at irrational valuation levels and the stock is due for a sizable correction.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The negative free cash flow , declining ROE , and increasing competition are likely to cause investors to take profits and drive the stock <i>lower</i> .  (Surprise) </span>The company had multiple negative EPS revisions for 2015 and 2016 over the past few months, but the stock kept rising.The trade now looks tired.I think that the stock recently peaked and is likely to fall further.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I would n't be <b>surprised</b> to see a drop of 30 % , similar to the corrections seen last year .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>All told , there are <i>better</i> stocks to choose from in this market .
