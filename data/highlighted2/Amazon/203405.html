(Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) and Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) are set to roll out their respective video streaming services in Japan in the coming weeks . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Both companies will be <b>hoping</b> for <i>stronger</i> debuts than competitor Hulu saw in 2011 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Hulu never achieved much success in Japan as it lacked original content and the <b>exposure</b> needed to overcome the country 's loyalty to DVD rental shops .  (Uncertainty) </span>Times in Japan, though, have changed.According to Shin Unozawa, former Bandai Entertainment employee and current chair of the Computer Entertainment Suppliers Association and CEO of the Anime Consortium Japan, the DVD rental shop culture in Japan has peaked .According to Unozawa, the inevitable transition to streaming media has finally begun.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This culture shift from DVD loyalty to streaming acceptance will assist both <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Netflix as they make excursions into the formerly unfriendly Japanese market , and we <b>believe</b> that the two figureheads of streaming contents will be able to generate brand-recognition synergies to create awareness that Hulu was unable to create four years ago . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As such , we <b>believe</b> both companies will find <i>more</i> success in Japan than Hulu did in 2011 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>On the onset , however , we affirm that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has the upper hand in Japan . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ability to leverage its pre-existing online retail customer base in Japan will serve as a significant competitive advantage over Netflix in an already adverse market . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This leverage coupled with a significant cost advantage and <i>more</i> diverse content offerings will make , in our opinion , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> the preferred streaming service in Japan . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Firstly , here is a quick synopsis of how <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime will function in Japan . Existing <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime members in Japan already paying for free shipping and other Prime benefits will begin to receive the video streaming service at no additional cost . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>New users will be able to sign up for Prime membership , with video streaming included , for the same price of <b>roughly</b> $ 32 per year .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix , on the other hand , will be releasing its streaming video services for <b>roughly</b> $ 5.49 - $ 12 per month , which equates to an annual rate of $ 65.88 to $ 144 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix will be offered to Japanese customers as 2x to 4.5 x as expensive as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . It 's important to note that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's $ 32 per year service is inclusive of free shipping on orders through Amazon.com . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In addition to a significant price advantage , we <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ability to leverage its pre-existing online retail customer base in Japan will serve as a significant competitive advantage over Netflix in an already adverse market . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>As can be seen in the graphic below with data collected from SimilarWeb.com , Amazon.com receives 1.03 % of its global web traffic from Japan . With 6.076 billion visits worldwide in the last six months, that means Japan accounted for 62.582 million unique visits in the past 6 months.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Annualized , that is <b>roughly</b> 125 million Japanese visits to Amazon.com per year . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>That makes <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> the seventh most visited website in Japan and the most visited shopping website in the country . For comparison purposes, video streaming rival website Hulu is the 50th most visited.Netflix.com is not among the top 50 websites in Japan, nor should it be as services have yet to be launched in the country.Netflix will be attempting to penetrate the market as an entirely new service, much like Hulu was four years prior.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Although the climate has certainly changed some in four years , Japan is still a <i>more</i> adverse market for streaming than the United States , and we believe an entirely new service like Netflix <b>could</b> have trouble with customer adoption .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Moreover , Japan provides <i>more</i> than just 125 million visits to Amazon.com per year - the country also provides arguably the most active user base on Amazon.com . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>As seen below, Japan's average visit duration is the longest among leading countries at 10-plus minutes per visit.Pages per visit are 10.18, second to only the US.Its bounce rate also is among the lowest, meaning its users interact with most pages they are led to.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> already has a large and engaged customer base in Japan , and we <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can leverage this customer base to make <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Instant Video the preferred streaming service in Japan . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Making this leverage <i>easier</i> will be <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Buy/Rent , which diversifies <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's video offering capabilities and <i>better</i> suits some of Japan 's favorite movies . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>According to Box Office Mojo , some of the highest grossing American films in Japan include Frozen , Maleficent , <b>Amazing</b> Spider Man 2 , Godzilla ( 2014 ) , Transformers : Age of Extinction , Edge of Tomorrow , The Hobbit : Desolation of Smaug , and Noah .  (Surprise) </span>Titles such as Noah and Transformers : Age of Extinction are available streaming on both Netflix and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Other titles like Frozen , Maleficent , <b>Amazing</b> Spider Man 2 , Godzilla ( 2014 ) , Edge of Tomorrow , and The Hobbit : Desolation of Smaug are not available via either subscription .  (Surprise) </span>However , these titles are all available for streaming to either buy or rent on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Some of those titles also are available on Netflix DVD.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Buy/Rent feature diversifies the platform 's product offerings and gives <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , as a whole , far <i>more</i> streaming content than Netflix , specifically content that has found popularity in Japan . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While some of this content is not available through a Prime subscription and instead costs extra money to buy and/or rent , the content is still instantly accessible ( unlike Netflix DVD ) and we <b>believe</b> there is an advantage in the consolidation of content in one place .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite the advantages we <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> possess in a Japanese market , it 's important to note that long-term winners can not be determined with high conviction at this point in time . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Netflix has already announced a deal with Japanese-based Fuji Media Holdings, giving the company access to content which should appeal to Japanese audiences.Through this, Netflix will be exclusively offering new episodes of the "Terrance House" and "Underwear" series.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has n't revealed in detail much of its plans yet , we <b>believe</b> they should and will follow suit . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It also should be noted the <b>possibility</b> of the services successfully coexisting remains viable as many users in the US enjoy the different offerings from both companies .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The Japanese video streaming industry has proven a tough market to crack , but we <b>believe</b> the synergies from the strength of both brands will bring forth much different results than what Hulu experienced in 2011 .
