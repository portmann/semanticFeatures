#A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN and Netflix NASDAQ NFLX are set to roll out their respective video streaming services in Japan in the coming weeks Both companies will be hoping for stronger debuts than competitor Hulu saw in Hulu never achieved much success in Japan as it lacked original content and the exposure needed to overcome the countrys loyalty to DVD rental shops Times in Japan though have changed According to Shin Unozawa former Bandai Entertainment employee and current chair of the Computer Entertainment Suppliers Association and CEO of the Anime Consortium Japan the DVD rental shop culture in Japan has peaked According to Unozawa the inevitable transition to streaming media has finally begun This culture shift from DVD loyalty to streaming acceptance will assist both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Netflix as they make excursions into the formerly unfriendly Japanese market and we believe that the two figureheads of streaming contents will be able to generate brandrecognition synergies to create awareness that Hulu was unable to create four years ago As such we believe both companies will find more success in Japan than Hulu did in On the onset however we affirm that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has the upper hand in Japan We believe Amazons ability to leverage its preexisting online retail customer base in Japan will serve as a significant competitive advantage over Netflix in an already adverse market This leverage coupled with a significant cost advantage and more diverse content offerings will make in our opinion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the preferred streaming service in Japan Firstly here is a quick synopsis of how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime will function in Japan Existing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime members in Japan already paying for free shipping and other Prime benefits will begin to receive the video streaming service at no additional cost New users will be able to sign up for Prime membership with video streaming included for the same price of roughly per year Netflix on the other hand will be releasing its streaming video services for roughly per month which equates to an annual rate of to Netflix will be offered to Japanese customers as x to x as expensive as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Its important to note that Amazons per year service is inclusive of free shipping on orders through Amazoncom In addition to a significant price advantage we believe Amazons ability to leverage its preexisting online retail customer base in Japan will serve as a significant competitive advantage over Netflix in an already adverse market As can be seen in the graphic below with data collected from SimilarWebcom Amazoncom receives of its global web traffic from Japan With billion visits worldwide in the last six months that means Japan accounted for million unique visits in the past months Annualized that is roughly million Japanese visits to Amazoncom per year That makes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the seventh most visited website in Japan and the most visited shopping website in the country For comparison purposes video streaming rival website Hulu is the th most visited Netflixcom is not among the top websites in Japan nor should it be as services have yet to be launched in the country Netflix will be attempting to penetrate the market as an entirely new service much like Hulu was four years prior Although the climate has certainly changed some in four years Japan is still a more adverse market for streaming than the United States and we believe an entirely new service like Netflix could have trouble with customer adoption Moreover Japan provides more than just million visits to Amazoncom per year the country also provides arguably the most active user base on Amazoncom As seen below Japans average visit duration is the longest among leading countries at plus minutes per visit Pages per visit are second to only the US Its bounce rate also is among the lowest meaning its users interact with most pages they are led to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>already has a large and engaged customer base in Japan and we believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can leverage this customer base to make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Instant Video the preferred streaming service in Japan Making this leverage easier will be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>BuyRent which diversifies Amazons video offering capabilities and better suits some of Japans favorite movies According to Box Office Mojo some of the highest grossing American films in Japan include Frozen Maleficent Amazing Spider Man Godzilla Transformers Age of Extinction Edge of Tomorrow The Hobbit Desolation of Smaug and Noah Titles such as Noah and Transformers Age of Extinction are available streaming on both Netflix and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Other titles like Frozen Maleficent Amazing Spider Man Godzilla Edge of Tomorrow and The Hobbit Desolation of Smaug are not available via either subscription However these titles are all available for streaming to either buy or rent on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Some of those titles also are available on Netflix DVD Amazons BuyRent feature diversifies the platforms product offerings and gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as a whole far more streaming content than Netflix specifically content that has found popularity in Japan While some of this content is not available through a Prime subscription and instead costs extra money to buy andor rent the content is still instantly accessible unlike Netflix DVD and we believe there is an advantage in the consolidation of content in one place Despite the advantages we believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>possess in a Japanese market its important to note that longterm winners cannot be determined with high conviction at this point in time Netflix has already announced a deal with Japanesebased Fuji Media Holdings giving the company access to content which should appeal to Japanese audiences Through this Netflix will be exclusively offering new episodes of the Terrance House and Underwear series While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>hasnt revealed in detail much of its plans yet we believe they should and will follow suit It also should be noted the possibility of the services successfully coexisting remains viable as many users in the US enjoy the different offerings from both companies The Japanese video streaming industry has proven a tough market to crack but we believe the synergies from the strength of both brands will bring forth much
