(Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The change , which could have a big long-term effect on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's EU income tax payments , went into effect on <b>May</b> 1 , and has thus far covered U.K. , German , Italian , and Spanish sales . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> already collects VAT on European sales , but its use of Luxembourg is one reason why its European income tax payments have been modest - the company paid just 4.2 M in U.K. taxes in 2013 on revenue of 4.3 B . The other reason , of course , is that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's international ops ( thanks partly to Asian investments ) have been in the red - <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> reported a $ 297M International segment op . loss for 2014, compared with a $2.11B North American op.profit.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's move <b>could</b> be a sign of things to come : Apple , Google , Microsoft , Starbucks , and a slew of other U.S. multinationals have also come under fire for their use of tax havens to cut their EU tax bills .
