#A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>You Shouldnt we argued that although hedge fund manager David Einhorn had shorted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN investors shouldnt follow his lead On the contrary we suggested investors consider buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>which was a topranked name on the Portfolio Armor website provided they hedged to limit their downside risk In that article we noted that Jeff Bezos pictured below accompanying his newly freed Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian back from Iran image via NBC Nightly News had a better than value investor David Einhorn In a follow up article after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>reported disappointing Q earnings Advantage Einhorn we discussed courses of action for hedged <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shareholders We concluded that they were likely best off staying the course In our view and in light of Portfolio Armors updated potential return on AMZN down from preQ earnings staying the course would seem to make the most sense now Since the hedge doesnt expire until July you can hold the position through the next earnings release Given that the cap on the collar is far above our updated potential return it probably doesnt make sense to buytoclose the call leg now This is also consistent with our research as part of our backtesting the hedged portfolio method We found that on average the highest returns came from holding securities for six months or until just before their hedges expired whichever came first Essentially this gave the underlying securities more time to recover from declines and generate better performance Bezos has certainly had a better April than Einhorn Einhorns portfolio holding SunEdison NYSE SUNE filed for bankruptcy and then the following week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>reported a great quarter summarized by the Fast Company graphic below In our previous article on the postearnings spike in Facebook NASDAQ FB shares Facebook Rewards Cautious Investors Less we looked at how hedges on that stock reacted as Facebook spiked after earnings As we noted in that article a sharp move up in a stock can make it costly to exit a collared position early As with the optimal puts above this optimal collar hedge may provide more protection than promised if the underlying security plummets in the near future due to the put legs combination of intrinsic value and time value for an example of this see the section titled More Protection Than Promised in this article However if the underlying security spikes in the near future the combined time value and intrinsic value of the call leg can have the opposite effect making it costly to exit the position early Theres an interesting difference between the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Facebook examples as well see below In the case of Facebook the hedge had a negative cost but there was a drag on returns due to the time value of the call leg In the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>most of the time value of both legs of the hedge has evaporated so the drag on returns is due mainly to the initial positive hedging cost Status Of The January nd Optimal Collar Hedge As of January nds close this was the optimal collar to hedge shares of AMZN against a greaterthan drop by midJuly while not capping an investors upside at less than by the end of that time period the screen capture below is via the Portfolio Armor iOS app As you can see above the cost of this hedge was or of position value Heres an updated quote on the put leg as of Fridays close And here is an updated quote on the call leg How That Hedge Reacted To Amazons Rise AMZN closed at on Friday January nd A shareholder who owned shares of it and hedged with the collar above then had in AMZN stock plus in puts and if he wanted to buytoclose his short call position he would have needed to pay to do that So his net hedged position value on January nd was AMZN closed at on Friday April th up from its closing price on January nd The investors shares were worth as of his put options were worth and if he wanted to close out the short call leg of his collar it would have cost him So represents a gain from So although AMZN was up by at the time of the calculations above if the investor hedged with this collar wanted to exit his position on Friday his gain would have been limited to Note that the difference there is within basis points of the initial hedging cost This makes sense as most of the time value of the put options has evaporated the same is true of the call options on the debit side but the investor paid about x more for the puts than he received for selling the calls in January The bestcase scenario here is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>keeps going up and is up or more from the January nd closing price by midJuly In that case the investor would be up about from the January nd closing price net of his hedging cost The worstcase scenario is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>plummets from here and the investor is down no more than from the January nd closing price by midJuly That maximum decline includes the hedging cost ie not counting the hedging cost the investor would be down
