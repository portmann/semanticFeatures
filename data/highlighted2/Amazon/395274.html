A shareholder who owned 100 shares of it and hedged with the collar above then had $59,638 in AMZN stock plus $3,460 in puts, and if he wanted to buy-to-close his short call position, he would have needed to pay $755 to do that.So, his net hedged position value on January 22nd was ($59,683 + $3,460) - $755 = $62,343.AMZN closed at $659.59 on Friday, April 29th, up 10.6% from its closing price on January 22nd.The investor's shares were worth $65,959 as of 4/29, his put options were worth $375, and if he wanted to close out the short call leg of his collar, it would have cost him $167.So, ($65,959 + $375) - $167 = $66,167.$66,167 represents a 6.1% gain from $62,343.So, although AMZN was up by 10.6% at the time of the calculations above, if the investor hedged with this collar wanted to exit his position on Friday, his gain would have been limited to 6.1%.Note that the difference there (4.5%) is within 4 basis points of the initial hedging cost (4.54%).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This makes sense as most of the time value of the put options has evaporated ( the same is true of the call options on the debit side , but the investor paid about 4.6 x <i>more</i> for the puts than he received for selling the calls in January ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The best-case scenario here is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> keeps going up and is up 30 % or <i>more</i> from the January 22nd closing price by mid-July . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>In that case, the investor would be up about 25.5% from the January 22nd closing price, net of his hedging cost.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The worst-case scenario is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> plummets from here , and the investor is down no <i>more</i> than 15 % from the January 22nd closing price by mid-July . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>That maximum decline includes the hedging cost (i.e., not counting the hedging cost, the investor would be down about 10.5%).Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Editor 's Note : This article covers one or <i>more</i> stocks trading at <i>less</i> than $ 1 per share and/or with <i>less</i> than a $ 100 million market cap .
