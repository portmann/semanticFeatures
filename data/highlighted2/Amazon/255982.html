class='textDiv'>Baidu Embraces <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Jettisons Music Baidu Inc NASDAQBIDU Seeking Alpha Dec AM ET About Baidu Inc BIDU Includes AMZN by Doug Young Bottom line Baidus disposal of its problematic music division looks like a smart move that was long overdue while its new tieup with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>looks minor but could get much bigger if it expands into the ecommerce sector Leading search engine Baidu NASDAQ BIDU is in the headlines with a couple of big strategic moves led by an intriguing new tieup with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN that could have broader implications in the ecommerce space The other news has Baidu merging its problematic music division which was historically plagued by piracy issues into a new company headed by an entertainment firm called Taihe Music Culture Development Both moves represent incremental strategic tweaks for Baidu as it tries to expand beyond its core online search business into other areas of the Internet The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>alliance looks relatively superficial but could hint at a broader future tieup that might see the companies work together in Chinas lucrative but highly competitive ecommerce space dominated by Alibaba NYSE BABA and JDcom NASDAQ JD The music merger comes two months after media reported that Baidu was looking to sell its music unit and appears to represent the dumping of an asset that was quite useful to Baidu early in its history but later became a liability That deal has Baidu saying it will merge its music business with Taihe to form a new company English article Chinese article Theres no word on shareholding structure but I suspect the new company will be controlled by Taihe and Baidu could ultimately sell out its minority stake Word that Baidu wanted to sell the music division first emerged in September in a move that I said looked long overdue previous post The original music service was a peertopeer PP platform that proved hugely popular with web surfers but also drew lawsuits due to the rampant trade in pirated music that it fostered Baidu tried to downplay that part of the business by more recently signing licensing deals with some major record labels to sell legal copies of songs But I suspect that part of the business never gained much traction and the lingering piracy issues on the PP platform led Baidu to decide it was better off without the unit This new deal is being called a merger but its probably more accurate to call it a sale that will relieve Baidu of this problematic asset once and for all Next theres the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>deal which looks quite minor on the surface The tieup will see Baidu become the default search engine on Amazons products in China including its ultra lowcost Fire tablet that will soon go on sale in the market English article Chinese article As part of the tieup Baidu and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will also integrate their China app stores and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will also integrate in China with Baidus iQiyi online video service None of these moves seems particularly groundbreaking and normally wouldnt be worth a big writeup But more intriguing is the possibility that the pair might be eyeing a much bigger alliance if they work well together <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Baidu have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on ecommerce in China over the last decade but neither has made much progress despite that effort Baidu made its latest effort in the space just last month when it launched an upscale online marketplace called Baidu Mall previous post Despite the lack of progress the fact remains that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is the global leader in ecommerce and thus has lots of experience and expertise in the area And Baidu is still Chinas dominant search engine That could become a potent combination if the companies decide to expand their alliance to ecommerce to challenge Alibaba and JD In this case both Baidu and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>are quite practical and adaptable and I would put the chances at better than that they could expand their alliance
