[...] But if Google's right, there's no quick fix.It won't be enough to buy Siri's creators again or partner with Yelp for another few years.If Apple needs strong AI and big-data services in the next decade to remain competitive, they need to have already been developing that talent and those assets, in-house, extensively, for years.They need to be a big-data-services company.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Their big-data AI services need to be far better , <i>smarter</i> , and <i>more</i> reliable than they are .  (Surprise) </span>And I just don't see that happening.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Becoming a major big-data AI services company does n't happen completely in secret and <b>suddenly</b> get released to the world , completed , in a keynote .  (Uncertainty) </span>It's a massive undertaking, spanning many years, many people, and a lot of noticeable interaction with the world.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's <i>easier</i> to conceal the development of an entire car than a major presence in AI and services .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Apple effectively validated Arment 's warning at its Worldwide Developers Conference <i>earlier</i> this month , when it announced it would open Siri to outside developers , as Forbes reported ( `` Apple Opens Siri To Fight Google , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> '' ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Opening Siri to outside developers <b>suggests</b> Apple has n't been building a big AI capability in-house in secret , which , as Arment pointed out , would have been unlikely .  (Uncertainty) </span>Back in April, Carl Icahn announced he'd dumped his Apple stake due to concerns about China.As the Financial Times reported over the weekend (free to read with FT registration) -- Apple locked in latest fight with China as iPhone is ruled too like a local brand -- municipal authorities in Beijing ruled that Apple's iPhone designs infringed on the patents of a Chinese manufacturer called Shenzhen Baili.The FT noted that Apple's phones were still available for sale as the company appealed the ruling: But the patent fight is emblematic of the struggles Apple has faced in a market that, until recently, has been its most important source of growth amid a global slowdown in smartphones.Sales of the iPhone fell 26% in China last quarter, compared with a 16% drop worldwide.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Earlier</i> this year , billionaire investor Carl Icahn , once one of Apple 's largest outside investors , said he had dumped his entire stake in the company , citing the Chinese government 's hostile attitude .  (Surprise) </span>The FT's Tim Bradshaw went on to point out that the latest ruling against Apple has come on the heels of other moves against the company in China: In April, its iTunes Movies and iBooks services became unavailable after the new government restrictions on publishing online material.Last month, it lost a trademark case in Beijing, allowing a fashion accessory maker to use the iPhone brand.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Bradshaw did n't refer to it in his article , but his colleague Charles Clover 's article ( also free to read with FT registration ) on Alibaba ( NYSE : BABA ) chairman Jack Ma 's recent comments <b>might</b> concern Apple shareholders , in light of Apple 's recent trouble 's in China -- Counterfeits often superior to luxury brands , says Ma .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Clover 's article did n't specify the products Ma was referring to , but consider how Ma 's comments <b>might</b> apply to Apple in light of the most recent ruling against it : The problem is the fake products today they make <i>better</i> quality <i>better</i> price than the real names .

(Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For Apple shareholders who want to stay long while limiting their downside risk over the next several months , but without capping their upside , these were the <b>optimal</b> puts , as of Friday 's close , to hedge 600 shares against a greater-than-14 % decline by late January ( screen capture via the Portfolio Armor iOS app ) : As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above , the cost of this protection was $ 2,850 , or 4.98 % of position value .  (Uncertainty) </span>A few notes about this hedge: To be conservative, the cost was calculated using the ask price of the puts.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In practice , an investor can often by the puts for <i>less</i> ( for some price between the bid and the ask ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If you are willing to <b>risk</b> a <i>larger</i> decline ( `` threshold '' , in the app 's terminology ) , you can potentially lower the cost of hedging in this manner .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The threshold is based on the intrinsic value of the puts , so they <b>may</b> provide <i>more</i> protection than promised if the underlying security declines in the near term , when the puts <b>may</b> still have significant time value .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For Apple shareholders looking to hedge with the same 14 % threshold , but willing to cap their potential upside to 10 % by late October , this was the <b>optimal</b> collar to hedge 600 shares , as of Friday 's close : As you can see at the bottom of the first part of the collar above , the cost of the put leg was $ 1,980 , or 3.46 % of position value .  (Uncertainty) </span>But as you can see in the second part below, the income generated from the call leg was $2,130, or 3.72% of position value.So the net cost here was negative, meaning the investor would collected an amount equal to $150, or 0.26% of position value when opening the position.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Two notes about this hedge : Similar to the situation with the <b>optimal</b> puts , to be conservative , the cost of the <b>optimal</b> collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In practice , an investor can often buy puts for <i>less</i> and sell calls for <i>more</i> ( again , at some price between the bid and the ask ) , so in reality , an investor would likely have collected <i>more</i> than $ 150 when opening this collar .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As with the optimal puts above , this hedge <b>may</b> provide <i>more</i> protection than promised if the underlying security declines in the near future due to time value ( for an example of this , see our previous article on Apple ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , if the underlying security spikes in the near future , time value can have the opposite effect , making it costly to exit the position early ( for an example of this , see this article on hedging Facebook - Facebook Rewards <b>Cautious</b> Investors <i>Less</i> ) .
