chasing the stock up But the online business was only up On the morning of November WalMart NYSE WMT reported results that impressed Wall Street The stock moved from the previous day to close at by the end of the regular trading day a spike of In the wake of the earnings release several Seeking Alpha authors have turned bullish While the gain is impressive this article will examine the reported numbers more carefully to unearth an important concern moving forward But first I will examine why the market rightly responded positively to the same store sales metric In my previous article published just days before the earnings release I argued that same store sales growth referred to as comp sales in the WalMart world is the single most important number for investors when judging the performance of a retailer I also argued that WalMarts Q growth of same store sales needs to be at least in order to meet market expectation Coincidentally the Q same store sales for WalMart US has grown by exactly More impressively same store traffic has grown by but the average spending per customer has declined Small format stores turned in even stronger performances reporting same store sales of Market sentiment had been negative since the company declining EPS guidance at the October investors meeting When same store sales which is the most important measure of retail store success met expectation the oneday increase in stock price is completely understandable However there are a few numbers buried in the earnings release that do not bode well for WalMart Important information about the digital business is buried in page of the earnings call transcript In typical WalMart fashion when a strategic business unit of the company did not do well CEO McMillon would switch the focus from the short term to the long term His choice of words regarding the online business is worth reproducing here Last month we told you about our longerterm plans to grow ecommerce sales and GMV That plan anticipates ebbs and flows along the way but we are confident in our targets We continue to expect to grow midtohigh teens for this fiscal year During the third quarter Global eCommerce sales and GMV growth both came in at around percent This was due primarily to continued economic challenges in our major international markets including Brazil China and the UK In the US where we have seen good growth for the year we continue to make progress on key initiatives but we know we have more work to do The upshot here is that the digital business is growing only at a disappointing the lowest rate since the Walmartcom sales were broken out and reported separately quarters ago This is a far cry from the growth rate reported by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Even Targets online business is growing at twice as fast as WalMart online At the rate the digital business is slowing down WalMart would find it impossible to be a significant force in the online world In order to have the scale to compete effectively with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Walmartcom needs to grow much more than to have a prayer of catching up Even the mid to high teens anticipated for fiscal would be far from sufficient to close the gap with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as a glance at this chart and some quick math would verify All this would be unimportant if the brick and mortar world was healthy and growing at the same pace or faster than online retail However this is not the case The chart below shows that the online retail industry has been steadily taking away sales from the brick and mortar world in the last years regardless of whether the economy is strong or in recession The online retail business shows no sign of slowing down It has been reported that the online retail business grew by in exceeding million for the first time The online retail industrys consistent growth can be seen below The weak performance of the WalMart online business which grew only in the latest quarter versus for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could be the primary reason Warren Buffett has recently reduced his holding of WalMart by When the Oracle of Omaha is selling it does not seem wise to be buying To be sure Buffetts sale took place before the Q earnings release But even after November several analysts remain skeptical of the turnaround story articulated by WalMart management WalMart is currently in a marketing war on two fronts In the brick and mortar front new evidence reported on November specifically the Q same store sales growth of suggests that WalMart is holding its own and perhaps even beginning to make progress against traditional rivals Kroger NYSE KR Target NYSE TGT and Costco NASDAQ COST The situation in the online retail front is exactly the opposite The WalMart online business has grown only in the latest quarter way behind the pace of reported by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Because Amazons online sales is already more than five times larger than WalMarts online sales a growth rate below <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>implies that WalMart is perhaps never going to catch up Gaining share in the slowgrowing brick and mortar market but losing share in the fastgrowing online market is an ominous sign for WalMart If current trends continue WalMart claim to be the worlds largest retailer may not last long Already it is no longer the worlds most valuable retailer
