will be banned from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site For years shorts would tear their hair out quarter after quarter when AMZN would continue to bleed cash with relentless abandon only to see the stock soar after earnings Now in what may be a perfect poetic symmetry following the quarter in which Amazons free cash flow soared to the highest in years printing at billion or more than triple the year ago period It wasnt just that one reason for the plunge may be that in the holiday season in which many had expected that AMZN would take away market share from an imploding retail sector revenue of billion a increase actually missed expectations of billion something AMZN has rarely done in the blockbuster for retail spending fourth quarter Another reason is that Wall Street finally got ahead of itself By a lot it was expecting AMZN to generate in EPS Instead AMZN missed this by a whopping with a final Q EPS of more than doubling the year ago net income on operating income of billion a nearly increase from a year ago which also missed expectations of a billion number On the spending side operating expenses increased to billion making some question if the companys core business profits will not be swept by Bezos many business growth ideas The CEOs biggest challenge is balancing Wall Streets thirst for profits against his own ambitions of using new technology such as unmanned drones and intelligent household gadgets Bezos is also eager to replicate his US success abroad including challenging Flipkart Online Services Pvt for Indias fastgrowing ecommerce industry According to Bloomberg the result was a surprise for investors who have become accustomed to Amazons ability to fuel sales by spending heavily on delivery infrastructure and new products The key question is whether the Seattlebased company can readjust its investments in the face of weaker than anticipated sales Still Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos appears determined to show that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can keep bringing in more profit and sales he pulled back on spending last year to deliver a surprise jump in earnings and will be showing Amazons first Super Bowl commercial next week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>reached this new level of profitability in that we hadnt seen previously said Kerry Rice an analyst at Needham Co LLC If they dont keep that trend going in the right direction the stock goes down For now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is not suffering too much in that regard Prime memberships rose a whopping offsetting fears that Amazons annuity cash flow stream may be throttled Curiously not even the silver lining was enough to save AMZN the companys cloud service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services generated sales of billion beating expectations of billion up from the billion a year ago and generating income of an impressive margin modestly shy of the billion in billion in retail profits across all of the companys other profit lines Finally not even AMZNs guidance was all that bad Net sales are expected to be between billion and billion or to grow between and compared with first quarter This compares with consensus expectations of billion Operating income is expected to be between million and million compared with million in first quarter Wall Street expects million So yes a good quarter but not good enough and one in which now that AMZN has entered profitability mode suddenly expectations exist that this profit growth can sustain and judging by the crash in AMZNs price that they wont Meanwhile AMZN continues to grow and grow and grow perhaps too much for its own good as the chart below shows while worldwide growth once again took a leg down the number of employees at AMZN has now grown to an epic up from only a year ago Thu NidStyles Thu FreeShitter Gee some folks already this tisk tisklol AMZN up nearly today on bullshit do I gotta sell my soul to the fucking devil to get this kind of insider info or what Thu gatorengineer Thu adr Wake me up when the fucking thing is down to where it

share price right before announcing their quarter cause they knew it would tank it Thu khnum Thu holdbuysell Looking at the cash flow statement one sees B in cash flow from ops Thu NoWayJose <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>had a chance to be profitable using massive warehouses a well thought out web site to display products and get customers to buy things they dont need and an efficient mailing system Instead they expand into one hour delivery with high overhead Walmart is closing these smaller closetothecustomer stores because of low profits and high costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is attempting a similar thing but is ADDING the overhead for delivery The model is doomed Thu Wild Theories Thu i_call_you_my_base Their stock tanked
