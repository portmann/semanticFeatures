Amazoncom will be introducing tablets with a price tag as low as The low priced line of tablets is just another example of Amazons longstanding tradition of accepting losses on key products in an attempt to build market share and put competitors out of business Although were not willing to buy shares of AMZN at current valuations we do believe AMZNs latest moves should put significant pressures on competitors This past weekend the Wall Street Journal reported that Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN will be introducing tablets with a price tag as low as The low pricing will only apply to the companys new devices with a small inch screen but at this discounted price <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is hoping the item will be a popular stocking stuffer for shoppers around the world The low priced line of tablets is just another example of Amazons longstanding tradition of accepting losses on key products in an attempt to build market share and put competitors out of business While there are no concerns that a cheap tablet with dialed down features is going to make a dent in holiday revenues for established players like Apple NASDAQ AAPL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could come out on top if the company can successfully convince tablet purchasers to pay for content such as books music or videos Amazons tablet introduction comes at an interesting juncture Earlier this month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>began allowing prime customers to download movies and television episodes to devices rather than streaming the content This gives users more flexibility in watching content while on the go Now with a a little advance planning you can watch your favorite TV episode while riding the train to work or on that cruise with the expensive wifi rates Parents of young children may be especially drawn to the new tablets which the WSJ refers to as disposable Not only can they preload shows on to the devices ahead of a car trip if the child drops the device out the window its not a huge financial loss <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>also managed to introduce these new scaleddown tablets before Apple released its line of gadgets ahead of the holiday season More Value for Prime Members More Competition for Content Providers With ultracheap pricing for devices and more flexibility for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>prime members we expect the company to report strong prime enrollment numbers for the second and third quarter An influx of subscribers to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>prime could present significant challenges for other content providers such as Netflix NASDAQ NFLX and Pandora NYSE P Both Amazons streaming video service and streaming music service has the potential to cut into these two rivals revenue And with Amazons bundled services and growing ease of use it is becoming harder for these two content providers to compete While the introduction of cheap tablets may help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>win more customers and build larger profits from other business lines were not fans of owning AMZN shares right now Too Much Potential Not Enough Value The company is currently trading near per share even while analysts expect the company to earn per share this year and per share next year The good news is that analyst estimates have been rising sharply over the last three months Table via Yahoo Finance The bad news is that even based on next years robust growth expectations investors are still paying more than times earnings for this company Sure as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>grows its market share in many different lines of business the company could raise prices at any time and boost profits But there is also the risk that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will continue to use its strong financial position to enter more markets delaying material profitability another year or two This new frontier approach has become the standard for Jeff Bezos Amazons CEO The problem with investing in AMZN at the current valuation is that investors could easily get discouraged by a new loss leader strategy by the company or even the announcement of big profit growth if the growth isnt as large as optimistic investors were expecting A Bearish Environment for Content Competition Although were not willing to buy shares of AMZN at current valuations we do believe AMZNs latest moves should put significant pressures on competitors Shares of Pandora and Netflix could trade sharply lower not only because of AMZNs potential to cut into their business but also because of the heightened level of fear in the market Following the market downturn in August investors will likely be looking for ways to cut risk in their investment portfolio With Netflix trading at a multiple north of times next years earnings and Pandora facing pressure from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Spotify and Apple all at once these two companies could be easy choices when it comes to deciding which positions to sell Thankfully option premiums are still high as traders expect more volatility for stock prices This gives traders an opportunity to set up bearish income positions such as bear put spreads or even selling call contracts against these stocks With investor fear levels high and competitive forces growing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon
