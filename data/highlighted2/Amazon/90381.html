(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> increased fuel expenses , stagnated revenue , and increased competition should partially offset margin growth from Expense cost-cutting program expected to yield results in the back half of fiscal 2016 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While new-age competitors like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> do not pose elimination threats to FedEx , they do present urban competition , which <b>could</b> adversely effect top and bottom line . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We believe FedEx is a Hold and have a $ 179 price target on the stock , with <b>speculative</b> upside potential from successful European market transition with TNT Express acquisition .  (Uncertainty) </span>We are initiating coverage on FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX ) with a $179 1-year Price Target and a 'Hold' rating.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> that while margins will benefit from FedEx 's cost-cutting strategies and share buyback programs , this growth will be offset by a shifting consumer priority .  (Uncertainty) </span>Several threats are rising in the e-commerce business , including <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , which concern us about healthy topline growth . There has been a clear shift in consumer priority from speed to quality, as Express revenues have decreased both sequentially and YoY while Ground revenues have increased both sequentially and YoY.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> this shift will accelerate given the existence of convenient speed-substitutes .  (Uncertainty) </span>While margins will improve due to an Express cost-savings plan to be completed by the end of this fiscal year, we feel these improvements will be mitigated by stagnated revenue and increased fuel costs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , while we do not <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> poses a risk to FedEx as a whole business , we do <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> adds legitimate competition to FedEx is select urban areas . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Based on our fair net present value calculation, FDX is currently trading at 9x EBITDA and 19x earnings, which we feel are fair multiples for a mature company with low-growth prospects and intense competition.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sales trends are illustrating a shift in FedEx 's consumers ' priority from speed to quality , and we <b>believe</b> this trend aligns appropriately with macro drivers .  (Uncertainty) </span>Express revenues have decreased both sequentially and YoY in the past 2 fiscal years, while Ground revenues have increased both sequentially and YoY in the past 2 fiscal years.This trend makes sense to us, and we expect to see it continue in the foreseeable future.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> the value of `` speed-mail '' lies in , as the name implies , the quickness with which something can be delivered .  (Uncertainty) </span>As far as letters and personal mail are concerned, the value offered by "speed-mail" can be offered via electronic messages.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As far as packages and other deliveries are concerned , the value offered by `` speed-mail '' can not be offered via electronic messages ; however , we feel that a new dimension-based pricing model will continue to steer consumers to the <i>cheaper</i> Ground alternative .  (Surprise) </span>This trend was emphasized in Fiscal 2015, especially Q4, which saw Ground revenues and Freight revenues grow 19% and 10% YoY, while the faltering Express segment accelerated its downward YoY sales trend to -19% YoY.We can see that the Express cost-cutting plan is a necessary for the business moving forward, as Express operating margins lag noticeably behind Freight operating margins and lag dramatically behind Ground operating margins.We also feel, however, that this cost-cutting plan will only marginally widen margins, given the declining Express sales trend described above.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We do , however , <b>believe</b> Express revenues will be helped FedEx 's acquisition of TNT ; this revenue boost is already accounted for in our model and in management guidance , which our forecast falls in .  (Uncertainty) </span>It is also important to note that margins in each quarter throughout Fiscal 2015 were skewed by low fuel prices.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While oil prices may not rebound to 2013 highs , we <b>believe</b> oil prices will increase noticeably by the 2nd half of Oracle 's Fiscal 2016 , which should offset some of Express segment 's margin gains .  (Uncertainty) </span>In attempts to cut operating costs and improve shipping times to customers , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is investing heavily in their shipping and distribution processes . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ultimate goal is to provide same-day shipping to its customers ( comparable to FedEx Express ) , with a focus on the `` last mile '' of a package 's delivery . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company is <b>hoping</b> to begin drone deliveries by the end of 2017 at the latest and is exploring the development of an app that allows individuals to deliver packages , similar to Uber 's business model .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>FedEx Vice President Mike Glenn expressed doubt towards the <b>suggestion</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> poses a threat to established shipping businesses . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>When asked about tech companies trying to construct their own distribution networks, Glenn said: "When you talk about the challenges of building a network, the scale, the input costs, the technology issues and the customer experience required to deliver what customers expect of companies like FedEx and our primary competitors, it's a pretty tall hill to climb."Glenn raises valid points.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> could <b>conceivably</b> compete with FedEx in select urban settings , FedEx has significant advantages over <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in cities outside of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's current experimental shipping operations and <i>more</i> suburban or rural areas . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> would have to invest significantly <i>more</i> money just to match FedEx 's current shipping infrastructure , let alone FedEx 's own efforts to offer wide-scale same-day shipping in the future . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Furthermore , consumers are <i>more</i> trusting of receiving their packages from FedEx and other shipping companies , so it 's <b>probable</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's proposed new shipping methods meet initial resistance in the market . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>On the whole , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's investment in shipping and distribution should not threaten FedEx or its competitors in the shipping industry . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We do feel , however , that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , with its large e-commerce reach , does pose a <b>risk</b> to stealing market share in urban areas ( city-to-city transactions ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Based on our calculations , we <b>believe</b> FDX is currently trading at 9x NPV-future EBITDA and 18x NPV-future EPS .  (Uncertainty) </span>We like to use a multiple on the NPV of future EBITDA and earnings as we feel this appropriately accounts for the future growth prospects of the company.Important to note, though, that this subjects the model's accuracy to the accuracy of our revenue and margin forecasts.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Express revenues decrease 5 % YoY in fiscal 2016 , in-line with the trend we identified <i>earlier</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Express revenues continue to decline at a 1.5% CAGR thereafter, and eventually report flat in Fy20.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> this accurately reflects the decreasing popularity for `` speed-mail '' amongst FedEx users .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Ground revenues increase 20 % YoY in fiscal 2016 , in-line with the trend we identified <i>earlier</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Ground revenues continue to increase at a 5% CAGR thereafter.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> this accurately reflects the shift in consumer priority to the cheap alternative .  (Uncertainty) </span>Freight revenues increase 10% YoY in fiscal 2016, and at a 8% CAGR thereafter into Fy20.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Freight sales have increased in this fashion , and we have no reason to believe sales will <b>deviate</b> from this pattern .  (Uncertainty) </span>Margins improve, beginning in the back-half of fiscal 2016, to a 16% operating margin by Fy16 and a 8% net profit margin by Fy20.Source: FedEx - Growth Concerns Remain Following Weak Earnings; $179 PT Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .
