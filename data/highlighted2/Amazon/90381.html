class='textDiv'>FedEx Growth Concerns Remain Following Weak Earnings PT FedEx Corporation NYSEFDX Seeking Alpha We are seeing a consumer priority shift from speed to quality in the shipping market and believe this shift could yield mixed results for FedEx We believe increased fuel expenses stagnated revenue and increased competition should partially offset margin growth from Expense costcutting program expected to yield results in the back half of fiscal While newage competitors like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>do not pose elimination threats to FedEx they do present urban competition which could adversely effect top and bottom line We believe FedEx is a Hold and have a price target on the stock with speculative upside potential from successful European market transition with TNT Express acquisition We are initiating coverage on FedEx Corporation NYSE FDX with a year Price Target and a Hold rating We believe that while margins will benefit from FedExs costcutting strategies and share buyback programs this growth will be offset by a shifting consumer priority Several threats are rising in the ecommerce business including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>which concern us about healthy topline growth There has been a clear shift in consumer priority from speed to quality as Express revenues have decreased both sequentially and YoY while Ground revenues have increased both sequentially and YoY We believe this shift will accelerate given the existence of convenient speedsubstitutes While margins will improve due to an Express costsavings plan to be completed by the end of this fiscal year we feel these improvements will be mitigated by stagnated revenue and increased fuel costs Furthermore while we do not believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>poses a risk to FedEx as a whole business we do believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>adds legitimate competition to FedEx is select urban areas Based on our fair net present value calculation FDX is currently trading at x EBITDA and x earnings which we feel are fair multiples for a mature company with lowgrowth prospects and intense competition Sales trends are illustrating a shift in FedExs consumers priority from speed to quality and we believe this trend aligns appropriately with macro drivers Express revenues have decreased both sequentially and YoY in the past fiscal years while Ground revenues have increased both sequentially and YoY in the past fiscal years This trend makes sense to us and we expect to see it continue in the foreseeable future We believe the value of speedmail lies in as the name implies the quickness with which something can be delivered As far as letters and personal mail are concerned the value offered by speedmail can be offered via electronic messages As far as packages and other deliveries are concerned the value offered by speedmail cannot be offered via electronic messages however we feel that a new dimensionbased pricing model will continue to steer consumers to the cheaper Ground alternative This trend was emphasized in Fiscal especially Q which saw Ground revenues and Freight revenues grow and YoY while the faltering Express segment accelerated its downward YoY sales trend to YoY We can see that the Express costcutting plan is a necessary for the business moving forward as Express operating margins lag noticeably behind Freight operating margins and lag dramatically behind Ground operating margins We also feel however that this costcutting plan will only marginally widen margins given the declining Express sales trend described above We do however believe Express revenues will be helped FedExs acquisition of TNT this revenue boost is already accounted for in our model and in management guidance which our forecast falls in It is also important to note that margins in each quarter throughout Fiscal were skewed by low fuel prices While oil prices may not rebound to highs we believe oil prices will increase noticeably by the nd half of Oracles Fiscal which should offset some of Express segments margin gains In attempts to cut operating costs and improve shipping times to customers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is investing heavily in their shipping and distribution processes Amazons ultimate goal is to provide sameday shipping to its customers comparable to FedEx Express with a focus on the last mile of a packages delivery The company is hoping to begin drone deliveries by the end of at the latest and is exploring the development of an app that allows individuals to deliver packages similar to Ubers business model FedEx Vice President Mike Glenn expressed doubt towards the suggestion that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>poses a threat to established shipping businesses When asked about tech companies trying to construct their own distribution networks Glenn said When you talk about the challenges of building a network the scale the input costs the technology issues and the customer experience required to deliver what customers expect of companies like FedEx and our primary competitors its a pretty tall hill to climb Glenn raises valid points While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could conceivably compete with FedEx in select urban settings FedEx has significant advantages over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in cities outside of Amazons current experimental shipping operations and more suburban or rural areas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would have to invest significantly more money just to match FedExs current shipping infrastructure let alone FedExs own efforts to offer widescale sameday shipping in the future Furthermore consumers are more trusting of receiving their packages from FedEx and other shipping companies so its probable that Amazons proposed new shipping methods meet initial resistance in the market On the whole Amazons investment in shipping and distribution should not threaten FedEx or its competitors in the shipping industry We do feel however that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>with its large ecommerce reach does pose a risk to stealing market share in urban areas citytocity transactions Based on our calculations we believe FDX is currently trading at x NPVfuture EBITDA and x NPVfuture EPS We like to use a multiple on the NPV of future EBITDA and earnings as we feel this appropriately accounts for the future growth prospects of the company Important to note though that this subjects the models accuracy to the accuracy of our revenue and margin forecasts Express revenues decrease YoY in fiscal inline with the trend we identified earlier Express revenues continue to decline at a CAGR thereafter and eventually report flat in Fy We believe this accurately reflects the decreasing popularity for speedmail amongst FedEx users Ground revenues increase YoY in fiscal inline with the trend we identified earlier Ground revenues continue to increase at a CAGR thereafter We believe this accurately reflects the shift in consumer priority to the cheap alternative Freight revenues increase YoY in fiscal and at a CAGR thereafter into Fy Freight sales have increased in this fashion and we have no reason to believe sales will deviate from this pattern Margins improve beginning in the backhalf of fiscal to a operating margin by Fy and a net profit margin
