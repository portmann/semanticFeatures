class='textDiv'>Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Desperately Needs BB To Be Profitable Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Amazons China market share is after more than a dozen years in the country Although of their revenue is from international business they have very little to show in terms of profitability I outline why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may be looking at a viable BB model using the resources it is gradually acquiring over the past months In Amazons NASDAQ AMZN international business accounted for of total revenue but the segment posted an operating loss of million on the billion it earned during the fiscal year Things havent improved for the last three years as the company as a whole continues to hemorrhage money in its pursuit of top line expansion In my article Amazons Pursuit of Shipping Excellence I outline what they were trying to do to stem their losses In this article I show a way out for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to gain a foothold in a business with the advantages and resources they already possess In the AsiaPacific region <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has operations in Australia India China and Japan in Europe the retailer has operations in the United Kingdom Spain Netherlands Germany France and Italy and in South America the company has stepped into Mexico and Brazil Its a good mix of developed and emerging markets outside United States and Canada Its very clear from the above table that their move into those specific countries was a calculated one that covered of the top ecommerce destinations With most of the best possible countries already covered the odds of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>further expanding to new destinations are far smaller than the odds of them further penetrating these existing markets To understand where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>stands with respect to one of its biggest overseas markets and why it needs a different strategy to move towards profitability lets take China as an ideal showcase nation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been in the BC business to consumer space in China since thats years In that time despite being the market leader in their own country and in several others theyve only managed to capture a meager of total market share In the country where Alibaba NYSE BABA rules the roost <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been struggling to increase market share ever since they entered Yet they hold a lowly eighth place ranking after being there for more than a dozen years Well China is a tough market to crack for any foreign company The Chinese government has a penchant for messing up foreign players efforts to support their homegrown businesses As of now and into the foreseeable future there is exactly a zero percent chance that the Chinese government is going to let <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>compete headon with the darling company of the country Alibaba Lets not forget Jack Ma Alibabas founder frequently travels with their countrys president during the latters overseas visits underlining the importance China affords Alibaba I think for the most part <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has already missed the boat on the explosive growth of the Chinese ecommerce market Though the market itself is expected to keep growing at doubledigit rates for the next few years I have a hard time seeing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>reap any tangible benefits of that growth The Peoples Republic of China PRC and India regulate Amazons and its affiliates businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict iii the sale of media and other products and services For example in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements amazoncn is operated by PRC companies that are indirectly owned either wholly or partially by PRC nationals In addition we provide certain technology services in China in conjunction with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services In India the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multibrand retail trading activities With a situation like this to deal with its no wonder why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>still has poor market share in countries like China A New Path to Profitability What Can <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Do to Change the StatusQuo Amazons entry into the BB space in any significant way in China is not an option The space is already dominated by Alibaba and no amount of media spin can change that However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does have one key advantage over Alibaba in terms of crossborder business It has the faith and goodwill of its home country the very country that China targets as its most profitable international market Think about that for a minute <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has the advantage of being the home team in the US Imagine a Chinese business looking to do bulk sales in the US When push comes to shove who do you think theyll find to be a better partner someone who knows the target market like the back of their hand or a Chinese company that doesnt yet have a hook in that market Flip that around and ask yourself who a US buyer would trust to carry out the transaction a company that falls within the jurisdiction of the United States or a Chinese company that is less answerable to US authorities No doubt if that company were Alibaba they would meticulously ensure that any customer complaints are taken care of speedily and fairly Even then who do you think the average buyer in the US would tend to purchase from Thats exactly the advantage I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>should capitalize on and thats what I think theyre slowly getting into From this new perspective you can see how vital that ocean forwarding license from the US government is to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>With the license and the help of logistics partners in ocean freight forwarding they can now easily connect their United States users with Chinese sellers But there is one more problem here If they do enter this segment of international trade then BC would be the worst possible idea Even with domestic shipping costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is barely keeping its head above water so thats not an option And thats where BB features large on Amazons horizon as their most profitable opportunity yet potentially even bigger than what they can ever hope to do with their hugely profitable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Service division But not just BB in itself what they need is a BB marketplace where businesses in the most consumerhungry nation America can easily source finished goods and other commodities from China the worlds largest manufacturer As Alibaba has shown a BB marketplace is unarguably the most profitable segment within ecommerce but its the marketplace model that makes the company that profitable I have covered this in detail in my earlier article on Alibaba and the BABA opportunity As an example shipping shirts to a business in the US is far cheaper than shipping shirt to a buyer in the same location A higher transaction value means lower peritem shipping cost and that can translate into higher profitability for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>something they sorely need at this point Looking at this through the prism of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>China securing the ocean freight license this model makes a lot of sense They can get into it in a big way because they already have the technology infrastructure and user base All they need is to connect Chinese sellers to US businesses process the transaction facilitate the shipping and delivery and they get to keep a bulk of what they make on each transaction just the way Alibaba is doing in China Investorspeak Amazons Only Moat Against an Alibaba Incursion I believe this is the most important moat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can ever build to prevent Alibaba from coming into its existing markets in a big way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has the platform to do it and now theyve got the ability to not rely on ocean freight partners for this Within the US it can use the fleet of cargo planes that it is negotiating leases on and other options to bring in merchandise from China and Europe In addition it already has a shiny new fleet of delivery trucks that would be better used hauling bulk orders to fewer locations reducing that painful lastmile cost that comes with BC selling So now we have a scenario where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is in an ideal position to take advantage of its dominant position with buyers in the United States to gain profitability from an international seller market If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>opens up its doors to US buyers with such an offering I think theyll be lining up all the way to China to get in on the deal The buyers wont have the fullon hassle of dealing with Chinas export policies and the sellers wont have to deal with the trouble of import laws in the US As long as buyers and sellers stay within the scope of international trade laws governing both nations this is a highly viable opportunity for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>The only problem I see with this model is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has always been a control freak at every stage of its supply chain In a BB marketplace thats not going to be practical Even Alibaba is scourged with accusations of fake products being shipped through its networks and Jack Ma is vociferously against such practices Yet they happen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>China wont have a high level of control over the quality of goods shipped and not quite the power of Alibaba to deal with issues that arise with Chinese sellers Despite this big fear I dont see it as being prohibitive to Amazons entry into this space They may have to invest in a higher measure of quality control prior to products being shipped or find other options to prevent the misuse of its shipping channels but the lure of unlimited potential for profitability will make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>fight harder than ever to find a solution to this new problem My opinion is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is thinking exactly along these lines with respect to trade with China and something is definitely on the fire at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>HQ While all along everyone keeps thinking that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is going to compete with UPS and FedEx in a big way Bezos seems to have a much longer vision of Amazons future And thats not even the end of it China is just one example of the potential of this for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Amazons activities in India indicate efforts are already on to increase their marketplace strength The number one etailer in India has already added sellers to its global marketplace since starting the program eight months ago The global marketplace now allows these Indian businesses to sell their products to customers in the US Japan Canada France Germany Italy Spain United Kingdom and Mexico It is highly unlikely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been unaware of the fact that a marketplace model like Alibabas is where the real money is I think theyre making moves in the right direction by exploring this as a possible future for themselves and its going to be a repeat of what theyre doing with AWS converting a lossmaking business into a profit center that rivals their core business of retail to individual consumers Only in this case the numbers are unfathomable I invite you to follow me and see how the ecommerce landscape is slowly being reshaped by companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Alibaba and to enjoy reading my other articles on the ecommerce retail sportswear automobile and other consumer
