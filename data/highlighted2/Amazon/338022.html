(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix' international expansion is the key driver of the company's growth.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As Netflix is ramping up its original content expenditures , some authors argue new shows such as `` Fuller House '' will lead the company into <i>broader</i> audiences ( e.g. tweens ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In this article , I take a <i>closer</i> look at one of Netflix ' international products ( UK ) and reason about the expansion strategy .  (Surprise) </span>In January, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) has announced its expansion into what is essentially the whole world (without China).As domestic subscribers have plateaued and competition from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Instant Video , Hulu and HBO ( NYSE : TWX ) is looming , investors are judging Netflix on its ability to quickly capture a large international audience while its competitors are still figuring out their strategy . Other contributors have gone through the numbers ( here or here ).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In this article , I take a <i>more</i> detailed look at the international expansion .  (Surprise) </span>Let's look at an actual content library instead of subscriber numbers.I live in the UK, where Netflix launched in 2012.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Since then , the company has been highly successful in gaining subscribers , with <b>roughly</b> five million customers , against a total population of ~ 65 million .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Below is a figure from Statista illustrating the rapid subscriber count ( note : Statista also makes <b>predictions</b> about 2020 subscriber count , which I omitted because I think they are likely too noisy to be relevant ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>How does that correspond to content?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Here is where it gets a little <i>harder</i> to investigate .  (Surprise) </span>I found a website that tracks Netflix' content library in the United Kingdom.Now, it is not immediately clear whether these numbers are reliable, but I cross-checked a few entries and recent additions and removals are easy to follow.Currently, there are 3,027 entries in the Netflux UK catalog, compared to just over 5,600 titles in the US catalog.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A <i>more</i> interesting number is the change over time : A year ago , Netflix US had over 7000 titles , while Netflix UK had ~ 2700 titles in March 2015 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The steep decline in US titles <b>presumably</b> reflects the company 's shift toward original content , which was also evidenced by not renewing licensing deals with networks such as Epix .  (Uncertainty) </span>In a previous article on Netflix , I instigated that Netflix UK had an inferior content library and was threatened by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Some commenters argued that Netflix UK would soon enough catch up with the US library.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>At around 11 % content growth YoY , that will only happen if Netflix US shrinks even <i>more</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The Netflix catalog is not a monotonically increasing function.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For instance , in 2016 , there were 352 additions versus 324 removals so far , for a total net inflow of just 28 titles , which <b>suggests</b> a significant slowdown in growth .  (Uncertainty) </span>This, of course, reflects the company's increasing capital expenditures for growing its content, the costs of which have been pointed out by other contributors.These numbers of course do not allow qualitative statements about the new content compared to the removed content.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As we know , Netflix is pushing massively toward producing <i>more</i> of its own shows , e.g. recently Fuller House .  (Surprise) </span>However, I would invite readers to look at the latest additions and removals for themselves, which brings me to my next point.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The vast majority of Netflix titles stay on for no <i>more</i> than 12 months , according to the tracking site .  (Surprise) </span>The release year with the highest number of titles available is 2014.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In my opinion , we can <b>roughly</b> summarize the content strategy , aside from original content , as follows : Permanent additions to the library are often cheaper/dated or niche content .  (Uncertainty) </span>The core of the library (again, aside from originals), are 2-to-5-year old movies that are licensed for a limited amount of time, hence a slow-down in net-influx.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now , Netflix would prefer if you did not notice this in too much detail .  (Uncertainty) </span>In my opinion, this explains the weirdly-designed search function.It also explains the lack of a list view, which would be the easiest thing in the world to implement.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , it would also give users an easy overview of the library and make them realize how weak the content just <b>might</b> be .  (Uncertainty) </span>Instead, Netflix displays a rotating view of whatever it wants you to see.Again, I know the counterargument to this is supposed to be Netflix's original content, which is heavily advertised.There is only one problem with that.Not everyone cares for it.In the UK, according to a survey carried out last year, two thirds reported they were not watching original programming, but rather US TV shows and movies.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Of course , this <b>might</b> also change in the future as <i>more</i> original content is created .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , I think there is still a big <b>risk</b> associated with Netflix strategy , which I will now summarize .  (Uncertainty) </span>Whenever I talk to Netflix users here in the UK, most of them are not especially happy with the content.My analysis from above explains why.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Users <b>might</b> intuitively feel `` there is nothing I want to watch . ''  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They might not understand this is the result of Netflix 's <b>presumed</b> deliberate attempts to hide its sparse library behind its layout without an option to list it in full .  (Uncertainty) </span>What we are seeing is a "Fake it till you make it" strategy.Netflix cannot afford to bring up its libraries in all regions to US level.As we saw, the overall content influx is slowing down as a result to its expensive shift to an original content producer.This does not mean Netflix will not continue to sign up subscribers.What it means is the reason Netflix is able to do so is because right now, the main thing Netflix has going for it in most countries is that ... it is there.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It should also be noted that the UK was one of the <i>earlier</i> markets Netflix expanded into , so the situation in other European countries is <b>presumably</b> <i>worse</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While piling up expenses to produce <i>more</i> content , the company has become vulnerable .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As soon as viable competitors become <i>more</i> broadly available in other markets ( <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Hulu and HBO <b>probably</b> being among the first ) , I continue to expect a major correction , potentially triggered by a loss in US subscribers .
