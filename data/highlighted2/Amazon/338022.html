content expenditures some authors argue new shows such as Fuller House will lead the company into broader audiences eg tweens In this article I take a closer look at one of Netflix international products UK and reason about the expansion strategy In January Netflix NASDAQ NFLX has announced its expansion into what is essentially the whole world without China As domestic subscribers have plateaued and competition from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Instant Video Hulu and HBO NYSE TWX is looming investors are judging Netflix on its ability to quickly capture a large international audience while its competitors are still figuring out their strategy Other contributors have gone through the numbers here or here In this article I take a more detailed look at the international expansion Lets look at an actual content library instead of subscriber numbers I live in the UK where Netflix launched in Since then the company has been highly successful in gaining subscribers with roughly five million customers against a total population of million Below is a figure from Statista illustrating the rapid subscriber count note Statista also makes predictions about subscriber count which I omitted because I think they are likely too noisy to be relevant How does that correspond to content Here is where it gets a little harder to investigate I found a website that tracks Netflix content library in the United Kingdom Now it is not immediately clear whether these numbers are reliable but I crosschecked a few entries and recent additions and removals are easy to follow Currently there are entries in the Netflux UK catalog compared to just over titles in the US catalog A more interesting number is the change over time A year ago Netflix US had over titles while Netflix UK had titles in March The steep decline in US titles presumably reflects the companys shift toward original content which was also evidenced by not renewing licensing deals with networks such as Epix In a previous article on Netflix I instigated that Netflix UK had an inferior content library and was threatened by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Some commenters argued that Netflix UK would soon enough catch up with the US library At around content growth YoY that will only happen if Netflix US shrinks even more The Netflix catalog is not a monotonically increasing function For instance in there were additions versus removals so far for a total net inflow of just titles which suggests a significant slowdown in growth This of course reflects the companys increasing capital expenditures for growing its content the costs of which have been pointed out by other contributors These numbers of course do not allow qualitative statements about the new content compared to the removed content As we know Netflix is pushing massively toward producing more of its own shows eg recently Fuller House However I would invite readers to look at the latest additions and removals for themselves which brings me to my next point The vast majority of Netflix titles stay on for no more than months according to the tracking site The release year with the highest number of titles available is In my opinion we can roughly summarize the content strategy aside from original content as follows Permanent additions to the library are often cheaperdated or niche content The core of the library again aside from originals are toyear old movies that are licensed for a limited amount of time hence a slowdown in netinflux Now Netflix would prefer if you did not notice this in too much detail In my opinion this explains the weirdlydesigned search function It also explains the lack of a list view which would be the easiest thing in the world to implement However it would also give users an easy overview of the library and make them realize how weak the content just might be Instead Netflix displays a rotating view of whatever it wants you to see Again I know the counterargument to this is supposed to be Netflixs original content which is heavily advertised There is only one problem with that Not everyone cares for it In the UK according to a survey carried out last year two thirds reported they were not watching original programming but rather US TV shows and movies Of course this might also change in the future as more original content is created However I think there is still a big risk associated with Netflix strategy which I will now summarize Whenever I talk to Netflix users here in the UK most of them are not especially happy with the content My analysis from above explains why Users might intuitively feel there is nothing I want to watch They might not understand this is the result of Netflixs presumed deliberate attempts to hide its sparse library behind its layout without an option to list it in full What we are seeing is a Fake it till you make it strategy Netflix cannot afford to bring up its libraries in all regions to US level As we saw the overall content influx is slowing down as a result to its expensive shift to an original content producer This does not mean Netflix will not continue to sign up subscribers What it means is the reason Netflix is able to do so is because right now the main thing Netflix has going for it in most countries is that it is there It should also be noted that the UK was one of the earlier markets Netflix expanded into so the situation in other European countries is presumably worse While piling up expenses to produce more content the company has become vulnerable As soon as viable competitors become more broadly available in other markets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Hulu and HBO probably being among the first I continue to expect a major correction potentially triggered by a loss in US subscribers I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than
