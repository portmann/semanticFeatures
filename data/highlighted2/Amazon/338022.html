Some commenters argued that Netflix UK would soon enough catch up with the US library.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>At around 11 % content growth YoY , that will only happen if Netflix US shrinks even <i>more</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The Netflix catalog is not a monotonically increasing function.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For instance , in 2016 , there were 352 additions versus 324 removals so far , for a total net inflow of just 28 titles , which <b>suggests</b> a significant slowdown in growth .  (Uncertainty) </span>This, of course, reflects the company's increasing capital expenditures for growing its content, the costs of which have been pointed out by other contributors.These numbers of course do not allow qualitative statements about the new content compared to the removed content.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As we know , Netflix is pushing massively toward producing <i>more</i> of its own shows , e.g. recently Fuller House .  (Surprise) </span>However, I would invite readers to look at the latest additions and removals for themselves, which brings me to my next point.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The vast majority of Netflix titles stay on for no <i>more</i> than 12 months , according to the tracking site .  (Surprise) </span>The release year with the highest number of titles available is 2014.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In my opinion , we can <b>roughly</b> summarize the content strategy , aside from original content , as follows : Permanent additions to the library are often cheaper/dated or niche content .  (Uncertainty) </span>The core of the library (again, aside from originals), are 2-to-5-year old movies that are licensed for a limited amount of time, hence a slow-down in net-influx.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now , Netflix would prefer if you did not notice this in too much detail .  (Uncertainty) </span>In my opinion, this explains the weirdly-designed search function.It also explains the lack of a list view, which would be the easiest thing in the world to implement.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , it would also give users an easy overview of the library and make them realize how weak the content just <b>might</b> be .  (Uncertainty) </span>Instead, Netflix displays a rotating view of whatever it wants you to see.Again, I know the counterargument to this is supposed to be Netflix's original content, which is heavily advertised.There is only one problem with that.Not everyone cares for it.In the UK, according to a survey carried out last year, two thirds reported they were not watching original programming, but rather US TV shows and movies.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Of course , this <b>might</b> also change in the future as <i>more</i> original content is created .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , I think there is still a big <b>risk</b> associated with Netflix strategy , which I will now summarize .  (Uncertainty) </span>Whenever I talk to Netflix users here in the UK, most of them are not especially happy with the content.My analysis from above explains why.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Users <b>might</b> intuitively feel `` there is nothing I want to watch . ''  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They might not understand this is the result of Netflix 's <b>presumed</b> deliberate attempts to hide its sparse library behind its layout without an option to list it in full .  (Uncertainty) </span>What we are seeing is a "Fake it till you make it" strategy.Netflix cannot afford to bring up its libraries in all regions to US level.As we saw, the overall content influx is slowing down as a result to its expensive shift to an original content producer.This does not mean Netflix will not continue to sign up subscribers.What it means is the reason Netflix is able to do so is because right now, the main thing Netflix has going for it in most countries is that ... it is there.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It should also be noted that the UK was one of the <i>earlier</i> markets Netflix expanded into , so the situation in other European countries is <b>presumably</b> <i>worse</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While piling up expenses to produce <i>more</i> content , the company has become vulnerable .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As soon as viable competitors become <i>more</i> broadly available in other markets ( <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Hulu and HBO <b>probably</b> being among the first ) , I continue to expect a major correction , potentially triggered by a loss in US subscribers .
