In addition, this writeup detailing the threat of YouTube points out another competitor in the streaming world that's going to continue to haunt Netflix.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) continues to develop YouTube into a Netflix style streaming service in addition to the free content that it generates , YouTube could be added to the long list of competitors that <b>may</b> stand in Netflix 's way .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix aims to be more like HBO , a service with <b>almost</b> double the number of subscribers that makes its money on its original content .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix is going to have to create a hybrid viewing experience , luring some people in with old unfamiliar content while then <b>hopefully</b> exposing them to original content that will hook them on the service .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix does have another wrench in can turn in its pricing, as well.It's not like Netflix has run out of offensive weapons, either.The company is still pushing its boundaries, growing and expanding to try and maintain it's growth an create new revenue segments.Over the weekend it broke that Netflix was also preparing for its first theatrical film release.Supposedly, the release has garnered good reviews across the pond, and it'll be available for streaming on October 16th.What one must consider when evaluating Netflix for an investment is the premium the stock is priced at today compared to what the competitive landscape is going to look like in several years.This increased competition is going to be a major factor when considering an investment in a company that's so highly valued as Netflix.The company's $42 billion market cap, 7x price/sales and 22x price/book ratio show how puffy the valuation has gotten post-split.In addition, the company's FCF picture is getting ugly, The company isn't earning much and on an earnings basis Netflix is trading about 330x its earnings next year.With the company continuing to burn cash ($384 million in the ttm period), we think Netflix is going to be due for a cooling off period, as the market environment continues to deteriorate heading into the Fed's consideration of raising rates.We think today is a great time for those who have been all aboard the Netflix train for the long-term to take some profit.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
