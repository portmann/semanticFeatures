( NASDAQ : NFLX ) | Seeking Alpha Long-term Netflix holders <b>may</b> wish to finally take some profit .  (Uncertainty) </span>Increasing competition from companies like Apple , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Hulu , HBO , ABC and CBS mean a rapidly changing landscape . Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is definitely the leader in streaming home content, but questions have been raised about the company's ability to stay on top.NFLX had the benefit of being the first company to explore "alternative means" of getting content to consumers, starting with mailing DVDs.When the progression naturally moved to streaming media, NFLX was first to the party and has benefited greatly for doing so.The company's dominance has led to a rapid appreciation in the stock price, which has led to a split.Since the split, performance has been good, but murky of late as the stock is well off its highs and research firm Citron recently stated they expect a correction in the stock back down toward the $80 level.Fueling NFLX's fire has been its subscriber growth, which has accelerated in recent quarters.Bears continue to avoid looking at subscriber growth and point out the company isn't cash flow positive, and is far overvalued on an earnings basis.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In addition , the competitive landscape is getting much , much <i>worse</i> for Netflix .  (Surprise) </span>As the company is getting ready to launch in Japan, its competition is increasing substantially.Hulu recently just announced an ad-free service for $11.99 per month and individual networks are starting to stream their content, like HBO is doing with HBO Go.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In addition , news like CBS just released yesterday , that they will be streaming all major NFL games this year online for free , means that the landscape is changing very quickly for Netflix , and not for the <i>better</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is also starting to get into the game.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Reports have said that Apple is in talks with some major names in the entertainment industry , which <b>could</b> put it in direct competition with Netflix .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Many have assumed Apple <b>may</b> buy Netflix , but if its strategy with streaming audio is any indication , they 're not interested in buying companies that are leading their sector at high valuations .  (Uncertainty) </span>Companies like ABC are also moving into the same space.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If you need even further proof that the streaming media field continues to expand , look no <i>further</i> than this morning 's news from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Here 's the news that Seeking Alpha reported last week on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . In addition, this writeup detailing the threat of YouTube points out another competitor in the streaming world that's going to continue to haunt Netflix.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) continues to develop YouTube into a Netflix style streaming service in addition to the free content that it generates , YouTube could be added to the long list of competitors that <b>may</b> stand in Netflix 's way .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Netflix aims to be <i>more</i> like HBO , a service with <b>almost</b> double the number of subscribers that makes its money on its original content .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix is going to have to create a hybrid viewing experience , luring some people in with old unfamiliar content while then <b>hopefully</b> exposing them to original content that will hook them on the service .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix does have another wrench in can turn in its pricing, as well.It's not like Netflix has run out of offensive weapons, either.The company is still pushing its boundaries, growing and expanding to try and maintain it's growth an create new revenue segments.Over the weekend it broke that Netflix was also preparing for its first theatrical film release.Supposedly, the release has garnered good reviews across the pond, and it'll be available for streaming on October 16th.What one must consider when evaluating Netflix for an investment is the premium the stock is priced at today compared to what the competitive landscape is going to look like in several years.This increased competition is going to be a major factor when considering an investment in a company that's so highly valued as Netflix.The company's $42 billion market cap, 7x price/sales and 22x price/book ratio show how puffy the valuation has gotten post-split.In addition, the company's FCF picture is getting ugly, The company isn't earning much and on an earnings basis Netflix is trading about 330x its earnings next year.With the company continuing to burn cash ($384 million in the ttm period), we think Netflix is going to be due for a cooling off period, as the market environment continues to deteriorate heading into the Fed's consideration of raising rates.We think today is a great time for those who have been all aboard the Netflix train for the long-term to take some profit.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .
