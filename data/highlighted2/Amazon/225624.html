northern France October Picture taken October RIO PARDO Brazil In December this year the UN Climate Conference takes place in Paris Ahead of the summit we will release a series of stories titled Earthprints that show the ability of humans to change the landscape of the planet From sprawling urban growth to the construction of new islands each site has profoundly changed in the last years Each story has accompanying NASA satellite images that show the scale of the change here In international talks over global climate policy Brazils government has declared time and again a goal that environmental activists scoff at eliminating illegal deforestation in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>rainforest They scoff because environmentalists believe that Brazil as

followed by ranchers and farmers followed by small merchants and prospectors who smell opportunity Flying over the area to shoot pictures I saw the starkest of contrasts between lush foliage and the bareness of the plots shaved into the jungle When Edivaldo Fernandes Oliveira first arrived in Rio Pardo in there were only other people there Like them he took to cutting trees and eventually cleared enough land to start a small ranch where more than cattle now graze Oliveira and others in Rio Pardo say they did not know at the time that the land was in one of the many national forests that Brazils government has established often in vain to demarcate protected lands I know now that it was wrong but nobody told me when I got here says Oliveira Now I have to fight For Oliveira fighting means struggling against efforts by Brazils environmental agency to move settlers like him off the protected lands But how do you move a whole town How do you move many small towns Settlers whether their crimes were deliberate or not are now attached to the land their families and livelihood tied to it This is good land says Zezito Oliveira an yearold farmer in Rio Pardo With courage and the desire to work you reap good things here adds Oliveira who is not related to Edivaldo Fernandes Oliveira Already the state has negotiated land swaps with the federal government agreeing to establish new forest preserves in stilluntouched areas that had not previously been demarcated in exchange for letting some settlers stay in areas that have been cleared While pragmatic such measures are seen by critics as tantamount to rewards for wrongdoing But settlers see the issue through a lens going back to the earliest days of colonization The Portuguese had no titles when they came to Brazil says Paulo Francisco Fernandes Oliveira the yearold father of Edivaldo the rancher who came to Rio Pardo later to help his son care for the cattle Brazil was born without titles Whats Next Tomorrows
