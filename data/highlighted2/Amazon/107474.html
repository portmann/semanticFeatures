(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft has built Azure into a credible IaaS platform , but <i>more</i> work is needed in PaaS and SaaS ; buying Salesforce.com would help , but it carries a high price/risk profile .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Microsoft seems significantly undervalued if it can generate mid-single digit growth , but significant erosion in its PC-centric businesses could make that an overly generous <b>assumption</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Like IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM ), Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ), and SAP AG (NYSE: SAP ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is looking at a major shift in the way it does business as the industry shifts away from discrete license-based software sales and toward the subscription-based "X as a service" model.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Making matters <i>more</i> challenging for Microsoft is the company 's heavy reliance on the PC ecosystem , its so far unconvincing device strategy , and its relatively poor history of adding value through acquisition .  (Surprise) </span>The migration to service-based software is going to change Microsoft's model, but the company's cloud businesses (including Azure) seem to be on a good path today.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It 's very uncommon for winners/leaders of one generation to extend that leadership into the next generation , but even a <i>lower</i> level of assumed performance <b>seems</b> to support a value argument for Microsoft .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The large installed base of on-premises software means that it will be some time before cloud deployments are the majority, but the market is moving in that direction.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Particularly for enterprise customers , cloud deployments significantly reduce their IT hardware cost/burden , as well reduce upfront costs and generally offer <i>easier</i> mobile access .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>What this will ultimately mean for the likes of Microsoft and Oracle is <i>less</i> obvious to me now .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The general notion for some time has been that subscription-based SaaS/PaaS offerings will be <i>less</i> lucrative for the software companies ( since , at a minimum , they have to have hardware to support the deployments ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Oracle 's Larry Ellison does n't agree , though , and recently claimed that he <b>believes</b> that cloud-based offerings will be just as profitable for Oracle over the life of the product ( though the year-to-year accounting will be different ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>Even if Ellison is right about the long-term profitability of SaaS/PaaS, Microsoft's IaaS offerings are not likely to be as profitable.Microsoft is building its Azure business into a formidable rival to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) and its AWS platform , but it is difficult for me to see how this model can generate the sort of margins to which the company is accustomed from its various software offerings . At a minimum, this whole process is going to create some growing pains for the company.There has been a lot of concern over what Microsoft's move to a "Windows as a Service" model is going to mean for revenue and earnings, and consumer users of Office don't seem to be enthusiastically embracing the subscription-based model.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Bulls can argue that the adoption rate will improve over time because there will be no choice , but bears can likewise argue that this change will drive <i>more</i> people to at least try out alternatives ( I , for one , was driven by Microsoft 's switch to try an alternative , and I 'm still using it instead of Office ) .  (Surprise) </span>For all of Microsoft's efforts in mobile, cloud, and enterprise software, this is still very much a PC-driven company.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Somewhere</b> around 40 % of the company 's revenue comes from the PC platform , and likely <i>closer</i> to three-quarters of its operating profits .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Put simply, products like Windows, Office, and Exchange are ubiquitous and very profitable for the company.The question is how sustainable this can be.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The PC market remains very weak , and while there is no real threat to Microsoft in consumer operating systems , volume growth could be limited and consumers <b>may</b> not migrate to the SaaS model for Office and other products .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The <i>bigger</i> issue <b>could</b> be that three-quarters of this PC-based model comes from the corporate side , where there <b>could</b> be <i>more</i> pressure on OS sales , Office , and other products .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>CEO Nadella's recent letter to employees and the new mission statement was pretty typical corporate-speak without a lot of specifics.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do n't think it 's unreasonable to look at it as a forerunner to <b>possible</b> additional restructurings and cost reductions .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That said , it <b>seems</b> as though the company is sticking with its device businesses , and that is not very encouraging considering how little progress the company has made in mobile ( Windows is a low-single digit market share holder ) and the little , if any , benefit seen from the Surface business .  (Uncertainty) </span>It remains to be seen what Nadella's "mobile first, cloud first" will mean in practice.Cloud is an inescapable, un-ignorable trend in enterprise software, and Microsoft has to play there.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Most of the recent assessments of Azure and AWS <b>suggest</b> that Microsoft has significantly closed the gap with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , but these are still early days for the industry . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the SaaS side , the <b>rumors</b> of Microsoft 's interest in bidding for Salesforce.com ( NYSE : CRM ) make a lot of sense - it would significantly elevate Microsoft 's presence in enterprise apps and be a natural complement/enhancement for the existing IaaS/PaaS/SaaS businesses .  (Uncertainty) </span>That said, while Salesforce would have immediate SaaS relevance, it would be an exceptionally pricey deal for a company with a lousy M&A history, and the pressure on management to lead a smooth integration, retain talent, and build on Salesforce's current state would be intense.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I 'm frankly <b>surprised</b> that Microsoft <b>seems</b> to have the value that it is , and I think it 's usually a good idea to be skeptical when large , very well-followed companies look cheap .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Then again , there is a lot of <b>doubt</b> , if not outright scorn , in the market regarding the company 's ability to compete in cloud and maintain growth in its traditional PC-based business lines .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 'm valuing Microsoft on the <b>assumption</b> of long-term annualized revenue growth of 4 % , with cloud-related business growing at a strong double-digit rate for at least the next five years .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I expect that its transition to a <i>bigger</i> cloud presence will hurt long-term FCF margins , and I 'm looking for long-term margins ( excluding stock comp add-backs ) in the mid-20 % 's .  (Surprise) </span>That works out to a mid-single digit FCF growth rate and a DCF-based fair value in the low $50s.Looking at ROE and book value as an alternative methodology, even a steep drop in long-term ROEs (from the mid-30%'s to the mid-20%'s) can support a fair value in the low-to-mid $50s (with a "fair" book value multiple in the high 4's).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The idea that Microsoft ends up looking 15 % or <i>more</i> undervalued makes me very concerned that I 've missed something important .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>may</b> be overestimating the persistence of Windows/Office-based revenue and/or overestimating the revenue and margins the company can expect from its cloud-based businesses .  (Uncertainty) </span>Whatever the case, no 1,000-word article on Microsoft can fully capture all of the nuances, drivers, and challenges of the business, so this is definitely a fertile ground for further research.All of that said, I think the skepticism and valuation on Microsoft make for an interesting situation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This company has definitely earned the opposite of `` benefit of the doubt '' over the last decade , but I <b>believe</b> there is still powerful FCF generation potential here and opportunities to outperform .
