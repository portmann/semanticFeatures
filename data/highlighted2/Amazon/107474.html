Microsofts revenue and margin structure but maybe not as much for the bad as the bears believe Microsoft has built Azure into a credible IaaS platform but more work is needed in PaaS and SaaS buying Salesforcecom would help but it carries a high pricerisk profile Microsoft seems significantly undervalued if it can generate midsingle digit growth but significant erosion in its PCcentric businesses could make that an overly generous assumption Like IBM Corp NYSE IBM Oracle NYSE ORCL and SAP AG NYSE SAP Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT is looking at a major shift in the way it does business as the industry shifts away from discrete licensebased software sales and toward the subscriptionbased X as a service model Making matters more challenging for Microsoft is the companys heavy reliance on the PC ecosystem its so far unconvincing device strategy and its relatively poor history of adding value through acquisition The migration to servicebased software is going to change Microsofts model but the companys cloud businesses including Azure seem to be on a good path today Its very uncommon for winnersleaders of one generation to extend that leadership into the next generation but even a lower level of assumed performance seems to support a value argument for Microsoft The large installed base of onpremises software means that it will be some time before cloud deployments are the majority but the market is moving in that direction Particularly for enterprise customers cloud deployments significantly reduce their IT hardware costburden as well reduce upfront costs and generally offer easier mobile access What this will ultimately mean for the likes of Microsoft and Oracle is less obvious to me now The general notion for some time has been that subscriptionbased SaaSPaaS offerings will be less lucrative for the software companies since at a minimum they have to have hardware to support the deployments Oracles Larry Ellison doesnt agree though and recently claimed that he believes that cloudbased offerings will be just as profitable for Oracle over the life of the product though the yeartoyear accounting will be different Even if Ellison is right about the longterm profitability of SaaSPaaS Microsofts IaaS offerings are not likely to be as profitable Microsoft is building its Azure business into a formidable rival to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN and its AWS platform but it is difficult for me to see how this model can generate the sort of margins to which the company is accustomed from its various software offerings At a minimum this whole process is going to create some growing pains for the company There has been a lot of concern over what Microsofts move to a Windows as a Service model is going to mean for revenue and earnings and consumer users of Office dont seem to be enthusiastically embracing the subscriptionbased model Bulls can argue that the adoption rate will improve over time because there will be no choice but bears can likewise argue that this change will drive more people to at least try out alternatives I for one was driven by Microsofts switch to try an alternative and Im still using it instead of Office For all of Microsofts efforts in mobile cloud and enterprise software this is still very much a PCdriven company Somewhere around of the companys revenue comes from the PC platform and likely closer to threequarters of its operating profits Put simply products like Windows Office and Exchange are ubiquitous and very profitable for the company The question is how sustainable this can be The PC market remains very weak and while there is no real threat to Microsoft in consumer operating systems volume growth could be limited and consumers may not migrate to the SaaS model for Office and other products The bigger issue could be that threequarters of this PCbased model comes from the corporate side where there could be more pressure on OS sales Office and other products CEO Nadellas recent letter to employees and the new mission statement was pretty typical corporatespeak without a lot of specifics I dont think its unreasonable to look at it as a forerunner to possible additional restructurings and cost reductions That said it seems as though the company is sticking with its device businesses and that is not very encouraging considering how little progress the company has made in mobile Windows is a lowsingle digit market share holder and the little if any benefit seen from the Surface business It remains to be seen what Nadellas mobile first cloud first will mean in practice Cloud is an inescapable unignorable trend in enterprise software and Microsoft has to play there Most of the recent assessments of Azure and AWS suggest that Microsoft has significantly closed the gap with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but these are still early days for the industry On the SaaS side the rumors of Microsofts interest in bidding for Salesforcecom NYSE CRM make a lot of sense it would significantly elevate Microsofts presence in enterprise apps and be a natural complementenhancement for the existing IaaSPaaSSaaS businesses That said while Salesforce would have immediate SaaS relevance it would be an exceptionally pricey deal for a company with a lousy MA history and the pressure on management to lead a smooth integration retain talent and build on Salesforces current state would be intense Im frankly surprised that Microsoft seems to have the value that it is and I think its usually a good idea to be skeptical when large very wellfollowed companies look cheap Then again there is a lot of doubt if not outright scorn in the market regarding the companys ability to compete in cloud and maintain growth in its traditional PCbased business lines Im valuing Microsoft on the assumption of longterm annualized revenue growth of with cloudrelated business growing at a strong doubledigit rate for at least the next five years I expect that its transition to a bigger cloud presence will hurt longterm FCF margins and Im looking for longterm margins excluding stock comp addbacks in the mids That works out to a midsingle digit FCF growth rate and a DCFbased fair value in the low s Looking at ROE and book value as an alternative methodology even a steep drop in longterm ROEs from the mids to the mids can support a fair value in the lowtomid s with a fair book value multiple in the high s The idea that Microsoft ends up looking or more undervalued makes me very concerned that Ive missed something important I may be overestimating the persistence of WindowsOfficebased revenue andor overestimating the revenue and margins the company can expect from its cloudbased businesses Whatever the case no word article on Microsoft can fully capture all of the nuances drivers and challenges of the business so this is definitely a fertile ground for further research All of that said I think the skepticism and valuation on Microsoft make for an interesting situation This company has definitely earned the opposite of benefit of the doubt over the last decade but I believe there is still powerful FCF generation potential here and opportunities to outperform Source Cloud Will Change Microsoft But The Valuation Looks Interesting Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned
