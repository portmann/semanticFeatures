At a minimum, this whole process is going to create some growing pains for the company.There has been a lot of concern over what Microsoft's move to a "Windows as a Service" model is going to mean for revenue and earnings, and consumer users of Office don't seem to be enthusiastically embracing the subscription-based model.Bulls can argue that the adoption rate will improve over time because there will be no choice, but bears can likewise argue that this change will drive more people to at least try out alternatives (I, for one, was driven by Microsoft's switch to try an alternative, and I'm still using it instead of Office).For all of Microsoft's efforts in mobile, cloud, and enterprise software, this is still very much a PC-driven company.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Somewhere</b> around 40 % of the company 's revenue comes from the PC platform , and likely closer to three-quarters of its operating profits .  (Uncertainty) </span>Put simply, products like Windows, Office, and Exchange are ubiquitous and very profitable for the company.The question is how sustainable this can be.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The PC market remains very weak , and while there is no real threat to Microsoft in consumer operating systems , volume growth could be limited and consumers <b>may</b> not migrate to the SaaS model for Office and other products .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The bigger issue <b>could</b> be that three-quarters of this PC-based model comes from the corporate side , where there <b>could</b> be more pressure on OS sales , Office , and other products .  (Uncertainty) </span>CEO Nadella's recent letter to employees and the new mission statement was pretty typical corporate-speak without a lot of specifics.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do n't think it 's unreasonable to look at it as a forerunner to <b>possible</b> additional restructurings and cost reductions .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That said , it <b>seems</b> as though the company is sticking with its device businesses , and that is not very encouraging considering how little progress the company has made in mobile ( Windows is a low-single digit market share holder ) and the little , if any , benefit seen from the Surface business .  (Uncertainty) </span>It remains to be seen what Nadella's "mobile first, cloud first" will mean in practice.Cloud is an inescapable, un-ignorable trend in enterprise software, and Microsoft has to play there.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Most of the recent assessments of Azure and AWS <b>suggest</b> that Microsoft has significantly closed the gap with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , but these are still early days for the industry . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the SaaS side , the <b>rumors</b> of Microsoft 's interest in bidding for Salesforce.com ( NYSE : CRM ) make a lot of sense - it would significantly elevate Microsoft 's presence in enterprise apps and be a natural complement/enhancement for the existing IaaS/PaaS/SaaS businesses .  (Uncertainty) </span>That said, while Salesforce would have immediate SaaS relevance, it would be an exceptionally pricey deal for a company with a lousy M&A history, and the pressure on management to lead a smooth integration, retain talent, and build on Salesforce's current state would be intense.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I 'm frankly <b>surprised</b> that Microsoft <b>seems</b> to have the value that it is , and I think it 's usually a good idea to be skeptical when large , very well-followed companies look cheap .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Then again , there is a lot of <b>doubt</b> , if not outright scorn , in the market regarding the company 's ability to compete in cloud and maintain growth in its traditional PC-based business lines .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 'm valuing Microsoft on the <b>assumption</b> of long-term annualized revenue growth of 4 % , with cloud-related business growing at a strong double-digit rate for at least the next five years .  (Uncertainty) </span>I expect that its transition to a bigger cloud presence will hurt long-term FCF margins, and I'm looking for long-term margins (excluding stock comp add-backs) in the mid-20%'s.That works out to a mid-single digit FCF growth rate and a DCF-based fair value in the low $50s.Looking at ROE and book value as an alternative methodology, even a steep drop in long-term ROEs (from the mid-30%'s to the mid-20%'s) can support a fair value in the low-to-mid $50s (with a "fair" book value multiple in the high 4's).The idea that Microsoft ends up looking 15% or more undervalued makes me very concerned that I've missed something important.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>may</b> be overestimating the persistence of Windows/Office-based revenue and/or overestimating the revenue and margins the company can expect from its cloud-based businesses .  (Uncertainty) </span>Whatever the case, no 1,000-word article on Microsoft can fully capture all of the nuances, drivers, and challenges of the business, so this is definitely a fertile ground for further research.All of that said, I think the skepticism and valuation on Microsoft make for an interesting situation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This company has definitely earned the opposite of `` benefit of the doubt '' over the last decade , but I <b>believe</b> there is still powerful FCF generation potential here and opportunities to outperform .
