( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha If investing in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , investors have to understand the powerful importance of cloud ( AWS ) . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Cloud has a <i>bigger</i> addressable market with <i>less</i> competition and big barriers to entry .  (Surprise) </span>Retail, an important driver, but cloud, something special and new in the land of investing.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Cloud ( AWS ) was 50 % of profits last quarter , and growing much <i>faster</i> than the overall business .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Our earnings <b>predictions</b> are <i>higher</i> than the Street for Q4 and ' 16 , and feel <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> should be strategically bought if there is `` bad news '' that gets the stock down . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) likely reports earnings in late January . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Until then , many , if not most , investors will be focused on the consumer environment and the potential retail results .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That said , we think the financial make-up of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is changing drastically to one focused much <i>more</i> on cloud computing services . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>We think analysts need to shift a great deal of attention and understanding to AWS ( <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services , the company 's cloud offering ) instead of spending time solely understanding retail . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Last quarter , cloud made up <i>less</i> than 10 % of revenues , but <i>more</i> than 50 % of profits .  (Surprise) </span>Top-line growth was 78% versus the rest of the businesses, excluding AWS, at 20%.The margins at AWS are tracking at 25% (as of last quarter).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The entire business , excluding AWS , this year is expected show <b>roughly</b> 3 % segment operating margins .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The nice thing is that the core retail business <b>seems</b> to be hitting the operating leverage , driving flow through to earnings .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Even if the top line is growing much <i>slower</i> , the profits <b>could</b> actually keep pace with the cloud business as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is finally seeing leverage on the fixed-cost expense . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But , as for valuation , the cloud business is deserving of a much <i>greater</i> piece of the company 's overall valuation given the current statistics and potential market size .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company thinks that the business can grow 50-70 % , but it is running <i>faster</i> than that .  (Surprise) </span>To be a player in cloud, a company needs a lot of money to invest in technology, architecture, software, people, etc.AMZN already needed to do it itself by building out its one-of-a-kind online retail business.From that investment, the company realized that the scale and know-how can be offered to other players.There are many other players in this field including Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), etc.The one issue is that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> claims to already have over 10x the computing capacity of its next 14 competitors combined . If you are a GE or Cap One or any bank or business with mission-critical applications, you need reliability, security and scale.Based on its size and first-mover positioning, AMZN is winning this business.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Forrester Research says this business <b>could</b> be $ 180B by 2020 ( 4-5 years from now ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> thinks ultimately there are only going to be a few main players capturing the major customers due to their reliability and security . A customer's number one issue is security.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> needs to deal with that for its online business every day and so has been seen as a reliable source so far . If <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ends up getting a position as one of the lead players in this industry , we 're adding another $ 50B to revenues in five years at 25 % EBIT margins . How Is The Market Putting A Value On The Businesses?Our Guess : 50X AWS A Few Years Out , 30x17 For Retail Here 's some math to think about how to get to the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's value and what the market is pricing for its businesses . As a caveat, all of these numbers are malleable, and you can do the math yourself to see where the valuation can go with your own inputs.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As another important comment , we do not think that growth companies can be shorted based on valuation , so if you happen to get to a <i>lower</i> valuation , unless something goes wrong with the company , most growth companies grow into their valuation .  (Surprise) </span>To be short on a high-valuation company, one needs to expect something to go wrong.Currently , there are scale advantages and a limited number of companies with capital to enter , and with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's large lead , we gave it a nice market share of 25 % ( all of these figures we ca n't know for sure , we are just estimating and modeling ) . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Our profit margins of 20 % are based on the company 's current 25 % recently , but understanding that just like Q1 of ' 14 , it <b>may</b> drop at any time to take another huge jump in market share .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>AMZN <b>may</b> also have to invest heavily in the business , like it 's done with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The company is no longer only growing one business on AWS, it is growing all of its customers and new customers, which will require investment.Our bias, though, is that margins go up from 25% over time.But, again, there is no way to know yet.We gave the company a 50 multiple on that business five years out and discounted it four years at 10%.All these numbers can be played with.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We think in actuality how markets work is , if these numbers prove correct , then the multiple will be <i>higher</i> as they grow into the multiple .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Here again, there is no way to know, so we chose 50.You can then see the value should be $ 410 for AWS today in that $ 647 <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stock price . The rest we give to retail/online.Taking our (which aren't far from the Street) estimates, we get about 60x earnings for the retail/online business for the next year.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If we look out to '17 and <b>assume</b> another EPS growth of 2.5 x , then the multiple becomes a <i>more</i> normal 30x .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But , if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> keeps the growth rate , and now profit leverage , the multiple <b>could</b> likely end up being <i>higher</i> than that . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>As we went through this process, our price did not end up far from the current price when plugging in our own numbers.Given the growth rates of the company , we feel the price of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does not seem unfair . We think the price has been decided by sizable investors who have done a similar run-through and made an extra decision that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a market leader that will unlikely get moved from its position for many years . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Shorter</i> Term , We Have Upside In Q4 .  (Surprise) </span>In line for Q1.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We are <i>Higher</i> For '16 When trying to figure out what Q4 , Q1 and '16 can be , we used the recent trends and seasonality and broke it down by business .  (Surprise) </span>For retail, there is a big jump sequentially in the fourth quarter, and Q1 comes back down.That said, the retail/online Q4 growth rate should slow as it did last year from Q3.Most of the drivers for top line have been "all-year" drivers, smoothing out the quarterly revenue trajectory.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They have been driven by Prime ( which is an all-year sales subscription ) , clothes and food which are <i>more</i> all year and <i>less</i> giftable than their one-time core business of music and books .  (Surprise) </span>We allow for this in our non-AWS (retail growth rate) estimates.The growth rate should pick back up in Q1 (although we kept the growth rate the same).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For margins , in Q4 , we <b>assumed</b> an average of the jump in sequential margins from Q3 to Q4 last year as well as figuring the margin improvement year over year from the recent Q3 ' 15 .  (Uncertainty) </span>We get about $.20 upside for Q4 versus the last couple of quarters' upside of $.30.North American retail margin has grown by 300-500bp this year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The Street is <b>assuming</b> some continuation next year .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We have a 250bp improvement in Q4 ( which <b>may</b> be conservative ) and are still <i>higher</i> than the Street .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We say this <b>may</b> be conservative because Q4 is the company 's core quarter with the most margin potential , where its distribution centers run at the highest utilization which should drive the highest margins .  (Uncertainty) </span>For next year, you can see in the model, there is upside potential versus the Street estimates.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We have , on average , 10ct upside <b>surprise</b> per quarter .  (Surprise) </span>We like that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has focused its communication around cash flow . We think that is an important message; that means we are in a period of growth and profits flowing through.We know AMZN has been notorious for spending back upside, which we thoroughly respect.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We also saw that after Q1 of ' 14 , the margins of AWS dropped from 23 % to 7.7 % Q1 to Q2 because the company decided to drop price and invest <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span>The company has said that it expects the AWS business to be "lumpy."Lumpy means it can drop the price again or ramp up spending to maintain its lead.This was part of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's strategy for many years with distribution centers , then content , Fire , phones , etc. . It's worked, and we expect it to constantly push to find new investments.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That said , AMZN 's investments seem to be driven based on the <i>greater</i> good of the overall company and customer offering .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>AWS was a little different that it realized it already built , something so special that the company <b>might</b> as well make a business out of it .  (Uncertainty) </span>There are other high-multiple companies that saw multiple depression from non-strategic investments.That has not been the case with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> because its investments have been on point with its overall strategy . Overall , we are obviously impressed with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We think , because of the markets , there <b>could</b> be a bull and bear tug of war here .  (Uncertainty) </span>Ultimately, we think the bulls win as this is a one-of-a-kind company in a rare premium position, both in retail and cloud.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> that AMZN is a longer-term buy and can be bought after the `` bad news '' has cleared , whenever that happens .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Whenever investors are <b>disappointed</b> that they decided to increase spending or drop price , and the stock takes a hit , there is a strong value support , story , and positioning to step in .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That said , we would look for `` bad news '' entries to manage through the <i>longer</i> term .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If one does n't use scary dips to buy , he <b>could</b> get shaken out on those scary dips , making this a losing investment .  (Uncertainty) </span>So far , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has proven to push its business model to discover new opportunities . AWS fell into its lap based on the company's online build-out need, and it made sense to resell the capacity and turn it into a business.AMZN is getting accolades for its content.That said, a lot of its new endeavors don't automatically have a great ROI or are profitable at all, especially at first.When the company invested heavily in distribution centers, the typical flow through visibility was initially missing to the Street on how it would play out.In the end, we see it's working, but the process took years.That said, AMZN can find something else to invest in that investors don't get.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As we mentioned before , it <b>could</b> take huge swaths out of its price in AWS or do a massive distribution build-out in a new region .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>These moves would slow operating leverage and potentially hold back or <i>lower</i> earnings expectations .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is the biggest and real <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The other clear <b>risk</b> is the market .  (Uncertainty) </span>Going into a rising rate environment, the potentially biggest hit stocks are those with high multiples.That said , often times a market advance thins out to only the best players , causing a thin dichotomy between a few great ones ( like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ) performing and the rest weak . In any case, investing in a high-multiple stock when everything is already pretty clearly working can't have the ranch bet.Investors always need to be humble, and that's why we say to use weakness to find opportunities to enter.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Chaim specializes in earnings and <b>predicts</b> , analyzes and reacts to earnings and earnings events as well as developing current company and macro stories with a hedge fund perspective .
