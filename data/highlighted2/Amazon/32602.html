more than off of highs New competitors in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Google have stepped forward further pressuring ANGIs business model Angies List NASDAQ ANGI is set to report earnings on Wednesday before the market opens The company has impeccable timing After being public for years theyre just now finally turning a profit while giant names like Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN set to become direct competitors Despite being up over the last three months ANGI has continues to be crushed since touching highs in July of The stock is down almost from its highs Since the beginning of alone the stock is down The below chart shows the one time euphoria fueled by analyst expectations that were never close to reasonable and the ensuing price correction by the market Analysts expect ANGI to report in EPS on revenue of million for the quarter This compares to a loss of on revenue of million in the year prior period Analysts are hoping the company can do for this year and for Todays price represents about x those expectations And Angies List actually turned a profit last quarter They earned share on million in revenue Trying to take a step in the right direction ANGI also canned its recent CEO William Oesterle who has planned to stay on board until a replacement can be found Some people see the CEO change as a potential positive Barrons was one of a couple publications that looked at the move through a glass half full lens Theyre hoping the new CEO is an internet visionary though were not sure how far heshe is going to forge a turnaround while ANGI keeps the same name and business model its been failing with consistently now since an public company Their optimistic look continues The company is transitioning to a marketplace which has required a change in its sales strategy and finetuning of its product It is poised to improve profitability significantly in and which has been underappreciated by investors driven by the higher percentage of SP revenue generated by renewal contracts that carry an profit margin dramatically higher than firstyear contract margins of flat to We also like Angies revenue visibility differentiated offering ability to increase advertising prices operating leverage and new monetization initiatives ie billion billion of transactions and nonpaying SPs Furthermore valuation is attractive with a enterprisevaluetorevenue of about times and it is a takeout candidate in our view We dont share this optimism We think ANGI is a broken stock painted with a broken brand It reminds us of all of the failed internet models of the s Its got generic branding a model thats well behind the times for cant turn a profit and has missed the adoption curve for changing in order to survive Yes even with an internet visionary stepping in Short of someone who could actually lend clout to the company by hisher name ie someone with a proven track record or an activist investor stepping in we find it likely ANGI is going to continue to spin its wheels for quarters to come And Angies List faces stiff competition with arguably better business models Sites like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Home Services and Google are going to be moving into the same business Angies List is it which is providing unbiased local reviews for products and services Angies model has always been in question by critics of the company Charging people upfront for these types of services as opposed to in an a la carte fashion or simply just monetizing the advertising hasnt proved to be the worlds most efficient model The company is in a constant attack mode with TV and radio ads because it needs to drive the foundation of a user base Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>on the other hand would lend their reputable names to a similar service but likely just rely on ad revenue to monetize this service The question then becomes whether or not ANGI users will pay to make sure the information theyre getting is unbiased and definitely not affected by advertisers on the site We all know how Google AdSense works We think some customers would stay on for this but not enough to keep ANGI growing at a rate thats going to command a multiple on earnings like x The bull case relies heavily on whether or not ANGI could be a potential take out candidate for another major name thats looking to move in the same direction and doesnt want to grow the entire business organically from the inside While possible were not sure ANGI is going to lend anything unique to a bigger brand like a Yahoo who would likely just go out on their own and build their own review system from scratch similar to the way theyve stepped out on their own with financial analysis With an enterprise value of just million theres surely an internet giant out there that could scoop up ANGI on the cheap by paying a small premium to shareholders at this valuation We think this scenario is unlikely however due to the ANGI brand not being worth anything Heading into earnings analyst sentiment on ANGI has been mixed Analysts at B Riley downgraded shares of Angies List from a buy rating to a neutral rating and lowered their price Analysts at Wunderlich lowered their price target on shares of Angies List from to and set a hold rating on the stock in a research note on Tuesday March st Analysts at Zacks reiterated a hold rating on shares of Angies List in a research note on Sunday March nd Finally analysts at Barrington Research set a price target on shares of Angies List and gave the company a buy rating in a research note on Thursday February th One equities research analyst has rated the stock with a sell rating fourteen have given a hold rating and three have assigned a buy rating to the companys stock The company presently has a consensus rating of Hold and a consensus target price of While were not sure on ANGIs business model we do know that the valuation at this point is going to look attractive to some investors At a share the company is trading at just about x sales While attractive on the surface digging deeper shows us ANGI is nothing special at this valuation The problem however is when you look at the company though an earnings and balance sheet perspective At x what analysts are looking for next year were not sure ANGI is going to be able to manifest that type of growth with its coming competition We definitely view ANGI as a show me stock meaning we want to see the earnings before were willing to pay a multiple that despite being the SP average is high Finally the company has a burgeoning debt load that essentially wipes out the entire in cash per share the company carries The balance sheet is insolvent and has been for a couple of quarters now For a company whose earnings are suspect moving forward trading at the SP average with a broken balance sheet and questionable model we think ANGI is likely to continue disappointing investors over the course of the next coming quarters Source Angies List Likely To Disappoint On Wednesday And All Future Days That End With Y Disclosure The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
