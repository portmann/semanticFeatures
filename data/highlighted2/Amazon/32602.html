The question then becomes whether or not ANGI users will pay to make sure the information they're getting is 100% unbiased and definitely not affected by advertisers on the site.We all know how Google AdSense works.We think some customers would stay on for this, but not enough to keep ANGI growing at a rate that's going to command a multiple on earnings like 17x.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The bull case relies heavily on whether or not ANGI <b>could</b> be a potential take out candidate for another major name that 's looking to move in the same direction and does n't want to grow the entire business organically from the inside .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While <b>possible</b> , we 're not sure ANGI is going to lend anything unique to a <i>bigger</i> brand like a Yahoo , who would likely just go out on their own and build their own review system from scratch ( similar to the way they 've stepped out on their own with financial analysis ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With an enterprise value of just $ 320 million , there 's surely an internet giant out there that <b>could</b> scoop up ANGI on the cheap by paying a small premium to shareholders at this valuation .  (Uncertainty) </span>We think this scenario is unlikely, however, due to the ANGI brand not being worth anything.Heading into earnings, analyst sentiment on ANGI has been mixed : Analysts at B. Riley downgraded shares of Angie's List from a buy rating to a neutral rating and lowered their price Analysts at Wunderlich lowered their price target on shares of Angie's List from $8.00 to $6.00 and set a hold rating on the stock in a research note on Tuesday, March 31st.Analysts at Zacks reiterated a hold rating on shares of Angie's List in a research note on Sunday, March 22nd.Finally, analysts at Barrington Research set a $10.00 price target on shares of Angie's List and gave the company a buy rating in a research note on Thursday, February 19th.One equities research analyst has rated the stock with a sell rating, fourteen have given a hold rating and three have assigned a buy rating to the company's stock.The company presently has a consensus rating of Hold and a consensus target price of $10.46.While we're not sure on ANGI's business model, we do know that the valuation at this point is going to look attractive to some investors.At $5.66 a share, the company is trading at just about 1.6x sales.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While attractive on the surface , digging <i>deeper</i> shows us ANGI is nothing special at this valuation .  (Surprise) </span>The problem, however, is when you look at the company though an earnings and balance sheet perspective.At 16x what analysts are looking for next year, we're not sure ANGI is going to be able to manifest that type of growth with its coming competition.We definitely view ANGI as a "show me" stock, meaning we want to see the earnings before we're willing to pay a multiple that, despite being the S&P average, is high.Finally, the company has a burgeoning debt load that essentially wipes out the entire $1.10 in cash per share the company carries.The balance sheet is insolvent and has been for a couple of quarters now.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For a company whose earnings are suspect moving forward , trading at the S&P average , with a broken balance sheet and questionable model , we think ANGI is likely to continue <b>disappointing</b> investors over the course of the next coming quarters .
