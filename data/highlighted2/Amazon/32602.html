( NASDAQ : ANGI ) | Seeking Alpha ANGI has been a failure since its IPO , down 65 % since then and <i>more</i> than 80 % off of 2013 highs .  (Surprise) </span>New competitors in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Google have stepped forward , further pressuring ANGI 's business model . Angie's List (NASDAQ: ANGI ) is set to report earnings on Wednesday before the market opens.The company has impeccable timing.After being public for years , they 're just now finally turning a profit while giant names like Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) set to become direct competitors . Despite being up 10.8% over the last three months, ANGI has continues to be crushed since touching highs in July of 2013.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The stock is down <b>almost</b> 80 % from its highs .  (Uncertainty) </span>Since the beginning of 2015 alone, the stock is down 11.4%.The below chart shows the one time euphoria, fueled by analyst expectations that were never close to reasonable, and the ensuing price correction by the market.Analysts expect ANGI to report $0.00 in EPS on revenue of $84.80 million for the quarter.This compares to a loss of ($0.06) on revenue of $72.66 million in the year prior period.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Analysts are <b>hoping</b> the company can do $ 0.14 for this year and $ 0.34 for 2016 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Today's price represents about 17x those 2016 expectations.And Angie's List actually turned a profit last quarter.They earned $0.26/share on $82.15 million in revenue.Trying to take a step in the right direction, ANGI also canned its recent CEO William Oesterle, who has planned to stay on board until a replacement can be found.Some people see the CEO change as a potential positive.Barron's was one of a couple publications that looked at the move through a glass half full lens.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They 're <b>hoping</b> the new CEO is an `` internet visionary , '' though we 're not sure how far he/she is going to forge a turnaround while ANGI keeps the same name and business model it 's been failing with consistently now since an public company .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Their <b>optimistic</b> look continues ... The company is transitioning to a marketplace , which has required a change in its sales strategy and fine-tuning of its product .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is poised to improve profitability significantly in 2015 and 2016 , which has been underappreciated by investors , driven by the <i>higher</i> percentage of SP revenue generated by renewal contracts that carry an 80 % -85 % profit margin , dramatically <i>higher</i> than first-year contract margins of flat to 5 % .  (Surprise) </span>We also like Angie's revenue visibility, differentiated offering, ability to increase advertising prices, operating leverage, and new monetization initiatives (i.e., $10 billion-$15 billion of transactions and nonpaying SPs).Furthermore, valuation is attractive with a 2016 enterprise-value-to-revenue of about 0.8 times, and it is a takeout candidate, in our view.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We do n't share this <b>optimism</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>We think ANGI is a broken stock painted with a broken brand.It reminds us of all of the failed internet models of the 2000s.It's got generic branding, a model that's well behind the times for 2015, can't turn a profit, and has missed the adoption curve for changing in order to survive.Yes, even with an "internet visionary" stepping in.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Short of someone who <b>could</b> actually lend clout to the company by his/her name ( i.e. someone with a proven track record ) or an activist investor stepping in , we find it likely ANGI is going to continue to spin its wheels for quarters to come .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And Angie 's List faces stiff competition with arguably <i>better</i> business models .  (Surprise) </span>Sites like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Home Services ) and Google are going to be moving into the same business Angie 's List is it , which is providing unbiased local reviews for products and services . Angie's model has always been in question by critics of the company.Charging people up-front for these types of services, as opposed to in an a la carte fashion or simply just monetizing the advertising hasn't proved to be the world's most efficient model.The company is in a constant "attack" mode with TV and radio ads because it needs to drive the foundation of a user base.Google and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , on the other hand , would lend their reputable names to a similar service , but likely just rely on ad revenue to monetize this service . The question then becomes whether or not ANGI users will pay to make sure the information they're getting is 100% unbiased and definitely not affected by advertisers on the site.We all know how Google AdSense works.We think some customers would stay on for this, but not enough to keep ANGI growing at a rate that's going to command a multiple on earnings like 17x.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The bull case relies heavily on whether or not ANGI <b>could</b> be a potential take out candidate for another major name that 's looking to move in the same direction and does n't want to grow the entire business organically from the inside .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While <b>possible</b> , we 're not sure ANGI is going to lend anything unique to a <i>bigger</i> brand like a Yahoo , who would likely just go out on their own and build their own review system from scratch ( similar to the way they 've stepped out on their own with financial analysis ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With an enterprise value of just $ 320 million , there 's surely an internet giant out there that <b>could</b> scoop up ANGI on the cheap by paying a small premium to shareholders at this valuation .  (Uncertainty) </span>We think this scenario is unlikely, however, due to the ANGI brand not being worth anything.Heading into earnings, analyst sentiment on ANGI has been mixed : Analysts at B. Riley downgraded shares of Angie's List from a buy rating to a neutral rating and lowered their price Analysts at Wunderlich lowered their price target on shares of Angie's List from $8.00 to $6.00 and set a hold rating on the stock in a research note on Tuesday, March 31st.Analysts at Zacks reiterated a hold rating on shares of Angie's List in a research note on Sunday, March 22nd.Finally, analysts at Barrington Research set a $10.00 price target on shares of Angie's List and gave the company a buy rating in a research note on Thursday, February 19th.One equities research analyst has rated the stock with a sell rating, fourteen have given a hold rating and three have assigned a buy rating to the company's stock.The company presently has a consensus rating of Hold and a consensus target price of $10.46.While we're not sure on ANGI's business model, we do know that the valuation at this point is going to look attractive to some investors.At $5.66 a share, the company is trading at just about 1.6x sales.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While attractive on the surface , digging <i>deeper</i> shows us ANGI is nothing special at this valuation .  (Surprise) </span>The problem, however, is when you look at the company though an earnings and balance sheet perspective.At 16x what analysts are looking for next year, we're not sure ANGI is going to be able to manifest that type of growth with its coming competition.We definitely view ANGI as a "show me" stock, meaning we want to see the earnings before we're willing to pay a multiple that, despite being the S&P average, is high.Finally, the company has a burgeoning debt load that essentially wipes out the entire $1.10 in cash per share the company carries.The balance sheet is insolvent and has been for a couple of quarters now.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For a company whose earnings are suspect moving forward , trading at the S&P average , with a broken balance sheet and questionable model , we think ANGI is likely to continue <b>disappointing</b> investors over the course of the next coming quarters .
