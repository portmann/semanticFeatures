Contrary to Netflix's newly established subscriber base, firms such as Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) can leverage their vast customer bases and brand appeal in order to attract viewers to their video streaming and internet TV platforms.YouTube has recently entered paid streaming with YouTube Red.Apple is expanding its music library to video, leveraging its large iTunes and Apple TV customer base.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Either through original content , licensing or user-created content , these deep-pocketed tech players are posing significant competitive <b>risks</b> to independent platforms like Netflix .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix is supplementary, not competitive to cable and is not in a position to benefit from cord-cutting.Until recently, a cable subscription was required for access to premium network content, such as HBO, Showtime and Starz.On top of the cable cost, subscribers had to pay extra every month to gain access to these networks' premium content of original shows and new releases.In response, premium as well as mainstream networks have recently launched their own streaming platforms.While seemingly an opportunity for streaming TV in general, cord cutting mostly benefits above competitors in particular.In other words, people would cut the cord for standalone platforms with strong, recurring content offering such as CBS or HBO, but not for a show they can binge-watch during a weekend.While not the main beneficiary of cord-cutting, Netflix is going to be the primary victim of traditional cable's fight against it.Cable's competitive price and bundle offerings, continuing consolidation and promotional efforts, and direct offering of its own OTT services (such as SlingTV) would all pose significant threats to Netflix's allure, making its product irrelevant to subscribers' needs.Finally, international expansion, while presented as an obvious opportunity, is a means to an end that will eventually come at a significant cost.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Since the company lacks competitive advantage in the core area of content , it is striving to create a competitive advantage in the face of global reach that <b>could</b> potentially help it negotiate with suppliers or utilize its proprietary content .  (Uncertainty) </span>That is proven by the company's rush to launch in multiple geographies.In many of the new markets, Netflix has failed to provide subtitle service, which in essence makes the product useless for parts of the population.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Cultural <b>differences</b> have not been taken into account either when launching abroad .  (Uncertainty) </span>According to a recent survey by RBS, in Japan, a key international market, only 6% of the subscribers are not at all likely to cancel their subscription and "the comedy genre doesn't travel as well as action and drama".Valuation driven by long-term contribution margin target The recent announcement of price increases for new and existing subscribers supports the argument that the only viable path to realizing the promised 40% contribution margin by 2020 is through pricing.The US contribution margin structure we have chosen is to grow content spending plus marketing slightly slower than we grow revenue, increasing our contribution margin to 40% by 2020.We think we can grow to 60-90 million members in the US, based upon our trajectory to date and the continued growth of Internet TV.Netflix Investor Relations Long-term View , January 19, 2016 As discussed, the company's content utilization will not be able to contribute to margin improvement.Therefore, management is not pursuing domestic expansion as aggressively anymore.Instead of pursuing a costly expansion with diminishing returns, management prefers to harvest its existing base through a meaningful price increase.Given the low penetration of existing competitors, Netflix is able to milk its existing subscriber base to prove its ability to improve contribution margins before a price increase can have adverse effects to its revenue and profitability.Consequently, management sees price increases as the only viable strategy to realize the long-term target of 40% for contribution margin.In sum, the company is cash-strapped, limited by a highly unscalable business model.Without the recent price increases its profitability would be at best anemic this year and the target of 40% in 2020 overly ambitious.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Heavy spending for content and customer acquisition in the US , as well as <b>variability</b> of international operations constitute the price increases unavoidable .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Considering all factors discussed , we conclude that recent valuation levels are not taking into account specific business and market <b>risks</b> of an evolving , competitive industry .

(Uncertainty) </span>However, as reality has shown, when competition steps in, all these factors will tend to deteriorate.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In a scenario where competition to attract and maintain subscribers intensifies , producing and licensing successful shows becomes more challenging , and economies of scale are harder to achieve , Netflix 's stock price <b>could</b> face significant pressure .
