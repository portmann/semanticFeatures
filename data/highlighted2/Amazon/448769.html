(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha NFLX continues to have an interest in entering China.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company <b>could</b> become an OTT provider or content producer with the right local partner .  (Uncertainty) </span>Reuters reported that Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) continues to look for ways to break into China.At a stop in Seoul, NFLX's CCO Ted Sarandos noted China's opportunity and that the company continues to look for ways to enter the country.For the record, I have been a critic of Sarandos for his lack of understanding of the Chinese market when he said that NFLX can enter China without a local partner (see - Netflix: Taking Middle Kingdom ).My view is that a local partner is absolutely necessary for NFLX to enter China given the bureaucracy and the content distribution licenses that are required.Additionally, localization of the content is also a necessity to gain traction given the competitive landscape with Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) owning Youku, Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) owning iQiyi and Tencent's owning QQ video.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Local content strategy is perhaps NFLX 's Achilles heels and this <b>could</b> be a <i>bigger</i> issue in the future given the decelerating domestic user growth and increasing competitive landscape against Hulu , HBO ( NYSE : TWX ) and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In short , investors should not underestimate the competitive and regulatory <b>risks</b> associated with entering China .  (Uncertainty) </span>China is a complex market for any foreign company to succeed.In NFLX's case, the company needs both the regulators and a local partner to obtain licenses for content distribution.According to regulations set by the content distribution government body, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, content broadcasters must obtain relevant licenses to broadcast videos over the internet, on mobile devices and via TV sets.There is a license for local content broadcasting as well as a license for foreign content broadcasting.The sheer number of licenses and the number of mid-level government officials that a content broadcaster deals with is mind boggling and exhausting.However, the process can be facilitated through a partnership with local players such as a well-known media company that is usually backed by a state-owned enterprise or a local government body.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>NFLX 's China strategy <b>could</b> come from two forms : OTT-only or content production .  (Uncertainty) </span>NFLX had prior discussions with OTT platforms LeTV, Wasu and BesTV.Recall that NFLX has acquired the popular Chinese drama, "Empress of the Palace", from LeTV for its US platform, I see this to be an important step because LeTV is one of the few players that have all the necessary licenses for content distribution.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>NFLX 's partnership with LeTV <b>could</b> accelerate its content distribution in China potentially through a partnership with LeTV 's existing partner , CNTV .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>LeTV currently has over 100k TV episodes and 5k movies and it would further give the company an edge over BIDU and BABA if it <b>could</b> stream NFLX content on its platform .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Superior content <b>could</b> also help LeTV in its hardware initiative , namely in auto , mobile devices and cloud services .  (Uncertainty) </span>As for discussions with Wasu and BesTV, both companies are state-owned enterprises that have the proper licenses.However, no conclusions were made with the OTT providers.The second option is to become a content producer in the country.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>NFLX approached Wanda Group that is <i>better</i> known for its movie theater chains in China .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Based on my knowledge , Wanda does not appear to have all the necessary licenses to operate an OTT platform , so I suspect that Netflix <b>may</b> be entering China to become a content producer rather than an OTT player .  (Uncertainty) </span>This scenario is quite plausible, given that Wanda Group also operates film and TV production, having produced Jackie Chan's Police Story 3 and Beijing Love Story that turned out to be quite popular.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given Netflix 's track record in moving towards content production , particular the recently released Beast of No Nations and Crouching Tiger <b>Hidden</b> Dragon 2 , it makes sense for Netflix to take an alternative approach when dealing with the hyper-competitive Chinese market .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Rather than competing head-on against a dozen other OTT service providers , Netflix <b>could</b> become the `` arms dealer '' for the OTT providers by supplying them with blockbuster content .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is significantly <i>more</i> attractive than competing with OTT platforms backed by Alibaba , especially after its acquisition of Youku ( see Alibaba : Ecosystem Stronger Than Ever ) .  (Surprise) </span>Going into movie production is also consistent with Netflix's existing strategy of partnering with local heavyweights in content creation and distribution.I note that Netflix is already working with Fuji Films in Japan to cater to the local market (see Netflix: Konichiwa Hastings-San ).As part of its strategy for Korea, Netflix will also partner with local players (see Netflix: Going Gangnam Style ) and the entry into India makes Eros (NYSE: EROS ) a very attractive partner for the OTT giant (see Eros: Bullish Thoughts Post Management Meeting ).Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Services , Music & Video Stores</div></body></html>
