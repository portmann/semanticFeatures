( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's five-year performance is now <i>better</i> than Apple 's . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> still has <i>better</i> growth catalysts and it 's not in the Dow . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>One of the <i>more</i> popular articles I have done lately , judging from the comments , was a piece last November saying that Amazon.Com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) stock at $ 300/share should be compared with Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) at $ 400 . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I wrote it because , partly in reaction to comments here at Seeking Alpha , I had bought a big position in Apple at about $ 400 and ridden it to the sky , and I had recently begun <b>nervously</b> gathering a similar stake in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Did I expect the subsequent gain of 72%?No.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With its performance in 2015 <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> now has a <i>better</i> five-year performance over that span than Apple , a gain of 272 % against just 203 % for Apple . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> now has a market cap of $ 233 billion , still well short of Apple 's $ 623 billion but not too bad . Many analysts will see <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> as stretched , even with my March math valuing each piece of the business fairly generously . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you assume there 's $ 40 billion in the media business and $ 50 billion in the cloud business , you 're now valuing the store at <b>roughly</b> two times sales , which is not the way stores are valued .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Still , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> at its present valuation is still a <i>better</i> value than Apple is at its valuation , and here is why : <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is still not in the Dow . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Being in the Dow has been a disaster for Apple.When GE (NYSE: GE ) makes the average fall managers have to sell the Dow's constituent stocks, including Apple.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>may</b> want to avoid a stock split just to stay away from this fate . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has <i>bigger</i> ambitions . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Amazon.Com is not yet the global brand that Apple is . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's not <b>nearly</b> as big in Asia , for instance .  (Uncertainty) </span>Its cloud business still has a lot of international expansion ahead of it, and as Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) shows so does the media operation.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> bears . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> nothing helps a stock grow so much as its haters , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's last two quarterly reports put a real squeeze on the bears . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>My recent pieces have n't drawn the ire of <i>earlier</i> efforts but I still get the occasional `` a P/E of 500 is too much '' and that 's a good thing .  (Surprise) </span>Positive cash flow is now a thing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The big news in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's June report was <b>probably</b> the positive operating cash flow . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>That 's something that usually does n't <b>appear</b> until Christmas , and if it becomes a regular occurrence <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has <i>more</i> fuel with which to grow without increased debt . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I'm not promising another doubling from here.Nothing grows forever.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's organic growth is slowing , and a lot of its recent innovations , like drone deliveries and fresh groceries , seem designed <i>more</i> for the press than anything else . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is becoming a political target over its labor practices , much like WalMart ( NYSE : WMT ) , and its U.S. base makes Europeans and Asians suspicious . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stock has recovered from the latest correction <i>more</i> quickly than Apple , and it opened trade Wednesday <i>less</i> than 5 % off its recent high . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Once earnings come in next month it should smash through that number.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>may</b> wait to sell until they start paying a dividend .
