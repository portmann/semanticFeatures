(Surprise) </span>ETF Hub Sep  8 2015, 19:02 ET | About: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Ahead of tomorrow's expected unveiling of a 12.9" iPad Pro, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) states Dell and HP will begin reselling its Surface Pro high-end tablet/convertible line and provide related support services.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The deals are part of a <i>broader</i> Surface Enterprise Initiative meant to boost corporate sales - IT services giant Accenture is also a partner - and <b>suggest</b> at least two major PC OEMs have made peace with Microsoft 's decision to compete against them via the Surface line .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>With the low-cost Surface 3 providing a lift.Microsoft's Surface revenue rose 117% Y/Y in calendar Q2 to $888M.A new high-end model - the Surface Pro 4 - is rumored to be launching this fall.Separately , Microsoft has confirmed its purchase of Adallom , an Israeli provider of cloud-based software for securing popular cloud/SaaS apps from the likes of Salesforce , Box , ServiceNow , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Google , and yes , Microsoft ( Office 365/Yammer ) . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Bloomberg and TechCrunch report the purchase price is ~ $ 250M , <i>less</i> than the $ 320M previously reported by the WSJ .  (Surprise) </span>Microsoft: "Adallom expands on Microsoftï¿½s existing identity assets, and delivers a cloud access security broker, to give customers visibility and control over application access as well as their critical company data stored across cloud services ... Adallom will complement existing offerings that Microsoft makes available today as part of Office 365 and the Enterprise Mobility Suite (EMS), including our recent Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics release."1.Microsoft must have offered a pretty deep profit split with Dell/HP (especially Dell) since the Surface line is a real threat of cannibalization for these OEMs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> that the strategy here for MSFT is to ensure first-class Win10 experiences for businesses to later extract profit from services , not profit from the devices themselves .  (Uncertainty) </span>Thought?2.For investing strategy, I have been gradually making both MSFT and AAPL commanding positions in my portfolio.All of these competitions for enterprise mean one thing: enterprises are pressured to upgrade.In a CTO point of view they have 3 options: sitting still, buying into AAPL iOS, or buying into MSFT Win10.For so much talk about new devices, form factors, services, etc., sitting still is the least compelling option.There is so little profit in being a Windows OEM at this point it likely didn't take a whole lot of convincing on Microsoft's part.Dell is focusing on selling services rather than being a pure OEM at this point so they likely aren't too upset over this.Idk... I work for a $70 billion dollar company and they still use POS sub $200 HP laptops and work stations... and they aren't feeling any pressure to upgrade/update despite the low productivity of these machines.Windows 7 with windows 2007 office (unless  your a VIP).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>ETF Screener : Search and filter by asset class , strategy , theme , performance , yield , and much <i>more</i> ETF Performance : View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes  (Surprise) </span></div></body></html>
