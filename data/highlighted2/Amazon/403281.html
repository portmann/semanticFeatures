(NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha 50% of Wal-Mart's revenue today is grocery-related.Wal-Mart didn't enter grocery until the year 2000.No question Wal-Mart's revenue has been under pressure for last two years.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is attacking every consumer-related niche not nailed down , much as Wal-Mart did in the 80s and 90s . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) , the retail and grocery giant , does not report its fiscal Q1 '17 financial results until Thursday , <b>May</b> 19th , 2016 , but watching <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) new ventures , like AmazonFresh and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's grocery delivery service , you ca n't help but <b>wonder</b> if Wal-Mart feels like it is standing in front of the proverbial freight train with little signs of it stopping . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Wal-Mart comps have been positive for 6 quarters in a row , although just between 0 % -1 % , but <i>more</i> importantly `` traffic '' as the comp attributor has now been positive for 5 quarters in a row .  (Surprise) </span>Neighborhood comps have been trending mid-to-high single digits; another positive data point.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Gross margin trends in the 25 % area have remained stable to <i>higher</i> , but that has to happen as Wal-Mart 's decision to pay rank-and-file workers a <i>higher</i> minimum wage has put significant pressure on the operating margin which fell 92 bps year over year in the January 2016 quarter .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The bright side of this is that Wal-Mart 's operating margin laps much <i>easier</i> comps starting with this quarter , i.e. Q1 ' 17 .  (Surprise) </span>After reporting Q4 '16 financial results, Wal-Mart's Q1 '17 consensus estimates of $0.88 and $113.275 billion in revenue have been steady, and today are $0.88 on $113.226 billion in revenue.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Some margin improvement at Wal-Mart <b>could</b> generate a nice upside <b>surprise</b> for the retail giant .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , that does n't change the <i>bigger</i> picture at this point and that picture is that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>probably</b> possesses the best business model for the 21st century and that Wal-Mart 's $ 480 - $ 500 billion in annual revenue lies directly in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's path and is ripe for the taking . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Back in the mid-1990s and I ca n't remember the name of the Wal-Mart CEO at the time , but this individual ( <b>probably</b> David Glass ) was being interviewed by Forbes or Fortune , and when asked about market share goals for the retail giant , his response was `` all of it '' .  (Uncertainty) </span>It is no great mystery , but <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is doing to Wal-Mart in the last two decades what Wal-Mart did to the rest of inefficient retail in the 1980s and 1990s . And the key is "cost structure"; the lowest cost structure wins.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now , getting back to the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's entry into grocery : to give readers some perspective , when Wal-Mart entered the grocery business in 2000 , Wal-Mart 's annual revenue was <b>roughly</b> $ 167 billion ( $ 166.9 billion to be exact in fiscal 2000 ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Today , Wal-Mart 's annual revenue is <b>roughly</b> $ 480 billion for a compound annual growth rate of 6.97 % .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, in the last 15-16 years, grocery has risen to 50% of revenue today, which means that "grocery" as a product line today is $244 billion in annual revenue to Wal-Mart starting from $0, 15-16 years ago.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Just Wal-Mart 's expected grocery revenue in fiscal 2017 ( $ 244 billion ) is <i>bigger</i> than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's current calendar year consensus revenue of $ 133 billion . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>And what has made grocery so successful for Wal-Mart over the years is that it fits perfectly with its model of "high-volume, low-margin" product lines that generate foot traffic, and which was then "convenient" for people to buy other Wal-Mart goods as they headed into the store to buy groceries.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If AmazonFresh and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> grocery delivery can draw even 10 % of Wal-Mart 's national grocery business ( which <b>maybe</b> why it wants to start its own 2-hour delivery service , which has gained some traction already in the tonier areas just north of downtown Chicago ) , you can see the market share starting to take shape for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You can see why general retail is starting to see <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> as John Boehner saw Ted Cruz ( i.e. `` Lucifer in the flesh '' ) , albeit anyone that has studied retail for years <b>could</b> see this coming . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>But grocery is the last and biggest market for traditional retail (as I see it).There are too many <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> bulls right now ( judging by last week 's Ira Sohn conference ) , and the stock is still below its late 2015 high , with the ramp in FANG stocks last year . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>My own pedestrian opinion is that Wal-Mart has to reduce store openings , move <i>more</i> towards the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> model and buy back a lot of stock , just as Home Depot ( NYSE : HD ) did under Frank Blake which I wrote about here . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>As a single guy, I don't do a lot of grocery shopping, and when I do, it's not very meaningful in terms of the dollars spent.But I do frequent some of the retail grocery stores in Lincoln Park , just north of downtown Chicago , like Plum Market and Whole Foods ( NASDAQ : WFM ) , and I see <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's delivery service already being used and not in small quantities . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>could</b> be another genius move by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and it <b>could</b> really hurt Wal-Mart . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>But the key aspect is how much market share <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can take and how quickly . The <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> trucks and the 2-hour delivery service now makes a ton of sense when wrapped in the `` grocery '' market . It will be interesting to watch and monitor Wal-Mart's response.This is classic Porter's "Competitive Strategy" at work and readers should take not of it.Just to clarify, I've been a huge fan of Wal-Mart over the years and Sam Walton's genius in creating a truly global and national business based on one simple concept: low cost and low price.However , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Bezos are doing to Sam and the Walton 's what the Walton 's did to retail for years . ( When I started seeing <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> bags start to show up in local grocery stores , I knew exactly what they were doing . ) Disclosure: I am/we are long AMZN, HD, WMT.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Tagged : Services , Discount , <b>Variety</b> Stores , CFA charter-holders  (Uncertainty) </span></div></body></html>
