class='textDiv'>Has <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Signed WalMarts Death Warrant With Entry Into Grocery WalMart Stores Inc NYSEWMT Seeking Alpha of WalMarts revenue today is groceryrelated WalMart didnt enter grocery until the year No question WalMarts revenue has been under pressure for last two years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is attacking every consumerrelated niche not nailed down much as WalMart did in the s and s WalMart NYSE WMT the retail and grocery giant does not report its fiscal Q financial results until Thursday May th but watching Amazons NASDAQ AMZN new ventures like AmazonFresh and Amazons grocery delivery service you cant help but wonder if WalMart feels like it is standing in front of the proverbial freight train with little signs of it stopping WalMart comps have been positive for quarters in a row although just between but more importantly traffic as the comp attributor has now been positive for quarters in a row Neighborhood comps have been trending midtohigh single digits another positive data point Gross margin trends in the area have remained stable to higher but that has to happen as WalMarts decision to pay rankandfile workers a higher minimum wage has put significant pressure on the operating margin which fell bps year over year in the January quarter The bright side of this is that WalMarts operating margin laps much easier comps starting with this quarter ie Q After reporting Q financial results WalMarts Q consensus estimates of and billion in revenue have been steady and today are on billion in revenue Some margin improvement at WalMart could generate a nice upside surprise for the retail giant However that doesnt change the bigger picture at this point and that picture is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>probably possesses the best business model for the st century and that WalMarts billion in annual revenue lies directly in Amazons path and is ripe for the taking Back in the mids and I cant remember the name of the WalMart CEO at the time but this individual probably David Glass was being interviewed by Forbes or Fortune and when asked about market share goals for the retail giant his response was all of it It is no great mystery but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is doing to WalMart in the last two decades what WalMart did to the rest of inefficient retail in the s and s And the key is cost structure the lowest cost structure wins Now getting back to the Amazons entry into grocery to give readers some perspective when WalMart entered the grocery business in WalMarts annual revenue was roughly billion billion to be exact in fiscal Today WalMarts annual revenue is roughly billion for a compound annual growth rate of However in the last years grocery has risen to of revenue today which means that grocery as a product line today is billion in annual revenue to WalMart starting from years ago Just WalMarts expected grocery revenue in fiscal billion is bigger than Amazons current calendar year consensus revenue of billion And what has made grocery so successful for WalMart over the years is that it fits perfectly with its model of highvolume lowmargin product lines that generate foot traffic and which was then convenient for people to buy other WalMart goods as they headed into the store to buy groceries If AmazonFresh and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>grocery delivery can draw even of WalMarts national grocery business which maybe why it wants to start its own hour delivery service which has gained some traction already in the tonier areas just north of downtown Chicago you can see the market share starting to take shape for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>You can see why general retail is starting to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as John Boehner saw Ted Cruz ie Lucifer in the flesh albeit anyone that has studied retail for years could see this coming But grocery is the last and biggest market for traditional retail as I see it There are too many <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>bulls right now judging by last weeks Ira Sohn conference and the stock is still below its late high with the ramp in FANG stocks last year My own pedestrian opinion is that WalMart has to reduce store openings move more towards the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>model and buy back a lot of stock just as Home Depot NYSE HD did under Frank Blake which I wrote about here As a single guy I dont do a lot of grocery shopping and when I do its not very meaningful in terms of the dollars spent But I do frequent some of the retail grocery stores in Lincoln Park just north of downtown Chicago like Plum Market and Whole Foods NASDAQ WFM and I see Amazons delivery service already being used and not in small quantities This could be another genius move by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and it could really hurt WalMart But the key aspect is how much market share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can take and how quickly The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>trucks and the hour delivery service now makes a ton of sense when wrapped in the grocery market It will be interesting to watch and monitor WalMarts response This is classic Porters Competitive Strategy at work and readers should take not of it Just to clarify Ive been a huge fan of WalMart over the years and Sam Waltons genius in creating a truly global and national business based on one simple concept low cost and low price However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Bezos are doing to Sam and the Waltons what the Waltons did to retail for years When I started seeing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>bags start to show up in local grocery stores I knew exactly what they were
