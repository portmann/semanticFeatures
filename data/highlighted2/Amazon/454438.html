(NASDAQ:GOOG) | Seeking Alpha Jul  8 2016, 19:10 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Continuing a move toward actual company status, Google's ( GOOG +1.5%, GOOGL +1.5%) self-driving car project has hired a dedicated general counsel .Kevin Vosen has been tapped for the role and will begin late this month, Recode reports.He's chief legal officer with environmental data analysis firm The Climate Corp. (started by ex-Googlers).The project is still part of skunk-works lab X, but has hinted that it is heading toward separate company status under the Alphabet umbrella.I am new to investing and have been trying to learn as much as I can before jumping in the market.I really like Google and would like to own shares some day.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Google 's Price/Earnings to Growth is 1.8 according to MSN , I 've read that this <b>may</b> indicate that the stock is over valued .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Would buying at this time be <b>speculating</b> on the market ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Or fundamentally sound.I'm not sure if the price is at a good entry point right now.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Is the market too <b>optimistic</b> about Google ?  (Uncertainty) </span>I'm not looking for a definite answer but to get a concensus opinion, any feedback would be appreciated!<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>IMO it all <b>depends</b> on your timeline and investing objective .  (Uncertainty) </span>If you are looking to own Google, in 5-10-20-40 years does it really matter if you overpaid a little today?Plus adding on at different valuations over time will DCA down.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Then again , if you <b>believe</b> that only purchasing at certain valuation stick to that if it works for you .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Though over time , you <b>may</b> look back at missed opportunity .  (Uncertainty) </span>Investing for 10 years now, I've changed my philosophy a couple times and only have a handful of missed opportunities that I really look back on.They all taught me to stick to my investment plan and be patient while keeping the the long and short term in mind.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Hope</b> this helps .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>+ The 2Q 2016 quarterly results and conference call so you get a <i>better</i> idea of current and 3Q 2016 projections Generally , I use both fundamentals ( P/E , PEG , etc. ) mostly to analyze a company and then technicals ( charts ) to find a good price ( near support levels ) to time my purchase .  (Surprise) </span>As a final note, many are turning bearish on Google as Facebook is providing lots of search, especially in mobile, and that will hurt Google going forward.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I also know of many <i>better</i> stocks including a decent number with PEG 's <i>less</i> than 1.0 and certainly <i>less</i> than 1.8 .  (Surprise) </span>michsar gave good advice........but you should at least understand how to time the market.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>may</b> not always work ... but you should know all that is play and you should review charts for pricing and timing .  (Uncertainty) </span>Haschultz,  I am very bullish on Google long term.But when you look at the recent events in the US you keep hearing about these incidents are being live streamed on Facebook.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Google needs to do a <i>better</i> job of having these things live streamed to YouTube .  (Surprise) </span>As bad as these events have been they are a weird advertisement for Facebook live streaming.I would be very curious how much of an increase in live streaming is taking place on Facebook over the last couple of days.CNN was interviewing a guy and he shared he was live streaming the interview to Facebook.But in the end Facebook makes money from people watching the streams.If everyone records to Facebook but the viewers are on YouTube it is not good for Facebook as they bare most of the expense without enjoying the revenue.If you go on YouTube the Minnesota Shooting video is on the site with millions of views.There are several versions so you have to total.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The events in the US have been horrible and I hope my comments do not <b>appear</b> inappropriate when you consider what is happening is far , far <i>more</i> significant than a ROI from FB or Google .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The people that are dying, no matter who they are, have people at home that need them and they are NOT coming home.IMO, this is NOT acceptable.Love to hear some tech investment ideas.Google , Facebook and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> are all companies that have strong strategic positions and all have very healthy growth . The "old tech" companies like Apple are basically in free fall.Apple had over a 20% decline last quarter and is expected to have a similar decline this quarter.With nothing on the horizon to change the trend it is common sense that Apple will continue to decline quickly.Where in tech are you finding companies with a strong strategic position that also has double digit growth?I am all ears.I think we are going to see Google actually rolling something out to actual paying customers later this year.They bought 100 minivans a month ago or so.best advice is do not try to time the market, if you have $10,000, buy $1,000 every month or every other month, stick to a plan.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>ETF Screener : Search and filter by asset class , strategy , theme , performance , yield , and much <i>more</i> ETF Performance : View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes  (Surprise) </span></div></body></html>
