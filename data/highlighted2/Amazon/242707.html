class='textDiv'>Microsoft Nothing Special About Christmas Microsoft Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Microsofts current revenue sources and growth are in enterprise not consumer products despite many investors belief that MSFT performs differently during the shopping season Microsofts statistical analysis shows no differences around Christmas time I am often asked how certain stocks will perform during certain times such as after earnings reports product releases or holidays Recently I was asked how Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT performs during the Christmas season And therein lies the first note of interest MSFT is not a consumer stock As Ive stated before Windows releases matter not for MSFT Earnings reports after Windows releases dont move the stock price Its unlikely that other consumer products which are the focus of Christmas time do as well as youll later see from the results of my backtest Many MSFT investors and many more outspoken Apple NASDAQ AAPL fans like to compare MSFTs consumer products to those of AAPL or Samsung OTCSSNLF I believe this is a bit of a mistake because it wrongly assumes that MSFT finds much of its revenue from the consumer sector which is simply incorrect In fact MSFT generates most of its revenue from enterprise not Windows or consumer products This makes companies such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN and Oracle NYSE ORCL better comparisons than AAPL On the enterprise field MSFT is competing with these companies in two primary areas Cloud servicesplatforms and apps Lets talk about MSFTs main app first Office This is a business app that directly competes with Salesforce NYSE CRM and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Apps Office has already overtaken Google Apps in revenue billion vs billion and is on the road to overtaking Salesforce Microsofts Office has the same security tools of Google Apps and is gaining popularity in companies as the tech departments move their Outlook email to the cloud Then theres cloud revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is the clear leader with their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services which is still growing Microsoft has decided to compete with AWS with a cloud platform under the name of Azure Azure currently generates billion in revenue for MSFT This is double what IBM NYSE IBM and ORCL generate from their cloud platforms Azure can arguably outpace AWS in growth due to it having the Windows operating system on its side Azure provides many backend services for Windows users including cloud backup enterprise monitoring and statistical data analysis that links with Office As more computers upgrade to Windows Azure will inevitable gain market share over AWS inevitably because Azure will be the default much like Windows is the default operating system for most users MSFTs CEO is predicting billion in cloud revenue in the next two years which would indicate a growth of nearly This would equate to a revenue triple of what AWS is currently earning Obviously with this type of growth the stock will follow Though MSFT is trading at over investors now are faced with an opportunity to get on the ground floor of what virtually constitutes a new company Right now Office and Office remain MSFTs largest revenue sources with Azure quickly gaining So keep that in mind moving forward AAPL is not a direct competitor in this respect So please lets not make the comments section of this article another AAPL vs MSFT debate The takeaway here should be that MSFTs stock price is only slightly based on its consumer segment And I now show that with a study In response to the reader who asked me to predict MSFTs stock price movements over Christmas I have little to say I ran a statistical study and truthfully the results of the study are insignificant meaning that no significant results were found for the recent decade In short I ran a statistical analysis on whether the stock price showed significant changes the time around Christmas Looking one month forward and back from Christmas I found the price to move no different than the twomonth average movement of MSFT Thus we must conclude to not reject the null hypothesis that MSFT performs differently around Christmas To get a visual idea of whether the stock is affected by Christmas seasonality I ran a backtest that compares a buyandhold MSFT portfolio to one that removes MSFT during the Christmas season While in the far past the late s to MSFT performed well during the Christmas season and dropping MSFT during this time would have hurt your portfolio Then briefly in the early s MSFT underperformed during the Christmas season But now MSFT shows a rather flat trend during Christmas In fact the above description applies for the general market as well meaning that you should not include seasonality in your MSFT buying plan Sometimes the stock price might not show seasonality while the earnings do I took a look at the quarterly earnings to see if Q earnings were especially high While Q earnings tend to do well they do not consistently outperform the other earnings which is something WalMart NYSE WMT does for example So while MSFT seems to do well during the Christmas season in earnings thats not immediately reflected in the stock price It could be that MSFT experiences an upward correction when it releases its Q earnings report I have yet to look But my results overall show that Christmas season is not a special time to buy MSFT That said MSFT does currently look to be on the rise especially in its free cash flow Just as in my previous article on MSFT this is one of those stocks that seems to defy seasonality Though Christmas is certainly not a bad time to buy MSFT stock do not feel the need to rush out and buy MSFT because of a misconception that they will do especially well with their consumer product line As previously stated MSFTs main revenue source is enterprise not consumer products Overall MSFT is a stock that has strong FCF growth an undervalued price as per the discounted cash flow model and most importantly strong industry prospects particularly in its cloud platform AZURE MSFT is a strong longterm buyandhold stock from this perspective My two studies have shown that MSFT unlike AAPL on which I performed similar studies showing strong seasonality effects that investors can use to gain more shares at a lower price is a decent stock to buy at any time If youre using dollar cost averaging dont bother trying to time the market just buy If youre interested in
