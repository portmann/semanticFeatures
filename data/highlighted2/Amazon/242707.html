Microsoft has decided to compete with AWS with a cloud platform under the name of Azure.Azure currently generates $1.58 billion in revenue for MSFT.This is double what IBM (NYSE: IBM ) and ORCL generate from their cloud platforms.Azure can arguably outpace AWS in growth due to it having the Windows operating system on its side.Azure provides many backend services for Windows 10 users, including cloud backup, enterprise monitoring, and statistical data analysis that links with Office 365.As more computers upgrade to Windows 10, Azure will inevitable gain market share over AWS - inevitably because Azure will be the default, much like Windows is the default operating system for most users.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>MSFT 's CEO is predicting $ 20 billion in cloud revenue in the next two years , which would indicate a growth of <b>nearly</b> 1300 % .  (Uncertainty) </span>This would equate to a revenue triple of what AWS is currently earning.Obviously, with this type of growth, the stock will follow.Though MSFT is trading at over $50, investors now are faced with an opportunity to get on the "ground floor" of what virtually constitutes a new company.Right now, Office and Office 365 remain MSFT's largest revenue sources, with Azure quickly gaining.So keep that in mind moving forward.AAPL is not a direct competitor in this respect: So please let's not make the comments section of this article another AAPL vs. MSFT debate.The takeaway here should be that MSFT's stock price is only slightly based on its consumer segment.And I now show that with a study.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In response to the reader who asked me to <b>predict</b> MSFT 's stock price movements over Christmas , I have little to say .  (Uncertainty) </span>I ran a statistical study and, truthfully, the results of the study are insignificant, meaning that no significant results were found for the recent decade.In short, I ran a statistical analysis on whether the stock price showed significant changes the time around Christmas.Looking one month forward and back from Christmas, I found the price to move no different than the two-month average movement of MSFT.Thus, we must conclude to not reject the null hypothesis that MSFT performs differently around Christmas.To get a visual idea of whether the stock is affected by Christmas seasonality, I ran a backtest that compares a buy-and-hold MSFT portfolio to one that removes MSFT during the Christmas season.While in the far past - the late 1990s to 2008, MSFT performed well during the Christmas season, and dropping MSFT during this time would have hurt your portfolio.Then, briefly in the early 2010s, MSFT underperformed during the Christmas season.But now, MSFT shows a rather flat trend during Christmas.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In fact , the above description applies for the general market , as well , meaning that you should not include seasonality in your MSFT buying plan : Sometimes , the stock price <b>might</b> not show seasonality , while the earnings do .  (Uncertainty) </span>I took a look at the quarterly earnings to see if Q4 earnings were especially high.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While Q4 earnings tend to do well , they do not consistently outperform the other earnings - which is something Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) does , for example : So , while MSFT <b>seems</b> to do well during the Christmas season in earnings , that 's not immediately reflected in the stock price .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>could</b> be that MSFT experiences an upward correction when it releases its Q4 earnings report - I have yet to look .  (Uncertainty) </span>But my results overall show that Christmas season is not a special time to buy MSFT.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That said , MSFT does currently look to be on the rise , especially in its free cash flow : Just as in my previous article on MSFT , this is one of those stocks that <b>seems</b> to defy seasonality .  (Uncertainty) </span>Though Christmas is certainly not a bad time to buy MSFT stock, do not feel the need to rush out and buy MSFT because of a misconception that they will do especially well with their consumer product line.As previously stated, MSFT's main revenue source is enterprise, not consumer products.Overall, MSFT is a stock that has strong FCF growth, an undervalued price as per the discounted cash flow model, and - most importantly - strong industry prospects, particularly in its cloud platform, AZURE.MSFT is a strong long-term buy-and-hold stock from this perspective.My two studies have shown that MSFT, unlike AAPL ( on which I performed similar studies , showing strong seasonality effects that investors can use to gain more shares at a lower price), is a decent stock to buy at any time.If you're using dollar cost averaging, don't bother trying to time the market - just buy!If you're interested in seeing some tweaks to this strategy, ask me in the comments section or via mail.In my premium Seeking Alpha backtesting newsletter, I backtest your strategies.Let me know your ideas for a backtest.Alternatively, if you'd like a standard statistical study free for public reading, just leave your ideas below.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
