the lower prices This one might seem a bit random but kitchen trash bags the tall variety are cheaper at Target compared to Walmart Specifically Im talking about the store brand at each store At Target you can get the Up Up brand in a count box for while youll pay for a box of only bags of the Walmart brand Both bags received strong customer reviews making the Target brand a solid buy Because of the exclusive discounts they offer wedding registry gifts are simply cheaper at Target If the wedding couple registered at several stores and Target is one of them always choose to shop with them
