appreciation The company often beats on both the top and bottom line looking at postearnings performance I havent written about Facebook NASDAQ FB in a while My last article was published in June and I have since made a nice profit but do not have a position right now However I still think that the company has solid upside potential Many are arguing that Facebooks valuation is too high and it is if you look at it in isolation But those that are arguing valuation is high are neglecting the companys massive growth potential Yes Facebooks core social networking platform is maturing and the growth will inevitably slow down at some point But I still think that the company has a lot of room to grow Instagram has just scratched the surface monetizationwise and some very valuable assets are yet to be monetized WhatsApp Messenger Oculus to name a few Facebook has evolved beyond anyones expectations over the last few years and I am sure that the company is going places we cannot yet imagine over the next few years However I want to focus on valuation and upside potential Since Facebook started monetizing mobile in the second half of its TTM PS ratio has been in the to range it was slightly above for some time during late Source Yahoo Finance price history Facebook earnings reports other data points authors calculations And while a TTM PS ratio of or seems very excessive at first glance we have to take the following into account Margins Facebook is not your usual lowmargin company It is hard to expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN to trade in such a high PS ratio range despite its perpetually strong revenue growth because of its lowmargin business model But it is not unusual for Facebook The companys nonGAAP operating margin was in Q and the net margin was If a company has a PS ratio of and a net margin of its PE ratio would be Facebooks TTM PE ratio is around as of this writing Growth Facebook has grown its annual revenues from just below billion in or from just million in to almost billion in Facebooks EPS rose from just at the end of to at the end of and despite the share count doubling since early And as mentioned above this growth story is far from being over Future expectations have risen substantially over the past few years and if the company continues to execute as in previous quarters estimates should rise further As of this writing analysts expect and revenues to grow and respectively while EPS for this year and the next should increase and respectively Future growth expectations in their current state are enough the keep the PS ratio in the to range over the next to months and the PE ratio in a range of to I am using the PS ratio since it has been a more reliable valuation metric over the last few years Margins have contracted and expanded since making the PE ratio less reliable but looking at the PE ratio chart we can see that the stock has often bottomed when the PE ratio hit The TTM PE ratio is around right now implying around downside from the current price and if the company matches the Q EPS forecast the ratio should fall to around making the stock very attractive by looking at historical valuation trends I expect the PS ratio to stay in the to range over the next months Based on revenue growth projections my yearend price target for Facebook is between and The low end of the range is below the analyst mean of while the high end of the range is slightly above the highest price target of The yearend range would be between and The yearend PT range seems rather high but it is longerterm focused and the high end of the range could materialize by early In the table below you can see the price target projections and the upside potential based on the abovementioned PS ratio range I have added a PE ratio projection as well as a projection that calls for some multiple contraction for both the PE and the PS ratio Source Yahoo Finance authors calculations Facebook also broke past resistance at last week and postearnings momentum could drive the stock higher over the next few weeks Source Seeking Alpha Facebook quarterly reports Postearnings reactions have been mostly positive but it is worth noting that the performance on the next day is actually better on average than the performance one month later Gains have averaged three months following the report The table below also shows the TTM PS ratio the day before the quarterly report Facebooks current TTM PS ratio is around which is a good starting point considering the historical averages since mid A significant growth slowdown is the most significant risk for my thesis on Facebook I think that Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL is a good indicator of future valuation trends for Facebook Alphabet had Facebooklike multiples until and Alphabet has traded in a rather steady PS ratio range of and over the last five years However since Facebooks margins are higher than Alphabets between and higher I think that Facebooks PS ratio in years should probably be in the to range However it is hard to know what will happen five or more years from now and even if Facebooks PS contracts by its share price by then would probably be around higher judging from the revenue growth expectations over the next five years I should note that these valuation trends are all part of the ongoing equity bull market Facebook did go through three minibear markets of its own since but all three were contained to less than even if we take into account the miniflash crash that occurred in August Should a major bear market occur over the next year or two it will probably drag Facebooks price lower Facebooks riskreward still looks good despite the stock reaching new alltime highs last week The potential upside over the next two years is between and while the downside should be limited to to in the worstcase scenario absent a brutal bear market I am considering using options for this trade in order to limit the downside risk Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in FB over the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas
