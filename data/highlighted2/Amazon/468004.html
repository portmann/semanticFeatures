(Uncertainty) </span>Facebook is not your usual low-margin company.It is hard to expect <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) to trade in such a high P/S ratio range despite its perpetually strong revenue growth because of its low-margin business model . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But it is not <b>unusual</b> for Facebook .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company's non-GAAP operating margin was 52% in Q1 and the net margin was 41%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If a company has a P/S ratio of 5 and a net margin of 40 % , its P/E ratio would be 12.5 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Facebook's TTM P/E ratio is around 45 as of this writing.Growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Facebook has grown its annual revenues from just below $ 2 billion in 2010 ( or from just $ 272 million in 2008 ) to <b>almost</b> $ 18 billion in 2015 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Facebook's EPS rose from just $0.53 at the end of 2012 to $2.28 at the end of 2015 (and despite the share count doubling since early 2012).And, as mentioned above, this growth story is far from being over.Future expectations have risen substantially over the past few years, and if the company continues to execute as in previous quarters, estimates should rise further.As of this writing, analysts expect 2016 and 2017 revenues to grow 46% and 34% respectively, while EPS for this year and the next should increase 56% and 30% respectively.Future growth expectations in their current state are enough the keep the P/S ratio in the 15 to 20 range over the next 12 to 24 months and the P/E ratio in a range of 40 to 50.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I am using the P/S ratio , since it has been a <i>more</i> reliable valuation metric over the last few years .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Margins have contracted and expanded since 2013 , making the P/E ratio <i>less</i> reliable , but looking at the P/E ratio chart , we can see that the stock has often bottomed when the P/E ratio hit 40 .  (Surprise) </span>The TTM P/E ratio is around 45 right now, implying around 10% downside from the current price, and if the company matches the Q2 EPS forecast, the ratio should fall to around 41, making the stock very attractive by looking at historical valuation trends.I expect the P/S ratio to stay in the 15 to 20 range over the next 12-24 months.Based on revenue growth projections, my year-end price target for Facebook is between $130 and $175.The low end of the range is below the analyst mean of $144 while the high end of the range is slightly above the highest price target of $170.The year-end 2017 range would be between $165 and $220.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The year-end 2017 PT range seems rather high , but it is longer-term focused and the high end of the range <b>could</b> materialize by early 2018 .  (Uncertainty) </span>In the table below, you can see the price target projections and the upside potential based on the above-mentioned P/S ratio range.I have added a P/E ratio projection as well as a projection that calls for some multiple contraction for both the P/E and the P/S ratio.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Source : Yahoo Finance , author 's calculations Facebook also broke past resistance at $ 120 last week and post-earnings momentum <b>could</b> drive the stock <i>higher</i> over the next few weeks .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Source : Seeking Alpha , Facebook quarterly reports Post-earnings reactions have been mostly positive , but it is worth noting that the performance on the next day is actually <i>better</i> on average than the performance one month later .  (Surprise) </span>Gains have averaged 17% three months following the report.The table below also shows the TTM P/S ratio the day before the quarterly report.Facebook's current TTM P/S ratio is around 17.5, which is a good starting point considering the historical averages since mid-2013.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A significant growth slowdown is the most significant <b>risk</b> for my thesis on Facebook .  (Uncertainty) </span>I think that Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is a good indicator of future valuation trends for Facebook.Alphabet had Facebook-like multiples until 2008, and Alphabet has traded in a rather steady P/S ratio range of 5 and 8 over the last five years.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , since Facebook 's margins are <i>higher</i> than Alphabet 's ( between 30 % and 50 % <i>higher</i> ) , I think that Facebook 's P/S ratio in 4-5 years should <b>probably</b> be in the 7 to 10 range .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , it is hard to know what will happen five or <i>more</i> years from now , and even if Facebook 's P/S contracts by 50 % , its share price by then would <b>probably</b> be around 100 % <i>higher</i> judging from the revenue growth expectations over the next five years .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I should note that these valuation trends are all part of the ongoing equity bull market.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Facebook did go through three mini-bear markets of its own since 2013 , but all three were contained to <i>less</i> than 30 % ( even if we take into account the mini-flash crash that occurred in August 2013 ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Should a major bear market occur over the next year or two , it will <b>probably</b> drag Facebook 's price <i>lower</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Facebook's risk/reward still looks good despite the stock reaching new all-time highs last week.The potential upside over the next two years is between 10% and 80% while the downside should be limited to 25% to 30% in the worst-case scenario (absent a brutal bear market).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I am considering using options for this trade in order to limit the downside <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Disclosure : I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned , but <b>may</b> initiate a long position in FB over the next 72 hours .  (Uncertainty) </span>I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Internet Information Providers</div></body></html>
