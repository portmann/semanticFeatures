The cloud computing ship has sailed, and it doesn't pay to start a race in last place and play catch up.Honestly, a strong move by Apple doesn't even have to be directed toward businesses - although that's my idea.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But overall , Tim Cook and team need to have the foresight to spot , or just flat out create , what <b>could</b> be the next big thing , without hesitation .  (Uncertainty) </span>Tim Cook has to be willing to whip out the checkbook, spending money early on in nascent industry on either acquiring businesses directly or poaching talent.Lately, Apple has been playing catch-up, rolling with the industry instead of driving serious innovation.More deeply, Apple's acquisition and cash management strategy has been incredibly passive.That's not a recipe for success, and it can't stay that way forever.This will require a change of thought process at the top.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When it comes to acquisitions , Steve Jobs and Tim Cook are n't all that <b>different</b> from one another .

(Uncertainty) </span>Apple's strength is in its people.As a group, you won't find a more motivated workforce that wants to impact change and develop innovative products.But Apple can do more to foster that environment internally.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If not , it <b>risks</b> losing its most talented people to companies that do ( see Google 's `` Other Bets '' segment ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 'm <b>hoping</b> Apple does not lose that luster .
