Microsoft Stock Still Worth Buying Microsoft Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Charles Lewis Sizemore CFA Sizemore Insights clicks The risk in owning Microsoft at this point is simply the risk of a broad market selloff If that is something that concerns you consider putting on a stop loss But given that Microsofts reinvention is still in the early stages I certainly wouldnt be in any hurry to
