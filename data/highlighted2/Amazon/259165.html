The cloud-based Azure platform saw its revenues jump 135% last quarter.Revenues from the Intelligent Cloud division, at $5.9 billion last quarter, are quickly catching up to its Productivity and Business Processes division.This unit - which includes Microsoft Office - earned $6.3 billion last quarter.Though Microsoft stock yields only 2.7% at current prices, it has become something of a favorite among dividend investors due to MSFT's great track record of raising the dividend.In September, MSFT announced a 16% dividend hike, and the company has grown its dividend at a 19% annual clip over the past three years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given that Microsoft has <b>nearly</b> $ 100 billion in cash and equivalents , I 'd say odds are good that growth will continue .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The <b>risk</b> in owning Microsoft at this point is simply the <b>risk</b> of a broad market sell-off .  (Uncertainty) </span>If that is something that concerns you, consider putting on a stop loss.But given that Microsoft's reinvention is still in the early stages, I certainly wouldn't be in any hurry to sell.Disclaimer: This site is for informational purposes only and should not be considered specific investment advice or as a solicitation to buy or sell any securities.Sizemore Capital personnel and clients will often have an interest in the securities mentioned.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is risk in any investment in traded securities , and all Sizemore Capital investment strategies have the <b>possibility</b> of loss .
