(NYSE:UPS) | Seeking Alpha L&F Capital Management , L&F Capital (564 clicks) Jan.6, 2016  2:13 AM ET �|� About: United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) , Includes: AMZN , FDX by: L&F Capital Management For the third Christmas in a row, FDX or UPS has had trouble handling increased e-commerce shipment volume around the Holiday season.Neither of the delivery giants are prepared to handle ramped up volume from 2015's historic levels.UPS increased its processing capacity by 6% this Holiday season, but another 20% expansion to handle future growth in e-commerce would likely require billions of dollars of investment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>seems</b> UPS is playing `` keeping up with the Joneses '' here , and we are unsure of how long this can sustain itself .  (Uncertainty) </span>The 2015 Holiday Season was an interesting one for the US delivery system.While one shipping giant, The United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS ), managed to handle a surge in last-minute e-commerce shipments, the other, FedEx (NYSE: FDX ), was late on a handful of its deliveries .But this is nothing new.This is now the third Christmas in a row where shipping has been a problem for FDX or UPS around the Holiday season.In 2013 , UPS 's inability to keep up with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) holiday orders led many Christmas gifts to arrive after December 25 . In 2014 , both UPS and FDX capped Holiday deliveries to avoid a repeat of 2013 , causing companies like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to miss out on some profit that comes with last-minute demand surges . Now, in 2015, FDX played the role of 2013 UPS and was late on a handful of Christmas deliveries due to an "unprecedented surge" in e-commerce shipments.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This `` unprecedented surge '' will become the norm very soon and an <b>anomaly</b> on the low-end soon thereafter .  (Uncertainty) </span>The problem is that neither of the delivery giants, UPS and FDX, are prepared to handle ramped up volume from 2015's historic levels.To us , this only strengthens <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's motivation to squeeze UPS entirely out of its delivery process . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is no <b>doubt</b> that there exists strong secular growth trends in e-commerce adoption , in large part thanks to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's growing e-commerce presence . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continues to threaten the retail industry , traditional brick-and-mortar retailers like Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) , Target ( NYSE : TGT ) , and Macy 's ( NYSE : M ) will be forced to put <i>more</i> emphasis on their respective e-commerce channels . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Throw in a new wave of popular e-commerce-only retailers like Wayfair (NYSE: W ), and it is inevitable that we will continue to see an increase in e-commerce shipments, particularly around the gift-heavy Holidays.FDX 's inability to handle a surge in e-commerce shipments in 2015 , at the early stages of a multi-year uptrend in e-commerce shipment volume , likely gives <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and other retailers little reason to trust the traditional delivery system . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> 3 Christmases of botched deliveries in a row between UPS and FDX is significant of an old system in a new marketplace .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Many will argue that UPS was on top of its deliveries this year , so there is little to worry about , but we <b>believe</b> this is a near-sighted claim .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>UPS 's efficiency this Holiday season was simply attributable to getting orders in early and making <i>more</i> room .  (Surprise) </span>Monday, December 21, was the busiest shipping day of the Holiday season for UPS.This is because UPS worked closely with retailers to get orders before the Christmas weekend, thereby providing a cushion for UPS into Christmas Day.UPS also increased its permanent processing capacity by 6% .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But it <b>seems</b> UPS is playing `` keeping up with the Joneses '' here , and we are unsure of how long this can sustain itself .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You ca n't force all shoppers to `` shop early '' - that <b>somewhat</b> deconstructs the convenience of shopping online .  (Uncertainty) </span>You also can't stop secular growth in e-commerce adoption, which will only magnify these shipment surges.Steve Osburn, retail strategist at Kurt Salmon, agrees with us on this point.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>A 6 % increase to facilities <b>might</b> have been doable this year , but <i>more</i> expansion is going to be costly .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>He has said that UPS expanding its network by 20% to handle future growth in e-commerce would likely require billions of dollars of investment .In his words: "For them to try to keep up with that kind of growth is impossible.So retailers are going to have to figure out a way to get the product to the customer at different times, or through different channels."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Jonathan Colehower , chief marketing officer for Atlanta-based logistics software company Manhattan Associates , also <b>believes</b> retailers are beginning to look at the situation a little differently .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>He thinks that retailers <b>may</b> be interested in `` taking back the wheel on this one '' and will try to `` shape demand versus always having to respond to it '' .  (Uncertainty) </span>One way for retailers to do this is in-store pickup.A significant amount of retailers aggressively promoted buy-online, pick-up-in-store shopping this Holiday season, but it didn't quite workout for the retailers or the customers.In Kurt Salmon's audit of online orders, only about 40% of in-store pickup orders were actually ready for pickup upon the shopper's arrival to the store.That means 60% of the buy-online, pick-up-in-store orders this Christmas didn't play out as planned .According to Osburn: "For a lot of retailers, this was the first peak season they tried to do it.Performance of buy online-pick up in store was terrible for a lot of retailers."While retailers will likely continue to tweak and attempt to improve the efficiency of their buy-online , pick-up-in-store models , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will continue to flesh out its own delivery system that does n't mess with the hassles of in-store pick-up or put the ball in the court of UPS and FDX to invest billions to expand infrastructure . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We firmly <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has taken the ball back into its own court when it comes to delivery . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>No <i>more</i> late deliveries at the hands of third-party shipment companies , no <i>more</i> $ 20 gift cards doled out to several customers because of an external error , no <i>more</i> capping of last-minute order surges , and no <i>more</i> impediments to the growth of the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> e-commerce machine . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> wants to grow its e-commerce channel as fast as it can . As they currently stand, UPS and FDX are impediments to that growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We believe investor <b>optimism</b> surrounding UPS being on-time this Holiday season is misplaced .  (Uncertainty) </span>Some deliveries in the US were still late, and that is all that matters.FDX being late on shipments this year coupled with in-store pick-up failures only further compel <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to create its own delivery system . It is only a matter of time before UPS loses all of its <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> business . We do not think the current valuation is braced to handle this loss , especially as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> grows its e-commerce market share . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
