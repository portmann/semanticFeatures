AMZN FDX by LF Capital Management For the third Christmas in a row FDX or UPS has had trouble handling increased ecommerce shipment volume around the Holiday season Neither of the delivery giants are prepared to handle ramped up volume from s historic levels UPS increased its processing capacity by this Holiday season but another expansion to handle future growth in ecommerce would likely require billions of dollars of investment It seems UPS is playing keeping up with the Joneses here and we are unsure of how long this can sustain itself The Holiday Season was an interesting one for the US delivery system While one shipping giant The United Parcel Service NYSE UPS managed to handle a surge in lastminute ecommerce shipments the other FedEx NYSE FDX was late on a handful of its deliveries But this is nothing new This is now the third Christmas in a row where shipping has been a problem for FDX or UPS around the Holiday season In UPSs inability to keep up with Amazons NASDAQ AMZN holiday orders led many Christmas gifts to arrive after December In both UPS and FDX capped Holiday deliveries to avoid a repeat of causing companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to miss out on some profit that comes with lastminute demand surges Now in FDX played the role of UPS and was late on a handful of Christmas deliveries due to an unprecedented surge in ecommerce shipments This unprecedented surge will become the norm very soon and an anomaly on the lowend soon thereafter The problem is that neither of the delivery giants UPS and FDX are prepared to handle ramped up volume from s historic levels To us this only strengthens Amazons motivation to squeeze UPS entirely out of its delivery process There is no doubt that there exists strong secular growth trends in ecommerce adoption in large part thanks to Amazons growing ecommerce presence As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>continues to threaten the retail industry traditional brickandmortar retailers like WalMart NYSE WMT Target NYSE TGT and Macys NYSE M will be forced to put more emphasis on their respective ecommerce channels Throw in a new wave of popular ecommerceonly retailers like Wayfair NYSE W and it is inevitable that we will continue to see an increase in ecommerce shipments particularly around the giftheavy Holidays FDXs inability to handle a surge in ecommerce shipments in at the early stages of a multiyear uptrend in ecommerce shipment volume likely gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and other retailers little reason to trust the traditional delivery system We believe Christmases of botched deliveries in a row between UPS and FDX is significant of an old system in a new marketplace Many will argue that UPS was on top of its deliveries this year so there is little to worry about but we believe this is a nearsighted claim UPSs efficiency this Holiday season was simply attributable to getting orders in early and making more room Monday December was the busiest shipping day of the Holiday season for UPS This is because UPS worked closely with retailers to get orders before the Christmas weekend thereby providing a cushion for UPS into Christmas Day UPS also increased its permanent processing capacity by But it seems UPS is playing keeping up with the Joneses here and we are unsure of how long this can sustain itself You cant force all shoppers to shop early that somewhat deconstructs the convenience of shopping online You also cant stop secular growth in ecommerce adoption which will only magnify these shipment surges Steve Osburn retail strategist at Kurt Salmon agrees with us on this point A increase to facilities might have been doable this year but more expansion is going to be costly He has said that UPS expanding its network by to handle future growth in ecommerce would likely require billions of dollars of investment In his words For them to try to keep up with that kind of growth is impossible So retailers are going to have to figure out a way to get the product to the customer at different times or through different channels Jonathan Colehower chief marketing officer for Atlantabased logistics software company Manhattan Associates also believes retailers are beginning to look at the situation a little differently He thinks that retailers may be interested in taking back the wheel on this one and will try to shape demand versus always having to respond to it One way for retailers to do this is instore pickup A significant amount of retailers aggressively promoted buyonline pickupinstore shopping this Holiday season but it didnt quite workout for the retailers or the customers In Kurt Salmons audit of online orders only about of instore pickup orders were actually ready for pickup upon the shoppers arrival to the store That means of the buyonline pickupinstore orders this Christmas didnt play out as planned According to Osburn For a lot of retailers this was the first peak season they tried to do it Performance of buy onlinepick up in store was terrible for a lot of retailers While retailers will likely continue to tweak and attempt to improve the efficiency of their buyonline pickupinstore models <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will continue to flesh out its own delivery system that doesnt mess with the hassles of instore pickup or put the ball in the court of UPS and FDX to invest billions to expand infrastructure We firmly believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has taken the ball back into its own court when it comes to delivery No more late deliveries at the hands of thirdparty shipment companies no more gift cards doled out to several customers because of an external error no more capping of lastminute order surges and no more impediments to the growth of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>ecommerce machine <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>wants to grow its ecommerce channel as fast as it can As they currently stand UPS and FDX are impediments to that growth We believe investor optimism surrounding UPS being ontime this Holiday season is misplaced Some deliveries in the US were still late and that is all that matters FDX being late on shipments this year coupled with instore pickup failures only further compel <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to create its own delivery system It is only a matter of time before UPS loses all of its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>business We do not think the current valuation is braced to handle this loss especially as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>grows
