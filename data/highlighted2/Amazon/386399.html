(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha After a decade of growing dominance, Apple has finally seen "peak iPhone."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is currently <b>unclear</b> what Apple will do to ensure its dominance going forward .  (Uncertainty) </span>Much has been said about Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) problems to find new revenue streams that can move the needle.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This article is not about <b>speculating</b> on specific projects or playing with cash flow models to size up potential revenue streams .  (Uncertainty) </span>This article is on a fundamental shift in the technology world as I perceive it as a researcher.For context, I have previously commented on how Apple is missing out in this segment.Apple is a device company.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> even the device company , given the iconic status of its products , which has allowed them to be sold at a premium to the general market .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is really obvious, so obvious we never stop to think about what being a device company should fundamentally mean.A device is something that enables us to perform a task for a particular purpose.Some devices perform essential tasks, some perform tangential tasks: Let's step back and think about Apple's inception and its historical context.If I think about the 20th century, I think about the century of devices.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The 20th century brought us electrical washing machines , fridges , television , hand-held music players and a myriad of other devices only made <b>possible</b> by the proliferation of integrated circuits .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Devices have made our lives <i>easier</i> by helping us save time , be <i>more</i> productive or by entertaining us .  (Surprise) </span>Apple was founded at the core of this device explosion.Its immense success and domination especially in the smartphone market in the past decade was grounded in what I would call a philosophical understanding of how people feel about their consumerist choices.How these choices can be used to express ourselves and how we want other people to view us.This is the understanding that separated Steve Jobs from other tech executives.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Humans are fundamentally bad at <b>predicting</b> how much things will change .  (Uncertainty) </span>When we think about what happens to us or the world in ten or twenty years, we tend to think in a sequence of linear steps.Paying off our mortgage.Children in college.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is natural because it 's hard to think about unknown <b>unknowns</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Hence , we are <b>surprised</b> when the world <b>suddenly</b> shifts very abruptly , even if we are quick to find explanations of how this was inevitable in hindsight ( e.g. Arab spring , fall of Berlin wall , war in Ukraine ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For Apple , linear progress consists of selling <i>more</i> and <i>better</i> devices and slowly expanding into other device categories .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is how Tim Cook <b>seems</b> to think .  (Uncertainty) </span>Note that the following argument is not about disruption.Disruption is about competition from another angle within the same or an initially just remotely similar market.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's <i>more</i> fundamental .  (Surprise) </span>It's about whether devices will be as central to our lives going forward as they are today, which is a pivotal question for a consumer electronics company.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do not <b>believe</b> the 21st century will be about consumer devices the same way the 20th century was .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is for a number of reasons.First, let us think about why we buy devices.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When a new class of devices <b>appears</b> initially , functionality is a differentiator .  (Uncertainty) </span>A colored smartphone display.A 5 MP camera.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A <i>larger</i> television screen .  (Surprise) </span>We buy things just because they can do something new and fascinating or useful.However, as a consequence of competitors entering a market, functionality becomes a marginal property.Instead, brand identity and status become paramount.After a while (and this can take decades), something else happens: a device becomes so commoditized that it is no longer associated to status.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Functionality converges to a set of features offered in tiny <b>variations</b> by all competitors An example of this would be a TV .  (Uncertainty) </span>Over a decade ago, a big television with a high resolution was associated to status.Today, we can get a large screen with high resolution from any vendor with negligible price differences.We are also beginning to see this status loss in the smartphone market.In 2010, having the latest iPhone was an actual status symbol.Today, people still love iPhones but the status effect has worn off after many generations.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the end , we care <i>less</i> about the device than about the services being run on the device , e.g. the Netflix app .  (Surprise) </span>Which finally leads me to the punch line.The 21st century will marginalize devices through intelligent software-driven services.The reason physical devices have been so successful is that interacting with a physical object was the only way to perform essential tasks.This is about to change.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I want you to take a minute to reflect on how we <b>might</b> interact with technology in 10 or 20 years and think beyond an iPhone 15 or an iPad 9 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Here is a theory of what <b>might</b> happen : Mobile devices and productivity devices like laptops and tablets will end up as interchangeable as washing machines or fridges or TVs today .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Seems</b> ridiculous ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Why?What fundamental reason is there to support a market differentiation like today?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I expect this shift to happen as a consequence of <i>less</i> physical interaction .  (Surprise) </span>If we talk to devices, we do not have to touch them or pick them up.If we can interact with a hologram or any other kind of optical projection (e.g. onto our retina), we don't care about the size of the screen.If devices know what we want them to do because they learn our schedules and habits, we don't have to interact with them at all to get something done.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I appreciate that for some readers this <b>might</b> be too far-down the road to care .  (Uncertainty) </span>On the other hand, I know that many view Apple as a buy-and-hold forever kind of company.If you invest like that, you need to think a decade or two ahead.As of right now, I think Apple does not think much about this issue and I feel a lot of the discussion here is similarly too focused on specific potential consumer products.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To me , Apple management seems vaguely optimistic in the sense that they <b>believe</b> they can just continue to come up with new devices that people will buy .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is <b>probably</b> true for the next 5 or 10 years .  (Uncertainty) </span>What Apple needs to decide is whether it wants to sell accessories or devices that perform useful services.The Apple Watch does not do any of that unless you count saving a second to pull out your phone to check a notification.The Apple Watch is an accessory.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is clearly driven by Jony Ive 's design interests <i>more</i> than by a <i>larger</i> vision for what Apple as a company should be .  (Surprise) </span>There is nothing wrong with selling high-end electronic toys.You just won't make $50 billion with them.They don't move the needle the way a transformative technology does if it performs a core task for us in a new way.Apple's relevance relies on doing that.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>At its core , technology is meant to help us to do things <i>better</i> , <i>faster</i> , <i>cheaper</i> or achieve results we ourselves <b>could</b> not get due to natural limitations .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It's a fallacy to think that this will always have to be through intense interaction with physical devices that we interact with every few minutes the way we are using consumer electronics today.We don't truly care about how we are interacting with a service.Yes, software needs to run on devices, so there will always be devices.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , we are converging towards devices just consuming services that are run in <i>more</i> resource efficient data-centers ( cloud computing ) .  (Surprise) </span>This means electronic devices are turning into mere interfaces for remote services.I think Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) understand this aspect.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They strongly <b>believe</b> the world is about to be reshaped by intelligent services and are launching initiatives into natural-language driven products .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple is largely ignoring that trend (Siri is not a core feature to Apple) because it does not see itself as a software-service company.It's not investing enough in this space to be a player.Apple builds beautifully designed hardware.Jony Ive is a great product designer.The problem is that designing new beautiful accessories will not let a company stay the most valuable enterprise in the world.New product lines should go back to a core vision of what technology should do for us.As of now , Apple is steering towards a world where either its devices become marginalized by intelligent services powered by software-centric players like Google , Facebook , IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . Or Apple is settling on selling new fashion accessories while its core product lines slowly shrink from their peaks.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Ultimately , we <b>might</b> not just have seen ` peak iPhone ' , we <b>might</b> have seen ` peak device ' .  (Uncertainty) </span>I cannot recommend Apple as a long-term investment until I see management presenting a convincing concept on how to integrate their devices with these next generation of services.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Technology , Personal Computers, Editors' Picks</div></body></html>
