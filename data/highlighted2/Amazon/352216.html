(Uncertainty) </span>Hulu, on the other hand, is a service that lacks Netflix's scale - it had close to 9M Hulu Plus subscribers as of last April - and has already created a niche among TV aficionados drawn to its large TV-show library and support (in some cases) for next-day streaming of new episodes.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Investing in long-tail movie content would give Hulu another way to <b>differentiate</b> its content relative to Netflix 's on a smaller budget .  (Uncertainty) </span>HBO (NYSE: TWX ), meanwhile, has been selling potential subscribers - whether for the standalone HBO Now service, or for the pay-per-view/HBO Go package - on its large and popular library of original programming.This acts as HBO's tentpole .What's interesting here is that HBO is arguably pitching its services as a complement to Netflix as much as an alternative.It's effectively telling consumers: "Whether or not you're subscribed to Netflix, you'll want to subscribe to HBO to get Game of Thrones, Vinyl, and other popular shows you can't get on Netflix."Investing in niche movie content not found on Netflix would be an extension of this strategy.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There 's no guarantee Hulu or HBO will try to <b>differentiate</b> by investing more in long-tail material .  (Uncertainty) </span>Hulu has long been hamstrung by the interests of its old-media owners.And thanks to the deals it has struck for its pay-per-view channel, HBO's movie library has skewed towards newer films.But Netflix's calculated decision to pare back the size of its library to focus more on original content and hit movies/shows presents an opening.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 house.Tagged: Services , Music & Video Stores, Editors' Picks, SA Submit</div></body></html>
