a new microphone to start making howto videos for my business and they delivered the thing on a Sunday I guess it means ecommerce has no days off anymore It also means I dont have to step foot in a store if I can help it That makes me smile a little bit Since Im a fan of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>I created an article some time ago called little known ways to save money at Amazoncom It is my most popular article by far on Debt Roundup I showed people a few ways they can save money when they were perusing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for things they wanted or to get the best deals There is even a bonus in that article so six ways to save Since that article Ive been asked by others if I knew of some other ways to save Luckily for them and for you I do have more Much more Today Im going to share with you ways yes to save money when shopping on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Not all of these are revolutionary but they will make you think before you click the checkout button If you check all of these out you can really save good money when shopping on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>You can also ensure youre getting the best price possible There are times when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is not the cheapest game in town and I know that can be the case Having said that I also account quick shipping ease of returns and customer service in my reasoning to purchase something Typically there are few retailers who can compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>on all of those levels Without further ado lets get started Here are the money saving tips everyone should know before shopping on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>This is the place to shop I have saved so much money here and the products are just as good Amazons Warehouse deals section is for the openbox and discounted used items <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has around Since they are the largest retailer they get items that have shipping damage were opened and then returned or a customer just didnt want them It happens to every retailer Instead of just calling it a loss <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sells the items they deem are in good condition When on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>head over to this page to start shopping their warehouse deals <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>grades the merchandise in their warehouse to help you make a better decision on what you want They are New Like New Very Good Good and Acceptable I would stick with the first three when buying anything I was able to save off a camera lens for my wife just because the shipping box was damaged It was labeled new but since there was box damage they couldnt sell it at full price I wrote an indepth article about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>warehouse deals so check it out and then start looking around to enjoy the savings If the warehouse deals wasnt enough <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>also have an outlet section This is where they stick their overstocks older models overruns closeouts and markdowns The items are all new but they put a deep discount on them in order to sell Right now you can typically score a deal up to off the regular price Its a pretty good section to look at Not every category has an outlet section but they deal mostly with clothing electronics outdoor equipment musical instruments and a few more You can typically find outlet deals for Amazons most popular categories Its a good place to look for items you know are not in season If you need something that you can use in the summer but youre buying it in the winter check Amazons outlet section You never know Did you know that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has coupons Most people didnt know that but they really do <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has an entire coupon section just for those looking for some deals Now these coupons tend to be for the bigger manufacturers but the best part is they are instant clip If youre looking to buy some diapers you can head over to the Coupon section and see if they have any diaper coupons One click and the savings are yours If you want to just navigate to the coupon section you can just go to wwwamazoncomcoupons and you will be there I wrote an indepth article about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>coupons so you can look that over before you go Basically they have coupons for well known brands including food items they stock in Prime Pantry They break out the categories for their coupons into sections such as Most Popular Beauty Grocery Gourmet Household Supplies Electronics Baby Child Care Vitamins Dietary Supplements and much more Depending on your need there might be an instant clip coupon waiting for you Want up to off items you normally buy each and every week Then you need to be a part of Amazons subscribe and save program Yes this little gem allows you to subscribe to a bunch of products you normally buy think everyday items but save money on top of it Subscribe and Save sends out products to you on a regular basis You choose what products you want delivered and when each month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will do the rest The best part is if you have five or more items on subscribe and save then you get off You also get free shipping on your items doesnt matter how many you have This is the perfect way to keep your house stocked up without having to drive to the store every month the replenish your supplies They will be waiting for you at your door at the time you specify Its not much easier than that Oh and you can also include some coupons in the mix <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does have some instant clip coupons just for subscribe and save items Hot dang This program is only for those who have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime It used to be separate but then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>wrapped it under Prime If you dont have Prime you can sign up for a day free trial here Its for the year You can read this post to see if its worth it Just like their subscribe and save program <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Mom allows you to save off diaper subscriptions This means you pick your favorite diaper brand and have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>deliver them right to your door at regular intervals Its just that easy So basically its Amazons subscribe and save with an extra added on top If youre already a Prime member then you can sign up for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Mom here Another benefit is getting off a baby registry completion purchase Did you know <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a baby registry Well they do If you have one with them and you dont get all that you wantneed then you can get off by purchasing the items youd like after your child is born That is only if youre part of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Mom program If youre a student with a edu email address then you can save on an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime membership <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Student is basically a Prime account but for off You can get it for a year There are some limitations to this program which are still available for full Prime members You cant share any of your shipping benefits with anyone else and you cant get Instant Video until your free trial expires after months To sign up you just head over here You dont need to have your edu email in your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>account but they will use it to verify youre truly a student The program will end after four years of your sign up or they cant verify your student status any longer whichever comes first This is just an easy way to save on Prime and get some discounts on books As I spoke in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Mom section they even offer a Baby Registry to make your life easier Its pretty easy to use and you get to save with their completion discount This is only for those who are in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Mom program Anyone can sign up for a baby registry You get the biggest selection of products Amazons selection is unmatched along with easy day returns mobile registry and discountsrewards only for baby registry owners <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>even has a tool that allows you to add items you cant find on their site to you registry Its basically a universal baby registry There are also some rotating offers which some will see and some will not This includes Amazons Welcome Box which is a free and includes some necessities for your baby Its pretty cool but not every one with a registry will get this box This is by far my favorite tool to save money on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Its a thirdparty tool that helps you keep track of prices on a product you might want to buy It also helps you make sure youre getting the best deal possible Seriously you should have this one bookmarked if you buy anything from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>This site is really easy to use You can either sign up for an account or just use it without one If you want to watch products and get alerts to price drops on either <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>or on Twitter then you will need to sign up for a free account To use the site just put in the URL of the product you want to buy off <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>so something like httpwwwamazoncomMohuLeafAmplifiedIndoorAntennadpBAPPDX This will then give you a run down of the pricing history of the product It gives you valuable insight into how the product has been priced over time and if the current price is in line with those changes Her is a graph for the product example above This chart tells me the product is not at its best price but is around average That being said you might want to wait and see if the price drops or just sign up for an account and CamelCamelCamel will email you when it does Easy peasy This is a service very similar to CamelCamelCamel but since it tracks Amazons prices on any item you want to buy I wanted to include it here Anything to help you save money before you actually buy is what I want to do TheTracktorcom is a site that allows you to search for a product by name put in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>URL or the ASIN The ASIN is a product identifier on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and can be found in any <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>product URL Here is an example The highlighted text above it the ASIN number If you can get this then you can enter it and get some pricing history Here is what the results look like Here is a sneaky little trick that does work from time to time Its not guaranteed but I have seen it work before Basically this is a way to get <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to push deals over to you without doing any work When you want to buy a product on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>head over there and add it to your cart The key to this pricing trick is to NOT check out after you add it to your cart You want to wait for some time to see if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will drop the price Sometimes they do and sometimes they dont This is what I like to call forcing a promotion You must be logged into your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>account before you add the items to your cart This is the only way Ive seen it work Once you add the items to your cart you need to leave <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for a few days Obviously you want to use this trick when you dont need an item quickly After some time you might get an email from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>saying you have items in your shopping cart and they could provide a promotion to you Ive saved by waiting before but it is hit or miss Its not effective Its free to try and doesnt hurt you so why not Theres a chance you can score a deal without doing anything but leaving an item or two in your shopping cart Winning This is basically running a small price comparison right on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>from your computer You are trying to see if you can score a better deal when shopping on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>without being logged in This is not but I have seen it work and have received a few lower prices It all depends on the product and where you live You just need to navigate to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>like you normally would Find what you want to buy but dont add it to your cart Make sure youre logged into your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>account Next open a new fresh browsing window try incognito in Chrome or private window in Firefox Navigate to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and go to the same product page Sometimes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will show lower prices to those not already an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>customer but this trick really works if you can get a friend in a different city to check the pricing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does really well with their product distributions so if they can pinpoint where you are and where the product is they might be able to score a better deal if the distribution center is near This trick is not hard to try but its accuracy is not as good as anything else in this article I think Ive seen this work about of the time Either way you can save by checking pricing on two different browsers There are tons of retailers out there who price match products Many didnt know that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>did it but they do just not on everything I wrote an article about how to ask for an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>price match so make sure to check that out for full details You can simply tell <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>about a lower price and see if they will match it Its not instant but you can go back to the product a little later and see if they dropped the price Sometimes they do and sometimes they do not It all depends on the product and the price you found Telling them about the price match is fairly easy On any product page you want to navigate to the product details Here is what youll see Just click that link and go through the pop up box that comes after your click Here is a brief example after you tell them where you found the price to match online or instore Ive seen a success rate with this so I cant complain Im not an avid price match superstar so when I can get a lower price by just asking for it why be upset Beyond the popularity of the little know ways to save on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>one of my next biggest posts on here is on how to share your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime account For the longest time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>allowed you to share you Prime shipping benefits with up to people Yes four people They had specified those people needed to be in your household but there was no enforcement You could share with friends and coworkers to allow them to get free twoday shipping It was awesome Unfortunately <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>wised up and figured out a way to cut out the fun You can still share your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime benefits but you also have to share the credit cards on your accounts That could really throw off anyone wanting to do this with friends Basically you can create a household so only one person needs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime The other person in the household can use your Prime account for the shipping benefits but still hide their order history This is good for those who use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to buy birthday gifts for each other and dont want them to find out You can share the credit card and the order history if you want but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does let you hide somethings When you share your benefits it allows you to only use one Prime account so you dont have to pay for each person Just one and share it Here is some information on how you can set up a household <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Smile can do just that for you While its not a way to save money on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>it is a way to give back while you shop there If you havent heard of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Smile then here is a rough break down You can read more here When you shop at smileamazoncom instead of just amazoncom you can give back to your favorite charity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Smile lists over one million charities where you can donate to But how do you donate Simple instead of buying an item on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>you just head over to smileamazoncom and buy the item there Its still Amazons site but now they will give of your purchase to the charity of your choice While its not going to be a huge donation its still a donation none the less Its basically a donation to your favorite charity just for shopping on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>You dont get to write it off since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is the one doing the donation but still It doesnt take any extra time or effort on your part and you can help your favorite charity in the process The next time you are on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>looking at a product to buy try replacing the www with smile in the URL If the product page comes back up then youre in luck Most of them work this way but if not just head to smileamazoncom and look for the same product If there is one thing I always do before I shop online its check out the cash back sites to make sure Im going to save more money in the process My favorite is Ebates but there are many more Here is a good list of them Cash back sites are typically free to join and they offer money back when you shop at your favorite retailers through them Basically I sign into my Ebates account find the retailer I want to shop at then click through their site If I purchase something Ebates will pay me a specified cash back amount Ive seen upwards of cash back for some retailers While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt regularly provide cash back offerings they are listed in Ebates and many other ones You can get back when shopping some clothing or other items It changes almost all the time I do believe they generally provide at least cash back on your purchases but they can be selective on which categories they allow I always suggest to anyone to check out the cash back sites before shopping on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Its like three extra clicks and you can get money back in your pocket Whats easier than that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a little feature they like to call their Gold Box This is really just their deal of the day type of section They have daily deals on a large number of products but only two or three get into the Gold Box Its not hard to find the daily deals on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but I will show you where to look anyway Im just kind that way Just look for the link below when youre on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>If you can find Todays Deals then you got to the Gold Box section <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>lists products for deeper discounts on this page The two or three which are the daily deals are the biggest discount They are only for a day and there is even a counter to tell you when the deal ends Now Im not going to say the deal is as good as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>advertises They typically inflate the savings by using the list price instead of what they typically sell it for If you want to see what the true deal is then check out this tutorial The deals are hit and miss but its easy to check out You can also sign up for a daily email which will be delivered every morning with the days gold box deals I do this and its easy for me to see if I want to even check out the deal You can subscribe here Do you have some old items you dont use or need anymore Have you thought about trading them in for cash Well what about trading them in for an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>gift card This can help you save money when you shop on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>by getting you cash for items you dont use anymore Amazons tradein program usually is reserved for items like electronics It does especially well with iPhones iPads and Android devices They say they will give you a quote for phones electronics books video games and DVDs You cant trade in your old clothing or anything like that To trade in an item you have to head over here to get a quote <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will provide you with an instant quote based on your feedback of the item They will then provide you with a prepaid shipping label to ship the item to them Once they receive it and inspect it they will pay you with an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>egiftcard Its really that easy The amount you make will be determined by the popularity and the condition Most people think wish lists are used for birthday gifts and other events like that but you can actually use a wish list to save money on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>They make it really easy to setup a wish list for products you want to purchase They might make it too easy To start one just go here Once you have a wish list created then you are good to go The point of this is not to share it with people for them to buy the products You can do this but we are not talking about that Once you add a product to your wish list <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>starts tracking the item for you The best part is they will email you when the price drops from what it was when you added it to your wish list Basically its the built in price tracking service on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>You cant get all of the historical data like you can with CamelCamelCamel or The Tracktor but you dont have to sign up with another service You just create your free wish list then wait to see if the price drops You can then head over to those two sites mentioned earlier to see if the price drop is a good one or not Who doesnt love easy This money saving tip could be a little touchy for some because it involves emails If youre anything like me you have an inbox that is growing by the day I cant handle too many emails beyond what I already have That being said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does deliver deals right to your inbox depending on what categories you sign up for As noted before I get Amazons daily deals to my inbox every morning This allows me to quickly look to see if the deal is anything which pertains to me If not it gets deleted It only takes a minute to sign up for different lists <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>provides You can go here and see what they offer but these emails will usually be promotions and deals Its really just about saving money with this one and making it easy for you The people behind savingscom put together a little tool to show you if the price on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is the best price While it can be hard to tell based on a number of factors like Prime shipping free shipping and other things this tool is pretty cool As noted before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>might not be the lowest price While I will check their prices against some competitors I will most likely check out on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>because of my Prime shipping and the customer service To each their own As with the other thirdparty tracking services this one doesnt track price history but shows you some other storescompetitors and their pricing It will tell you if the best deal is at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and give you the option to look at the other stores Based on looking for a Mohu Leaf I found that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is not the cheapest around I can get it for less at Home Depot That being said sometimes it cant find an exact match for the product so it tries to bring relevant matches This example was close but the Walmart listing was off Either way its a free tool to use and why not stick it in your savings quiver You never know if youre getting the best deal until you compare with other stores Here is an interesting little way to save money on some unique <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>products SnagShout is a service that allows you to get some products from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but at a reduced price Why The point of the service is to encourage you to leave reviews of the product This typically is reserved for newly released products They dont have a huge amount of products but they are at great prices for instance you can get a piece stainless steel barbecue set for only Thats about off the price it would sell on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>As noted you get the price because you have to submit a product review on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Companies are spending money to reduce the price in order to get reviews You have to be honest in your review This is not a way to buy star reviews This is to just get reviews in order for your product to sell The more reviews you have hopefully positive the better your chances at selling a product become Before you go sign up make sure you read their FAQ to see if you would be a good SnagShout shopper They want people they can trust to do what is asked of them I havent tried this method but Ive heard it does in fact work I have tested it in theory and you can see that above Basically you are tricking the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shopping cart system to give you free shipping even though you dont match the threshold See <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>gives free shipping on orders of or more They also now give free shipping on items of oz and less You can read more about these two free shipping initiatives here If you wanted to purchase a product and didnt have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime then you would either have to be ordering enough to meet the free shipping threshold or something that is oz or less Well that might harder to do for some orders so there is another way This little trick involves adding the items you want in your cart Once you do that you can go add something that is in preorder status While it can be a little challenge sometimes to find preorder items I suggest looking at DVDs or video games That is the best way to do it You can easily just type in preorder or preorder in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>search box and add that to the cart Once you do that the system will usually say you qualify for free shipping order is over You arent charged for the preorder until it actually ships so your original products will ship if in stock and then you can just cancel the preordered item and be done with it Do you like to read Do you have an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Kindle Well then you need to make sure you save money when buying books for your Kindle They have a Kindle Daily Deals section just for those people who love to read on their Kindle They offer items at up to off and its easy to find You dont have to do much but head right here and start looking for those deals They break down the categories for you to make it much easier to look at the categories that interest you You can also find deals and much more Just look over the page and find the books that you want to get to read on your Kindle This last tip to save money on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is for those who already have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime This is basically calling <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>when your order is not delivered on the guaranteed day See when you shop on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and you have Prime then you will get a guaranteed delivery date If the order does not arrive at your house on that day then you can call up <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>about it Now most likely they will just apologize In some cases if you let me know of you frustration you can get an extension on your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime membership Since they are yearly memberships getting some free months is awesome and it saves you money Ive heard of people getting an extra month sometimes three and in the extreme cases up to six months This is all for just calling them out on missing their guaranteed delivery date <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>prides themselves on excellent customer service so just asking them about missing the shipping deadline could result in more months added onto your Prime membership Just call and see what happens Get Your
