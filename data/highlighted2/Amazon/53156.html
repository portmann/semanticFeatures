'' <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Future increased tax liabilities resulting from increasing scrutiny of Irish tax arrangements is encompassed in the risk factor section of Apple 's 10-Q : The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates , the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or <b>exposure</b> to additional tax liabilities .  (Uncertainty) </span>The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company's subsidiaries are organized.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Due to economic and political conditions , tax rates in various jurisdictions <b>may</b> be subject to significant change .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The Company 's future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with <b>differing</b> statutory tax rates , changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities , or changes in tax laws or their interpretation , including in the U.S. and Ireland .  (Uncertainty) </span>For example, in June 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation of Ireland to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities with regard to the corporate income tax to be paid by two of the Company's Irish subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the European Commission were to conclude against Ireland , it <b>could</b> require Ireland to recover from the Company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid , and such amount <b>could</b> be material .  (Uncertainty) </span>A "material event" is defined by U.S. securities rules as five percent of a company's average pre-tax earnings for the past three years, which, for Apple, amounts to several billion dollars.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given that this is only a base , or minimum potential recovery , it is understandable why investors may give some pause to this <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But , as set forth in the opening paragraph to this article , I believe that the <i>longer</i> term risk is Apple 's future inability to continue storing a substantial portion of its cash in a <b>nearly</b> tax free haven .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>State aid is defined as "an advantage in any form whatsoever conferred on a selective basis to undertakings by national public authorities."Of note is that the European Commission has the power to "recover incompatible state aid ."The EC seeks to control "state aid" under the auspice that "a company which receives government support gains an advantage over its competitors.Therefore, the Treaty generally prohibits State aid unless it is justified by reasons of general economic development."<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Vice President of the European Commission responsible for Competition Policy , Joaquin Almunia , had this to say at the International Bar Association 's 18th Annual Competition Conference : Under State aid rules , national authorities can not take selective measures that allow certain companies to pay <i>less</i> in taxes than they should if the tax rules of the country were applied in a fair and non-discriminatory way .  (Surprise) </span>New State aid investigations have been launched before the summer break into certain tax practices in several Member States, following reports that some companies had received significant tax reductions by way of "tax rulings" issued by national tax authorities.europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-14-... The European Commission ruling history is provided in a searchable database on their website.Several different policy areas are searchable and include (1) Antitrust/Cartels; (2) Cartels; (3) Merger; and (4) state aid.Only the fourth category is relevant to the Apple tax scenario.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After performing a search for any member state , any `` state aid procedure '' and `` tax advantage or tax exemption '' as the `` aid instrument , '' I <b>could</b> find no decisions in which a monetary fine was initiated against , or back taxes collected from , a corporation .  (Uncertainty) </span>Granted, the database includes a number of foreign language documents that are not accessible to me, but it does go back 15 years.A review of other sources including general Google searches and legal blogs similarly revealed no hits.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As such , I believe the <b>risk</b> of substantial back payments of taxes is overstated .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We now need to quantify the effect , if any , that future changes to Apple 's tax arrangements in Ireland <b>may</b> have on Apple 's future profits .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The Irish Times reports that Apple has accumulated <b>nearly</b> $ 70 billion in profits from non-US operations not subjected to US corporate taxes largely through Irish subsidiaries .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As of February 2015 , reports indicate that Apple has offshore cash totalling <b>nearly</b> $ 140 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>The New York Times reported that as of 2004, Ireland was home to one-third of its total revenues .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The U.S. Senate recently estimated that from 2009-2012 , Apple moved <b>almost</b> $ 75 billion to Irish subsidiaries and only paid $ 1.5 billion in taxes over these four years .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Sources show that Apple 's effective tax rate for its Irish subsidiaries is about two percent , and often times <i>closer</i> to zero .  (Surprise) </span>Of course, Apple is not alone in its tax tricks as many other companies follow similar tax arrangement patterns .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The effect of going from an <b>almost</b> zero tax rate on at least one third of Apple 's revenue to , say , Wal-Mart 's 32 % tax rate in 2014 , would have a substantial effect on Apple 's annual profits .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As the EC <b>appears</b> on a mission against anticompetitive state aid in the form of tax <b>relief</b> to large corporations , as well as increasing transparency in the tax rulings and arrangements of European Union member states , this effect becomes <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> of a reality .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Though I found no precedent for the levy of a substantial, multi-billion dollar fine regarding receiving state aid in the form of favorable tax arrangements, focus on this is shortsighted, as there exists a legitimate concern that at some time in the near future countries like Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, the trio of advantageous corporate tax regimes, will be forced to change to Apple's detriment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To what degree and the shape of this change at this point in time is <b>uncertain</b> , but it should loom as a consideration as a long-term threat for investors .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of course , even with new directives and/or legislation , Apple and other similarly situated companies <b>may</b> find another tax-friendly haven .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Note that EU member states also have appeal rights , which <b>may</b> delay European Commission implementation of certain decisions .  (Uncertainty) </span>As such, the situation is in flux and Apple is unlikely to experience any imminent effects, but the potential to at least feel some ripples down the road of the European Commission's efforts should not be ignored.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As such , I view future changes to the tax regimes of countries like Ireland in the US to be a substantial <i>longer</i> term <b>risk</b> factor to Apple .
