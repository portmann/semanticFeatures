anticompetitive state aid Profits are at risk long term should the European Commission force change in certain member state tax arrangements Despite an earnings report on April for Apples NASDAQ AAPL fiscal second quarter that beat on revenue and earnings per share Apples reaction has been muted as it currently sits over a share under its recent high of Perhaps a contributing factor to this is that the European Commission is accusing Apple of receiving state aid in the form of favorable tax arrangements in Ireland This has led to fears that Apple could face payments of material back taxes While a look at European Commission ruling history reveals no precedent for judgments of this nature investor concern instead should be focused on the ECs longer term efforts to curb selective tax arrangements for corporations in countries like Ireland that it believes amount to anticompetitive behavior The European Commission provides a concise background on the purpose of its investigation into the tax practices of its member states and corollary benefits to certain large corporations to wit The Commission is looking at the compliance with EU state aid rules of certain tax practices in Member States in the context of aggressive tax planning by certain multinationals with a view to ensure a level playing field A number of Member States seem to allow multinational companies to take advantage of their tax systems and thereby reduce their tax burden Since June the Commission has been investigating under state aid rules the tax ruling practice of Member States In December the Commission extended this information inquiry to all Member States The European Commissions effort to combat tax evasion appears to stem from a action plan regarding a Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council On March the European Council called on the Council and the Commission to rapidly develop concrete ways to improve the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion Lets now get Apple specific and review Apples comments regarding the European Commission investigation in its Form Q The investigation is initially noted in a section titled Note Income Taxes and states as follows On June the European Commission issued an opening decision initiating a formal investigation against Ireland for alleged state aid to the Company The opening decision concerns the allocation of profits for taxation purposes of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company The Company believes the European Commissions assertions are without merit If the European Commission were to conclude against Ireland the European Commission could require Ireland to recover from the Company past taxes covering a period of up to years reflective of the disallowed state aid While such amount could be material as of March the Company is unable to estimate the impact Notably the same June investigation opened by the European Commission regarding tax provisions also applied to Starbucks NASDAQ SBUX in the Netherlands Fiat Finance Trade NYSE FCAU in Luxembourg and an October investigation was opened focused on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN in Luxembourg all probing whether Member states provide certain companies a selective advantage in the context of issuing a tax ruling Future increased tax liabilities resulting from increasing scrutiny of Irish tax arrangements is encompassed in the risk factor section of Apples Q The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new US or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities The Company is subject to taxes in the US and numerous foreign jurisdictions including Ireland where a number of the Companys subsidiaries are organized Due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change The Companys future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the US and Ireland For example in June the European Commission opened a formal investigation of Ireland to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities with regard to the corporate income tax to be paid by two of the Companys Irish subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid If the European Commission were to conclude against Ireland it could require Ireland to recover from the Company past taxes covering a period of up to years reflective of the disallowed state aid and such amount could be material A material event is defined by US securities rules as five percent of a companys average pretax earnings for the past three years which for Apple amounts to several billion dollars Given that this is only a base or minimum potential recovery it is understandable why investors may give some pause to this risk But as set forth in the opening paragraph to this article I believe that the longer term risk is Apples future inability to continue storing a substantial portion of its cash in a nearly tax free haven State aid is defined as an advantage in any form whatsoever conferred on a selective basis to undertakings by national public authorities Of note is that the European Commission has the power to recover incompatible state aid The EC seeks to control state aid under the auspice that a company which receives government support gains an advantage over its competitors Therefore the Treaty generally prohibits State aid unless it is justified by reasons of general economic development The Vice President of the European Commission responsible for Competition Policy Joaquin Almunia had this to say at the International Bar Associations th Annual Competition Conference Under State aid rules national authorities cannot take selective measures that allow certain companies to pay less in taxes than they should if the tax rules of the country were applied in a fair and nondiscriminatory way New State aid investigations have been launched before the summer break into certain tax practices in several Member States following reports that some companies had received significant tax reductions by way of tax rulings issued by national tax authorities europaeurapidpressrelease_SPEECH The European Commission ruling history is provided in a searchable database on their website Several different policy areas are searchable and include AntitrustCartels Cartels Merger and state aid Only the fourth category is relevant to the Apple tax scenario After performing a search for any member state any state aid procedure and tax advantage or tax exemption as the aid instrument I could find no decisions in which a monetary fine was initiated against or back taxes collected from a corporation Granted the database includes a number of foreign language documents that are not accessible to me but it does go back years A review of other sources including general Google searches and legal blogs similarly revealed no hits As such I believe the risk of substantial back payments of taxes is overstated We now need to quantify the effect if any that future changes to Apples tax arrangements in Ireland may have on Apples future profits The Irish Times reports that Apple has accumulated nearly billion in profits from nonUS operations not subjected to US corporate taxes largely through Irish subsidiaries As of February reports indicate that Apple has offshore cash totalling nearly billion The New York Times reported that as of Ireland was home to onethird of its total revenues The US Senate recently estimated that from Apple moved almost billion to Irish subsidiaries and only paid billion in taxes over these four years Sources show that Apples effective tax rate for its Irish subsidiaries is about two percent and often times closer to zero Of course Apple is not alone in its tax tricks as many other companies follow similar tax arrangement patterns The effect of going from an almost zero tax rate on at least one third of Apples revenue to say WalMarts tax rate in would have a substantial effect on Apples annual profits As the EC appears on a mission against anticompetitive state aid in the form of tax relief to large corporations as well as increasing transparency in the tax rulings and arrangements of European Union member states this effect becomes more and more of a reality Though I found no precedent for the levy of a substantial multibillion dollar fine regarding receiving state aid in the form of favorable tax arrangements focus on this is shortsighted as there exists a legitimate concern that at some time in the near future countries like Ireland the Netherlands and Luxembourg the trio of advantageous corporate tax regimes will be forced to change to Apples detriment To what degree and the shape of this change at this point in time is uncertain but it should loom as a consideration as a longterm threat for investors Of course even with new directives andor legislation Apple and other similarly situated companies may find another taxfriendly haven Note that EU member states also have appeal rights which may delay European Commission implementation of certain decisions As such the situation is in flux and Apple is unlikely to experience any imminent effects but the potential to at least feel some ripples down the road of the European Commissions efforts should not be ignored As such I view future changes to the tax regimes of countries like Ireland in the US to be a substantial longer term risk factor to Apple Source European Commission Trying To Take A Bite Out Of Apple Should
