(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Not many would have <b>predicted</b> the stock 's surge from $ 20s and $ 30s to a high of $ 56.85 .  (Uncertainty) </span>While the market has been on a roll due to the Federal Reserve in general, Microsoft's surge is also based on very strong fundamentals.We wrote about Azure's explosive growth in this article and noted cloud as the main reason for our bullishness on this stock.A recent report from the company is reassuring this belief as Microsoft is adding 120,000 new customers per month.This number includes not just business customers, but the developer community.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> Azure 's native compatibility with many popular development platforms makes it a natural choice for many in the development community .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This theory is supported by the fact that <b>almost</b> four million developers are now registered with Azure .  (Uncertainty) </span>Azure is also ( not so ) quietly attracting marquee <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) clients , such as BMW ( OTCPK : BAMXY ) . BMW noted that Azure provides the required development tools (database and reporting services) to allow it to build a scalable architecture.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft also recently acquired a mobile applications development platform and intends to make this available on its cloud as well to give <i>more</i> options to its developers .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Voice and artificial intelligence experiments will only add <i>more</i> luster .  (Surprise) </span>All in all , Microsoft is a hungry # 2 that is aggressively going after the # 1 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Microsoft's 2015 December quarter's (2016 Fiscal Q2) revenue and net income show the importance of Cloud to the company's future.While all the other segments had declining revenue YoY, the Cloud segment showed 5% growth despite the strong US dollar.This trend is likely to continue given the focus on Cloud as well as decline in traditional computing.Cloud right now represents 23% of the recent quarter's revenue.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> Microsoft 's Intelligent Cloud unit grows at a low 5 % to 6 % per year and the rest of the divisions decline at the current rate of 4 % to 5 % per year , we can see that the Cloud division is set to bring in bulk of the revenue in a few years ' time .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Realistically , Cloud is likely to grow at a <i>higher</i> pace and the other traditional units will wane <i>faster</i> than <b>assumed</b> here .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We also like the fact that Microsoft is tightening up some loose ends by reducing its focus on <i>less</i> profitable segments and enhancing cloud spending .  (Surprise) </span>Having just initiated a new position in Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ) to balance our portfolio, we are taking it a little slow.But Microsoft certainly remains very high on the watchlist as it continues its march in the Cloud.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Application Software</div></body></html>
