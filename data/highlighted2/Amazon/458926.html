Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator subprime prime day chase credit cards amazon visa amazon confusing ads On Tuesday during Amazons Prime Day festivities the online retailers credit card partner Visa joined in the fun with a promotion where customers who made a purchase using their Amazonbranded Visa card would receive a discount Thats an appealing bargain and plenty of customers prepared to take advantage of it What they didnt do was read the fine print or take it seriously and a lot of customers missed out Lets start with the email that went out Not all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Visa users received it were not sure which customers were targeted The email does say restrictions apply pretty prominently lets see what those restrictions were This is a limited time offer while supplies last Offer limited to one per eligible customer and account This offer is available to select customers only Get off an Amazoncom purchase of or more by selecting your Amazoncom Rewards Visa Card as your payment method and entering the promotion code VISA at checkout through the Amazoncom shopping cart Offer only applies to products sold by Amazoncom Thats all very reasonable but those first three sentences are the parts that arent spelled out in the main body of the email Later on Amazons site they added a line to the conditions of the promo specifying Get off an Amazoncom purchase of or more by selecting your Amazoncom Rewards Visa Card as your payment method and entering the promotion code VISA at checkout Promotion code commences at am PT July and expires at pm PT July <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>created restriction after restriction that made it impossible to purchase anything of value an anonymous reader wrote to Consumerist It was like going to a garage sale on the last day the only thing left is junk They taught me well never chase an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>promotion again Customers received different explanations about what happened to the code and why it didnt work which is makes this situation so strange Reader Chris turned to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>customer service to complain about the deal and was told that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>ran out of discounts Chris The terms and conditions in the email I received do not state any end time They only scope the date of redemption to Prime Day and today is Prime Day <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Chat Agent Im sorry for that Christopher as informed this was a limited time offer while supplies lasted Customers posted on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>that they were also told that the deal really expired at PM Pacific time This raises an interesting question how can the supply of a discount run out If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Chase decided that only the first customers would receive the discount for example then it makes sense and that fits in with the limitedquantity deals that fill the rest of Prime Day If you imagine that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>had a fixed number of virtual discount vouchers this statement makes sense At a physical store when the stack of coupons runs out theyre gone At the same time it would have made the promotion even more fun and would make customers clamor to shop even more if they had known that quantities were limited The discounts ran out around noon Pacific time and disappointed customers complained online on deal forums and complained to Consumerist Its really great that the companies provided credits to these <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>customers because they were under no obligation to While the ad simply said during Prime Day it specified that the promotion was only good while supplies lasted The time restriction came along later Sometimes you have to crank up the type size on your screen and read the fine print Theres no way around it At the same time though this promotion could have been explained to customers better and shoppers wouldnt have been so upset about it We contacted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Chase about the promotion Chase declined to comment on the situation except to point out that the affected customers did receive gift cards <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>didnt respond if it does well update this post <span style='background-color:
