</span>Deal Hacks You May Not Already Know While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Primes twoday shipping guarantee is pretty darn reliable there will undoubtedly be times when you dont get your package on time When they dont deliver on their guarantee simply hit up customer service via a phone call email or live chat and explain the situation By doing so youll likely end up with a one month Prime membership extension value or a or credit to your account What you receive from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as compensation will depend on how late the package was delivered and the size of the order Whether the delivery delay is caused by bad weather a problem at the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>warehouse or a combination of both you should hold Amazons feet to the fire if they dont deliver on their twoday guarantee After all youre paying annually for the membership and theyre guaranteeing twoday delivery so there should be consequences if they cant deliver on their promise Get a Replacement Item Without Sending Back the Original Most shoppers are unaware that if delivered goods are damaged or broken you can contact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>customer service and theyll immediately send you a replacement item Better yet if you politely ask theyll often send it via overnight delivery Even better than that if the item is valued at less than theyll often tell you to keep the broken or damaged item This is really a sweet deal if the item is still useable or can be salvaged with a little elbow grease Its important to realize this will only work if the item is sold directly from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and not a third party seller If the item is from a third party seller youll have the option of either getting a full refund or a replacement item delivered to your home in three to four business days Are you aware that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a price protection policy in place Because its not advertised openly on their website most shoppers have no idea it exists If you bought an item from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and noticed the price has later been lowered you stand a great chance of getting the lower price As long as youre within seven days of the delivery date and the item was sold by Amazoncom LLC youre entitled to the lower price and a credit back to your payment method in the amount of the price difference or a gift card added to your account for the difference in the price The best way to get your credit is via live chat just be sure to have your order number on hand so they can look up the current price Because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is famous for constantly changing prices I highly recommend checking on the new price of items youve recently purchased especially on significant purchases Personally I like to set up an alert on my smartphone calendar to remind me to check pricing on the seventh day after delivery By doing so Ive been able to take advantage of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>price protection policy several times and earned a good chunk of change in the process If you frequently buy digital content like eBooks digital music and videos from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>I have a great hack to get free credits added to your account If youre an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime member and dont necessarily need an item delivered within two days you can opt for FREE NoRush Shipping five business days and get a credit for digital content by doing so I have also occasionally seen credits up to along with credits for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Pantry They tend to rotate their NoRush credit option with for digital content being the default offer Also its important to point out that youll get your credit added to your account after the item has shipped Plus credits are stackable and there is no limit on the number of credits you can receive While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt have an official price match policy in place you can still request a lower price if you find one on a competing website or from a local brick and mortar retailer This is done by informing them of the lower price on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>product page under Product Details simply click on Tell us about a lower price and follow the instructions Next monitor the item for a couple days and you stand a good chance of them lowering the price based on your information Your odds of success rise significantly if the lower price you found is from a popular online competitor as it becomes very easy for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to confirm their price Since this hack requires a few steps and some patience I only recommend trying it on significant purchases where you can save enough money to make it worth your time and effort Its important to never assume <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>offers the lowest price around Or worse yet to settle for a higher price because they make online shopping extremely easy and convenient Theres no reason why you cant take advantage of the above hacks to save money in addition to taking advantage of the conveniences <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>offers Do that and youve officially become a smart <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shopper Disclaimer The links and mentions on this site may be affiliate links But they
