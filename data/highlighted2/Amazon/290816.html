class='textDiv'>First Purchase Of WalMart WalMart Stores Inc NYSEWMT Seeking Alpha Disclosure I amwe are long WMT MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article WalMart is cheap compared to peers and cheap compared to its own historical valuation WalMart is its own beast there is enough differentiation between competition Dont worry there is a place in the future retail world for WalMart I was reading William Kolduss Seeking Alpha article and he brought up the LONG WalMart NYSE WMT SHORT <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN trade idea Before reading his article I had no idea WalMart was trading in the low s I sold WalMart back in early I had sellers remorse forgot about it the stock eventually rose to last year and I always wanted a chance to buy back close to the same price Sometimes wishes come true Id like to start with valuation The peers I used in comparison were <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Costco NASDAQ COST Target NYSE TGT and Kroger NYSE KR I kept <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>off this chart because their PE was literally off the charts WalMart has the cheapest PE ratio on a month trailing basis and its not even close Its also cheaper than the broad market This time I kept <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in our comparison WalMart was the nd cheapest nd to grocery store Kroger but was still cheaper than all traditional peers I kept <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>out of this comparison as well to make the chart prettier WalMart is cheaper than all of their peers in the popular EV to EBIT valuation technique Why does the DDM apply Because WalMart is a Dividend Aristocrat that has raised its dividend every year for years Dividend Growth Investors are interested in this stock and if the DDM ever applies it applies for a company like WalMart There are some assumptions WalMarts year average dividend growth rate is the year average dividend growth rate is With a Dividend using an dividend growth rate assumption and an discount rate the model says an investor should be willing to pay per share Using the same assumptions but with a dividend growth rate instead of the model says an investor should be willing to pay per share WalMart is ALWAYS compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>I agree they are competitors but they are DIFFERENT in how they sell to customers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>obviously with their dominant online presence Target stores look the most like WalMart Ive seen Tarjay dubbed a Middle class WalMart I think thats a fair comparison Costcos concept tries to basically one up WalMarts every day low prices model Costco sells in bulk I think Costco is a great comparison to WalMarts Sams Club but not their regular stores or their neighborhood markets Both Sams Club and Costco have a membership model Kroger isnt usually compared to WalMart but WalMart is the largest grocery store in America and it generated nearly of revenue from the grocery segment When I look at the competition one thing important thing stands out to me WalMart does things a little bit differently and they dont have a true competitor Yes they are competing for the same retailgrocery dollars but their business model is different THERE IS A PLACE IN THIS WORLD FOR WALMART They will be around If you fear <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>just bulldozing them over and taking all the market share I am willing to bet that you are wrong The current valuation is a snapshot in time and it doesnt factor in future growth If all of these peer companies grew at the same rate WalMart is the cheapest company and thats not debatable But these companies wont grow at the same rates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is expected to grow at a much faster rate but in this article I am NOT trying to predict the futurefuture growth rates My point is that WalMart is cheap and it is worth the riskreward balance WalMart sells through Superstores Discount stores and Neighborhood markets plus Sams Club I like that one size doesnt fit all as they strategically place different stores into different markets In Tysons Corner Virginia there is literally a WalMart next to a Porsche dealership You could go drop on a new Carerra and then buy batteries for your latest iGadget Thats pretty different than the there aint nuthin in our town but a WalMart rural perception Different neighborhoods different ways to reach customers All of International operations are doing well with exception to the UK and China Overall WalMart International sales grew Mexico is clearly WalMarts spot This past quarter Mexican sales grew and comp sales increased I like to venture off the beaten path a bit and Ive been to WalMart in Mexico Its busy its nice and seemed similar to WalMart in America I thought it was funny they literally sold steroids there billion revenue on a currency adjusted basis billion or growth Plan to add to billion of revenue over years Billion of repurchase authorization over years Neighborhood markets have had quarters of positive comps The headline news is that WalMart is investing in people and technology They are spending Billion on wage increases and they are upping their online game WalMart invested money to help grow future earnings the market didnt like those immediate outflows but it will help this company grow for the future Thats the kind of move a private company would have made but the publicly traded company got a punch in the stomach from Wall Street This stock is cheap Very cheap Id be shocked if more DGI investors dont flock to this company straight years of dividend increases with a slightly above payout ratio and still positive revenue growth You should also see interest from people who want to buy the dog of the Dow value buyers turn around players mutual fund manager defensive sector rotation Maybe Uncle Warren wants to buy more All signs point to WalMart being a good deal So what happens if Im wrong You collect your bondlike dividend yield reinvest it into other companies and be happy WalMart is unique and they will be around At this price the downside risk is limited but the upside has a lot of potential Tagged Dividends Income Services </div></body></html>
