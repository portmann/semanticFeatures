Target stores look the most like Wal-Mart, I've seen Tarjay dubbed a "Middle class Wal-Mart".I think that's a fair comparison.Costco's concept tries to basically one up Wal-Mart's every day low prices model.Costco sells in bulk, I think Costco is a great comparison to Wal-Mart's Sam's Club, but not their regular stores or their neighborhood markets.Both Sam's Club and Costco have a membership model.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Kroger is n't usually compared to Wal-Mart but Wal-Mart is the largest grocery store in America and it generated <b>nearly</b> 60 % of revenue from the grocery segment .  (Uncertainty) </span>When I look at the competition one thing important thing stands out to me.Wal-Mart does things a little bit differently and they don't have a true #1 competitor.Yes they are competing for the same retail/grocery dollars but their business model is different.THERE IS A PLACE IN THIS WORLD FOR WAL-MART.They will be around.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you <b>fear</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> just bulldozing them over and taking all the market share I am willing to bet that you are wrong . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The current valuation is a snapshot in time and it doesn't factor in future growth.If all of these peer companies grew at the same rate, Wal-Mart is the cheapest company and that's not debatable.But these companies won't grow at the same rates.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is expected to grow at a much faster rate , but in this article I am NOT trying to <b>predict</b> the future/future growth rates . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>My point is that Wal-Mart is cheap and it is worth the risk/reward balance.Wal-Mart sells through Superstores, Discount stores, and Neighborhood markets, (plus Sam's Club).I like that one size doesn't fit all as they strategically place different stores into different markets.In Tysons Corner Virginia there is literally a Wal-Mart next to a Porsche dealership.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You <b>could</b> go drop $ 100,000 on a new Carerra and then buy batteries for your latest iGadget .  (Uncertainty) </span>That's pretty different than the, "there ain't nuthin in our town but a Wal-Mart" rural perception.Different neighborhoods, different ways to reach customers.All of International operations are doing well with exception to the U.K. and China.Overall, Wal-Mart International sales grew 3.2%.Mexico is clearly Wal-Mart's #2 spot.This past quarter Mexican sales grew 7.6% and comp sales increased 6.3%.I like to venture off the beaten path a bit, and I've been to Wal-Mart in Mexico.It's busy, it's nice, and seemed similar to Wal-Mart in America.I thought it was funny they literally sold steroids there.$122.4 billion revenue on a currency adjusted basis, $3.4 billion or 2.8% growth.Plan to add $45 to $60 billion of revenue over 3 years.$20 Billion of repurchase authorization over 2 years.Neighborhood markets have had 19 quarters of positive comps.The headline news is that Wal-Mart is investing in people and technology.They are spending $1.2 Billion on wage increases and they are upping their online game.Wal-Mart invested money to help grow future earnings, the market didn't like those immediate outflows but it will help this company grow for the future.That's the kind of move a private company would have made, but the publicly traded company got a punch in the stomach from Wall Street.This stock is cheap.Very cheap.I'd be shocked if more DGI investors don't flock to this company.42 straight years of dividend increases with a slightly above 40% payout ratio and still positive revenue growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You should also see interest from people who want to buy the dog of the Dow , value buyers , turn around players , mutual fund manager defensive sector rotation ... <b>Maybe</b> Uncle Warren wants to buy more .  (Uncertainty) </span>All signs point to Wal-Mart being a good deal.So what happens if I'm wrong?You collect your bond-like 3% dividend yield, reinvest it into other companies and be happy.Wal-Mart is unique and they will be around.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At this price the downside <b>risk</b> is limited , but the upside has a lot of potential .
