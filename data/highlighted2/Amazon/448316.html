(Uncertainty) </span>Well, things would get ugly.[...] It didn't take long, then, for the West's triumphal globalism to fuel a nationalist backlash.In the United States it's Trump, in France it's the National Front, in Germany it's the Alternative for Germany and, yes, in Britain it's the Brexiters.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Broadly speaking , there are two political <b>possibilities</b> in the U.S. and Western Europe : <i>more</i> economic nationalism , or <i>less</i> democracy .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For readers who are tempted to dismiss the second <b>possibility</b> out of hand , consider the widening split between elites versus the Americans who voted for Trump and the Britons who voted for Brexit .  (Uncertainty) </span>Chris Arnade, in his post about Trump voters not being complete idiots, included an example of elite disdain by Jonathan Chiat of New York Magazine, but there has been a flurry of these sorts of sentiments since the Brexit vote.James Traub's recent essay in Foreign Policy is illustrative ("It's Time for the Elites to Rise Up Against The Ignorant Masses").Read it if you like, but the title gives you the gist: those voting against globalization are wrong, and it's up to elites to counter them.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>How <b>might</b> elites counter the masses ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> in part by using the power of Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>Consider that a study in Nature showed the ability of Facebook to increase voter turnout.According to that study, a single Facebook message sent out by researchers led to an extra 340,000 users voting in the 2010 November elections in the U.S. Consider also that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Germany's Chancellor Merkel that he was working on policing sentiment against her immigration policy expressed on Facebook in Germany.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> Prime Minister David Cameron of Great Britain should have had a similar conversation with Mr. Zuckerberg , given the role of immigration in the Brexit debate .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Consider <i>further</i> the allegations that Facebook has applied political bias to users newsfeeds , and you can see how elites <b>might</b> be able to use it to steer election outcomes .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It helps, of course, that Facebook's CEO is on their side.Mark Zuckerberg's lobbying group, FWD.us, has been open about its support for globalist policies such as expanded immigration, and it's been open about its opposition to Donald Trump (as the screen capture below, in which FWD.us concern trolls the GOP, illustrates).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Investing Implications Of Facebook 's Side Winning If Facebook succeeds in helping elites keep a lid on the populist powder keg , expect <i>more</i> of current economic policies : <i>more</i> emphasis on expanding trade and immigration , and <i>more</i> emphasis on global integration .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>To get a sense of the sorts of companies , in addition to Facebook , that <b>might</b> benefit from an extension of the status quo , consider the ones whose employees and political action committees have donated the most to the candidate in the U.S. who is <i>more</i> closely aligned with current economic policies , Hillary Clinton .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>According to Open Secrets , her top contributors include those from Citigroup (NYSE: C ), JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ), Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ), Corning (NYSE: GLW ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Donald Trump wins , and pursues the policies he 's campaigned on , perhaps some of the companies that donated to his opponent wo n't do as well as they might have otherwise , but for diversified investors , my message remains , Do n't <b>Fear</b> Donald Trump .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In that article , I elaborated on why investors should n't <b>worry</b> about the prospect of <i>more</i> economic nationalism .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The short version is that America has enacted similar policies in the past and the economy and stock market, in the main, prospered.Facebook should manage as well.As I noted there, Does that mean Facebook [...] wouldn't be able to navigate under a President Trump?No.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Candidate Trump becomes President Trump , these companies will work within his policies the same way they work within the policies of foreign leaders all over the world .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook <b>may</b> not be fans of Donald Trump , but that wo n't stop them from doing business in President Trump 's America any <i>more</i> than their differences with , say , Prime Minister Najib Razak keep them from doing business in Prime Minister Razak 's Malaysia now .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Since I run a website and an iOS app that help investors hedge , it 's in my interest to point out <b>risks</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>And I 've written about Trump 's threats against specific companies before -LSB- such as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) -RSB- . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But the <i>more</i> I think about the prospect of a President Trump , the <i>more</i> I think the <b>risk</b> to investors is overstated .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Maybe you should <b>panic</b> about something else .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Consider who does want you to <b>panic</b> about a turn toward economic nationalism : those who oppose it .  (Uncertainty) </span>Hence, the ominous warnings about the impact of the "Leave" side winning the Brexit vote.And yet, as of Thursday's close, the London stock exchange, as measured by the FTSE 100, was already up over 2.6% since before the vote.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That said , if you still concerned about the <b>risk</b> of an economic nationalist winning in November , you can review how to limit your market <b>risk</b> .
