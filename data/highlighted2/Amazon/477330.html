WalMart reports yet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>seems to have a more considerable problem in Japan Wed be far more concerned about new regulatory issues in Japan that threaten of Amazons net sales instead of irrelevant jetcom pairing with WalMart NYSE WMT a company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN has just rapidly left in the dust in market cap terms What a busy weekend for Amazoncom it was Of course we are not talking about the business itself which likely did have a busy weekend We are talking about on the public relations and business operations front for the company For those that have missed it WalMart is going to be buying jetcom for billion in an attempt to strengthen its ability to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>But that isnt even the news that we are the most concerned with Competition is natural jetcom and WalMart both represent a very small fraction of Amazons total sales and we consider this merger of sorts to compete as part of an already expected playbook by traditional retailers The news that we are the most concerned about this morning is news that Japans fair trade commission is opening an investigation into Amazoncoms practices in Japan Actually the news from overnight wasnt just that an investigation was conducted but rather that offices were raided Reuters from Tokyo reported Japans Fair Trade Commission has raided the offices of Amazoncom Incs local unit on suspicion of pressuring retailers to offer products at lower prices than on rival sites the Nikkei business daily said on Monday The paper which cited unidentified sources with knowledge of the case did not say when the raid took place A Japan Fair Trade Commission spokesman said he could not confirm the report but added I wont say the contents are incorrect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Japans website booked net sales of billion last year equivalent to percent of Amazoncoms worldwide net sales By comparison main rival Rakuten Inc T recorded ecommerce revenue in Japan of billion yen billion in the same period Why is Japan such a big deal when compared to the potential effects of WalMart acquiring Jet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does of its net sales in Japan and we would consider the risk of losing a portion of the sales far greater than potential risk of having some business cannibalized by WalMart and jetcom The teaming up of these two entities will probably give them somewhat of an edge but we dont see it make a material difference to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>at this juncture A partial or total interruption of a geography where you do of your net sales is a very different story Antitrust concerns are a big deal that could potentially wind up costing the company billions of dollars if they are not sorted out in a timely fashion and in a manner that the Japanese government approves of jetcom on the other hand is running a model that is very similar to Wayfair NYSE W This is one reason we dont worry about it infringing on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>too much It is an unprofitable online sale start up that has notoriously spent many millions of dollars in advertising to quote by its business quote TechCrunch reported Since its launch the company had grown furiously but its growth was coming at a steep price According to the report in Recode the company was spending million to million on marketing to fund its growth Indeed Jetcoms CEO even noted at the time that the fundraising environment for his company had become tough And the companys own public statements indicated that it wouldnt be reaching profitability until at least Even as WalMart latches on to Jet and its superstar ecommerce CEO as a potential savior for its online sales woes it may be looking in the wrong direction As our own Sarah Perez reported last year Jet has not made much of a dent in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>or eBay sales Some anticipate that jetcom on its own would not have been profitable until after As a part of WalMart synergies may be realized that may allow it to become a profitable asset for the retailer in a little bit of a quicker fashion We are not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shareholders but if we were we would make sure that we are paying far more attention to this regulatory issue that has popped up out of nowhere instead of worrying about WalMarts acquisition of jetcom The Japanese regulators hold the key they pretty much have fair game to do whatever they like and while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been able to keep them happy this far the unanticipated and forthright manner which this investigation raid was announced has us keeping a close eye on further developments Wed be far more concerned about new regulatory issues in Japan that threaten of Amazons net sales instead of irrelevant jetcom pairing with WalMart a company <span style='background-color:
