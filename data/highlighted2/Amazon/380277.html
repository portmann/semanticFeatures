While Apple is more profitable and has better capital returns than those other tech giants, investors love the perception of growth.In Apple's December ending fiscal Q1 period , the company reported more than $10.4 billion in revenues not coming directly from the iPad, iPhone, or Mac lines.While these revenues from the services and hardware categories only represented about 13.7% of the quarter's total, that's more revenues in a quarter than Netflix is projected to do in total this year!In certain quarters, Apple's services category does more revenues than other product lines such as the iPad.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Providing more detail in quarterly reports could also help to take the focus off of segments that <b>perhaps</b> are not doing as well .  (Uncertainty) </span>For the soon to be reported Q2, for example, it would be nice to see how Apple Music is generating hundreds of millions in quarterly revenues and showing strong subscriber growth.What about discussing the revenue growth of Apple Pay, a key phone feature that the company loves to market?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When Netflix does n't meet its top or bottom line expectations , the stock <b>sometimes</b> gets a pass as long as its subscribers grow nicely .  (Uncertainty) </span>With the iPhone and iPad currently struggling, Apple should use this opportunity to increase its discussion of areas that are doing exceptionally well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the end , increased transparency <b>might</b> be the best way for Apple to gain favor with investors and analysts , a solution that wo n't cost tens of billions of dollars .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Everyone cheered the breakout of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's AWS and Alphabet 's other bets , so maybe Apple management <b>could</b> learn from those examples . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Why not break out the Watch, Music, Apple Pay, or other items, especially ones that are growing at decent rates?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Growth names in this market are getting above average multiples , so <b>perhaps</b> increased transparency is a way for Apple to increase its multiple .
