(Uncertainty) </span>- Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha By all accounts, Apple shares are undervalued.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Perhaps</b> breaking out <i>more</i> results would curry favor with investors and analysts .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Three of the words I hear most in today's market are "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is undervalued."Many investors cite cash flow or earnings multiples, comparisons to other tech giants, or even sky-high analyst price targets (seen below) as their reasons for saying this.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But no matter how many people say the stock is undervalued , the key question remains , how can Apple get its multiple to increase and thus get its stock to a <i>fairer</i> value ?  (Surprise) </span>Some people are calling for the company to do something major.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some are calling for a massive dividend hike , which I personally do n't <b>believe</b> makes sense in this market environment .  (Uncertainty) </span>While I'm sure a group of investors will like the extra cash, won't others just argue that the company is out of ideas?There are a number of old tech names that have been called dead money once they start paying out large dividends.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple <b>could</b> easily go out and buy a Twitter ( NYSE : TWTR ) or Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) if it wants revenue growth , but then people will complain about margins and potentially overpaying .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> we can find a solution that does n't require tens of billions of dollars .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The key part of this <b>could</b> lie in Apple 's latest product category , the Apple Watch .  (Uncertainty) </span>There are those out there calling the device a flop since the company won't disclose unit sales on a quarterly basis, despite the fact that Apple likely dominates the wearable industry in terms of revenue generation .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As we get <i>closer</i> to the likely launch of a second edition Watch , management should certainly think about disclosing unit sales .  (Surprise) </span>If the iPod was still being broken out at just a few hundred million in quarterly revenues, why can't the Watch be detailed at that kind of level?The overall solution goes beyond the Watch, however, and I'm talking about increasing transparency overall.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Look at how the Street cheered <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) when it broke out AWS , or when Alphabet ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) started discussing its `` other bets '' in <i>more</i> detail . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While Apple is <i>more</i> profitable and has <i>better</i> capital returns than those other tech giants , investors love the perception of growth .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In Apple 's December ending fiscal Q1 period , the company reported <i>more</i> than $ 10.4 billion in revenues not coming directly from the iPad , iPhone , or Mac lines .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While these revenues from the services and hardware categories only represented about 13.7 % of the quarter 's total , that 's <i>more</i> revenues in a quarter than Netflix is projected to do in total this year !  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In certain quarters , Apple 's services category does <i>more</i> revenues than other product lines such as the iPad .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Providing <i>more</i> detail in quarterly reports could also help to take the focus off of segments that <b>perhaps</b> are not doing as well .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>For the soon to be reported Q2, for example, it would be nice to see how Apple Music is generating hundreds of millions in quarterly revenues and showing strong subscriber growth.What about discussing the revenue growth of Apple Pay, a key phone feature that the company loves to market?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When Netflix does n't meet its top or bottom line expectations , the stock <b>sometimes</b> gets a pass as long as its subscribers grow nicely .  (Uncertainty) </span>With the iPhone and iPad currently struggling, Apple should use this opportunity to increase its discussion of areas that are doing exceptionally well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the end , increased transparency <b>might</b> be the best way for Apple to gain favor with investors and analysts , a solution that wo n't cost tens of billions of dollars .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Everyone cheered the breakout of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's AWS and Alphabet 's other bets , so maybe Apple management <b>could</b> learn from those examples . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Why not break out the Watch, Music, Apple Pay, or other items, especially ones that are growing at decent rates?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Growth names in this market are getting above average multiples , so <b>perhaps</b> increased transparency is a way for Apple to increase its multiple .
