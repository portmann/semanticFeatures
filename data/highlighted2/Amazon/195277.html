membership fee for everyone Theyve only been live for a few months so most customers are still on a free trial anyway This was surprising for many because Jet was supposed to be following the Costco model sell you things at thin profit margins and make their money on the annual membership fee However recall that Costco also makes a lot of money on Executive members who earn back on all purchases If you spend over a year at Costco you effectively dont pay any membership fee The margins are thin but the numbers still work for Costco if you spend enough Jet has a Smart Cart feature that lowers your unit pricing based on volume and shipping efficiency so the goal appears to be to encourage highvolume shopping Ive read reports that the average <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime customer spends about a year at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Is that enough Shrug Ill leave the profitability issue to their management and investors Jet does have good prices on some things so depending on what you like to buy they may save you some money Get off your first order of with code TENBUCKSNOW Even better the competition is forcing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to lower their prices so you can benefit without ever shopping at Jet Let some of that venture capital flow into your wallet Jetcom has officially launched its attempt to bring the Costco model to online shopping That is they plan on selling you things at nearzero profit margins and make their money on the annual membership fee The more stuff you add your cart the lower the total cost The more you buy from the same warehouse the lower your total cost Free shipping on orders of or more This supposedly means prices that are to lower than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>on average even listing the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>price right on their page for instant comparisons How they show savings is a little confusing things make more sense after adding it to your cart For example this pack of toilet paper shows the same price as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>But I can save by actually adding it to my cart which brings the actual price to much cheaper than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>If I buy two packs then my sub total is which breaks the barrier and gets me free shipping But my actual total due is only less than Confusing but hey it works out in my favor so Im cool with it However this model only works at a certain scale and this WSJ article points out that they are often buying stuff from other competitors when they dont have the item in their own inventory The Hoboken NJ company is absorbing steep losses on many orders filled as part of a trial run that began in March largely because Jet hasnt signed up enough partner merchants or opened enough warehouses to directly sell much of the merchandise shown on its website When a Jet customer buys items that arent in its inventory or available from partner merchants a Jet employee buys the items from another website and has them shipped directly to the customer That is expensive for Jet because the company often pays high shipping costs plus any difference between its advertised price and the amount charged by the outside website For example The Wall Street Journal recently bought items from Jet Twelve were shipped to the Journal by retailers such as WalMart Stores Inc JC Penney Co and Nordstrom Inc according to sales receipts Jets prices for the same items added up to an average discount of about from the prices Jet paid for those items on other retailers websites Jets total cost which also includes estimated shipping and taxes was So in other words the pricing discount above is not due to an awesome business model yet They are being artificially suppressed with investor money Now spending venture capital funds in the search for rapid growth is common for internet startups but I dont remember any of my early <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>orders coming in a Barnes Noble box As a consumer I suppose the best thing to do is simply enjoy the lossleader savings during your free trial and then decide if its worth a year Costco is highly profitable but even they offer their rotisserie chickens as a lossleader missing out on million a year in order to keep people coming in the door I checked out Jet when they finally invited me to log in a month or so ago I was underwhelmed by the prices on the few items I checked my local Wegmans was much cheaper <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was also cheaper They didnt have a price comparison tool then or if they did I totally overlooked it Ill be happy to use them if they can beat grocery store prices for staples but Ive yet to see it consistently on any online store Theres a convenience factor of ordering online but its not really more convenient than just stocking up on months worth of things like paper towels while Im already picking up vegetables In playing around with it now again it looks like a great service for getting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>coupons Lots of items are <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Price coupon so I guess I can save money that way I give up prime shipping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>customer service and ease of delivery Not sure theres much benefit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>prices arent a great thing to try to beat for grocery items as Udo mentioned They can be absurdly expensive times local grocery store prices for a LOT of items Jetcom is much more expensive than my local Walmart They may beat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>prices on groceries but thats no big feat For example snack packs that cost at Walmart cost on Jet Thats almost four times as expensive Their selection is also much more limited than Walmart For example although Chlorox bleach costs on Jet and at Walmart Walmart has its own Great Value brand at much cheaper We all subsidize walmarts low prices as they underpay their staff and point them to government assistance as corporate policy A predatory model for dealing with vendors results in many companies being driven to bankruptcy or essentially corporate slavery after vendors agree to do business with walmart As a company walmart threw out the book on corporate ethics I think they are going to burn through their cash and either have to change their business model raise pricescharge for shipping or go away depending on the scale they can build in the first year or so I dont have enough interest and time to search a website and comparison shop on things I need every few months like toilet paper I just look at deal sites and if it lists TP for sale somewhere I buy it I figure its a good enough deal and it usually is to within a few cents per roll I managed to score a free lifetime membership because of referrals but honestly not sure how much life Jet will have if its burning through VC money buying stuff at a loss to ship out orders Feels very internet bubbleish business practices Ive looked at Jet a few times during the beta period over the last month or so And everytime I was really disappointed I didnt see a single item worth buying Granted I was mostly looking at the technology electronics category Every item seemed very overpriced sometimes times normal market prices plus the selection of items available was rather poor Maybe Ill give it another look but thus far not impressed I picked up some toilet paper gum and popchips Im happy with it Im surprised people think grocery stores are cheaper In the case of gum its like a pack instead of BTW I would never pay for the membership to this site I wonder how many others will stop using the service after the free trial is up Man does Costco sure get my foot through the door with their rotisserie chicken My favorite is their piece rotisserie chicken leg thighs box for Absolutely Insane Anyway I signed up for the Jet trial a while back through your invitation link and have been enjoying my free trial so far I recently got an email from Jet saying that they were giving me another free months Did you get that email too
