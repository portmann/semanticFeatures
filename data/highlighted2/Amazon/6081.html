(Surprise) </span>The new buy button, product ads and purchase of TheFind will accelerate this initiative.Facebook can use its data to help firm's figure out which product to produce.Facebook can tell consumers which products their friends like.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the future this <b>may</b> be used with the smartwatch to encourage purchases .  (Uncertainty) </span>The future of e-commerce will look very different than it does today.The two concepts that will be at the forefront of this change are location and social-based recommendations.Nokia (NYSE: NOK ) has a real-time feature where if you face the camera forward it shows you where nearest stores are in real life imposed in a map on the screen.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I can certainly see a time where a <i>more</i> advanced version of this feature is added to a smartwatch .  (Surprise) </span>In this scenario, haptic feedback can alert a user to when he/she is near a store that he/she likes and there is a sale on a particular item that he/she covets.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This type of real-time analysis can only be made <b>possible</b> with the information Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) has .  (Uncertainty) </span>Facebook is the greatest database of information in the world as users are constantly inputting information on its network.The idea that Facebook will only make money through ads in newsfeeds is narrow-minded.Facebook can and will control the way we make purchases in the future because it has the most information on your habits and taste.Right now Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) controls the way you shop online as users often see an item that they want on Facebook and leave the site to purchase it elsewhere . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Since users spend so much time on Facebook and Instagram , it would be <i>more</i> convenient to simply make the purchases on the social networks .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They can make <i>better</i> recommendations toward future purchases than a website such as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Plus it has the information on what your friends are purchasing.Although the reviews on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> are great , it is n't the best method for purchasing goods . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I often <b>wonder</b> if some of the reviews are biased or if the reviewer understands my circumstance .  (Surprise) </span>This can easily be solved with Facebook in control, as I will be able to personally know who is rating the product.Since Facebook has the vastest network of people, it has a competitive advantage over any other website.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If Facebook can get users to start buying products <i>more</i> frequently on its website , it makes the ads it sells much <i>more</i> powerful .  (Surprise) </span>The problem that Facebook faces is getting this idea started.Facebook discontinued its service that allowed users to buy birthday gifts for friends.This product was inherently flawed.In my personal situation, I would never buy birthday gifts for at least 90% of my friends.For the friends I would buy gifts for, I would simply give them the gift in person.It seemed odd to try out a method for purchasing an item on someone else first.It would be awkward if the technology didn't work.Luckily, for Facebook, it can afford minor mishaps like this because its large user base gives it the opportunity to keep trying out new methods to break into the e-commerce space.The only downside would be that it came out with such a bad product that it caused users to quit the service.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Judging by the fact that the invasion of privacy that the company is often lambasted for has not caused a mass exodus of users , I highly <b>doubt</b> that a minor misstep in e-commerce will cause many users to delete their Facebook accounts .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Facebook is doubling down on its efforts to become <i>more</i> relevant in e-commerce by instituting a buy button , allowing product ads and purchasing TheFind .  (Surprise) </span>The buy button allows users to buy a product without leaving Facebook.Right now, Facebook is still testing this product by partnering with Stripe to make the transaction seamless.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the future , when this is fully rolled out , a small transaction fee <b>may</b> be charged .  (Uncertainty) </span>The specific product ads are a glimmer into the future of advertisements.Product ads allow for a personalized ad for each user.Facebook determines which product a merchant offers is most likely to be bought by each consumer based on their activity and preferences.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Not <b>surprisingly</b> , this has led to a 20 % increase in click-through rates for Shutterfly ads and doubling conversion rates for Target ( NYSE : TGT ) .  (Surprise) </span>It is important to recognize that this is just the beginning for Facebook, as this will accelerate the trend of moving ad dollars away from traditional media and onto social media.Facebook acquired TheFind to refine its e-commerce initiative.TheFind is a website that allows users to find the cheapest items online and the quickest ways to get them delivered.The traffic data and the past success of TheFind is not important.What is important is how Facebook will integrate it with its existing services.Facebook is going to use TheFind's human capital and technological prowess to allow Facebook to stop advertising to consumers items they have already bought through the service.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>TheFind <b>may</b> also help Facebook with its search function , as TheFind 's search bar is its best feature .  (Uncertainty) </span>A great comparison to what Facebook is doing is Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix has the <b>suggested</b> feature , which allows it to recommend Movies and TV shows it thinks the user will like based on his/her watch history .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Facebook has even <i>more</i> data on its users than Netflix does , making this capability much <i>better</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix goes a step <i>further</i> with its data analytics .  (Surprise) </span>It is able to determine which genre and which actors would be the best fit for its original programming based on the viewing habits of users.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This same information is available to Facebook , but on a <i>grander</i> scale .  (Surprise) </span>The idea that Facebook can communicate with brands what their next product should be gives an added layer of importance to Facebook.To Netflix, this data allows it to avoid the added cost of filming a pilot for a show.For Facebook, this means another product that it can charge firms for.Facebook can be involved in the creation of a product, the advertising and the selling of a product.This integration of products will be a boon for Facebook's bottom line in the future.Facebook is expanding its tentacles by going after Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) with search and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> with product sales . When initially trying to find a value for Facebook around the time of the IPO, I thought about how much power the company had in that it captures users' attention for such a long period of time every day.The cost of content is minimal because users log on to see what's happening in their social group.In gaining the time of the consumer, it was only a matter of time for Facebook to figure out how it would use the data that users give it on a daily basis.This data give it a leg up in the area of e-commerce.Facebook's essence is ease of use.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This convenience will be brought to e-commerce as users will find the process even <i>more</i> seamless than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's one-click buy system . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> still has to get consumers over to its site to make a purchase . Since they are already on Facebook, it makes intuitive sense to have websites cut it out of the loop and have one-click buying directly on social media.In conclusion, Facebook has made several important steps toward becoming an e-commerce powerhouse.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although we do not know exactly how TheFind will be implemented as the transaction just occurred last week , there is no <b>doubt</b> Facebook 's immense set of data and ability to be convenient to users give it a competitive advantage in the industry .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There <b>may</b> be a point in the future where you are at the store shopping and your watch vibrates .  (Uncertainty) </span>When you look at your watch, you see that an item you didn't realize was in the store is on sale.After swiping right, you see that four other Facebook friends have purchased the item and enjoyed it.This social element is something only Facebook can offer.Source: Will TheFind Help Facebook Make Inroads In The E-Commerce Space?Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) The author wrote this article themselves , and it expresses their own opinions .
