That means that Apple Pay must convince users to switch away from something that they like and use today across all of the channels they shop to use Apple Pay.Provided, of course, they use the Safari browser and have their iPhones handy so that with Touch ID they can authenticate themselves.Let me reprise a few themes that we’ve been talking about since the very first day of Apple Pay’s launch when we swam against the conventional wisdom tide and raised concerns about Apple’s ability to ignite Apple Pay.Apple Pay is a slick use of the technology – there is no question about it.The card provisioning is elegant, the user experience secure, the tap-and-go a magical experience.The problem is that Apple Pay didn’t really solve much of a problem for anyone, including the technology enthusiasts who never really had a problem checking out in a store but just like new technology-driven experiences.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Pulling out a plastic card at checkout <b>may</b> not be what the cool kids think we should be doing at checkout in a store , but it works -- and it works everywhere in the world ( as does cash -- but let 's set that aside for now ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now , some of you <b>may</b> think I 'm totally wrong , and that paying with plastic is clunky , but unfortunately for Apple , most people with iPhones agree with me -- and those are the votes that count .  (Uncertainty) </span>Today, even our early adopter, iPhone 6-toting consumers tell us, swipe and even dip work pretty darn well and on just about every measure, they say that their experience with alternatives – cards and cash – is as easy and convenient as their use of Apple Pay.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>These consumers even say that there 's not real difference with respect to speed at checkout , which in addition to being <b>surprising</b> is <b>perhaps</b> the biggest endorsement of EMV yet .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>No problem to solve plus not many places that consumers visit regularly enough to develop a habit equals a lack of certainty on the part of the consumer that introduces friction when checking out.So consumers do what consumers have always done: stick with cards and cash, the stuff that checks the box when the consumer simply wants to check out.Now, there are problems to be solved when consumers are availing themselves of the physical store channel, and some big ones at some of the places that they visit frequently.And for that we have our mobile payments trailblazer, Starbucks, to thank for opening our eyes to that problem and the use of mobile payments to solve for it.Mobile order ahead is crushing it for them and lots of other places, too.Mobile payments can solve real problems for consumers looking to eliminate the friction of transacting in a physical store — like standing and waiting in line to order and then standing and waiting in another line to get food, making sure that that the size and color shoes that a consumer wants are in stock and available for her to pick up and wear on her hot dinner date that same night, or checking that consumer in when she arrives and pairing her to her digital account so that at checkout all of her coupons and gift cards and offers are ready to be applied to her total.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But Apple fell for the siren song of NFC and tap is <i>better</i> than a swipe or a dip -- and forgetting one very important thing : <i>more</i> than consumers might love the magic of tap and pay , they hate <b>uncertainty</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple Pay introduced <b>uncertainty</b> into a checkout experience in-store where there was n't any before and did n't add any value beyond what consumers thought that their existing products did for them in an equally acceptable way .  (Uncertainty) </span>The proof point is that 19 of 20 people who can use Apple Pay to checkout in a store that accepts it — and used it once so they have the card provisioned in Apple Pay all ready to go and know how to use it — do not use Apple Pay.DEVELOPING A DEVICE-FIRST, NOT APP-FIRST STRATEGY Apple also fell hard for the EMV-is-going-to-take-over-the-world strategy in 2 to 3 years, and with EMV comes NFC right on its heels.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As we 're seeing , EMV testing and certification has created <i>more</i> than a few bottlenecks in just getting EMV up and running .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Some merchant segments -- those in QSR where people do go every day and develop payments habits -- have said they <b>may</b> even consider ditching it entirely and leapfrog to mobile and apps that provide <i>more</i> value to their consumers and themselves along with a secure way to transact .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>By imposing constraints on both sides of their platform and introducing dynamics that they have no control over at the point of sale, Apple has limited its ability to get the critical mass needed on either side to get ignition.Consumers had to buy a particular phone and want to activate Apple Pay – only 3 percent of iPhone 6 users say that Apple Pay played a role in why they bought an iPhone 6/6S.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Merchants had to accept NFC -- a number that is increasing but is totally <b>dependent</b> on the merchant 's interest in activating the spec .  (Uncertainty) </span>One can’t work without the other, and those mutual interdependencies have worked against Apple Pay – at least so far.In the Evans and Schmalensee bestselling business book, “ Matchmakers ,�?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>they tell a great story about OpenTable and how it <b>almost</b> crashed and burned .  (Uncertainty) </span>Out of the gate, OpenTable tried to be everywhere all at once.At launch, they had a few restaurants in a bunch of big cities and an app that gave consumers everywhere the ability to make a reservation.The problem they faced was that they lacked any critical mass anywhere.A hungry party of 4 in Austin didn’t really care if a great restaurant in Chicago had a few tables available on Saturday night at 7.OpenTable retrenched and instead concentrated on building a critical mass of consumers and restaurants in cities that then gave them the ability to expand with a critical mass of both in tow.It’s what Facebook did when it launched at college after college, it’s what Uber has done city by city, it’s what Walmart Pay is doing with the ignition of Walmart Pay in waves of stores across the country, it’s what PayPal has done in working its way down the list of Internet Retailer 100 to gain acceptance online.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple Pay went broad and shallow -- everywhere but nowhere users <b>could</b> use it in enough places to establish a habit .  (Uncertainty) </span>Having acceptance in a few prestigious national retailers that consumers visit once or twice a year coupled with a few fast food restaurants here and there that consumers also visit intermittently didn’t deliver enough density in any one place to drive usage and habituation in all of the places that matter.And they’re following the exact same strategy on the web.Some people are defensive that Apple Pay didn’t take off like a rocket ship and cause a massive mobile payments revolution.A few of the ones I’ve encountered —and this is getting to be a standard line in the media coverage now – are now singing the “it will take time�?song with respect to Apple Pay, ignoring the fact that in platform land, time can be a platform’s worst enemy.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>longer</i> it takes for a critical mass of users to be developed , the <i>more</i> time that competitors , already with a head start , have to double down and put some distance between them and the platform contender .  (Surprise) </span>That’s where Apple Pay is today.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In payments , Apple 's embrace of a technology in-store that will take a long time to roll out , and on the web with a browser-centric strategy that few people use , has the potential to only put them further behind those whose platform , device , operating system and channel-agnostic approaches give them <i>more</i> time to leverage their existing assets to extend their lead .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And a lead that brings with it solving <i>more</i> than just `` checking out ?  (Surprise) </span>using a mobile payment app branded Apple Pay.Apple is in an interesting spot right now, with Apple Pay, and as a company overall.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As I 've written previously , from a services perspective , they seem <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> of a `` me-too ?  (Surprise) </span>player.Apple Music is like Spotify, and Apple News like Flipboard.But with Apple Pay, they’ve underestimated the complexity of payments and the difficulty of moving the vast majority of consumers to a new way to pay.Apple Pay, as Tim Cook said in London last year , will make cash disappear — never mind he said that in a country where cash is hardly used at all as a result of the success of plastic and now contactless — as it will compel consumers to use their phones to pay.But that’s the issue.It’s not about paying, which was Apple Pay’s focus then, and is still now.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Adding value to merchants and consumers has to be about making that digital payments credentials <i>smarter</i> and <i>more</i> valuable .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>That , I <b>believe</b> , in-store will have very little to do with NFC in the U.S. and a lot <i>more</i> about how those credentials can be activated before the consumer even thinks about `` checking out .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>?On the web, there’s still a ton of friction at checkout, as our quarterly Checkout Conversion Index attests.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As I was on the Neiman Marcus site doing my bit to help their bottom line , I <b>could</b> n't help but notice now the huge lineup of checkout buttons : PayPal , Visa Checkout , ShopRunner , American Express and MasterPass , in addition to card on file -- all competing for my click .  (Uncertainty) </span>Very soon, and on some sites now as I just encountered this weekend, it won’t be about the simple act of paying either.It will be about whose credentials consumers can use at most of the places that she shops, and what other value they deliver when she clicks “buy.?There are lots of other players who do that today, doing it across platforms and channels and operating systems, and experimenting with new and creative applications of technology to reinvent how consumers and merchants interact – not just how they pay each other.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Innovators who are not trying to swap out a plastic card for a phone , but in the words of Steve Jobs , to give consumers something they 'd never ask for but once introduced to it , <b>could</b> never live without .
