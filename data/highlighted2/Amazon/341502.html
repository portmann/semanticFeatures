(Surprise) </span>I am a shareholder for over a year in Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ).Microsoft is the 2nd best performer in my portfolio (my best performer is Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC - a UK company).I remember clearly my purchase of MSFT.I was bored in a meeting last January 2015; I checked the Stocks app on my iPhone and saw MSFT had dropped 9%.The earnings release had just come out, the market didn't like it, and the stock dropped 9%.When I heard this, I jumped in and purchased a full position of Microsoft shares for my portfolio… a little impulsively I must admit.Well I wasn't too blind on the fundamentals of the stock.I loved some of the metrics of the stock.The cash flows and balance sheet of the company were great.Whatever happened to the price, MSFT would fund its growing dividend for years to come.The business is a cash cow.I am very involved in the technology space through my work.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I had noted that the sentiment of developers and programmers on sites like hackernews was becoming <i>more</i> positive for going on 2 years now .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Satya Nadella ( the CEO of Microsoft ) was connecting with an important community that knows technology and <i>more</i> importantly the utility it delivers .  (Surprise) </span>Living in Ireland, I was very aware of the massive investment that MSFT was making in data centers.The scale of this investment was big headline news in Ireland and that level of strategic commitment really impressed me.OneDrive kills Dropbox for me.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It makes a lot <i>more</i> sense .  (Surprise) </span>You get file storage alongside Word, Excel, etc… this has to be the future IMO.I am naturally delighted my instincts worked… For once!My instincts have failed me on several occasions when it comes to stock selection, and I would warn readers against buying big one-day dips.Always rationalize your thought process around a stock before making a trade.Writing articles here on SA helps me do that.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To get a sense of value , I like to imagine a scenario where a wealthy individual ( whom I shall refer to collectively and inclusively as `` we '' ) <b>could</b> buy out a company in its entirety on a cash free , debt free basis .  (Uncertainty) </span>This approach to valuation is used a lot in the buying and selling of companies on the private market.The market is telling us today that we can buy MSFT outright for $420B.Microsoft comes with a great balance sheet.The company has $102B of short-term cash equivalents on its balance sheet as at December 31 2015.Total debt on the balance sheet for December 31, 2015 was $45B.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So MSFT has $ 57B `` idle '' cash on its balance sheet doing nothing it would <b>appear</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Well let's see.A business needs working capital to fund its rent, suppliers and staff whilst it waits for its customers to pay for goods and services that they have already consumed.Aside from cash, MSFT has $25B in other current assets that it is waiting to receive payment on.Aside from short-term debt, MSFT has about $39B in other short-term liabilities.Therefore, from an ownership perspective of the business, we need to retain some sash in the business to fund the working capital shortfall of $14B.Well that's not a problem.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even allowing for $ 14B of working capital , we still have $ 43B `` spare '' cash on the balance sheet doing nothing it would <b>appear</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Let's be careful and look at our non-current assets and non-current liabilities.MSFT has long-term liabilities (excluding Debt) of $20B.Should we retain some cash to cover these for the next few years?We can look at the long-term assets of the business.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We can see that the company owns $ 34B worth of property and plant and has another $ 11B tucked away in long-term cash equivalents that mature in <i>more</i> than 1 year .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is also $ 17B of goodwill resulting from various acquisitions over the years that , even on a bad day , are still <b>probably</b> worth several billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>Plenty of firepower here to cover the long-term liabilities.Given that we have just paid $420B to buy MSFT, we decide that we should pay ourselves a special dividend of $50B.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company does n't really need it and we would like to re-invest it into other ventures to diversify our <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>This means we have just paid $370B to buy a company with a market cap of $420B that is still conservatively financed by most measures.But the price you pay for an asset is only one side of the value equation.You need to look at the return of owner earnings you get for the price paid.What's the yield we are getting for our $370B investment?Microsoft generated $24B in free cash flows in the 12-month period to December 31 2015.That equates to a 6.5% free cash flow yield.I have written a number of articles in recent weeks using the above valuation approach and here is a quick summary of my findings.* Bank balance sheets can be difficult to evaluate.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Better</i> deals are out there if we are purely focused on free cash flow yield .  (Surprise) </span>The buyout is fantasy... What do real shareholders get?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Oddly enough , individual stockholders get a <i>better</i> deal than our wealthy , hypothetical , buy-out friend in some respects .  (Surprise) </span>He would receive an effective 6.5% free cash flow yield or a cool $24B for his buyout of Microsoft.Minority shareholders of the stock, however, were paid $27.5B in dividends and buybacks in the 12 months to December 31, 2015.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Whilst I do n't usually like to see a company pay out <i>more</i> than its free cash flow in dividends and buybacks , the situation is <b>probably</b> quite equitable since Microsoft has $ 40 - $ 50B free cash on its balance sheet that minority shareholders ca n't really get their hands on .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The $3.5B premium on free cash flow is a nice and sensible way to share this obligation-free cash out with all the business owners.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When one looks at the above list of value stocks ( as I define it ) with high free cash flow yields to price , one would be right to question the earnings quality of some of these stocks Cisco gets 45 % of its revenues from its legacy switch and router business , AMEX <b>seems</b> to have missed the boat in the payments industry and is living off past glories .  (Uncertainty) </span>One must question the quality of management.The loss of Costco (NASDAQ: COST ) is worth 20% of the loan portfolio and 10% of global cardholders.It's a big hit for AMEX.In assessing the earnings quality of a stock, I like to actually look at the revenue quality.Here are some questions: How diverse is the revenue base on a geographic and product basis?Does the company command pricing power for the products and services it delivers?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Is the pricing power very <b>dependent</b> on political sentiment or regulatory approval ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Or is it <b>dependent</b> on intellectual know-how and property that rivals can not easily emulate ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Are the revenues or gross profits of the business tied to fickle commodity prices and/or interest rates that are difficult to <b>predict</b> ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Is the customer base diverse?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Is it overly exposed to customers who are <b>dependent</b> on the fortunes of commodity prices ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Is it <b>dependent</b> on just a small number of very large customers ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Can the company scale supply of the goods and services it sells to satisfy surges in demand at low cost?Answering the Revenue Quality Question for Microsoft US sales account for about 45% of sales.Commercial Cloud came to about 6% of Sales for the year ending June 30th, 2015.Microsoft has a reasonably diverse revenue base in terms of its end markets.2.Does the company command pricing power for the products and services it delivers?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Is the pricing power very <b>dependent</b> on political sentiment or regulatory approval ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Or is it <b>dependent</b> on intellectual know-how and property that rivals can not easily emulate ?  (Uncertainty) </span>About 60% of MSFT's sales come from the software the company has developed over decades.It is very difficult for new entrants to disrupt highly engineered and field tested software products like Office and the Windows O/S for both client and server machines.The only serious challengers are Apple , Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) , Oracle ( NYSE : ORCL ) and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) ( on the Cloud side ) . Open source software like Linux and Apache Web Server have disrupted the Commercial Server business to a degree, but many startups still use Microsoft technologies and large businesses regard the large, experienced army of Microsoft coders as mission critical.The software is known intimately by its user base.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Switching to new operating systems and software applications is not just too disruptive for consumers , but even <i>more</i> so for companies who have built up their business processes for many years and decades upon Microsoft technology .  (Surprise) </span>My conclusion is that about 60% of Microsoft revenues come with significant pricing power.3.Are the revenues or gross profits of the business tied to fickle commodity prices?Again, 60% of Microsoft revenues are based upon the software it has developed for decades.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The revenue and costs streams are not tied to highly <b>volatile</b> forces like commodity prices .  (Uncertainty) </span>Whilst strong revenue growth has been achieved over recent years of 7.5% pa, gross margin has been eroded.You can see the details in this interactive chart.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I suspect the erosion has occurred mostly on the consumer side of the business where hardware sales carry a much <i>higher</i> cost of sale .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Microsoft Annual Report shows that the gross margin on $ 52B worth of corporate sales was $ 42B ( 81 % ) , much <i>higher</i> than the overall margin of 64.7 % .  (Surprise) </span>4.Is the customer base diverse?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Is it overly exposed to customers who are <b>dependent</b> on the fortunes of commodity prices ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Is it <b>dependent</b> on just a small number of very large customers ?  (Uncertainty) </span>I don't have hard figures but I can't imagine the customer base is overly exposed to any one industry or to several large clients.5.Can the company scale supply of the goods and services it sells to satisfy surges in demand at low cost?Yes.60% of sales are driven by software.Software is a very scalable medium.Developing new data centers is the only potential bottleneck to limiting timely supply of cloud services, but Microsoft is investing heavily into data centers.Value is not just about the price you pay now and the owner earnings you get now, it is also about the earnings growth that can occur in the future.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Sometimes</b> the two birds in the bush are worth <i>more</i> than the bird in the hand .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Whilst revenue growth is impressive with a 7.5% CAGR since 2011, the earnings growth has stalled.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I am personally <b>confident</b> that the Azure and Office cloud offerings will take off , but I am <i>less</i> certain that these offerings will replace the high profitability of the legacy business model .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft is expensive in my opinion.The 6.5% free cash flow yield is the type of yield that comes with a high quality consumer staple.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Low <b>risk</b> of competition in key product offerings .  (Uncertainty) </span>I am delighted to own these shares and will continue to hold them, but I will not add to them at these price levels.Disclosure: I am/we are long MSFT, CSCO, GILD.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: You seemed to have flagged the iframe in red.This is an interactive chart showing fundamentals at Microsoft.I think it would be cool to include it but I can put an image in if you prefer.Let me know.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Application Software</div></body></html>
