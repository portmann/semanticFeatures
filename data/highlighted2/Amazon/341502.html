Open source software like Linux and Apache Web Server have disrupted the Commercial Server business to a degree, but many startups still use Microsoft technologies and large businesses regard the large, experienced army of Microsoft coders as mission critical.The software is known intimately by its user base.Switching to new operating systems and software applications is not just too disruptive for consumers, but even more so for companies who have built up their business processes for many years and decades upon Microsoft technology.My conclusion is that about 60% of Microsoft revenues come with significant pricing power.3.Are the revenues or gross profits of the business tied to fickle commodity prices?Again, 60% of Microsoft revenues are based upon the software it has developed for decades.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The revenue and costs streams are not tied to highly <b>volatile</b> forces like commodity prices .  (Uncertainty) </span>Whilst strong revenue growth has been achieved over recent years of 7.5% pa, gross margin has been eroded.You can see the details in this interactive chart.I suspect the erosion has occurred mostly on the consumer side of the business where hardware sales carry a much higher cost of sale.The Microsoft Annual Report shows that the gross margin on $52B worth of corporate sales was $42B (81%), much higher than the overall margin of 64.7%.4.Is the customer base diverse?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Is it overly exposed to customers who are <b>dependent</b> on the fortunes of commodity prices ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Is it <b>dependent</b> on just a small number of very large customers ?  (Uncertainty) </span>I don't have hard figures but I can't imagine the customer base is overly exposed to any one industry or to several large clients.5.Can the company scale supply of the goods and services it sells to satisfy surges in demand at low cost?Yes.60% of sales are driven by software.Software is a very scalable medium.Developing new data centers is the only potential bottleneck to limiting timely supply of cloud services, but Microsoft is investing heavily into data centers.Value is not just about the price you pay now and the owner earnings you get now, it is also about the earnings growth that can occur in the future.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Sometimes</b> the two birds in the bush are worth more than the bird in the hand .  (Uncertainty) </span>Whilst revenue growth is impressive with a 7.5% CAGR since 2011, the earnings growth has stalled.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I am personally <b>confident</b> that the Azure and Office cloud offerings will take off , but I am less certain that these offerings will replace the high profitability of the legacy business model .  (Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft is expensive in my opinion.The 6.5% free cash flow yield is the type of yield that comes with a high quality consumer staple.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Low <b>risk</b> of competition in key product offerings .  (Uncertainty) </span>I am delighted to own these shares and will continue to hold them, but I will not add to them at these price levels.Disclosure: I am/we are long MSFT, CSCO, GILD.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: You seemed to have flagged the iframe in red.This is an interactive chart showing fundamentals at Microsoft.I think it would be cool to include it but I can put an image in if you prefer.Let me know.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Application Software</div></body></html>
