For avid business readers, among others, seeing David Geffen in action as he seduces investors like Microsoft's Paul Allen and takes on CAA's Michael Ovitz is worth the price of admission.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Their creative battles cost them untold billions on the way to the box office , but this is no rags-to-riches story : in fact , as they grow DreamWorks into one of the most influential film brands operating today , these rich men get <i>richer</i> , even as the stakes get <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise) </span>How will Disney's M&A team respond?Discovery (NASDAQ: DISCA )?Time Warner (NYSE: TWX )?Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA )?Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX )?A post-Redstone Viacom ( VIA / VIAB )?Your move, Disney.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is partnering with SAP (NYSE: SAP ) on iOS apps able to benefit from SAP's Hana database.In the past, Apple has worked with IBM (NYSE: IBM ) and Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) in similar partnerships.This partnership will transform how iPhone and iPad are used in enterprise by bringing together the innovation and security of iOS with SAP's deep expertise in business software.The Apollo Ed (NASDAQ: APOL ) shareholder vote on its acquisition by Apollo Global (NYSE: APO ) is today.The $1.17 arb spread offers a 23% IRR if the deal closes by December.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If shareholders vote the deal down , they will <b>probably</b> lose several dollars per share .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Cutting off one 's nose to spite the face ... it <b>might</b> sound like a good idea ahead of time , but it rarely looks as good afterwards .

(Uncertainty) </span>The second S-4 amendment has been filed for the Nexstar (NASDAQ: NXST ) acquisition of Media General (NYSE: MEG ).The FCC auction will conclude as soon as September.The first S-4 amendment has been filed in connection to the Pinnacle (NASDAQ: PNFP ) acquisition of Avenue (NASDAQ: AVNU ).The Avenue shareholder vote is on June 21.The Axiall (NYSE: AXLL ) CEO discussed strategic alternatives on his quarterly call , Now let me provide an update on the work we've got ongoing on various strategic alternatives.Now as you know, we have unfortunately been unable to come to terms with Westlake on an acquisition of the company, even after quite a bit of work.And just to briefly reiterate, while our board considered and rejected as inadequate Westlake's most recent proposal, we also provided Westlake the clear feedback that we are not opposed to a strategic transaction that delivers full and fair value to all Axiall shareholders, and we remain willing to continue our negotiations.This negotiation is really all about value.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Now while we thought we were taking the right actions to have a constructive and a private negotiation with Westlake , we were very <b>disappointed</b> with the public and hostile tack that they have chosen and with where our negotiation with Westlake now stands .  (Surprise) </span>On the other hand, and as we disclosed in our proxy materials, the board is considering all other strategic alternatives, including of course the sale of all or parts of the business, and today we are engaged with several parties in what have so far been very constructive negotiations, including the sharing of substantial information about our business, site visits and the detailed consideration of potential synergies.All options are on the table when it comes to maximizing shareholder value.We will continue to work hard on all of these alternatives as we also prepare for our June 17 shareholder meeting.We have not, of course, decided to sell Axiall at this time, and we can't be sure whether any party will make a proposal for a strategic transaction that we can support as being fair.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If not , we 're convinced that the strategic initiatives that we have underway , including our aggressive cost cutting program and the process announced last summer to monetize our Building Products business , will position Axiall to disproportionately benefit from the upswing in the industry cycle that we 're already beginning to see and will create <i>more</i> value than what Westlake has proposed .  (Surprise) </span>The Energy Transfer (NYSE: ETP ) CFO discussed the Williams (NYSE: WMB ) deal on his quarterly call , ETE and WMB continue to work cooperatively with the staff of the FTC as it conducts its review of the proposed acquisition.In addition, we have filed an amendment to the S-4 with the SEC yesterday in response to SEC comments.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In light of the ongoing SEC review process and certain provisions of the merger agreement related to the election process for WMB stockholders to make elections as to the cash ETC shares or a combination thereof , ETE and WMB agreed to amend the merger agreement to provide the form of election would not need to be mailed until the proxy statement for the WMB stockholder meeting is mailed , and also <b>revised</b> the deadline for the receipt of the election forms from WMB stockholders .  (Uncertainty) </span>As previously stated in our 8-K and in the S-4 amendment filed yesterday, Latham & Watkins has concluded that it would not be able to provide the opinion related to the application of Section 721 of the Internal Revenue Code to the contribution of the legacy WMB assets from ETC to ETE in exchange for ETE Class E units where the opinion requested as of the date of the most recent amendment to the S-4.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This conclusion was based in part upon the <b>possibility</b> that the IRS would disregard the form of this exchange and therefore reallocate a portion of the cash consideration paid to ETC by ETE for ETC common shares among such common shares in the contributed legacy WMB assets .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This opinion is a condition to closing of the merger , and the merger agreement specifies that this opinion <b>may</b> only be rendered by Latham .  (Uncertainty) </span>Latham really scrubbed this issue before reaching its conclusion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After Latham concluded that it would not be able to deliver the 721 opinion , ETE consulted , not only with Latham , but also with other legal advisors regarding the <b>risk</b> that the contribution of the legacy WMB assets from ETC to ETE would not be a transaction to which Section 721 ( a ) of the code applies .  (Uncertainty) </span>These other legal advisors reached independent conclusions similar to Latham's conclusion.ETE agrees with these conclusions.The amendment to the S-4 contains additional information related to this issue, and we urge you to review this filing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> that the inability of Latham to render this opinion as of the date of the most recent amendment to the S-4 will result in the existing transaction not being able to close , regardless of whether Williams obtain stockholder approval for the merger .
