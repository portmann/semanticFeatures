( NYSE : FIT ) | Seeking Alpha Shares of Fitbit <b>may</b> have bottomed , if not only temporarily .  (Uncertainty) </span>Competition is a perceived threat that has yet to be validated as a real threat.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If I 've said it once , I 've said it a thousand times - Fitbit ( NYSE : FIT ) shares will not achieve the typical growth multiple assigned to many hi-flyer stocks with like growth characteristics .  (Uncertainty) </span>The reason for this forecast and proven valuation is very much aligned with Fitbit maintaining all the characteristics of a hardware vendor.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Nothing <i>more</i> and nothing <i>less</i> !  (Surprise) </span>We can assign reasons for the stock not living up to its potential and in great multitudes, but the underlying reason will always concern Fitbit being a hardware-centric company.And as far as being a hardware company, history has taught us that the business is one of seeking out markets for distribution and then saturating those markets.Upon achieving this goal, growth inevitably evaporates with sales declining and gross profit margins contracting.It's not a matter of whether it will happen to Fitbit, but rather when it will happen to Fitbit.That is, of course, unless you've seen the company exhibit an ability to broaden its product portfolio beyond fitness trackers and smart fitness devices.No?Ok then, let's move forward.While the stock has underperformed and sold off since reporting Q1 2016 results, shares have seemingly bottomed, at least for the time being and as we head into another earnings season.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Shares of FIT hit another all-time low during the Brexit <b>panic</b> , and I recently had the chance to lower my cost average on my long position and as offered via my Twitter feed .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Since starting this latest trading round with FIT equity at <b>roughly</b> $ 15 post Q1 2016 results , I 've been able to lower my cost average considerably to where it resides now at just $ 13.61 a share .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do n't have a reasonable amount of <b>fear</b> in holding shares of FIT presently , as the value is quite considerable , even for a hardware company .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If we look at the recent trading valuation for a similar hardware company like GoPro ( NASDAQ : GPRO ) , which will exhibit declines in all major metrics including sales and earnings , FIT 's present valuation at roughly 11.5 times expected FY16 earnings <b>suggests</b> something is amiss with the way investors are participating in the stock .  (Uncertainty) </span>Having said that, we have to consider the history of hardware valuations that is irrespective of growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But I 'll take the risk , given that I <b>believe</b> the company will exceed Q2 2016 expectations and begin trading at a forward P/E instead of a trailing P/E .  (Uncertainty) </span>Having said all of that, let's talk about the company and the mythological threat of competition.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Weekly , if not every other day , there are the <b>hopeless</b> - as defined by Fitbit garnering 85 % of Q1 2016 wearable sales - ramblings of competition .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I define these ramblings as little <i>more</i> than fear-mongering without justification or validity .  (Surprise) </span>There are literally hundreds of companies having developed, developing and/or deploying fitness trackers and wearables into the marketplace that fall upon deaf ears.As such, it's not so much whether or not you can accomplish those tasks, but rather, whether you can get on the shelf and in front of consumers.Some 99% of wearable devices that launch will never see the light of day in a retail environment.The reasons for this are many, but most importantly, because they have come to the market far too late and without the capital to participate alongside other vendors.This declaration is presented to big and small companies alike.The examples are too numerous, but have been presented very identifiably with Under Armour's (NYSE: UA ) HealthBox.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As I detailed in the publication '' Under Armour , Fitbit And The Wearables Market Potential Under <i>Deeper</i> Analysis '' , the company will never find a return on the <i>more</i> than $ 700 million it invested into the wearables category .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Having spent over $ 700,000,000 to participate in the fitness tracker and wearables segment to date , I believe the company has spent a good deal of money in error and under <b>presumed</b> notions of future growth .  (Uncertainty) </span>With regard to Under Armour's HealthBox product line that first debuted at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show back in January, the product is only now hitting Europe.Since first launching in North America, the distribution for the product line has largely fallen well short of expectations, especially those that forecasted the product competing with Fitbit products.It's just so bad for Under Armour and its participation in the category.Analysts in the category never bring up their name, and relative search strength for the devices is among the lowest of vendors participating in the wearables category.If one searches through the fitness tracker category ranking on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) for HealthBox products , the product does n't even rank in the top 1,000 . So when I said Under Armour spent millions in error, the only question to build upon that declaration is what will the writedowns look like for the company when they come.Do you remember how much of a threat HealthBox was supposed to be for Fitbit?Do you remember seeing the advertisements for the product line?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> you recall seeing it at ... Dick 's Sporting Goods ( NYSE : DKS ) and not much anywhere else ?  (Uncertainty) </span>With all this forced nostalgic thinking, all I can recollect is one of my long-time favorite songs from Phil Collins titled "Do You Remember" from the '90s.So much for HealthBox.I'm done with that "threat"!I would ramble on about the proposed threat from Apple Watch (NASDAQ: AAPL ), but over the last several months, I think my articles regarding the Apple Watch and its laundry list of failures speak to its underperformance.To color the threat that was perceived to be from the Apple Watch on Fitbit, I'd rather offer what its next iteration will employ and deploy.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As I stated , <b>suggested</b> and sampled previously , the Apple Watch has failed to generate anything meaningful beyond distribution .  (Uncertainty) </span>As such, sales for the Apple Watch have fallen precipitously after just one year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Secondly , the Apple Watch has found that the <i>greater</i> utility for such a smart device will come from its health and wellness features and not all those duplicate features found in a smartphone .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Thirdly , as I <b>suggested</b> previously , the next iteration of the Apple Watch will be aligned <i>more</i> greatly to be used as a smart fitness device .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Most unfortunately, however, the Apple Watch OS3 will still not be able to compete on par with Fitbit.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Price points will still be too high , and overall functionality will still be found wanting for <i>greater</i> market penetration regardless of the improvements to the device .  (Surprise) </span>Apple has never lead itself into a product category with its worst foot forward, and in the case of Apple Watch, that is exactly what it did.As such, the already few millions of users will not likely give the product another chance on top of those that will never give it a chance due to the price point and utility of the device.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What I find comical about those <b>suggesting</b> that the Apple Watch does n't compete directly with Fitbit is that Fitbit itself states openly it competes against Apple in its annual filing .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Funny how some media pundits like to align a narrative to fit a personal belief system , even when the evidence is very much to the contrary and Apple moves in a <i>more</i> direct competitive position .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Maybe they <b>believe</b> Fitbit is lying , but where is the litigation against the company for that ?  (Uncertainty) </span>There has been and resides a primary fault with the smartwatch sub-category since 2014, when the smartwatch devices launched.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The problem was that they did far <i>less</i> than a smartphone at an aggressive , added cost to the consumer .  (Surprise) </span>Since 2014, that problem has not been addressed, and based on every single data point that is presented with new iterations, the problem will persist.This is identified with Apple essentially reducing its production output for the fall launch of the Apple Watch OS3 on a launch-over-launch basis.Even Apple is forced to recognize the company didn't see the sell-through demand it had expected with the first Apple Watch, and is forced to focus on profitability with the Apple Watch OS3.Most of the Apple Watch sales came in the first 5 months of sales, and an estimated 10.6 million have sold into the market for all of 2015.Unfortunately, the sell-through has failed to generate new orders in 2016, which will now find with the launch of Watch OS3 still a likely decline in Watch sales for 2016 as forecasted by many analysts, including Ming-Chi of KGI Securities .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple is only ramping production for the Watch OS3 to <b>roughly</b> 2 million units monthly .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Apple Watch shipments will decline <i>more</i> than 25 percent year-over-year in comparison to 2015 , according to a new research note issued by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The wearable device sold an estimated 10.6 million units in eight months last year , but Kuo <b>predicts</b> that even with the launch of the Apple Watch 2 , and a full twelve months of sales , the device 's shipments will still come in at <i>less</i> than 7.5 million units in 2016 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Whether it is Samsung , Apple , Garmin ( NASDAQ : GRMN ) , Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) or whomever , try as they <b>may</b> to compete , it is an effort in vain .  (Uncertainty) </span>Fitbit will remain in the dominant position for the totality of the wearables category.So it has been said, so it has been written.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Tongue and cheek as it <b>may</b> be offered , the reasoning is identifiable , exampled and has been proven most relevant within the statistical findings , as evidenced in the chart from Stackline below .  (Uncertainty) </span>In yet another photograph below, the far left examples 10 different wearable products fighting for space in a 4-foot section of the store.The Samsung Gear Fit and Gear S2 smartwatch have about 6" of selling space within that 4-foot section and alongside the Garmin Vivo products.The far right portion of the photograph examples the 8-foot Fitbit section of the store.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>First-mover</i> advantage , branding and the general term used by wearable consumers is identified by how retailers are positioning wearable products in their stores and on the shelves .  (Surprise) </span>The statistical data is irrefutable - Fitbit faces competition.But it likely won't falter due to competition, as evidenced by the statistical and physical data.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company will be just fine - it 's investors who should consider something <i>greater</i> , and that something <i>greater</i> is their investment .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Investors have to <b>worry</b> <i>more</i> presciently about sales growth deceleration in an increasingly saturated wearables space .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Anecdotally speaking, years ago I told a good friend who was offered a vice president's role at The Sports Authority that his career would be short-lived.I showed him a simple graphic akin to the one that is updated below regarding the market share gains by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> with respect to sporting good sales and The Sports Authority : Fortunately , my friend understood the irreversible trend in the business and avoided The Sports Authority , which eventually filed for bankruptcy . In short, statistics don't lie and trends are hard to overcome.As such, what Fitbit has garnered in the way of market share will likely not be overcome or impeded at this stage of the race.Moreover, and most importantly for FIT investor consideration is Fitbit's continued distribution and selling practices.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Almost</b> a month ago , the company proliferated a Today 's Special Value segment on the Home Shopping Network ( HSN ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Fitbit sold 22,000 Alta units at a discounted price that likely showed little , if any , gross profit margins .  (Uncertainty) </span>On Saturday, it followed this distribution and selling practice with a QVC Network Today's Special Value for the Blaze smart fitness watch.Fitbit sold 25,000 units during the all-day promotion.As with the prior Home Shopping Network promotional sale, the latest QVC promotional sale will hinder brick-and-mortar sell-through results and prove to be an impediment for YOY sales come 2017 for Fitbit.Again, by and large, analysts don't follow the home shopping sales channels and don't account for the impact on sales from these channels, be they favorable or negative.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Due to the lack of coverage regarding the home shopping channels , analyst sales data tracking becomes <i>less</i> viable and <i>less</i> effective .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At present , I <b>believe</b> Fitbit is over-inventorying its retail partners given the breadth of participation in the home shopping channel .  (Uncertainty) </span>I had warned of this occurrence previously on June 23rd and identified it with retail channel checks that included Target (NYSE: TGT ) and Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ).<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With the company launching new versions of the Charge HR and Flex fitness trackers during Q3 2016 , I <b>believe</b> it will focus <i>more</i> on sell-through for much of the back half of 2016 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Production cuts will be needed to alleviate retail inventory levels, and sell-through will have to increase in order for the company to come out of the Q4 holiday selling period with clean inventories.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While the tone is understandably <b>cautious</b> , it is in fitting with the share price valuation and as such justified .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , I <b>believe</b> sales have accelerated in Q2 for international markets that will serve to offset further YOY sales growth deceleration in the Americas .  (Uncertainty) </span>With this data point, it is reasonable to expect Q2 sales to have performed well for Fitbit during the period and on a YOY basis.Gross profit margins are likely stable for the period, and the average selling price has moved little month to month.But even with all that being said, guidance, investors will key off of guidance and as usual!If you have followed my CPG and retail coverage over the years on Seeking Alpha, you likely have born witness to profits issued with my investments and trades.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In 2016 , I have offered additional trading and investment opportunities for which I have recently closed out profitable trades in TWTR , JCP , UVXY and , as of last week , SBUX at $ 57.30 for a <i>lesser</i> , 5.2 % return .  (Surprise) </span>Additionally, last week, our longstanding price target of $108 a share on PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP ) has been achieved.I have traded FIT positively 4 times already this year, with the most recent still in play.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>My returns on invested capital to date are <b>roughly</b> 92 % and coming off of a 200 % plus return in 2015 .  (Uncertainty) </span>For those who consistently follow my UVXY short narratives and analysis, it is well understood that my largest portfolio position has remained with the ETF since 2012.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Shares of UVXY are down <b>roughly</b> 75 % YTD and continue to generate great wealth for long-term short participants and since the ETF came to the market in late 2011 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the coming days , I will deliver <i>more</i> updated trading and investment opportunities , as I also participate in at least one-penny stock annually that exhibits strong fundamentals with a deep value .  (Surprise) </span>If you have enjoyed my publications and are looking for additional analysis and insights, please feel free to follow me on Seeking Alpha in real time and on Twitter.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: I maintain a significant short position in shares of UVXY at all times, with a small long position to garner tax losses.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For this reason , I have also reduced my short position in shares of UVXY <i>earlier</i> this year .
