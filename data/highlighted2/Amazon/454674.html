In short, statistics don't lie and trends are hard to overcome.As such, what Fitbit has garnered in the way of market share will likely not be overcome or impeded at this stage of the race.Moreover, and most importantly for FIT investor consideration is Fitbit's continued distribution and selling practices.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Almost</b> a month ago , the company proliferated a Today 's Special Value segment on the Home Shopping Network ( HSN ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Fitbit sold 22,000 Alta units at a discounted price that likely showed little , if any , gross profit margins .  (Uncertainty) </span>On Saturday, it followed this distribution and selling practice with a QVC Network Today's Special Value for the Blaze smart fitness watch.Fitbit sold 25,000 units during the all-day promotion.As with the prior Home Shopping Network promotional sale, the latest QVC promotional sale will hinder brick-and-mortar sell-through results and prove to be an impediment for YOY sales come 2017 for Fitbit.Again, by and large, analysts don't follow the home shopping sales channels and don't account for the impact on sales from these channels, be they favorable or negative.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Due to the lack of coverage regarding the home shopping channels , analyst sales data tracking becomes <i>less</i> viable and <i>less</i> effective .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At present , I <b>believe</b> Fitbit is over-inventorying its retail partners given the breadth of participation in the home shopping channel .  (Uncertainty) </span>I had warned of this occurrence previously on June 23rd and identified it with retail channel checks that included Target (NYSE: TGT ) and Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ).<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With the company launching new versions of the Charge HR and Flex fitness trackers during Q3 2016 , I <b>believe</b> it will focus <i>more</i> on sell-through for much of the back half of 2016 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Production cuts will be needed to alleviate retail inventory levels, and sell-through will have to increase in order for the company to come out of the Q4 holiday selling period with clean inventories.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While the tone is understandably <b>cautious</b> , it is in fitting with the share price valuation and as such justified .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , I <b>believe</b> sales have accelerated in Q2 for international markets that will serve to offset further YOY sales growth deceleration in the Americas .  (Uncertainty) </span>With this data point, it is reasonable to expect Q2 sales to have performed well for Fitbit during the period and on a YOY basis.Gross profit margins are likely stable for the period, and the average selling price has moved little month to month.But even with all that being said, guidance, investors will key off of guidance and as usual!If you have followed my CPG and retail coverage over the years on Seeking Alpha, you likely have born witness to profits issued with my investments and trades.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In 2016 , I have offered additional trading and investment opportunities for which I have recently closed out profitable trades in TWTR , JCP , UVXY and , as of last week , SBUX at $ 57.30 for a <i>lesser</i> , 5.2 % return .  (Surprise) </span>Additionally, last week, our longstanding price target of $108 a share on PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP ) has been achieved.I have traded FIT positively 4 times already this year, with the most recent still in play.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>My returns on invested capital to date are <b>roughly</b> 92 % and coming off of a 200 % plus return in 2015 .  (Uncertainty) </span>For those who consistently follow my UVXY short narratives and analysis, it is well understood that my largest portfolio position has remained with the ETF since 2012.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Shares of UVXY are down <b>roughly</b> 75 % YTD and continue to generate great wealth for long-term short participants and since the ETF came to the market in late 2011 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the coming days , I will deliver <i>more</i> updated trading and investment opportunities , as I also participate in at least one-penny stock annually that exhibits strong fundamentals with a deep value .
