( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class , performance , yield and <i>more</i> , check out the ETF Hub . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>ETF Hub Oct 1 2015 , 19:22 ET | By : Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor GE , Samsung , and Oster are among 11 new supporters of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Dash Replenishment Service ( DRS ) , which allows Web-connected appliances and electronics to automatically reorder supplies when they run low . Existing supporters include Whirlpool, Brita, and Brother.Examples of DRS-enabled devices at work include printers automatically reordering ink, water pitchers automatically ordering filters, and washers ordering detergent.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> claims hardware makers can support the service by adding as few as 10 lines of code to a device 's software . DRS complements <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Dash Buttons ( mocked by some , praised by others ) , which let Prime subs reorder a name-brand product simply by pressing a button on a small device that can be hung or stuck someplace within a home . Supported brands include Gillette, Tide, Gatorade, Clorox, and Ziploc.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Each button costs $ 4.99 , but comes with a $ 4.99 credit towards an initial purchase Both solutions are arguably part of a <i>broader</i> effort by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to keep consumers ( Prime subs especially ) habitually ordering from the company , by offering a level of convenience and value-added services <i>smaller</i> online retailers ca n't provide . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Separately , in an eyebrow-raising move , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has told marketplace sellers it wo n't allow Apple TV set-tops and Google 's Chromecast HDMI stick to be sold on its site as of Oct. 29 , The Fire TV vendor claims the move is due to the fact Apple TV/Chromecast do n't `` interact well '' with Prime Video . The ChromeCast banning is a bad joke.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Less</i> than a quarter of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's customers are Prime subscribers anyway , so <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's excuse rings hollow . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For all the criticism Google 's gotten lately , a move like this would definitely have violated its `` do n't be evil '' motto , and I <b>doubt</b> the company would ever commit such a blatantly anticompetitive act .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> should be getting <i>more</i> regulatory scrutiny than Google , but how much net capital does it actually have to take away . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>That 's what it still comes down to for all involved , including governments , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will clearly do whatever it takes , short of a customer backlash . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Dash buttons are actually an interesting technological example of some of the same sort of jockeying to work around Apple : That 's still a heck of a lot <i>better</i> than using its retail clout in ways that should be garnering FTC attention .  (Surprise) </span>That is not very smart of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . They do not want to remind people that they are a scary monopoly yet.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It would have been <i>better</i> to wait until they are absolutely unavoidable , ( like , say , a cable company ) before they start with the scary monopolistic actions .  (Surprise) </span>And Google and Apple were absolutely the wrong companies to piss off.Especially if you piss them both off at the same time.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>ETF Screener : Search and filter by asset class , strategy , theme , performance , yield , and much <i>more</i> ETF Performance : View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes  (Surprise) </span></div></body></html>
