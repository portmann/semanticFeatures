(Surprise) </span>They're both growing.They compete with each other.So those categories are growing.It's only really the game consoles that are not growing as fast for secular reasons, the early on.They were the only high-connected devices attached to the TV.And now, they are facing competition in share from smart TVs and from these attached devices.David, a balance sheet question for you.I think in the letter, you talk about looking to raise additional capital next year.Do you think the next year will be the last year in which you'll need to do that, as you think about the plans for the next three to five years?And then any additional color on what kind of capital or how you would raise that capital next year?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Well , it 's largely <b>unknown</b> , right .  (Uncertainty) </span>I mean you're asking me three or four years out.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But I would say , given our plans to expand content and given the fact that we 're on pace to use about $ 1 billion this year and no indications that that would shrink next year , we wanted to give some headway or some inside into the fact that we <b>may</b> be back in the market next year .  (Uncertainty) </span>We've done that on a regular sort of cadence of about once a year.So there is no change from that.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But there is still some <b>uncertainty</b> in terms of the pipeline , how much we would need exactly next year .  (Uncertainty) </span>But I would say, safe indications are that we will be back in the market in the next 12 to 18 months.And then a success scenario, where Ted is able to invest the originals as well in the future as he has in the past.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We would <b>hope</b> to be back , because we want to be funding these incredible creative productions around the world .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So in a success scenario , we would do a bunch <i>more</i> over the next five , 10 years .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And in terms of contribution margins <b>maybe</b> again David for you , I think you reiterated your goal of getting to 40 % contribution margins in U.S. by 2020 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Are those European countries and some of that in Canada , some of that <i>earlier</i> countries that you launched in .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Could</b> you just talk about what the contribution margin has been like in those markets ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Has it been similar to what you did in the U.S. over the last three years?Well, similar to the comment of Reed, we don't give a specific, Mark, in commentary for competitive reasons.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But we have said and I 'll reiterate that there is nothing structural that means we ca n't get equal or <i>better</i> margins outside the U.S. that we 've seen in the U.S. And we gave you a data point on Canada that that had reached U.S. margin .  (Surprise) </span>About 18 months ago, we gave you a point on that.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>So there is no reason that we <b>could</b> n't do <i>better</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Largely it's determined competitively within that country or that region in terms of how well we do on the profit side.Recently you guys agreed to sell subscriptions to Apple phone users via iOS in app purchases.For years you didn't do that.Are you paying the same 30% tax that everyone else pays, when someone gets an app subscription through Apple?And then why make that change now after years of not doing that?It's a great opportunity to expand.So historically, we've only been on the Apple TV and that on the iPhone.And we don't comment specifically on the business terms.So I can't directly answer your question.But we're really excited about the potential, especially as we go global over the next year-and-a-half to be able to serve all of the iPhone customers around the world.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So some <i>higher</i> motivation on our side to get access to that incredible iPhone customer base around the world .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If that does generate a lot of new subscriptions , will we see the impact of that on you financials ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Will those come in significantly <i>lower</i> monthly revenue numbers ?  (Surprise) </span>No, the revenue is the same.You would see an increase in COGS to deal with the fees to Apple.That's where it would show up.But it's essentially the gross revenue the 7.99 or 9.99 that shows for us.Curious what you guys think of new streaming offerings from Verizon and Comcast both, what you think of them as actual content?And what you think of the notion and broadband providers that you need to work with, now competing with subscription or streaming services?We're really big and everybody has got to get into streaming.It's been our main message for several years, that what is known as channels is going to become apps.And that all of these providers need to have great apps on a phone, on a tablet, on a TV, so it's completely consistent with all of that.And what we see is if we have great content, then consumers watch our service and enjoy it and tell their friends about it.And it kind of doesn't matter that there is also a great sports game on or there is also a shows on Verizon or on Comcast.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So part of the reason that we <b>may</b> seem a little blas ?  (Uncertainty) </span>is that it really hasn't affected us.What has affected us is when we have great show like Narcos that just takes the world by storm.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So that 's what we 're focused on , how do we have <i>more</i> incredible shows .  (Surprise) </span>It's early in the market.They are great companies.They will work on that.But I'm not going to critique them.They're all, they are in, they are trying, and that's a great thing.Of course, you seen Sony Vue, you've seen the Dish sling product.So people are really innovative, which is great for consumers.And not every product, when it first comes out is great, and they'll continue to work on them.Ted, we got a couple of series of emails about whether Star Wars is going to be available, all the films on the Netflix next year, what's the answer?They're all subject to negotiations.It's up to Disney, how they want to manage access to those assets before, during or after the release of Star Wars 7.So it's certainly an ongoing discussion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And <b>assuming</b> Star Wars launches theatrically this year , then it would not come to Netflix as part of the -LSB- multiple speakers -RSB- .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And then there was a new user interface launched on the site about four months ago , and <b>hoped</b> that that would be kind of improved user retention satisfaction levels four months in , any takeaways ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Super happy with it, and we're generating new improvements already, improvements there, improvements on mobile, improvements on the TV.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So thinking a product group is just an <b>amazing</b> learning organization .  (Surprise) </span>It's always pushing the balance and its steady improvement on all of those fronts, Mark.And it's the aggregate of that, which has us at so many viewing hours and so much customer satisfaction that we've been working at all of these improvements over the last seven years on streaming.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>You guys changed your amortization schedule for your license content , just like you had for originals , you said it 's because you 're seeing <i>more</i> viewing in the first month .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>What does that mean are people -- does that mean people are <i>less</i> interested in the stuff than you thought overtime or they 're <i>more</i> interested than you thought .  (Surprise) </span>Originally what does that tell us about viewing behavior?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Presumably</b> , Peter you 're referring to that amortization change or the change in accounting estimate .  (Uncertainty) </span>And no, it doesn't.You can't conclude that nor should you conclude that from the change.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>What we 're saying is there is <i>more</i> viewing in the first month not necessarily <i>less</i> viewing over the lifetime , it just moved up a little bit .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And it <b>could</b> be that we view that at so much good content over the last few years that it 's become -- you have to make a good choice , right .  (Uncertainty) </span>You've got 20 good choices, you're choosing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So it <b>could</b> be that the merchandising system is concentrating a little bit of that when something comes in .  (Uncertainty) </span>Regardless, we try to be accurate in our accounting, and we follow the trends regularly on a quarterly basis.And this past quarter, we noted some content that was trending up, so we accelerated the amortization on that.We wanted to be upfront, even though it's relatively small based, if you look at it in comparison to the overall U.S. content spend it's relatively small.Peter, let me give you a little example, it will help on this one.Suppose we pay $1 million dollars for a title for a four year license, and we think it's going to go 1 million hours of viewing.But the title is just incredibly popular, and instead it does 10 million hours.But many of those hours are in the first month as supposed to spread over the four years.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Well , then we would accelerate the amortization of that million dollars , even though the whole thing is doing much <i>better</i> than we ever thought .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Its relative proportion overtime is <i>more</i> upfront .  (Surprise) </span>So that's why we would front load that million dollars.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And generally what 's happening , are these things over performing or is there a mix where they <b>sometimes</b> are performing <i>less</i> well than you thought ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It's not about the total performance that gets us to change the amortization, it's the relative performance overtime.And so if it performs a lot in the beginning, relative to how it does at the end.That's what gets us to accelerate.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So your <i>earlier</i> question about write-downs is what 's missing .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You 're not quite getting that , let 's see , if a title under performed our estimate , but was very back-loaded , then the right accounting would be to shift it out further as oppose to pull it up .  (Uncertainty) </span>And so you're thinking of it in a write-up and write-down sense, and that's not actually how it works.The schedule is based upon how it does overtime relative to the license period.Did that example help?No, no, but in both cases you're saying look, we have these things for so long that it always worked out.That is why I was asking about the write-down part.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>You 've never once reached a point where you missed entirely and you found something that no one wants over any <i>more</i> time .  (Surprise) </span>Let me take that, Peter, because I think there has been a couple of questions on that.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We certainly license things that perform <i>less</i> well than we expected <b>sometimes</b> , right .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>There is a portfolio of content that we're licensing.We don't always get it right.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But in the case if something that does n't perform as well as we expected , we 're not a producer that has ultimate revenues like a production studio that has to write that down based on a <i>lower</i> expectation of revenue .  (Surprise) </span>We have something available on our service in broadcaster accounting.And in broadcasters, if we're deriving revenue over the life of that license period over the service, it doesn't result in a write-down.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It just <b>maybe</b> an opportunity cost that we can license something <i>better</i> down the road .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Well, and a good recent real world example is Longmire.We just released the original fourth season of Longmire.So season one, two, and three, which we've licensed for several years on Netflix, they were at the kind of tail end of their life, actually exploded when Longmire season four launched.So it's very unique to the behavior, like nothing actually performs like everything else.So we are trying to do is make sure the amort matches the viewing patterns.And it's a good lead in to remind everyone that these are dynamic, right.That's why we look at it every quarter, because things change.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We see when something gets released like Longmire or we release the third season , then the first season of that particular title <b>may</b> see a bump .  (Uncertainty) </span>So it's something that we're constantly looking at.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On global rights deals , Ted , just a big picture , as you see yourself , is the company able to negotiate <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> of these content deals on a global rights basis ?  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Yes , it 's definitely been the drive of myself and my team all year , trying to move the sellers into a <i>more</i> of a global mode .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Remember , they are mostly situated as regional sellers of content , <b>sometimes</b> the rights are fragmented in their ownership .  (Uncertainty) </span>But in the cases of the deals we did this past quarter, they were controlled by one entity and typically solved by multiple regions and we corralled the deals into the corporate offices, and were able to license the world on those titles.Titles that we think will have great global appeal.So I think the growth, the opportunities, the challenges of Netflix are all global, so that its having a lot of regional discussions around the world isn't that efficient.And it turns out that tastes are rather global too.So it's actually really well lined up.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And then Ted or Reed , when you think about the mix in international markets of local versus global content , any general change in your thinking on what the optimum mix is , and you find it that you 're constantly toggling with <b>depending</b> on the market that you 're in ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's interesting , like you said every time we launch in a new market , we know <i>more</i> in that first 24 hours of viewing , than we did from a year of research .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And in terms of the move , I think , we went in expecting Japan to be much <i>more</i> local than it turned out to be .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's <i>more</i> local than other territories , but not as local as conventional wisdom would have had .  (Surprise) </span>And it actually moves with a global desire for some of these large shows, so that the local tastes are usually determined by what you have access to.And if we're growing the access to great content around the world, people are moving or migrating to that kind of viewing.So that's why we're able to do local language originals, our own global originals and then licensed content, not just from Hollywood to the world, but from the world to the rest of the world.Another international question.Can you guys give us any update on China, either in terms of what you're thinking about in terms of timing or what your approach is going to be to a really regulated market there when you do show up?We can tell you, well, we're still learning a lot.So nothing really specific our helpful, except that we're still in early stages.And lot of you guys mentioned getting in new Pay TV Window for a specific movie, The Big Short.Are you negotiating those deals now on one-off deals for individual movies or you're doing these for whole slates?There were conversations directly with producers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So a lot of times , well , if you can get to the rights before they get fragmented , that 's when you <b>could</b> do those deals .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So they tend to be <i>more</i> curated title-by-title in that way .  (Surprise) </span>Reed, I think I'll just ask one last question directly to you.When you think about the biggest challenges that you think Netflix faces over the next several years, three to five years, what do you think they are?What do you focus most of your time on?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Well , I would say the biggest challenge is , our being the service that people want , really feeling out <i>more</i> movies and <i>more</i> TV shows .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We 're working so hard to have these great original productions , and if we <b>could</b> have 10 <i>more</i> Oranges and 5 <i>more</i> Narcos , I know I 'm putting a lot of pressure , that would be really transformative .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Especially, I'll bring up the Narcos, we've got an example, because it was filmed in Bogota, Columbia.The main company doing it, it was a French company.So it's a very international production; Brazilian cast.And we have an incredible production Marseille, which I'll give a little plug for, that's in filming now.And I think it will be a really great crossover around the world kind of crime, drama, family, politics.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And the <i>more</i> we do these around the world , obviously , that 's great in a local market in terms of establishing our bona fides and reputation with customers .  (Surprise) </span>But it's also great, because there is something new, something fresh.And as long as we're continuing to push the bounds on things, like original movies or international productions, then the consumers are really embracing.David, help us think through and it's I guess one of same things I am sensing very strongly is just increasing appetite enthusiasm for original content.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>From a P&L perspective , that $ 5 billion next year in content spend , theoretically if that was 25 % original content versus 15 % or 10 % , the impact of that on margins , as you mix shift <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> towards original content , is that accretive to margins ?  (Surprise) </span>Well, the good news for me as a forecaster is it does take Ted a little bit of time to actually produce these shows.So anyway, we get a little bit of lead time in terms of some visibility into the production.So our targets at 40% U.S. margin already encapsulate this shift towards originals overtime.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I think we made some <i>earlier</i> comments about a long-term shift that could be upwards of 50 % of originals , and we still <b>anticipate</b> being able to meet our margin targets and also shift towards originals .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's going to bring <i>more</i> amortization in , but we think we can do both .  (Surprise) </span>And I'll use the word expansion.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So think of it as our license content is growing , but our original content is growing <i>faster</i> .  (Surprise) </span>There is a mix shift, but I don't want that to get misunderstood as a reduction in license spending.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And remember , between original films , original cartoons , animated shows for kids , our original scripted series , we 're releasing <i>more</i> original titles in Q4 than we released in entire second year of original programming .  (Surprise) </span>So it is accelerating rather quickly and you're seeing it.Reed, you said for a while now, the future of TV is apps, and now Tim Cook is saying the same thing, it's now the conventional wisdom.Do you think individual viewers or consumers want to pick and choose their own apps, their own shows, serving in a la carte world or do you think there's a role for someone who sort of bundle all the stuff back together.Well, that will be a really interesting question over the next couple of years.We're going to work really hard to expand our movies and TV shows so quickly in such a compelling way, that lots of the viewing for movies and TV shows is through Netflix, which is sort of what makes us want to focus so much on that area.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But I <b>could</b> imagine future bundles emerging .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Once there is a whole bunch of apps , and as you go through this industry change now , next <b>probably</b> three , five , 10 years , where there is a lot of discrete offerings , everybody is improving their brand value .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And then you get to a maturing phase of the market , and then there is some consolidation , which <b>could</b> be acquisitions , it <b>could</b> be other things or it <b>could</b> be bundles .  (Uncertainty) </span>But the next couple years, when you have this new phase of the market, I think everyone is just racing to make a great app like Netflix, like HBO Now, those things.This will be it.It's a small one.You're seeing some folks sort of rebundle already, right.Hulu is showing Showtime together.Would you be comfortable having Netflix bundle with another service?We don't see a lot of take rate from our consumer side on the Hulu Showtime.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We think we 're <i>better</i> focused on just establishing the Netflix brand .  (Surprise) </span>Again, at this phase in the market, we think the real key is focus.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At some future time the bundling <b>may</b> be appropriate .  (Uncertainty) </span>Of course, we'll keep an eye and watch the Hulu Showtime take rate to see, to confirm that there is very little traction of that.So we'll be open minded.But our instinct is focused on making Netflix the passion brand in this space.And before we sign off, we should remind everybody that Friday, tomorrow, is the premier of Beasts of No Nation on Netflix and in selected theaters around the country.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an important resource for bloggers and journalists, and are excited to contribute to the democratization of financial information on the Internet.(Until now investors have had to pay thousands of dollars in subscription fees for transcripts.)<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So our reproduction policy is as follows : You <b>may</b> quote up to 400 words of any transcript on the condition that you attribute the transcript to Seeking Alpha and either link to the original transcript or to www.SeekingAlpha.com .
