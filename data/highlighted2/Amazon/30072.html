( NASDAQ : NFLX ) | Seeking Alpha Netflix stock took off Thursday on strong subscriber growth but some of the financial data from the earnings report paints a <i>less</i> rosy picture .  (Surprise) </span>Forward guidance was lowered as the company ramps up international expansion but the strong dollar should provide a financial headwind.From a purely financial standpoint, my purchase of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) puts ahead of earnings was a disaster.The options that I bought yesterday at $29.55 were sold today for a mere $0.87.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Not the type of return on investment I was <b>hoping</b> for !  (Uncertainty) </span>The funny thing is that my general thesis was right on.With the exception of one thing.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Subscriber growth numbers came in <i>better</i> than expected .  (Surprise) </span>And that sent the stock off to the races.Take a look at this chart of Wednesday's price action.4PM Eastern would be when normal market trading ends and after hours trading begins.Notice that brief downward blip at around 4:05?That's when the initial earnings report came out the stock price dropped around $9 a share.Then it announced subscriber growth and the stock took off.Initially, the market reacted negatively to the numbers but that was overlooked once the subscriber number was announced.The conclusion obviously is that Netflix trades on subscribers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I was <b>worried</b> about Netflix coming into earnings and I think a lot of my concerns were validated .  (Uncertainty) </span>It just wasn't reflected in the stock price thanks to those subscriber numbers.For example ... Very little was mentioned about the dollar specifically but look at Netflix's forward guidance in the report.SunTrust dropped their 2015 & 2016 EPS estimates from $2.62/$3.85 to $1.08/$2.40.That's huge and the strong dollar and rapid expansion plans are largely to blame.Lowered guidance in an earnings report like that would kill most stocks.Not Netflix.Free cash flow is also heading in the wrong direction.The -$163 million figure is the worst quarterly number since the company went public.International growth spend is the reason but this is a trend I have difficulty seeing reverse itself any time soon.Overseas subscriber numbers were great this quarter but the trend is that growth is slowing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Coupled with the strong dollar and an international expansion that 'll continue to cost a lot of money , top line and bottom line numbers <b>may</b> not be as robust as thought .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Guidance has already taken a hit and if Netflix has trouble establishing itself in places like China ( which is probably <i>less</i> than likely but still a <b>risk</b> ) that the return on investment will be dampened .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The idea that Netflix's stock is overvalued has already been beaten to death but it's still a valid argument.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As with many hot growth stocks ( like the cybersecurity stocks currently ) valuation is <i>less</i> of a concern as the company spends to expand .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But for shareholders that means a lot of room to drop if things slow <b>unexpectedly</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Let's face it.Investors buy securities to make money.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Hyper-growth can support a steep valuation for a while but once growth starts slowing ( and evidence <b>suggests</b> that it 's already starting ) that valuation has to begin to normalize .  (Uncertainty) </span>Right now, despite those fantastic subscriber numbers the financials are still relatively weak and the stock is priced to perfection.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , obviously , is an example of a stock that can remain inflated despite generating no meaningful profit for two decades but that 's the exception rather than the rule . Netflix is a tough stock to evaluate.It's obviously growing well and it has the look and feel of a business that will be part of the global landscape for the foreseeable future but I just have trouble liking it as an investment right now.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Volatility</b> has been the name of the game with this stock as it 's swung wildly on multiple occasions .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We saw one steep drop in 2011 and two <i>more</i> in 2014 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>A stock with this kind of volatility that trades largely on one metric and <i>less</i> so on actual financial data and results is risky and not a <b>risk</b> I 'm comfortable taking right now .
