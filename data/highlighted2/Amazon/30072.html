Guess Netflix Trades Exclusively On Subscriber Numbers Netflix Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Netflix stock took off Thursday on strong subscriber growth but some of the financial data from the earnings report paints a less rosy picture Forward guidance was lowered as the company ramps up international expansion but the strong dollar should provide a financial headwind From a purely financial standpoint my purchase of Netflix NASDAQ NFLX puts ahead of earnings was a disaster The options that I bought yesterday at were sold today for a mere Not the type of return on investment I was hoping for The funny thing is that my general thesis was right on With the exception of one thing Subscriber growth numbers came in better than expected And that sent the stock off to the races Take a look at this chart of Wednesdays price action PM Eastern would be when normal market trading ends and after hours trading begins Notice that brief downward blip at around Thats when the initial earnings report came out the stock price dropped around a share Then it announced subscriber growth and the stock took off Initially the market reacted negatively to the numbers but that was overlooked once the subscriber number was announced The conclusion obviously is that Netflix trades on subscribers I was worried about Netflix coming into earnings and I think a lot of my concerns were validated It just wasnt reflected in the stock price thanks to those subscriber numbers For example Very little was mentioned about the dollar specifically but look at Netflixs forward guidance in the report SunTrust dropped their EPS estimates from to Thats huge and the strong dollar and rapid expansion plans are largely to blame Lowered guidance in an earnings report like that would kill most stocks Not Netflix Free cash flow is also heading in the wrong direction The million figure is the worst quarterly number since the company went public International growth spend is the reason but this is a trend I have difficulty seeing reverse itself any time soon Overseas subscriber numbers were great this quarter but the trend is that growth is slowing Coupled with the strong dollar and an international expansion thatll continue to cost a lot of money top line and bottom line numbers may not be as robust as thought Guidance has already taken a hit and if Netflix has trouble establishing itself in places like China which is probably less than likely but still a risk that the return on investment will be dampened The idea that Netflixs stock is overvalued has already been beaten to death but its still a valid argument As with many hot growth stocks like the cybersecurity stocks currently valuation is less of a concern as the company spends to expand But for shareholders that means a lot of room to drop if things slow unexpectedly Lets face it Investors buy securities to make money Hypergrowth can support a steep valuation for a while but once growth starts slowing and evidence suggests that its already starting that valuation has to begin to normalize Right now despite those fantastic subscriber numbers the financials are still relatively weak and the stock is priced to perfection <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>obviously is an example of a stock that can remain inflated despite generating no meaningful profit for two decades but thats the exception rather than the rule Netflix is a tough stock to evaluate Its obviously growing well and it has the look and feel of a business that will be part of the global landscape for the foreseeable future but I just have trouble liking it as an investment right now Volatility has been the name of the game with this stock as its swung wildly on multiple occasions We saw one steep drop in and two more in A stock with this kind of volatility that trades largely on one metric and less so on actual financial data and results is risky and not a risk Im comfortable taking right now
