'' He also echoes a refrain heard from a number of agents, namely that Netflix's lack of transparency over how many people are watching its shows makes it difficult for reps to figure out the value of their clients' creations."Their refusal to open the books â€¦ is a problem for me, and I think it's gonna be a problem for a lot of people down the road," he says.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>`` I 'll take <i>less</i> money up front for ... real participation in wild success .  (Surprise) </span>I'm always willing to gamble on myself."Comments from creatives such as Soderbergh hearten cable executives, some of whom insist that the streaming giant is starting to experience some pushback from producers."Netflix is a very sexy place to go, and they're ordering a ton of product, and people are having great experiences there," says one veteran development executive."But we're starting to see some talent coming back around and saying, 'You know what?From a business standpoint.'I think everyone is starting to be like, 'Okay, wait.This cost-plus model's kinda good, but is it good enough?'"But the rise of Netflix itself is the real culprit when it comes to the rising costs of producing television shows.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The cost-plus model employed by Netflix will eventually cause the best talent to move <i>closer</i> towards a backend model because the best talent will want to participate in the upside and not have their profits capped because nobody in Hollywood wants a ceiling .  (Surprise) </span>Otherwise, front-end costs will continue to rise dramatically for everyone.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In reality , <b>probably</b> a bit of both will happen .  (Uncertainty) </span>Streaming high-quality star-studded episodic television is all the rage, and just to get from concept to production can prove costly.Studios from California to Vancouver, B.C. remain crammed, and talent spread thin amongst the record amount of ongoing television productions.How crazy is the competition?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Another quote from Vulture : One studio executive says the scramble for crews and production staff <b>may</b> be most responsible for the rising cost of episodic television .
