This creates complexity as consumers attempt to sign up and cancel accounts associated with each service.Some customers also need to consider additional costs on Internet usages.This slow process gives Disney time to adjust and adapt its offerings/content strategy.2.Disney owns some of the most watched channels like ESPN, Disney and ABC.Those channels target specific audience groups, generate massive advertising revenues and are in high demand.In addition to this, the company has also put effort in reducing non-production costs and improving the margin.This means that even if revenue growth slows, profit can continually grow.3.DIS's new initiatives can offset subscriber losses in the traditional TV bundles.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Disney owns <b>approximately</b> 1/3 of Hulu , a popular video streaming service provider which has seen a large jump in subscribers last year .  (Uncertainty) </span>So as customers switch from cable packages to video streaming services, Disney will reap some of that rewards.Its channels are also present on Sling TV and Sony Vue, two of the other video streaming services.We also like Verizon's (NYSE: VZ ) new custom TV packages, which include ESPN in two basic packages.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For these reasons , we <b>believe</b> Disney 's cable network business will continue to deliver modest top-line and bottom-line growth in the coming years .  (Uncertainty) </span>Changing consumer tastes and preference We pointed out how this is mitigated by geographic and product diversification.Disney is also quite sensitive to consumer taste change, and it adapts its products accordingly.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We believe a rate hike is still <b>possible</b> for this year , but the extent and frequency will be reduced .  (Uncertainty) </span>Disney is only moderately leveraged, with a robust interest coverage of 35x.Innovation and new products: This include building new brands/themes as well as revisit existing ones (e.g. Star Wars) Demand for domestic theme parks has been strong for the recent quarters.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>There have been concerns on <i>lower</i> domestic spending powers , but we <b>believe</b> in Disney 's ability to continue delivering solid ticket sales with the adoption of dynamic pricing strategy .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>With this strategy, price increases would likely not hugely affect demand, but would help to ease some of the park overcrowding issues.Shanghai Disneyland will have its grand opening in June.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is the first one in mainland China , and we <b>believe</b> it has tremendous potential .  (Uncertainty) </span>Even though China is experiencing challenges like economic slowdowns and structural changes, we mentioned there are many positive catalysts for China.China's middle-class spending power has grown over the years as well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>could</b> see that from the near $ 112M box office of Zootopia , only behind U.S. and Canada .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Recession-proof : Disney is a symbol of dream , innocence and joy ( You <b>probably</b> have a smile on your face right now ) .
