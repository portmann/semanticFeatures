class='textDiv'>Forget <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fast Retailing Is The Best FastFashion Investment Fast Retailing Co Ltd ADR OTCMKTSFRCOY Seeking Alpha There has been a lot of talk of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>moving into the fastfashion business While we love <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>we dont think it will trouble the big fastfashion retailers We do however think ASOS shareholders should be worried Fast Retailing UNIQLO operator has ambitious expansion plans that we believe will be hugely successful As part of its quest to take over the whole retail world there has been a lot of talk recently of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN moving into fast fashion in through its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fashion Private Label unit Fast fashion is a hugely lucrative industry and in our opinion the future of apparel retailing But we feel there is a much better fastfashion investment that investors could make today and that is UNIQLO operator Fast Retailing OTCPKFRCOY The report of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>potentially moving into fast fashion comes on the back of news that it has quietly launched seven inhouse clothing brands We dont feel fastfashion retailers such as Fast Retailing HM OTCPKHNNMY Zara OTCPKIDEXY or Forever will have much to worry about though While online is clearly a meaningful segment for any fashion retailer especially with click and collect we feel bricksandmortar is the key for fast fashion The proof is perhaps in the most recent annual report for Fast Retailing which saw online sales account for just of its billion total sales We put this down to a number of reasons but the main one is that we like many other people we know use fastfashion to satisfy an immediate need It could be to pick something up to wear for an event in a few hours time or due to a sudden change in the weather We know we can go to HM Zara or UNIQLO and pick up something that is both cheap and fashionable as well as try it on to ensure it fits ASOS OTCPKASOMY on the other hand could be in trouble if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>moves into fast fashion We think of them as being the leader in online fashion retail and could see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>taking a large bite out of their billion revenue Another advantage that bricksandmortar fastfashion retailers have and something we really like is the rapid rate at which these retailers release new stock HM actually releases new clothing every day By doing business in this way shoppers know that every time they pass one of these retailers stores there is potentially something new and exciting on offer Traditional retailers which release a new line with each season risk seeing shoppers just once per season We see Fast Retailing as being a great investment especially at the current price As you can see on the chart above the share price has taken a huge dive in the last year making the shares extremely attractive right now The company has incredibly aggressive growth plans which we are confident will be a great success As of the end of the last financial year the company had UNIQLO stores operating around the world This is still a fraction of the size of Zara and HM which boasts total store networks of and respectively At present of these stores are in China where it sees huge potential The company plans to get to stores there in the next five years with stores in China the ultimate goal We expect store growth including its other global brands such as GU Theory and J Brand to be around new stores per year for at least the next decade We expect revenue to grow by an average of per annum for the next five years Rises in disposable income together with the growing fastfashion trend and store expansion should make this a reality It may face headwinds from a strong yen but the Bank of Japan does seem to want to devalue it so by the end of the financial year things may have improved in that regard We believe the shares are undervalued at present As shown above the shares have had a tendency to trade at around times sales but at present are trading at just times sales We feel a rise up to put it in line with Zara operator Inditex is coming in the next few months Right now we feel fair value is and have a oneyear price target of based on estimated fullyear revenue of billion shares outstanding of billion and a price to sales ratio of This would give shareholders an incredible return of from the last traded price of So there it is if you want to profit from fastfashion dont buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>buy the Japanese
