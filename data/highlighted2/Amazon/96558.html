(Uncertainty) </span>MSFT has a strong history of dividend growth (15% annualized over past nine years) and will likely continue this trend.MSFT's Office 365 and Windows 10 cloud initiatives are very promising and Azure is on a rapid growth pace.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>MSFT faces the challenge of playing perpetual defense , which <b>may</b> further erode margins .  (Uncertainty) </span>Nadella has yet to prove himself as a competent leader.MSFT has full fair value up to $52 per share, representing 13% of upside.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> it should be considered a key component of a diversified blue-chip portfolio .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is another contribution to a continuing series in which I profile some of my favorite blue chip holdings.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I keep <b>approximately</b> 70 % -80 % of my assets indexed and in blue chips , so this is a very important field for me .  (Uncertainty) </span>As I've stated before, my focus is on quality companies at a reasonable price, although I appreciate (and prefer) a strong bargain, quality companies rarely go on a fire sale.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When they do , there 's often <i>deeper</i> concerns .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As Buffett and Munger best put it , `` it 's far <i>better</i> to buy a <b>wonderful</b> company at a fair price than a fair company at a <b>wonderful</b> price . ''  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) is one of these <b>wonderful</b> companies , trading in a fair price range , with potential upside of 13 % to its `` full fair value '' of $ 52 per share .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>MSFT is certainly not cheap , currently trading at <b>nearly</b> 18x its three-year average free cash flow ( FCF ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>Although MSFT isn't a bargain, I think it is fairly valued, and should be considered a key component in a diversified blue chip portfolio.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>MSFT has maintained a successful dividend strategy throughout its history , and payout amounts have been very impressive even throughout the last decade of <i>weaker</i> growth .  (Surprise) </span>The annual dividend payout has been raised an impressive 15.3% annualized over the past nine years with no clear signs of slowing down.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Even with the strong dividend yield of <b>approximately</b> 2.7 % , the dividend is covered <i>more</i> than 2x by current and average free cash flow .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Even if growth slows over the next few years, MSFT still has ample runway to raise the dividend (albeit likely at the expense of repurchases).Strong but Inconsistent Share Repurchases While MSFT has boasted an overall strong repurchase program over the past decade, with shares reduced by 25% over the past decade, the momentum has noticeably slowed since 2010.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>MSFT missed key opportunities to repurchase shares in the $ 20s and $ 30s , and is now resuming share repurchases when the stock is <i>more</i> richly valued .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>( click to enlarge ) Although MSFT has resumed share repurchases after a nearly three-year period of stagnation , MSFT can not be <b>depended</b> upon to heavily reduce their share count , primarily due to the majority of their cash held overseas .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With the currently high FCF multiples ( close to 18x on average ) , MSFT is likely <i>better</i> off investing in growth opportunities or raising the dividend .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Over the past 10 years , MSFT has spent $ 93B ( net ) to reduce the share count by <b>approximately</b> 2.68 B shares , or <b>approximately</b> $ 34.70 per share .  (Uncertainty) </span>While this looks reasonable based on the current share pricing, the average cost per share has looked foolhardy in the past.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With MSFT resuming repurchases near peak pricing , the average repurchase pricing might continue to <b>appear</b> questionable .  (Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft is ubiquitous worldwide for both its Windows operating system and Office productivity suite.Despite over two decades of assault from the likes of Linux, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Microsoft's margins have remained steady and its dominance of these two markets has continued.MSFT also has made key strides in the entertainment sector via its Xbox business, which has arguably replaced Sony (NYSE: SNE ) as the primary source of living room entertainment.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Although the Nintendo consoles have <i>higher</i> total sales , Microsoft 's platform offers a complete entertainment service whereas Nintendo 's offerings are far inferior on a technological basis .  (Surprise) </span>Microsoft's gross and pretax profit margins remain at very high levels but have declined steadily over the past decade.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Revenue growth has easily compensated for the decline in margins , but the margin trend is a bit <b>worrisome</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft has an enormous cash pile, which will enable them to pursue potential growth opportunities, but this is also a bit of a mixed-bag due to the amount of cash that remains outside of the US.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Without some form of tax repatriation holiday , MSFT will be <i>less</i> likely to institute large repurchases or acquire significant US-based companies .  (Surprise) </span>The majority of tech firms are internationally based, for similar tax reasons, so despite the limitations MSFT should still be able to make good use of their cash hoard.As of the latest 10-Q quarterly filing (current to March, 31 2015), MSFT has over $50B in net cash and short-term investments vs. $48B in mid-2014 (June 30th).Despite an increasing dividend, over $10B in share repurchases, and $4.5B in capex during the past nine months, the cash pile continues to grow.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft often takes a lot of flak from investors for not having <i>more</i> presence in the `` cloud '' computing environment .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While it 's true that the Microsoft Azure offering falls far behind <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) AWS in terms of revenues ( AWS has <b>approximately</b> 10x the revenue as of spring 2015 ) , MSFT is gaining growth , averaging <i>more</i> than 10,000 new customers per week . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The best chance, in my opinion, for Microsoft to truly capitalize on the Cloud is via its Office 365 offerings and a future potential for operating system subscription licenses.Office 365 essentially changes the Office revenue stream from one-time licensing fees with potential add-on service revenue fees to a recurrent annual or monthly service fee.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This shift is critical since it will continue to squeeze money out of businesses that previously were <i>slower</i> on the upgrade cycles .  (Surprise) </span>Since Office 365 updates in real-time, companies will avoid painful lump-sum "upgrade costs" and instead will pay via a monthly, quarterly or annual licensing fee.Office 365 is sold to residential consumers for $9.99 per month or $99.99 per year.The business plans range from $5 to $12.50 per month based on storage needs and additional features (including tablet functionality and HD video conferencing).Enterprise plans range from $8 to $20 per user per month.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> the real-time update capacity and cloud storage tie-in features of Office 365 will further cement their dominance in the workplace .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> an enormous potential rests in offering operating systems via a similar subscription .  (Uncertainty) </span>Windows already offers live updates, but instead of relying on a "new version" every few years, or even the annual update style that Mac users are accustomed to, what if MSFT operating systems offered users real-time updates on a feature-by-feature basis?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is essentially what both Apple and Microsoft are already doing , but it <b>could</b> be sold as an annual license instead of a one-time sale .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>could</b> both increase the quantity and consistency of revenue flows , but would also cut down on piracy as the base Windows operating systems would be designed to require some form of subscription model and verification .  (Uncertainty) </span>Users who didn't renew would continue to have a functional operating system, but would lose access to live updates and all related cloud services.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There 's already been a lot of talk about this potential shift in the tech community , and I <b>believe</b> the `` free '' Windows 10 update is just the first step .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is n't really a new challenge for Microsoft , but competition is nibbling at all edges of Microsoft 's dominance from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Hewlett-Packard ( NYSE : HPQ ) and IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) with cloud services to Google , Apple , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> with personal devices and products . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Microsoft 's push into mobile phones and the Surface tablet have been decent endeavors , but like so many Microsoft initiatives in the 2000s ( except for the wildly successful Xbox ) , both <b>appear</b> to simply be `` mediocre-at-best defense . ''  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> MSFT is finally getting ahead of the curve with Office 365 , Windows 10 , Azure and the Xbox One integration , but we 've seen these false starts before .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The true <b>risk</b> to Microsoft investors is n't that they fail to recognize significant growth , as they have n't had significant growth since the late 1990s , but rather that their pseudo monopolies fall apart .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Having sampled <b>nearly</b> all of the alternatives to Office I think Microsoft 's grip on this market is as strong as ever , but nothing is ever for certain .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I view the <b>risk</b> from continuing upstarts in a similar vein as the above discussion - nothing will fundamentally challenge MSFT 's dominance , but many new products will eat away at the majority of future growth initiatives .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>My largest <b>fear</b> as an investor is that MSFT will get caught in a cycle of acquisitions which are necessary to maintain dominance .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These acquisitions <b>could</b> result in expanding capex requirements that essentially `` eat '' all of the growth in operating cash flow from the aforementioned initiatives ( Office 365 , Azure , and Windows 10 + ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe it 's very possible that MSFT 's free cash flow <b>could</b> remain relatively flat for the foreseeable future .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Microsoft has <b>approximately</b> $ 82B in cash ` trapped ' overseas , which has forced them to issue increasing amounts of debt to fund domestic acquisitions , repurchases and dividend payments .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If a substantial `` tax holiday '' does n't occur within the next few years , this <b>could</b> lead to further inefficient purchase decisions .  (Uncertainty) </span>President Obama has proposed a "compromise" of sorts that would levy a one-time tax of 14% on offshore profits while setting the future rate at 19%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe both of these tax rates are unrealistically high , and that this structure <b>could</b> lead to a massive exodus of US corporations .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Assuming</b> repatriation is offered at 15 % , cash-rich firms are still incentivized to pursue foreign growth initiatives even if they are <i>less</i> attractive ( up to 15 % ) than domestic alternatives .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There 's a <b>risk</b> that MSFT will unwisely allocate their non-domestic cash in attempts to avoid further taxation .  (Uncertainty) </span>Former CEO Steve Ballmer was (in my opinion) unfairly blamed for the performance of Microsoft stock, but he was infamous for presiding over an unfriendly corporate culture and for stifling innovation through his repeated restructuring attempts.New CEO, Satya Nadella, has promised to lead innovation in the Cloud and Enterprise sectors and he has a strong record of performance at Microsoft.Nadella has made some key decisions during his first year as CEO including opening up Office Apps to iDevices and Android platforms (note: I commonly use Excel on my iPhone and have been very pleased with its functionality - previously I had been looking into competing options).Microsoft and Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ) announced a landmark deal in 2014 to integrate several of their products.Microsoft also teamed up with Dropbox to enhance operability with Office (note: Dropbox is an essential part of my personal finance business, I have managed to keep my costs at $0, but I would be willing to pay for this quality in the future).Despite the many promising initiatives Nadella has brought to Microsoft, recent restructuring moves raise additional questions of leadership focus.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Nadella has cut <b>nearly</b> 20k jobs ( albeit mostly Nokia-related ) and has lost seven key executives in the past few months .  (Uncertainty) </span>Overall reviews of Nadella's success remain mixed, and I'm not personally convinced yet.The majority of the stock performance over the past two years is due only to perceptions and not to any real fundamental improvements.As I've previously discussed in my other blue chip articles, I prefer to utilize an average price to free cash flow ratio in my valuation targets.My broad range is typically from 10-20x (5-10% yield).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With a company like MSFT with a clear moat and global scale , and <b>nearly</b> unsurpassed quality and staying power in the tech sector , I am comfortable with a long-term ( five-year ) average multiple of 15-20x ( 5-6 .7 % yield ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The three-year average captures some of their <i>higher</i> capex flows due to a few key acquisitions including Nokia 's phone ops , Yammer and Skype , which keeps the cash flow picture <i>more</i> conservative .  (Surprise) </span>MSFT pays a healthy dividend, but FCF is the important metric to track.The averages are shown in the chart below.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The five - and three-year averages are similar as <i>higher</i> recent operating cash flow has given way to <i>higher</i> capex , primarily in the form of acquisitions .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Taking the <i>more</i> conservative three-year average and applying a 15x-20x range results in a `` fair '' market capitalization of $ 315B to $ 420B .  (Surprise) </span>With 8.09B shares outstanding as of 16 April 2015, the fair price range for MSFT is $38.94 to $51.92.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe this range is fair , but it shows that Microsoft 's current price of $ 46.10 is hardly a `` bargain '' at a relative FCF multiple of <b>nearly</b> 18x .  (Uncertainty) </span>MSFT has a history of questionable management decisions on the macro scale, primarily in terms of new product development and marketing, but it is a well-managed firm overall in terms of market domination, production efficiency and profitability.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Choosing the mid-point of my valuation range ( 15-20x 3y average free cash flow ) leads to a price target of $ 45.43 , <b>roughly</b> in-line with the current market pricing .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> shares of MSFT are fairly priced and should be included as a component of a diversified blue chip portfolio , but they are nothing to get excited about .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I 'm long MSFT at a basis in the mid - $ 20s I sold shares last year due to outsized portfolio <b>exposure</b> and <i>cheaper</i> alternatives , but would consider adding <i>more</i> shares if they dip <i>closer</i> to a 15x FCF range .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I would be comfortable holding my current allocation of shares until the low/mid $50s.The only trade I've made in MSFT since 2011 is shown below.Source: Microsoft: Attractive Investment Despite Richer Valuation Disclosure: I am/we are long MSFT, IBM.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .
