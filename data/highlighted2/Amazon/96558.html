''  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> MSFT is finally getting ahead of the curve with Office 365 , Windows 10 , Azure and the Xbox One integration , but we 've seen these false starts before .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The true <b>risk</b> to Microsoft investors is n't that they fail to recognize significant growth , as they have n't had significant growth since the late 1990s , but rather that their pseudo monopolies fall apart .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Having sampled <b>nearly</b> all of the alternatives to Office I think Microsoft 's grip on this market is as strong as ever , but nothing is ever for certain .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I view the <b>risk</b> from continuing upstarts in a similar vein as the above discussion - nothing will fundamentally challenge MSFT 's dominance , but many new products will eat away at the majority of future growth initiatives .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>My largest <b>fear</b> as an investor is that MSFT will get caught in a cycle of acquisitions which are necessary to maintain dominance .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These acquisitions <b>could</b> result in expanding capex requirements that essentially `` eat '' all of the growth in operating cash flow from the aforementioned initiatives ( Office 365 , Azure , and Windows 10 + ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe it 's very possible that MSFT 's free cash flow <b>could</b> remain relatively flat for the foreseeable future .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Microsoft has <b>approximately</b> $ 82B in cash ` trapped ' overseas , which has forced them to issue increasing amounts of debt to fund domestic acquisitions , repurchases and dividend payments .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If a substantial `` tax holiday '' does n't occur within the next few years , this <b>could</b> lead to further inefficient purchase decisions .  (Uncertainty) </span>President Obama has proposed a "compromise" of sorts that would levy a one-time tax of 14% on offshore profits while setting the future rate at 19%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe both of these tax rates are unrealistically high , and that this structure <b>could</b> lead to a massive exodus of US corporations .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Assuming</b> repatriation is offered at 15 % , cash-rich firms are still incentivized to pursue foreign growth initiatives even if they are <i>less</i> attractive ( up to 15 % ) than domestic alternatives .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There 's a <b>risk</b> that MSFT will unwisely allocate their non-domestic cash in attempts to avoid further taxation .  (Uncertainty) </span>Former CEO Steve Ballmer was (in my opinion) unfairly blamed for the performance of Microsoft stock, but he was infamous for presiding over an unfriendly corporate culture and for stifling innovation through his repeated restructuring attempts.New CEO, Satya Nadella, has promised to lead innovation in the Cloud and Enterprise sectors and he has a strong record of performance at Microsoft.Nadella has made some key decisions during his first year as CEO including opening up Office Apps to iDevices and Android platforms (note: I commonly use Excel on my iPhone and have been very pleased with its functionality - previously I had been looking into competing options).Microsoft and Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ) announced a landmark deal in 2014 to integrate several of their products.Microsoft also teamed up with Dropbox to enhance operability with Office (note: Dropbox is an essential part of my personal finance business, I have managed to keep my costs at $0, but I would be willing to pay for this quality in the future).Despite the many promising initiatives Nadella has brought to Microsoft, recent restructuring moves raise additional questions of leadership focus.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Nadella has cut <b>nearly</b> 20k jobs ( albeit mostly Nokia-related ) and has lost seven key executives in the past few months .  (Uncertainty) </span>Overall reviews of Nadella's success remain mixed, and I'm not personally convinced yet.The majority of the stock performance over the past two years is due only to perceptions and not to any real fundamental improvements.As I've previously discussed in my other blue chip articles, I prefer to utilize an average price to free cash flow ratio in my valuation targets.My broad range is typically from 10-20x (5-10% yield).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With a company like MSFT with a clear moat and global scale , and <b>nearly</b> unsurpassed quality and staying power in the tech sector , I am comfortable with a long-term ( five-year ) average multiple of 15-20x ( 5-6 .7 % yield ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The three-year average captures some of their <i>higher</i> capex flows due to a few key acquisitions including Nokia 's phone ops , Yammer and Skype , which keeps the cash flow picture <i>more</i> conservative .  (Surprise) </span>MSFT pays a healthy dividend, but FCF is the important metric to track.The averages are shown in the chart below.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The five - and three-year averages are similar as <i>higher</i> recent operating cash flow has given way to <i>higher</i> capex , primarily in the form of acquisitions .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Taking the <i>more</i> conservative three-year average and applying a 15x-20x range results in a `` fair '' market capitalization of $ 315B to $ 420B .  (Surprise) </span>With 8.09B shares outstanding as of 16 April 2015, the fair price range for MSFT is $38.94 to $51.92.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe this range is fair , but it shows that Microsoft 's current price of $ 46.10 is hardly a `` bargain '' at a relative FCF multiple of <b>nearly</b> 18x .  (Uncertainty) </span>MSFT has a history of questionable management decisions on the macro scale, primarily in terms of new product development and marketing, but it is a well-managed firm overall in terms of market domination, production efficiency and profitability.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Choosing the mid-point of my valuation range ( 15-20x 3y average free cash flow ) leads to a price target of $ 45.43 , <b>roughly</b> in-line with the current market pricing .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> shares of MSFT are fairly priced and should be included as a component of a diversified blue chip portfolio , but they are nothing to get excited about .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I 'm long MSFT at a basis in the mid - $ 20s I sold shares last year due to outsized portfolio <b>exposure</b> and <i>cheaper</i> alternatives , but would consider adding <i>more</i> shares if they dip <i>closer</i> to a 15x FCF range .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I would be comfortable holding my current allocation of shares until the low/mid $50s.The only trade I've made in MSFT since 2011 is shown below.Source: Microsoft: Attractive Investment Despite Richer Valuation Disclosure: I am/we are long MSFT, IBM.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .
