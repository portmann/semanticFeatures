associated with The Walt Disney Co NYSE DIS yet that is exactly what the venerable entertainment combine is doing these days Virtually alone among American entertainment creators Disney has reported steadily growing revenues Disneys revenue grew by billion in topping billion for the first time by rising to billion in the fourth quarter The Magic Kingdom started the year at billion in the fourthquarter and just kept growing and growing bucking the trend in the entertainment business Time Warner NYSE TWX saw its revenues grow from billion in December to billion in June then fall to billion in the fourth quarter Buffett favorite TwentyFirst Century Fox NASDAQ FOXA saw nothing but decline in Rupert Murdochs movie studio began the year with billion in December and finished with billion in the fourthquarter a revenue drop of billion for Viacom NASDAQ VIA NASDAQ VIAB which owns Paramount reported a revenue decline of million Its revenue fell from billion in December to billion in the fourthquarter The only major entertainment purveyor besides Disney that reported some revenue growth was CBS NYSE CBS which is basically a TV network CBS began the year with a TTM revenue of billion in the fourthquarter that rose to billion by the end of fourthquarter That is a nice rise considering the losses at Fox although still down from the billion the company reported in December This might indicate that CBSs digital strategy of promoting its TV shows online is paying off Another possibility is increased advertising revenue CBS will have two big ad revenue boosters this year the Super Bowl and the ongoing elections in the United States in which candidates and their supporters are expected to spend several hundred million dollars on political advertising The secret to Disneys success on the other hand is not very hard to figure out It can be summarized by two names Star Wars and Marvel as in Marvel Comics Much of Disneys success in recent years comes from its purchase of those two iconic franchises The latest Star Wars movie alone The Force Awakens grossed billion at the box office as of March Marvels The Avengers grossed around billion in worldwide release The Force Awakens and The Avengers both pop up on the top five list of top grossing films of the past years or so Okay this is very good for Disneys balance sheet The company reported a net income of billion a diluted earnings per share of a profit margin of a free cash flow of million billion in cash from operations and billion in cash and shortterm investments in the fourth quarter of That means Disney has enough float to make up for the decline of its American TV networks such as ABC and ESPN It also has the resources to weather the shift from broadcast and cable TV to streaming video However Disney has lagged in creating its own distribution channels preferring to take advantage of those already created by Netflix NASDAQ NFLX and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN The question we have to ask is how long can Disney sustain this success Just how many Star Wars films and superhero stories does the public want to see Many people were already tired of the Star Wars hype before The Force Awakens premiered Marvel is even more problematic Disney does not even own the movie rights to some of the most popular Marvel superheroes The XMen and Wolverine belong to Fox SpiderMan to Sony NYSE SNE and I forget who has the Fantastic Four Oh and Universal has the rights to the Hulk and presumably the SheHulk Although Universal and Sony now let the Hulk and SpiderMan appear in the Avengers because of its success To make matters worse Marvels producers are already scratching the bottom of the barrel as superheroes go Theyve brought Deadpool and The Guardians of the Galaxy to the big screen One has to wonder are Machine Man Beta Ray Bill Iron Fist and Quasar movies coming next What happens when audiences get sick and tired of Star Wars and Marvel superheroes There are not that many pop culture franchises with the cachet and depth of Marvel and Star Wars out there Nor are the few that are likely to be for sale any time soon It is hard to imagine CBS and Paramount selling Star Trek Time Warner giving up DC Comics Superman Batman and all their friends or the BBC parting with Doctor Who This means Disney might not be a good longterm investment but it should make some money in the short term Investors will not be disappointed by it in the here and now DIS offered shareholders a return on equity and a dividend yield of It was also undervalued with an enterprise value of billion and a market cap of billion If you are looking for a safe entertainment stock with growth potential check out Disney It is not exactly a value investment but it is a very good company those who buy it will not be disappointed Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Services Entertainment Diversified </div></body></html>
