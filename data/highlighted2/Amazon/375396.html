The question we have to ask is how long can Disney sustain this success?Just how many Star Wars films and superhero stories does the public want to see?Many people were already tired of the Star Wars hype before The Force Awakens premiered.Marvel is even more problematic.Disney does not even own the movie rights to some of the most popular Marvel superheroes.The X-Men and Wolverine belong to Fox, Spider-Man to Sony (NYSE: SNE ) and I forget who has the Fantastic Four.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Oh , and Universal has the rights to the Hulk and <b>presumably</b> the She-Hulk .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although Universal and Sony now let the Hulk and Spider-Man <b>appear</b> in the Avengers because of its success .  (Uncertainty) </span>To make matters worse, Marvel's producers are already scratching the bottom of the barrel as superheroes go.They've brought Deadpool and The Guardians of the Galaxy to the big screen.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>One has to <b>wonder</b> , are Machine Man , Beta Ray Bill , Iron Fist and Quasar movies coming next ?  (Surprise) </span>What happens when audiences get sick and tired of Star Wars and Marvel superheroes?There are not that many pop culture franchises with the cachet and depth of Marvel and Star Wars out there.Nor are the few that are likely to be for sale any time soon.It is hard to imagine CBS and Paramount selling Star Trek, Time Warner giving up DC Comics (Superman, Batman and all their friends) or the BBC parting with Doctor Who.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This means Disney <b>might</b> not be a good long-term investment , but it should make some money in the short term .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Investors will not be <b>disappointed</b> by it in the here and now .  (Surprise) </span>DIS offered shareholders a 20.16% return on equity and a dividend yield of 1.4%.It was also undervalued with an enterprise value of $177.18 billion and a market cap of $159.8 billion.If you are looking for a safe entertainment stock with growth potential, check out Disney.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is not exactly a value investment , but it is a very good company ; those who buy it will not be <b>disappointed</b> .
