class='textDiv'>WalMart Earnings Preview Is Home Depots Strategy The Ticket To WalMarts Resurgence WalMart Stores Inc NYSEWMT Seeking Alpha WalMart is at a critical technical level A heavy volume trade through and the stock could be broken Looking at the WalMart US segment there appears to be an operating margin problem WalMarts US revenue growth has actually been improving while Sams and International remain volatile WalMart NYSE WMT the worlds largest retailer and the every day low price EDLP leader until <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN came along will report its fiscal Q financial results before the opening bell on Tuesday August Street consensus per Thomson Reuters is expecting in earnings per share EPS on billion in revenue for an expected yy decline of in EPS and flat or just a slight growth in revenue The consensus Q EPS estimate has fallen from as of the May earnings release to today while the consensus revenue estimate has fallen from billion as of the May release to billion today or roughly a billion deceleration While WMT is expecting just flat revenue growth in and revenue growth in fiscal and thanks to pressure from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>If readers would jump to the table below you will see that while WMT US essentially the US SuperCenter and big box business is seeing improving revenue the US segments operating margins have begun to suffer The reason is pretty clear too WalMart is in the proverbial death match with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and it is not scheduled to end anytime soon Joe Nocera the famed New York Times business writer who had a featured column in the Saturday business section once wrote in that column in the early s that WalMart was probably the single largest reason that inflation remained subdued during the late s early s In hindsight maybe technology had something to do with that low inflation rate but today and certainly since the late s and during the decade of the s Amazons emergence and its price leadership has pressured even WalMarts pricing ability and likely continued to keep a lid on the core CPI WalMarts recent initiative to pay core employees a higher wage is likely a smart move to retain store employees and ultimately improve store productivity July retail sales With WMT accounting for roughly of all retail sales and the July retail sales just reported Thursday August investors and those that follow economic data found that exauto and exgas July retail sales rose and overall Per Bespokes excellent research some of which can be found freeofcharge on Seeking Alpha the strongest sector for the month was NonStore online retail sales which grew mm The point of this is that brickandmortar particularly general merchandise retailers some of which reported tough quarters this week such as Macys NYSE M and Kohls NYSE KSS no positions continue to suffer from the migration to ecommerce and online shopping This should not be a big surprise to readers but the point being again that with WalMart having such a large retail market share the pressure on their topline from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>must be excruciating Also ecommerce is a doubleedge sword for WMT since the retailer is having to really ramp up its spending on WalMartcom Some think that WMT has the advantage in the ecommerce war since the stores can act as a shipping point or even a pickup point for customers but how delivery sameday overnight Uber LYFT etc is managed and ultimately falls out will likely matter quite a bit Signs of improvement However there have been some small signs of improvement the last few quarters Traffic has been positive the last two quarters albeit only to a small extent and exgas comps have been positive the last four quarters or at least three of those quarters were positive and the other quarter was flat at The challenge WalMart is having is that with pressure from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and the dollar stores it has had to use ticket to stabilize comps so in effect WMT has had to strategically raise prices to stabilize comps which is basically anathema to its business model Since last inventory growth has exceeded sales growth for all but one of those quarters but that difference has started to diminish In the April quarter inventory grew while revenue was flat yy so WMT is adjusting the model to slower revenue growth Gross margin has been positive the last two quarters after falling yy the previous four quarters The new urban stores like Walmart Neighborhood and Walmart Express have been comping midsingle digits This is WalMarts answer to incredibly enlightened urban areas like Chicago and other major cities that are antiWalMart WalMarts disclosure in its quarterly earnings reports is excellent It provides investors with a lot of useful detail WalMart US This table surprised me in that it shows WMT US has an operating margin problem in the US which is predominantly WMT SuperCenters and WalMart ecommerce Revenue growth of is pretty decent particularly given the pressure by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>however it is clear that WMT US operating margin has been under pressure for the last quarters Sams The warehouse club game has been won by Costco NASDAQ COST by a pretty substantial margin but Sams at least according to the above table hasnt seen a revenue or operating margin issue until the last two quarters I dont have much insight into the division other than COST seems to have won the market share and best in show battle International Mexico and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act still lingers as an expense issue International is roughly of total revenue and of operating profit Summaryconclusion What is the end game for WMT in a incredibly competitive US market with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and other lowcost providers Here is an article written a few months ago wondering if Home Depots NYSE HD strategy of fewer stores less headcount and tremendous return of capital to shareholders is something WalMart could duplicate Home Depot has opened four stores in the last year and has kept its square footage basically flat Comps have improved dramatically with store productivity and the free cash flow generation being enormous HDs stock has risen from to in about four years Technically WMT needs to hold the level hit in early during the halycon days of largecap growth and tech in the late s A trade below the level could indicate that WMT management isnt ready to change their stripes and focus on shareholder returns The stock is oversold on the daily and weekly charts to a pretty strong degree The is an important level in my opinion Fundamentally WMT is not really cheap on any metric other than the x pricetoquarter trailing sales At x cash flow the retailer isnt compelling with little revenue or earnings growth and flat comps at least thus far Sentiment Given the fundamentals and the stock price action sentiment around WMT is probably as negative as it has been in years That is a good contrarian sign but still WMT management must make the store and productivity changes to drive EPS growth in a challenged revenue environment Positive signs I would love to see come Tuesday morning August th Upside surprise on quarterly comps say with traffic growth and a slight decline in average ticket An upside revenue surprise WMT has missed on the revenue consensus of the last quarters per my internal spreadsheet Some strong indication by management including Doug McMillon that maybe fewer stores less headcount and a better US segment operating margin could generate excess capital that could be returned to shareholders Slower store growth which means less capex WMTs capex is currently of its cash flow while HDs capex is of its cash flow Today I would much rather own WalMart than Home Depot after Home Depots run and current valuation Per Morningstar WMT still has widemoat status which is a far better designation than many mass merchandise retailers garner but I think WMT needs to focus on operating margins and returning more capital to shareholders WalMart and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>are the two premier retailers in America today and neither is really going away Unless it is partandparcel or really integral to an ecommerce strategy which maybe I dont understand yet does WMT management really think the future is more and bigger US SuperCenters in America A roughly position in WMT and a similar position is held for clients in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Im happy with both right now It is highly unlikely that WMT will be traded prior to Tuesdays earnings release and the technical action in the stock
