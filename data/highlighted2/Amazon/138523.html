(Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Therefore , investors who want <b>exposure</b> into web TV do n't have a long list of candidate to choose from .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix secured huge wins in the early innings of the Internet TV space.The company signed a deal with Disney (NYSE: DIS ), and launched various in-house productions.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This keeps the process of content bidding a bit <i>more</i> honest as Netflix can always revert to <i>more</i> in-house content to avoid price gouging .  (Surprise) </span>Netflix expanded internationally, so it will also have a global base of subscribers to market content to, which creates trouble for regionally locked content studios.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The ability to source <i>higher</i> quality content becomes <i>easier</i> when you operate on a 30 % growth rate for revenues .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>MVPDs ( multichannel video programming distributors ) are n't growing at the same rate as Netflix , so eventually ; the competing economics of content deals for online streaming becomes <i>better</i> whereas deals with MVPDs become <i>less</i> desirable .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When <b>assuming</b> a 30 % top line growth rate , Netflix 's revenue will reach $ 20 billion by 2020 .  (Uncertainty) </span>The growth will have to accelerate by 5 points, but I think that's feasible given the adoption rate of 4K TVs, and the robust growth in international subscribers (68.5% year-over-year growth in Q2 2015).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The movement of domestic subscribers to <i>higher</i> pricing tiers will eventually materialize by 2017 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I also think international subscriber growth will be driven by China , as a wave of deregulation will make it <i>easier</i> for Netflix to launch its streaming service in the mainland .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>My long-run net income forecast is $ 3 billion on a 15 % profit margin <b>assumption</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The company <b>may</b> produce <i>higher</i> margins , but given the rapid investment into content and in-house productions , I 've tempered my expectations on margins .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Netflix were to trade at <b>perhaps</b> 60 times earnings , the stock would be worth $ 180 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>Even at 45 times earnings the stock would be worth $135 billion.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The valuation will contract from 240 times earnings , but <b>anticipating</b> a <i>more</i> rapid reduction in valuation would be ridiculous .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>For those reasons, I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation on Netflix.Sure, the company isn't cheap, but I wouldn't say the stock is overvalued either.The stock will simply justify the valuation by sustaining a high pace of growth.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .
