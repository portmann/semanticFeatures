( NYSE : WMT ) | Seeking Alpha WMT recently revamped and expanded ShippingPass to look <i>more</i> like an abridged and <i>cheaper</i> version of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>There is a significant overlap in Netflix and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime 's sub bases . This overlap implies tremendous opportunity for ShippingPass to disrupt the market.Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) recently revamped and expanded ShippingPass , the retailer 's response to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Prime . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>ShippingPass now looks a lot like an abridged and <i>cheaper</i> version of Prime , offering unlimited , free 2-day shipping on select items for $ 49 per year .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is also no <i>longer</i> invite-only .  (Surprise) </span>ShippingPass doesn't offer any of the additional perks of Prime, like access to music and video streaming services, but the cost reflects this (half the cost of Prime on an annual basis).We argue that ShippingPass will provide immediate benefits to WMT , and that this benefit will likely coincide with increased <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime churn . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On its face , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime offers a much <i>more</i> compelling value proposition than ShippingPass . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Prime offers a streaming video service and free shipping on 30 million products for $99 per year.A Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and ShippingPass combo membership would cost $158 per year, and ShippingPass offers free, 2-day shipping on only 1 million products.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While there are several <b>hidden</b> costs with Instant Video ( several of the movies are n't included with Prime and have a rental fee ) , Prime still looks like a <i>more</i> compelling value proposition than the Netflix-ShippingPass combo .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This analysis , though , <b>assumes</b> that Netflix and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime are mutually exclusive ( you either have one or the other ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The truth is they are far from mutually exclusive, and this is to WMT's advantage.In the US , UK , and Germany , half of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime 's members also subscribe to Netflix . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The reason for this overlap is <b>ambiguous</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>The content offerings of Instant Video and Netflix are unique, with each service having its own content niche.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Richard Broughton of Ampere research notes the following : Netflix has focused on drama , action , crime and comedy , while <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime skews <i>more</i> toward documentaries , family and children 's movies . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> also has a focus on <i>older</i> titles - 18,000 movies and 4,500 TV shows to Netflix 's 11,300 movies and 5,500 TV shows . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>We argue , though , that the reason for the overlap is how consumers view <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime 's main benefit is the free shipping perk , not a half-free video streaming service or any other under-used perk wrapped into Prime . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Data actually seems to <b>suggest</b> that a significant number of Prime subs do not make use of those additional perks , so there is a large market of consumers paying $ 99 exclusively for a free shipping benefit .  (Uncertainty) </span>While Prime Music has "several million people" using it, that is a fraction of the 40 million Prime sub base.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The consensus <b>seems</b> to be it is a value-added service , but it simply is n't used by a majority of Prime subs .  (Uncertainty) </span>Usage of Instant Video implies a similar conclusion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some data <b>suggests</b> that 40 % of Prime subs solely use Netflix ( meaning 4 out of every 10 Prime subs do not use Instant Video at all ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>In other words, consumers are using Prime mainly for its shipping perks, not for the video or music streaming service wrapped into the membership cost.Those consumers now have the option to subscribe to a service that offers free shipping for half the cost.To the 40 % of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ~ 40 million members who solely use Netflix ( 16 million members ) , it makes economic sense to drop <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime and pick-up ShippingPass . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Those consumers wo n't miss any of the perks that come with Prime outside of free shipping ( because they do n't use them ) , and they will reap <b>almost</b> identical benefits for $ 50 <i>less</i> per year .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Because of the tremendous overlap in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime and Netflix sub base , we think there is tremendous opportunity for ShippingPass , priced at half the cost of Prime , to disrupt Prime and provide immediate benefits to WMT . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We are unsure at this juncture how much market share ShippingPass will consume , but it seems like it <b>could</b> steal up to 16 million members from Prime .
