an abridged and cheaper version of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime There is a significant overlap in Netflix and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Primes sub bases This overlap implies tremendous opportunity for ShippingPass to disrupt the market WalMart NYSE WMT recently revamped and expanded ShippingPass the retailers response to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Prime ShippingPass now looks a lot like an abridged and cheaper version of Prime offering unlimited free day shipping on select items for per year It is also no longer inviteonly ShippingPass doesnt offer any of the additional perks of Prime like access to music and video streaming services but the cost reflects this half the cost of Prime on an annual basis We argue that ShippingPass will provide immediate benefits to WMT and that this benefit will likely coincide with increased <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime churn On its face <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime offers a much more compelling value proposition than ShippingPass Prime offers a streaming video service and free shipping on million products for per year A Netflix NASDAQ NFLX and ShippingPass combo membership would cost per year and ShippingPass offers free day shipping on only million products While there are several hidden costs with Instant Video several of the movies arent included with Prime and have a rental fee Prime still looks like a more compelling value proposition than the NetflixShippingPass combo This analysis though assumes that Netflix and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime are mutually exclusive you either have one or the other The truth is they are far from mutually exclusive and this is to WMTs advantage In the US UK and Germany half of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Primes members also subscribe to Netflix The reason for this overlap is ambiguous The content offerings of Instant Video and Netflix are unique with each service having its own content niche Richard Broughton of Ampere research notes the following Netflix has focused on drama action crime and comedy while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime skews more toward documentaries family and childrens movies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>also has a focus on older titles movies and TV shows to Netflixs movies and TV shows We argue though that the reason for the overlap is how consumers view <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Primes main benefit is the free shipping perk not a halffree video streaming service or any other underused perk wrapped into Prime Data actually seems to suggest that a significant number of Prime subs do not make use of those additional perks so there is a large market of consumers paying exclusively for a free shipping benefit While Prime Music has several million people using it that is a fraction of the million Prime sub base The consensus seems to be it is a valueadded service but it simply isnt used by a majority of Prime subs Usage of Instant Video implies a similar conclusion Some data suggests that of Prime subs solely use Netflix meaning out of every Prime subs do not use Instant Video at all In other words consumers are using Prime mainly for its shipping perks not for the video or music streaming service wrapped into the membership cost Those consumers now have the option to subscribe to a service that offers free shipping for half the cost To the of Amazons million members who solely use Netflix million members it makes economic sense to drop <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and pickup ShippingPass Those consumers wont miss any of the perks that come with Prime outside of free shipping because they dont use them and they will reap almost identical benefits for less per year Because of the tremendous overlap in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and Netflix sub base we think there is tremendous opportunity for ShippingPass priced at half the cost of Prime to disrupt Prime and provide immediate benefits to WMT We are unsure at this juncture how much market share ShippingPass will consume but it seems like it could steal up to million members from Prime I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from
