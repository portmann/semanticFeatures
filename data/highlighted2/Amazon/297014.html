(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long AMZN, GOOGL, CMCSA.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .  (Surprise) </span>I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With 75 million paid subscribers how much <i>further</i> can it go ?  (Surprise) </span>One, I like Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ).It's a good service, and well-run.Second, I don't like to short stocks.It's not in my investment DNA.But the best short I can find on the whole market board, right now, is Netflix.And the reason for that is as basic as any Management 101 course.It's the "S-Curve."(This one came from Marv Langston's Smart Future blog. )Every technology company has to face the "S-Curve," which defines the market's acceptance of what it sells, and its pricing power.New companies meet demand slowly, starting with technophiles, then early adopters.At some point they hit the mass market, and here is where profits can be maximized.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At some point , when most potential buyers have the product , competition emerges , pricing power deterioriates , and while a well-run company may continue to prosper , its days as a <b>speculative</b> buy are over .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We saw this with Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) and the iPhone , which is why that company trades at a price/earnings multiple <i>closer</i> to 10 than to 30 , even with a dividend and the wind at its back .  (Surprise) </span>We see this with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), and we saw it with the PC makers.The only force that can then expand the multiple is a new product.Over the last year Netflix stock is up 126%, and it's up over 300% in the last five.It has evolved from a service that mailed DVDs to one that streams and produces its own shows.It has evolved from a library to a studio.And Reed Hastings has done a masterful job as CEO.The numbers are impressive.Top-line growth of 25% per year.A balance sheet where only $1 in each four is subject to debt.Operating cash flow holding its own despite this superior growth.And a growing library of shows and movies that are going to make money for decades to come.This article was first written before the latest earnings release came out showing net income of $43 million on revenue of $1.8 billion for the quarter, $1.22 billion on revenue of $6.8 billion for the year.The earnings sent the stock up another 8% in after-hours trading, to about $117/share.That's just the problem.Things are really, really good.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Right now people are paying <i>more</i> than 6 times those 2015 sales for this company , and a P/E of 287 .  (Surprise) </span>But while it strides across Hollywood like a colossus Netflix remains, in terms of revenue, a relative minnow.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( Time Warner ( NYSE : TWX ) will do <i>more</i> than $ 28 billion in revenue when it reports its 2015 numbers . )  (Surprise) </span>And the posse is on its tail.Time Warner has HBO to Go.Cable operators have combined to offer Hulu Plus.Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is adding a paid tier to YouTube.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) is offering cheap carriage to all these players , and <i>more</i> , while at the same time competing with them through Prime Video . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>How is Netflix going to grow from here?The company had about 75 million streaming customers at the end of the year, up from 69 million just three months ago.How long can it keep that up?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The days of fast growth have end <b>sometime</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Launching 11 new shows is a huge financial challenge especially on monthly fees that can't easily rise.The question for Netflix investors isn't one of saturation, but of maturation, the point where the easy-to-reach part of the market has all been harvested.In its most recent quarterly report Netflix management crowed about its international growth.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But the market is n't looking for <i>more</i> international <b>exposure</b> now .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I would argue that there are now three main networks - Netflix , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime and Time Warner 's HBO , replacing the old TV triumvirate of ABC ( NYSE : DIS ) , CBS ( NYSE : CBS ) and NBC ( NASDAQ : CMCSA ) . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Maybe you can add Hulu ( <b>maybe</b> they 're Fox ( NASDAQ : FOX ) ( NASDAQ : FOXA ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>Google?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>is starting to look <i>more</i> like the WB .  (Surprise) </span>Many of the companies Netflix now competes with, including Google and Comcast, are also ISPs.Everyone is trying to rush through the same door, getting subscription revenue directly from consumers for goods that used to be bundled through cable operators.You will ask , how can I remain bullish on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> yet say short Netflix ? <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's because <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has a lot <i>more</i> going for it than just the video service . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> still does n't get a huge share of the American retail market , the cloud has just begun to hit the numbers , and there are service revenues that have just begun to grow . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is at the front of the `` S '' - Netflix is <i>closer</i> to the back end . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Over the next year Netflix' pricing power is going to be tested, as it is expected to raise prices to $10/month from $8.Over the next five years tens of millions of people are likely to cut their cable or satellite subscriptions, but most will still have Internet contracts, wired or wireless or (most likely) both.Add those costs to a few Netflix-like services and you're getting pretty close to the cost of today's bundles.It's not about saving money.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even Netflix <b>may</b> , in the future , decide that the way to grow is with `` specialty '' channels - comedy and drama and children 's .  (Uncertainty) </span>How many of those can it sell to each customer?At some point, people will recognize, it will be about the cost and value of their own time.There just aren't enough free hours in a day to watch everything available to you from even one of these services.As people learn to value their time, how many subscriptions will survive?Not many.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Netflix <b>may</b> be a survivor in that environment , but how much <i>bigger</i> will it be than it is ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>How much <i>further</i> can they push the price envelope ?  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They <b>could</b> try to do pay-per-view , but <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> already does that , and it 's not that big a business . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Yes, there is potential internationally.But there is also push-back.The effort by Netflix to enforce country code rules - to go to war against some of its own customers - is just the first indication of what's coming.To survive in the global market, Netflix will have to self-censor, and bow to local governments' wishes.It is, frankly, hard for me to see this working out well for Netflix, in terms of growth and its corporate soul.But in the end it gets down to that "S-curve."Once investors recognize that Netflix is at or even near the top of the "S," once the market turns away from initial purchases and toward replacement, it will be "game over" for Netflix as a premium investment.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I suspect that day is <i>closer</i> than most investors realize .  (Surprise) </span></div></body></html>
