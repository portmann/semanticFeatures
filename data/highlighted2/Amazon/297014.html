Over the next year Netflix' pricing power is going to be tested, as it is expected to raise prices to $10/month from $8.Over the next five years tens of millions of people are likely to cut their cable or satellite subscriptions, but most will still have Internet contracts, wired or wireless or (most likely) both.Add those costs to a few Netflix-like services and you're getting pretty close to the cost of today's bundles.It's not about saving money.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even Netflix <b>may</b> , in the future , decide that the way to grow is with `` specialty '' channels - comedy and drama and children 's .  (Uncertainty) </span>How many of those can it sell to each customer?At some point, people will recognize, it will be about the cost and value of their own time.There just aren't enough free hours in a day to watch everything available to you from even one of these services.As people learn to value their time, how many subscriptions will survive?Not many.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix <b>may</b> be a survivor in that environment , but how much bigger will it be than it is ?  (Uncertainty) </span>How much further can they push the price envelope?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They <b>could</b> try to do pay-per-view , but <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> already does that , and it 's not that big a business . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Yes, there is potential internationally.But there is also push-back.The effort by Netflix to enforce country code rules - to go to war against some of its own customers - is just the first indication of what's coming.To survive in the global market, Netflix will have to self-censor, and bow to local governments' wishes.It is, frankly, hard for me to see this working out well for Netflix, in terms of growth and its corporate soul.But in the end it gets down to that "S-curve."Once investors recognize that Netflix is at or even near the top of the "S," once the market turns away from initial purchases and toward replacement, it will be "game over" for Netflix as a premium investment.I suspect that day is closer than most investors realize.</div></body></html>
