receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article With million paid subscribers how much further can it go One I like Netflix NASDAQ NFLX Its a good service and wellrun Second I dont like to short stocks Its not in my investment DNA But the best short I can find on the whole market board right now is Netflix And the reason for that is as basic as any Management course Its the SCurve This one came from Marv Langstons Smart Future blog Every technology company has to face the SCurve which defines the markets acceptance of what it sells and its pricing power New companies meet demand slowly starting with technophiles then early adopters At some point they hit the mass market and here is where profits can be maximized At some point when most potential buyers have the product competition emerges pricing power deterioriates and while a wellrun company may continue to prosper its days as a speculative buy are over We saw this with Apple NASDAQ AAPL and the iPhone which is why that company trades at a priceearnings multiple closer to than to even with a dividend and the wind at its back We see this with Intel NASDAQ INTC and we saw it with the PC makers The only force that can then expand the multiple is a new product Over the last year Netflix stock is up and its up over in the last five It has evolved from a service that mailed DVDs to one that streams and produces its own shows It has evolved from a library to a studio And Reed Hastings has done a masterful job as CEO The numbers are impressive Topline growth of per year A balance sheet where only in each four is subject to debt Operating cash flow holding its own despite this superior growth And a growing library of shows and movies that are going to make money for decades to come This article was first written before the latest earnings release came out showing net income of million on revenue of billion for the quarter billion on revenue of billion for the year The earnings sent the stock up another in afterhours trading to about share Thats just the problem Things are really really good Right now people are paying more than times those sales for this company and a PE of But while it strides across Hollywood like a colossus Netflix remains in terms of revenue a relative minnow Time Warner NYSE TWX will do more than billion in revenue when it reports its numbers And the posse is on its tail Time Warner has HBO to Go Cable operators have combined to offer Hulu Plus Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL is adding a paid tier to YouTube <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN is offering cheap carriage to all these players and more while at the same time competing with them through Prime Video How is Netflix going to grow from here The company had about million streaming customers at the end of the year up from million just three months ago How long can it keep that up The days of fast growth have end sometime Launching new shows is a huge financial challenge especially on monthly fees that cant easily rise The question for Netflix investors isnt one of saturation but of maturation the point where the easytoreach part of the market has all been harvested In its most recent quarterly report Netflix management crowed about its international growth But the market isnt looking for more international exposure now I would argue that there are now three main networks Netflix <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and Time Warners HBO replacing the old TV triumvirate of ABC NYSE DIS CBS NYSE CBS and NBC NASDAQ CMCSA Maybe you can add Hulu maybe theyre Fox NASDAQ FOX NASDAQ FOXA Google is starting to look more like the WB Many of the companies Netflix now competes with including Google and Comcast are also ISPs Everyone is trying to rush through the same door getting subscription revenue directly from consumers for goods that used to be bundled through cable operators You will ask how can I remain bullish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>yet say short Netflix Its because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a lot more going for it than just the video service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>still doesnt get a huge share of the American retail market the cloud has just begun to hit the numbers and there are service revenues that have just begun to grow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is at the front of the S Netflix is closer to the back end Over the next year Netflix pricing power is going to be tested as it is expected to raise prices to month from Over the next five years tens of millions of people are likely to cut their cable or satellite subscriptions but most will still have Internet contracts wired or wireless or most likely both Add those costs to a few Netflixlike services and youre getting pretty close to the cost of todays bundles Its not about saving money Even Netflix may in the future decide that the way to grow is with specialty channels comedy and drama and childrens How many of those can it sell to each customer At some point people will recognize it will be about the cost and value of their own time There just arent enough free hours in a day to watch everything available to you from even one of these services As people learn to value their time how many subscriptions will survive Not many Netflix may be a survivor in that environment but how much bigger will it be than it is How much further can they push the price envelope They could try to do payperview but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>already does that and its not that big a business Yes there is potential internationally But there is also pushback The effort by Netflix to enforce country code rules to go to war against some of its own customers is just the first indication of whats coming To survive in the global market Netflix will have to selfcensor and bow to local governments wishes It is frankly hard for me to see this working out well for Netflix in terms of growth and its corporate soul But in the end it gets down to that Scurve Once investors recognize that Netflix is at or even near the top of the S once the market turns away from initial purchases and toward replacement it will be game over for Netflix as a premium investment I suspect that day is closer than most investors realize </div></body></html>
