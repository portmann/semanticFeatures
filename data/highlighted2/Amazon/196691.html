( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha An August NYT article <b>suggests</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's culture rewards `` superstar chickens '' . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>This past weekend, I spent some time listening to some archived TED talks through my NPR One app and came across a fabulous TED talk about collaboration.One of the speakers was Margaret Heffernan , who is an entrepreneur, executive consultant, and author.Margaret told a fascinating story about a Purdue University evolutionary biologist named William Muir.Mr. Muir created an elaborate scientific study to track the productivity of chicken flocks.I will paraphrase the story, and for interested readers, the full story can be found here .Before you stop reading and say that I 'm `` off the reservation '' crazy , I would argue that lessons from this experiment are warning signs for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) investors . Essentially, Mr. Muir devised an empirical study where he tracked two flocks of chicken over the course of six generations (according to Wikipedia - the average chicken life lasts seven to eight years).The first flock was a team of average "worker bee" chickens that were steady egg producers.The second flock was a team of superstar, alpha chickens at the top of their game measured by their egg production.Over the course of six generations, he tracked, monitored, and plotted the progress of the "worker bee" flock and the "superstar" flock.What he found at the end of the experiment was that the flock of average chickens far surpassed the superstar flock of chicken in every category.In fact, by the end of the experiment, only three sixth generation superstar chickens were alive.The others all died from poor health.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> , this was the result of the caustic flock chemistry and individual ambition over the best interest of the team .  (Uncertainty) </span>Also, the only three surviving chickens were in poor health, measuring by weight, behavior, and evaluating their feathers.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The worker bees ended up thriving in a <i>more</i> hospitable environment .  (Surprise) </span>After hearing this TED talk , I instantly thought of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If half of what The New York Times article wrote was true , then the company <b>could</b> be destined to experience the fate of the superstar chicken folk .  (Uncertainty) </span>There was also a story written by Julia Cheiffetz, shortly after the NYT piece was published.Julia was a former <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> employee . While out on maternity leave, she developed cancer and lost her health insurance coverage.She, too, described a toxic environment of superstar chickens willing to do anything to get ahead.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>hope</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> longs take the time to read the full excerpt of Ms. Heffernan 's TED talk . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>From my perspective , it may foreshadow that the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> dynasty <b>could</b> be threatened . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company 's talent travel up and down the elevator every day , and if Mr. Bezos and his management team do n't treat them well , then other companies will hire them away .  (Uncertainty) </span>In general, I'm not sure that our short-sighted culture of managing to Wall Street's consensus earnings expectations is sustainable, and whether or not the pendulum has swung to the far extreme.Yesterday , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's stock was under pressure , driven by a ChannelAdvisor report that its growth was still solid , but decelerating . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even though the underlying news was fine , investors are <b>nervous</b> and looking to sell at the sign of bad news .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Q3 earnings release is fast approaching , let 's look at the major institutional holders and consensus estimates As we can see Mr. Bezos still holds <b>approximately</b> 84 million shares worth $ 44.77 billion as of yesterday 's close . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>There is only one 5% holder, Capital World Investors.The rest of the ownership is mostly held by the major mutual fund companies.Let 's look at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's market capitalization and consensus estimates Even if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can generate $ 10 billion in cash flow from operations in FY15 , it would still be trading at 25X cash flow . That is insane, especially for a company with a market capitalization of $250 billion.Clearly , Wall Street 's imagination is captivated by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's creative destruction and its no-holds-barred approach . No question, the company's sales growth has been impressive, but valuing a business based on sales growth instead of cash flow is a fool's errand.Lastly , from a sales growth trajectory perspective , what inning is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in to justify its valuation ? I'm applying what I learned from six generation of chicken flocks - always bet on the collaborative work bee flock, and avoid a team of rivals, because Mr. Bezos is no Lincoln.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
