superstar chickens This past weekend I spent some time listening to some archived TED talks through my NPR One app and came across a fabulous TED talk about collaboration One of the speakers was Margaret Heffernan who is an entrepreneur executive consultant and author Margaret told a fascinating story about a Purdue University evolutionary biologist named William Muir Mr Muir created an elaborate scientific study to track the productivity of chicken flocks I will paraphrase the story and for interested readers the full story can be found here Before you stop reading and say that Im off the reservation crazy I would argue that lessons from this experiment are warning signs for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN investors Essentially Mr Muir devised an empirical study where he tracked two flocks of chicken over the course of six generations according to Wikipedia the average chicken life lasts seven to eight years The first flock was a team of average worker bee chickens that were steady egg producers The second flock was a team of superstar alpha chickens at the top of their game measured by their egg production Over the course of six generations he tracked monitored and plotted the progress of the worker bee flock and the superstar flock What he found at the end of the experiment was that the flock of average chickens far surpassed the superstar flock of chicken in every category In fact by the end of the experiment only three sixth generation superstar chickens were alive The others all died from poor health Perhaps this was the result of the caustic flock chemistry and individual ambition over the best interest of the team Also the only three surviving chickens were in poor health measuring by weight behavior and evaluating their feathers The worker bees ended up thriving in a more hospitable environment After hearing this TED talk I instantly thought of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>If half of what The New York Times article wrote was true then the company could be destined to experience the fate of the superstar chicken folk There was also a story written by Julia Cheiffetz shortly after the NYT piece was published Julia was a former <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>employee While out on maternity leave she developed cancer and lost her health insurance coverage She too described a toxic environment of superstar chickens willing to do anything to get ahead I hope <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>longs take the time to read the full excerpt of Ms Heffernans TED talk From my perspective it may foreshadow that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>dynasty could be threatened The companys talent travel up and down the elevator every day and if Mr Bezos and his management team dont treat them well then other companies will hire them away In general Im not sure that our shortsighted culture of managing to Wall Streets consensus earnings expectations is sustainable and whether or not the pendulum has swung to the far extreme Yesterday Amazons stock was under pressure driven by a ChannelAdvisor report that its growth was still solid but decelerating Even though the underlying news was fine investors are nervous and looking to sell at the sign of bad news As Amazons Q earnings release is fast approaching lets look at the major institutional holders and consensus estimates As we can see Mr Bezos still holds approximately million shares worth billion as of yesterdays close There is only one holder Capital World Investors The rest of the ownership is mostly held by the major mutual fund companies Lets look at Amazons market capitalization and consensus estimates Even if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can generate billion in cash flow from operations in FY it would still be trading at X cash flow That is insane especially for a company with a market capitalization of billion Clearly Wall Streets imagination is captivated by Amazons creative destruction and its noholdsbarred approach No question the companys sales growth has been impressive but valuing a business based on sales growth instead of cash flow is a fools errand Lastly from a sales growth trajectory perspective what inning is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in to justify its valuation Im applying what I learned from six generation of chicken flocks always bet on the collaborative work bee flock and avoid a team of rivals because Mr Bezos is no
