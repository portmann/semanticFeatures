</span>not only because Im a Prime member but also due toAmazon warehouse deals I mentioned this little known section of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>before in one of my simple savings Sunday posts Being a deal seeker I try to find the greatest deals that I can wherever I shop I am also an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime member so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is really my one stop shop for many of my products I learned about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>warehouse deals some time agowhen I was searching for a camera lens for my wife If you know about photography then you understand that camera lenses are expensive I am not very savvy when it comes to the camera so my wife told me what type of lens she wanted got to love that With the information in hand I was able to start my search Here is my experience with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>warehouse deals and why I think you should always check there for awesome deals every time you shop on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>My experience with warehouse deals has been verypositive its one of the many ways I show you how to save on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>You should check out this list for over ways <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt really make it easy to find their warehouse deals section If you just start searching using their large search bar then you probably wont find the section If you want to specifically search their warehouse deals then head to this page This is their main warehouse deals section Now anytime you search you should see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Warehouse Deals next to the search box like shown below You can find the warehouse deals when you are on a product page and you are checking the prices You will see the new products first but then you can find the warehouse deals typically listed as Used Click the used link to pull up all of the sellers of the product youre looking for If there are no used prices then they dont have the product selling as a warehouse deal Then look through the listings to find those being sold under <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Warehouse Deals You can use the Prime filter on the side to help that process along Basically warehouse deals consists of products that have been returned damaged at the warehouse used and refurbished These items just dont meet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>s new standard so they list them here They also have some new and openboxed items but there are less of these If you are an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime member then you can get the same day shipping on eligible items <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>thoroughly tests each product to make sure that it is still functional before listing back on sale They even grade their items to help you find ones that you are willing to purchase Some of their grading can be a little general but if you shop there enough you start to understand how they are doing it Here are their product conditions or grades New This means that the product has not been opened but the package has superficial damage These offer new products with discounted prices because the shipping package was damaged Easy way to score a little deal with a brand new product Like New These are typical returns where the customer might pull the item out and then just return it The packaging has been opened but the product is in perfect working order <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will also put some products that have some physical damage to the outer box of the factory sealed item Very Good The item has been tested and verified to work correctly The item may have some cosmetic damage or blemishes Good Items are tested and verified in working order They may be missing accessories or have large cosmetic damage Acceptable Items are still tested and verified in working order There are signs of wear along with possible different packaging and could include third party accessories I tend to only purchase items that are New which are harder to find Like New or Very Good I have purchased quite a few items from warehouse deals and never had an issue with them <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>still stands behind their return policy so if you have any issues then you need to call them up They have excellent customer service when it comes to returns When you see the items listed they will have a little description underneath listing the reason for the listing I have found that these are pretty general but some are quite detailed It really depends on the product Here is an example of one that is good If you find something you like when shopping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>warehouse deals then understand that they typically dont have a lot of deep inventory These are returns and damaged items so they wont have a lot of inventory If you are waiting for it to go on sale you might miss your chance to get the item This is especially important when holiday shopping season comes around When people ask me were to find great deals online I typically tell them about warehouse deals The majority of people I speak with have never heard of it yet they have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>accounts I think this is a great opportunity to find great deals on products that you want or need Yes you do have to be careful of what you order but if you find the right product condition then you will most likely be OK <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has warehouse deals for many great and popular categories like consumer electronics baby products sports outdoor home garden shoes and much more You still get the same great service from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but you can save a good amount of money When I bought the camera lens for my wife I was able to save off the regular price just because the shipping box was damaged The lens had no issues and my wife loved the gift I cant complain there The worst I have had was there was an accessory missing Luckily it only cost me about for a replacement so I considered that a win Some products you can save on while others you can save It really all depends on the item and how long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has had it in their inventory So if you are looking for a good deal while shopping online then check out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>warehouse deals Regular shoppers should be taking advantage of these deals Yes they can be hit or miss but youd never know unless youve checked Before I buy something I will check the warehouse deal section just to be sure I cant find something thats been returned You really never know what you might find If youre really lucky then you might be able to find an <span style='background-color:
