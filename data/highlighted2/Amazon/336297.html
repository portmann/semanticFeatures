(Surprise) </span>Qualcomm confirmed that their flagship Snapdragon 820 would power the latest LG G5, one day ahead of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.A Bloomberg report in early February that Google was poised to endorse Qualcomm's server chip efforts turned out to be a rumor .Hence, we expect that Intel will step up with their data center server chip innovations and pricing, which will put more pressure on Qualcomm shares.Qualcomm has a weight of 8.16% in the SMH ETF.Shares of Qualcomm have performed poorly during the past 10 years.QCOM bounced off a four-year low at $41.85 a share in mid-February and the stock is now trading near the $51 a share trendline resistance level.The stock can make a breakout if it can close and stay above $58 a share, but there are walls of resistances between now and the $58 a share level.There is support at $49 a share level if the stock pulls back.Broadcom Ltd - The acquisition of Broadcom by Avago was completed in early February 2016 and the new company emerged as Broadcom Limited.After the merger, the company became one of largest analog and mixed-signal chip makers for automotive, industrial, and communications, as well as custom network chips.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Broadcom is a major supplier for Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) with revenue <b>exposure</b> of between 10 % and 15 % .
