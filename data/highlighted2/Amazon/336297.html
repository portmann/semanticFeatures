selling prices on the Data Center Group platform have increased only minimally in Intel may want to cut the ASP deeper if enterprise buying remains cool and new competitors Qualcomm and Broadcom become threats Shares of Intel NASDAQ INTC sold off in early January Investors were reluctant to step back in after Gartner said the global outlook for PC shipments in is for a decline of compared with with the potential for a soft recovery in late The PC market is still in the middle of structural change which will reduce the PC installed base in the next few years according to the Gartner report Notebook sales arent doing so great either according to Chris Danely of Citigroup who downgraded the chip sector in February citing that Taiwan notebook ODM shipments declined monthovermonth in January below the threeyear average of being down on a monthtomonth basis The good news for Intel might be that spending for data center systems is projected to grow yearonyear and the demand in this segment is expected to continue to be strong through according to Gartner Intels investors are hoping for a revenue rebound in its lucrative Data Center Group DCG which makes microprocessors chipsets and SoC that are used in servers storage and switches to power data centers In the fourthquarter the company said DCG revenue grew just yearonyear compared to a clip during the same quarter in Most analysts had expected previous doubledigit percentage gains to continue Revenues and operating income growth from the Data Center Group which accounted for and of total revenue and operating income in are decelerating From Intels earnings statements the DCG revenue grew in compared to in while the operating income grew only in compared to the explosive growth of in Notably the average selling prices ASPs on the DCG platform increased just in compared to a increase in while the unit volume growth was in as it was in In fact the ASP during the fourthquarter was down compared to the thirdquarter and to the same quarter in Intel may want to cut the ASP deeper if enterprise buying remains cool and new competitors begin to emerge as they try to maintain the high single digit growth Early in January Annapurna Labs Ltd an Israeli chip designer that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN bought for between and million last year sent out a press release saying it will start rolling out a new line of ARMbased chips called Alpine which can run WiFi routers power connected devices and handle networking and storage functions for data centers The chips will be sold to makers of products for homes and data centers Here is what Intel Senior Vice President General Manager Data Center Group Diane Bryant told Business Insider When you have share of the market youre always looking for where the competition may come in As long as I can give the cloud service providers the best technology I believe customers will continue to rely on us based on the investment that we make Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM announced in midJanuary that it had entered into an agreement with the Chinese province of Guizhou to create a joint venture called Guizhou Huaxintong SemiConductor Technology Co Qualcomm plans to enter the server CPU market that Intel dominates with a customer processor chip built using the ARM architecture which is less expensive and may also consume less power Intel immediately fired back several days later with an announcement of a new joint venture to design chips through a research partnership with Tsinghua University and Montage Technology Global Holdings Intel will put million into the venture Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD announced in January that they had started volume shipments of its Seattle Opteron A ARM processors designed for highdensity server systems The Opteron A chips will power web servers networking appliances and storage arrays So far analyst views on the new AMD bit ARM chip have been mixed Chip companies including Broadcom NASDAQ AVGO Applied Micro NASDAQ AMCC and Cavium NASDAQ CAVM could soon try to take a bite from Intels nearmonopoly market share with their Vulcan bit ARM server processor XGene family of ARM server chips and ThunderX ARM processor respectively In our opinion a real threat to Intels data center market may be still years away since large scale data centers still mainly run on x chips A change in an infrastructure from x to ARM will be quite an undertaking due to enormous investment in hardware and software Intel The acquisition of Altera by Intel was completed in early fiscal year and Altera has emerged as a stand alone unit called the Programmable Solutions Group Intel once said that the company had a plan to create a hybrid XeonFPGA chip that will plug into a single processor socket As competition in the data center business is heating up it is highly critical for Intel to convince Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Facebook NASDAQ FB and others to switch from the graphics processor unit GPU chips to the Intel hybrid XeonFPGA chip to power their artificial intelligence tools including speech recognition image recognition and natural language processing Technically INTC was under selling pressure earlier this year but is on the rebound as analysts had raised concerns over PC and notebook sales during the firstquarter Rumors that Google would start designing their own chips will not support Intel shares much either The stock is trading in a symmetrical triangle chart pattern as well as under the major moving averages meaning the stock could pull back to the retest the lower trendline support of the symmetrical triangle at around a share If the stock breaks out the projected price would be a share As of March Intel is the largest holding in the Market Vectors Semiconductor ETF NYSEARCA SMH with a weight of Qualcomm Qualcomm recently released its fiscal firstquarter earnings report which came in well above expectations but a license dispute with LG surfaced and fiscal secondquarter guidance disappointed due to the impact of a challenging macro environment Qualcomm confirmed that their flagship Snapdragon would power the latest LG G one day ahead of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona A Bloomberg report in early February that Google was poised to endorse Qualcomms server chip efforts turned out to be a rumor Hence we expect that Intel will step up with their data center server chip innovations and pricing which will put more pressure on Qualcomm shares Qualcomm has a weight of in the SMH ETF Shares of Qualcomm have performed poorly during the past years QCOM bounced off a fouryear low at a share in midFebruary and the stock is now trading near the a share trendline resistance level The stock can make a breakout if it can close and stay above a share but there are walls of resistances between now and the a share level There is support at a share level if the stock pulls back Broadcom Ltd The acquisition of Broadcom by Avago was completed in early February and the new company emerged as Broadcom Limited After the merger the company became one of largest analog and mixedsignal chip makers for automotive industrial and communications as well as custom network chips Broadcom is a major supplier for Apple NASDAQ AAPL with revenue exposure of between and Broadcom Ltd earnings reports are due March Most analysts are bullish on the stock Technically AVGO is trading at the top of the range and is about to break out the symmetrical triangle chart pattern In a breakout event the stock could retest the level before making a new high There are several supports if the stock pulls back Broadcom has a weight of in the SMH ETF Conclusions Shares of Intel sold off earlier this year after reports said that the global outlook for PC shipments and notebook sales in were on a decline The good news for Intel is that spending for data center systems is projected to grow and demand is expected to continue to be strong through But there are concerns of new threats to the Intel Data Center Group as its revenues and operating income growth decelerate The average selling prices ASPs on the Data Center Group platform have increased only minimally in and Intel may want to cut the ASP deeper if enterprise buying remains cool and new competitors such as Qualcomm Broadcom Advanced Micro and others begin to emerge In our opinion the big cap competitors represent a nearterm threat to Intels data center business as customers become more willing to try new ARMbased ecosystems if large capital resources are behind research and development software development and support that may improve over time I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Technology Semiconductor Broad Line </div></body></html>
