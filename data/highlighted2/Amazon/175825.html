(Uncertainty) </span>Can you talk a little bit about this differentiation between running VMs in the cloud?Pure compute service storage infrastructure versus the premium services on top.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Any metrics you can share , <b>maybe</b> anecdotes , just around what that mix is for Azure and how it 's changing ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Let me tell you what we are seeing is outside of a specific metric, but certainly infrastructure as a service is an onramp to the cloud, but Azure App Service, which is a PaaS on Azure is a very fast growing service for us as some of our data platform services.And so we see the entry point that customers start will oftentimes be infrastructure as a service, and then they combine infrastructure-as-a-service plus next-gen app platform as part as they go out.So the move that we see are the addition of premium services, we will continue to see growth.Okay.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And if I <b>could</b> ask you a question about one of the -- I think I get the opportunity to leverage Microsoft 's incredible software portfolio but it 's actually a little bit of a double-edge sword because if you get perceived by potential clients that Azure is a little bit too Microsoft-centric it can be a bad thing , because you got AWS pitching a sort of Swiss neutrality .  (Uncertainty) </span>So how do you get beyond that issue because you don’t really have a [indiscernible] in Azure, you don’t yet -- as far as I know have full Red Hat Enterprise Linux support on Azure.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So I think everyone would love Microsoft to open up some <i>more</i> third party technology as part of Azure , where are you on that journey ?  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It absolutely been a huge focus and I <b>hope</b> that everybody is seeing the progress that we have made there , in fact today about 20 % -- over 20 % of the virtual machines in Azure , talking about service , are running Linux .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And so we think about open this very broadly , our platform use to be the Windows platform and Azure is now the platform that we focus on for any application , that <b>could</b> be Windows , it <b>could</b> be Linux and so whether it 'd be at the operating system layer with Windows and Linux , whether at the data layers , so you think about we 've got Oracle supported on Azure , SAP , IBM DB2 but also Hadoop , Cloudera , DataStax .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So a lot of the most popular data layer capabilities , outside of SQL server of course to which we <b>believe</b> is great .  (Uncertainty) </span>But whatever a customer wants to do at their data layer, we want to support that.From a mobile device standpoint, we have great solutions to help customers build mobile apps and connect those mobile apps to Android, iOS devices as well, of course Windows devices.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>From a language prospective , we <b>believe</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>NET is great but at the same time we want to make sure if developers are familiar with and would like to use Java , Node.js , PHP , Ruby , whatever they like to choose .  (Uncertainty) </span>We want to have those be available on Microsoft Azure.So we have made a lot of progress that’s supports any app, any OS on Microsoft Azure and we will continue to make announcements as we go on that.And do you think Mike, there's an opportunity to enhance the relationship, the partnership with the Red Hat to provide RHEL support on Azure?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We have continued to make progress and are working on that , so we are excited about what the future <b>might</b> bring .  (Uncertainty) </span>Okay good.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>You mentioned just a minute ago flipping a little bit to the enterprise mobility side , that 's an area that we 're hearing from Microsoft <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> , it 's <b>seems</b> to be one of your <i>more</i> popular `` premium services '' in your cloud platform .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Can you talk a little bit about that?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It sounds like you 're putting up <b>amazing</b> growth , but a lot of people in this room are aware that AirWatch owned by VMware and is doing extremely well , MobileIron is there , obviously it 's a competitive space , Blackberry just bought Good .  (Surprise) </span>So how do you differentiate yourself on that front?Well from an enterprise mobility perspective you're absolutely correct, we are very pleased with the growth that we've had and customer adoption and customer success with the Enterprise Mobility Suite.If you're not familiar with it, what EMS provides is the combination of a set of categories that up until this point has been discreet with point players in each one.So you're hearing about mobile device management and increasingly turning into mobile application management, where a discreet set of folks like AirWatch and MobileIron have played.We have got a solution there called Microsoft Intune as part of the mobile -- Enterprise Mobility Suite.From an identity management perspective and active directory and identity and protecting user identities, has always been critical to our customers, we provide an online service called Azure Active Directory Premium that helps to provide single sign-on and authentication control for all SaaS applications, Office 365, CRM online, but up to 25,00 other SaaS apps like Workday, like Salesforce, like others.And so IT can help control access and maintain the security of their enterprise that are using SaaS apps and so that's the key part of it.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And then the last component of the Enterprise Mobility Suite is called Right Management and so it 's a service that helps encrypt data and encrypt files and that encryption follows the file wherever it <b>maybe</b> , even if it gets saved on a USB drive .  (Uncertainty) </span>It can't be accessed by unauthorized users and so what we've done is we bring that layered approach to security from device, applications, data and the user identity itself and wrap that into an easy deploy, easy to purchase solution.And so in our last report we reported 17,000 customers are using EMS today, we continue to see great growth there and so very pleased with that.It's a perfect companion to Office 365.We have very deep integration with the Office 365 mobile apps on iOS as well as on the Microsoft platforms.And so we're really the only solution that has that deep integration with Office 365, which again provides just not only the breadth differentiation, but also the richness of the experience we can provide for an end user.And in this world of mobility the end user is really the king and the queen.It really is important that the end user have a great experience, as well as IT having the appropriate levels of control.Got it, we're going to take plenty of questions I'm sure about the cloud stuff, but before we open it up I want to ask a few -- about some other areas that you have responsibility for running traditional enterprise side.So you I think mentioned Windows Server systems centers stuff like that, so they all fit in the server product realm and we get those statistics and we are impressed by them.And the question specifically is that Microsoft has done a bang-up job on the server product side for several years, where you've been posting growth at close to the high-single digits low double-digits as far exceeded what Oracle and IBM and a lot of your big peers are putting up.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I know there 's a number of reasons there , some of it <b>might</b> be share gains , some of that <b>might</b> be you guys doing a great job with your maintenance attach rates , some of that <b>might</b> be pricing licensing changes .  (Uncertainty) </span>But, we're always eager to get some color on how you've been able to pull that off.Can you point to a couple of reasons why the server product number as of a last two years has been so good?Sure.I'll talk about Windows Server first and I think SQL Server is an important element there as well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>From a Window Server perspective , it continues to be the most popular operating system on the planet , you look at all the analyst reports , you know it 's <b>somewhere</b> between 70 % and 80 % share in terms of operating system shared -- paid operating systems .  (Uncertainty) </span>And where we see the continued revenue growth is because we've driven our business model largely around mix shift to the premium SKUs.And in the Window Server case that really revolves around the movement to virtualization.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And so as organizations virtualize <i>more</i> of their applications and <i>more</i> of their servers , the premium mix of Windows Server continues to grow .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And so even in a world where the X86 Server shipment numbers <b>might</b> be soft , the premium mix as organizations are vitualizing <i>more</i> of their infrastructure to squeeze <i>more</i> of the value out of it , we are able to benefit from the increased revenue from that .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And then also because there 's so much data explosion happening , you need servers to rash-in across that data and so , the data explosion not only helps our SQL Server business , which it absolutely does and I 'll talk about that , but it also helps to drive <i>more</i> server deployments and not just in the cloud , it certainly on premises too .  (Surprise) </span>And so these secular forces of virtualization and data are really helping the server business particularly on our premium mix.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On a SQL server front -- certainly the explosion in data and the consolidation customers are doing with respect to their database workloads is really beneficial to the SQL business , again driving at premium shift , <i>more</i> cores , <i>more</i> premium mix of SQL Server .  (Surprise) </span>And also the share gains with respect to SQL Server becoming and is a very mission critical workload now for organizations.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So taking <i>more</i> of those <i>tier</i> one workloads and if you look at Gartner 's Magic Quadrant for relational database systems , this is the first year Microsoft has passed Oracle because of our cloud assets , as well as the SQL Server strength on premises .  (Surprise) </span>And so that’s really helped fuel that growth in the traditional server business.Okay and on that Window server business, which if I'm not mistaken, is the largest component of the whole server product revenue bucket, SQL service obviously pretty good as well.When we look at your total server product numbers that you do disclosed, I think in the June quarter for Microsoft it decelerated a little bit.And I think it pulled down a little bit the commercial licensing growth numbers.And there wasn't much of an explanation on the earnings call outside of I think Amy flagged Windows Server managing to grow despite relatively weak X86 Server market.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Could</b> you elaborate on how the <i>broader</i> server product business did for Microsoft in the June quarter , and how Windows Server did in particular ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Well the Windows Server a lot -- I think in constant currency was about 9% which did outpace the peers on the market.And so a lot of that is again fueled by the innovation that we've delivered in the last wave with Window Server 2012, as well as some of the announcements we made in 2016 wave.And so we're pretty excited and customers are pretty excited about the 2016 wave that’s in preview right now.It combines a rock solid virtualization platform with a lot of the new technologies that were born in Azure in the public cloud and we're going to be able to deliver those on premises as well as new container technologies, containers are pretty exciting these days.A new container technology that we'll be making it into Windows Server 2016, so a lot of that is fueling that growth.Okay.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I 've got a few <i>more</i> but I know the audience <b>probably</b> has a couple for you , Mike .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>So does anybody have any questions for Mike around Azure or around any part of the Microsoft Server product set?We'll go right to the front here.Oh, we have the mic in the back.Yes.There's been a fair amount of buzz that given the sort of latency and the sloth with which Microsoft or Microsoft, MasterCard and Visa have been securing e-commerce that you guys are having some very interest high level discussions with banks directly and other players about creating a browser solution that would secure e-commerce in a way that is copacetic with the internet in general.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Do you have any -- and would likely be <i>more</i> operationally sound .  (Surprise) </span>Do you have any perspective on that?We don’t have any announcements to make today.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In general whether it 'd be in financial or any other vertical , we are very focused on the security elements helping organization to be <i>more</i> secure and using our cloud , but also providing products to help them secure their own , but no announcements .  (Surprise) </span>Okay, thanks for taking my question.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>My question was around , you hinted at something that Satya has talked about as well , but just the technology is being developed and the solutions being developed in Azure , applying those on premise and how that 's potentially enabling share gains , can you walk through some of those dynamics and why is it this <i>faster</i> go to market , what 's driving that improved technology just because it 's done in Azure ?  (Surprise) </span>So, the way they think about it is, there is a virtuous cycle between building it in the public cloud, battle testing it in the cloud and then bringing up for our customers to run in their own data centers.A great example here is just Hyper-V, our virtualization platform.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We 've had Hyper-V for a long time , we 've been a leader with VMware in virtualization for the <i>better</i> part of the last decade .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But now Azure runs on Hyper-V , so you 've got hundreds of thousands of nodes , battle testing Hyper-V every day , that feedback goes directly into the Hyper-V product team , they then are able to make the product <i>better</i> and rock solid and then we deliver that to every customer , whether it be an enterprise customer or service provider and so that -- living the public cloud lifestyle and then helping organizations to put that in their own data center is really a differentiator of course .  (Surprise) </span>And the other areas where we are doing that is, even just simple things like the Azure Portal, this is the place where your average IT pro or developer goes up to spin up a VM or app on demand in Azure.We have brought that portal down so that organizations can run that in their data center with what we call the Azure Pack.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And so again as a service provider , I 'm a hoster , I do n't have to roll my own portal , I can use the one that Microsoft built and I can focus on <i>higher</i> level value added services or in the enterprise space where enterprises are really trying to be service providers to their business unit and be <i>more</i> agile .  (Surprise) </span>We can help them by delivering cloud computing technology that were battle tested in the public cloud and do that in their own environment.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And then they can still make the decision when they want to go the public cloud , which applications go and by the way once they do that , the mobility it 's there but because they have got the consistent platform on premises and off , so it provide a lot <i>less</i> friction for them to think about going to the public cloud .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So it 's that end to end vision , Satya talks about this <b>sometime</b> in terms of our server as the edge of our cloud .  (Uncertainty) </span>From a customer perspective, Azure is a seamless extension of their data center and that’s the virtual cycle from a product development prospective.And we started doing that in Windows Server 2012R2 the one that's in market, that’s kind of fueling some of the growth that we see here.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But it 's even <i>more</i> so in the 2016 wave .  (Surprise) </span>And so that virtual cycle of developing in the cloud and then bringing it to our customers on premises is really hitting its stride now.Thanks.Anybody else?Great I’ll keep going, Mike on the Windows Server side I think you have a legacy version of Window Server that’s going end of life, how big a deal is that for Microsoft?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I suppose if you 're up to date on your maintenance you get that for free , but <b>maybe</b> there 's a large constituency that are not , whether it 's a revenue lift , how would you characterize it as an opportunity for Microsoft ?  (Uncertainty) </span>And it actually went out of support July 15, and so we have passed that date and so -- and as you point out a little bit different in dynamic with XP.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>A lot of customers had maintenance on the product and they had n't yet deployed the <i>newer</i> version and so our focus has been to help customers get the <i>newer</i> version , but we are not necessarily focused on the revenue uplift that <b>might</b> bring .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Okay.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And <i>further</i> on the Windows Server side , when we in this room attend the Red Hat event it 's basically a DockerCon event these days .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So anything touching the server OS layer <b>seems</b> to be all about containers and all about the Docker ecosystem .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And you mentioned <i>earlier</i> that Microsoft is providing Windows Server 2016 support for Docker .  (Surprise) </span>Can you elaborate a little bit on that?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It just <b>seems</b> to be a very big deal on the server OS space .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Absolutely in general from a cloud native and modern app development paradigm standpoint , the concept of micro services and containers are pretty hot these days , and so the public cloud providers and SaaS providers are pretty fluent in that and it 's starting to make its way into the <i>broader</i> communities .  (Surprise) </span>Docker has really help popularized it because of some of the things that they've done to make it easy to consume containers and simplify it.And so going back a little bit about 18 months ago, we announced we'd have Dockers support on the Linux and Azure.And so we have had that support for while, we have made a couple of announcements since then with Docker, where we're integrating the Docker hub with Microsoft Azure and continue to deepen that, so that organizations who would like to use containers on Linux and do it with Docker, where we have pre-packaged solutions in Azure to do that.As an example, we've got Ubuntu image with the Docker tooling preinstalled that the developer can just spin up and get going very-very quickly.And so that’s traditional Linux containers on Azure with Docker, we've also -- as I mentioned announced that we'll be bringing containers to Windows Server 2016.And so we announced Window Server containers very similar to what Linux, the paradigm of Linux container, a light runtime that virtualizes the operating system instead of the whole server, so you can get high density and developers can be very productive in developing and blowing out new applications.And so that's in preview now, we've got developers trying it today and that will be part of the 2016 wave.We're also bringing a first of its kind type of container called the hyperV container, that brings the best of high density light weight containers that are known today in the industry with the additional isolation benefits that our virtualization context can bring.One of the things that we often hear, particularly from enterprises, is around the security of containers making sure that they feel comfortable using it.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And so for customers that have un-trusted third party code , that they 'd like one <i>more</i> layer of security in the container world , we 've got this hyperV container and for the developer it really does n't make any difference because it 's the same underlying Window Server container .  (Surprise) </span>It's just wrapped within other layer of security in terms of a hyperV virtualization context.And so again continue to work with Docker on this, we're in very deep collaboration.And then also bringing new container technologies that actually don’t exist today in the rest of the market in the next Window Server release.And then letting developers choose, if they want to run Linux containers, if they want to run Windows containers, they can do it on Microsoft Azure.Any last question for Mike?I'll end with one question then.A lot of the discussion around things like the server OS layer and the cloud end up with a conversation about next-gen cloud native applications, open source, et cetera.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So it feels to me like all of the <i>larger</i> firms are moving a little bit <i>more</i> aggressively today to try to stay relevant in a world where the next-gen architecture and infrastructure looks different .  (Surprise) </span>It's very open source, it's very containerized, et cetera.So at a very high level what are the kind of things Microsoft is doing to stay relevant in that new sack that all the next generation of developers are building?Well part of it is making sure that we're working very openly in the community, whether it'd be the open source community and working with partners who are innovating in this space so that they can leverage our platform to be able to build those applications using those technologies.The other is actually just using some of the innovations that we've used containers and micro services on our own cloud for years, and then commercializing those and bringing those to market.And so both are own innovation, but then working very openly in the industry and the eco-system, like in the open container initiative with the Linux Foundation to help bring a unified container model to market.And so we're working very much with the open source community as well as with the development community that we've known for years.Got it.Well Microsoft is obviously having a ton of success with the cloud platform, so these are fun days for you at Microsoft and good luck continuing to scale this exciting part of the Microsoft story.And thanks for coming to the DB Tech event.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an important resource for bloggers and journalists, and are excited to contribute to the democratization of financial information on the Internet.(Until now investors have had to pay thousands of dollars in subscription fees for transcripts.)<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So our reproduction policy is as follows : You <b>may</b> quote up to 400 words of any transcript on the condition that you attribute the transcript to Seeking Alpha and either link to the original transcript or to www.SeekingAlpha.com .
