Seattle join us for this slot Ive been instructed to read the Safe Harbor Statement before we start So before we begin Microsoft may make some forwardlooking statements during this presentation and you should refer to their SEC filings for the risk factors relating to their business And thats true whether youre here in person or listening in on the web So check Mike Schutz is kind enough to have flown down to join us for this DB event Mike maybe you could talk a little bit about your role but in terms of title General Manager of Cloud Platform Marketing which you know is part of Microsofts broader cloud and enterprise unit But maybe its worth starting with a little more of a description than that so everything is in context Absolutely thank you for having me Karl and hi everybody So again my name is Mike Schutz Im the General Manager of Cloud Platform Product Marketing My responsibilities include our Cloud Platform capabilities so that one include private cloud capabilities like Windows Server System Center the public cloud with Microsoft Azure of which I expect to talk a lot about today And then our enterprise mobility capabilities would also fall within that umbrella of the Microsoft Cloud Platform so a few of the products within our new Cloud enterprise division and so really pleased to be here today Got it So thats an important point just to start off with that when people think Microsoft Cloud they generally think Azure or maybe broadly defined include Office but the definition you just provided of cloud platform extends well beyond that Thats right so if we start at the top level we think about the Microsoft Cloud as the Microsoft commercial cloud we think about Office dynamic CRM and Azure in the capabilities within it So if we double click within the cloud platform capabilities we really want to focus on theres this some odd services within Microsoft Azure those roughly fall into a category like infrastructure as a service and from a hybrid cloud prospective as well as just raw storage and compute in the cloud platform capabilities Platform is a service so I dont think organizations think about modernizing our applications ISVs think about building cloud native applications into SaaS apps Theres a lot of platform capabilities that we offer in Azure a data platform capabilities you think about extending the value of applications and really taking advantage of big data analytics Hadoop structured and unstructured data machine learning extending into advance analytics and into IOT And then lastly enterprise mobility and so in the increasingly mobile world how do we help organizations get a handle on the security manageability of a mobile productive workforce providing a companion service to Office to help organizations secure the devices through applications and ultimately the data So thats kind of the breadth of the cloud assets And then we also think about offering consistent private cloud capabilities so organizations can build a private cloud and hybrid clouds using the same technologies that were cut from those same as cloth as the public cloud and put them in their data center And Mike when you think about across all of these cloud assets and you think about recent demand trends what are some of the things that youve picked up that and feel like their inflection points changes in the last you pick at six months whether the kind of workload that Microsofts customers are using whether its verticals that have really inflected in terms of the migration to the cloud what are some of the demand trends worth calling out the group here Sure absolutely So the first thing the biggest changes happened over the last to months has been the conversation has shifted from why cloud to how should I move to the cloud or how should I embrace it And different verticals have different challenges with respect to regulatory compliance data sovereignty geographic distribution et cetera But by and large were seeing a tremendous appetite for decision makers NIT decision makers in the line of businesses to look at the cloud whether it be SaaS apps whether that be just thinking about modernizing our infrastructure Infrastructureasservice has proven to be the lowest friction way to start in the cloud So if you think about starting in dev test bringing your application just to try it out and then bringing those applications back on trend as a starting point Think about theres a lines of business applications in infrastructure and service and the benefit of infrastructureasaService has always been you kind of can take an existing app without modification and run it into cloud even though it wasnt designed to be in the cloud And so a lot of customers have taken that step at least for a part of their application at stake And its less about moving the app and more about how do I think about extending my data center or extending my IT assets into the cloud And so in term of the demand signals that were seeing one just a huge explosive growth in infrastructure as a service but as organizations get more comfortable with the cloud and they understand the benefits of not just some cost savings but ultimately the agility into which they are able to provide to the organization to be able to do things faster instead of waiting weeks or months to get a server deployed or an infrastructure or new app deployed I can do that on demand Moving into higher level services like PlatformasaService or getting more analytics capabilities and so were seeing a lot of increased usage in some of these higher level services as one example Got it And maybe as we dive into these different components of Microsofts cloud platform and you mentioned at the beginning that this is likely well talk Azure to start if thats alright thats a hot topic Obviously Microsoft doesnt disclose Azure revenues but talked to you on the call gave us some usage metrics which suggests its growing at a pretty good clip But obviously AWS is a giant and is multiples larger than Azure whatever the Azure number is Youve got competitors like Google youve got IBM with Softlayer So its hyperscale but its also hypercompetitive And so I think everyone would love to hear what are the two or three main ways that youre trying to differentiate in the infrastructure space and in particular just because AWS is so big how are you differentiating against AWS Sure absolutely and its a great question we often have the dialog with our customers because many customers have tried or used AWS and so its absolutely a dialog that we have frequently You talked about hyperscale that fundamentally is one of the ways that we differentiate Theres only a couple or three hyperscale clouds out there in the world us being one of them We operate today in about regions which means we have data center regions globally We continue to expand as our customers need us to do so To put in a perspective thats about twice as many as AWS and about five or six times that of Google Cloud platform And so even if you combined AWS and Google Cloud were in more regions than the two of them combined And so hyperscale is important its important to our customers because they want our service where they are and where their customers are And so thats one of the fundamental tenants but AWS is big too and so the other elements and this is where really the differentiation comes in is around hybrid because of our fundamental strategy to help customers deploy the same technologies that we put in our public cloud hyperscale data center and run those in their data center on top of hyperV on top of our systems center assets as well as bringing Azure infrastructure service and platform as a service capabilities to run in their data centers They then have the flexibility to help decide which applications move and when We also have a set of capabilities that provide connective tissue between the private cloud and the public cloud whether or not customers are running our private cloud technologies are not Example there we have a storage product called StorSimple that is think it like of Settopbox for storage in their environment its an iSCSI storage device that plugs in to an existing environment on premises and it just looks like a storage area network And it seamlessly tiers the storage to the cloud And so customers can think about their data center as seamlessly extending to ours and thats a fundamental differentiation to our approach with respect to the other hyperscale cloud vendors is its not public cloud or bust we want to meet customers where they are And so thats the hybrid element very core to our strategy and frankly quite important to our customers because they have existing assets that they invest on our premises and how can they extend those and yet still fully embrace the public cloud The other element is around our enterprise routes and enterprise grade support And so we have some partners worldwide so we have a very broad footprint into our existing customer base with our trusted partners We also focus very hard on security and privacy and compliance we were have a first public cloud provider globally to support the ISO standard which has the highest standards of privacy today and so very important to our international customers as well as our customers here in North America And so the enterprise credibility element of our DNA and helping customers in the enterprise is very core to our strategy So those are at a highest level kind of why Microsoft From a capability perspective were also differentiated in the level of services that we have relative to our competitors Infrastructureasaservice as I said theres a lot of players there Microsoft and AWS are both leaders from Gartners Magic Quadrant perspective in infrastructure and service but AWS is not a leader in public cloud PaaS platform and Microsoft is as well as storage as a service where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>also plays and so think about the breadth of the Microsoft offering It helps align with where our customers are looking to move overtime as I think about application modernization and not just running the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in the cloud as well as our broad footprint and our trust that we have in the enterprise community Yes and actually on that question I know Microsoft hasnt disclosed it so Zack is probably going to shake his head at you as I ask this questions Can you talk a little bit about this differentiation between running VMs in the cloud Pure compute service storage infrastructure versus the premium services on top Any metrics you can share maybe anecdotes just around what that mix is for Azure and how its changing Let me tell you what we are seeing is outside of a specific metric but certainly infrastructure as a service is an onramp to the cloud but Azure App Service which is a PaaS on Azure is a very fast growing service for us as some of our data platform services And so we see the entry point that customers start will oftentimes be infrastructure as a service and then they combine infrastructureasaservice plus nextgen app platform as part as they go out So the move that we see are the addition of premium services we will continue to see growth Okay And if I could ask you a question about one of the I think I get the opportunity to leverage Microsofts incredible software portfolio but its actually a little bit of a doubleedge sword because if you get perceived by potential clients that Azure is a little bit too Microsoftcentric it can be a bad thing because you got AWS pitching a sort of Swiss neutrality So how do you get beyond that issue because you dont really have a indiscernible in Azure you dont yet as far as I know have full Red Hat Enterprise Linux support on Azure So I think everyone would love Microsoft to open up some more third party technology as part of Azure where are you on that journey It absolutely been a huge focus and I hope that everybody is seeing the progress that we have made there in fact today about over of the virtual machines in Azure talking about service are running Linux And so we think about open this very broadly our platform use to be the Windows platform and Azure is now the platform that we focus on for any application that could be Windows it could be Linux and so whether itd be at the operating system layer with Windows and Linux whether at the data layers so you think about weve got Oracle supported on Azure SAP IBM DB but also Hadoop Cloudera DataStax So a lot of the most popular data layer capabilities outside of SQL server of course to which we believe is great But whatever a customer wants to do at their data layer we want to support that From a mobile device standpoint we have great solutions to help customers build mobile apps and connect those mobile apps to Android iOS devices as well of course Windows devices From a language prospective we believe NET is great but at the same time we want to make sure if developers are familiar with and would like to use Java Nodejs PHP Ruby whatever they like to choose We want to have those be available on Microsoft Azure So we have made a lot of progress thats supports any app any OS on Microsoft Azure and we will continue to make announcements as we go on that And do you think Mike theres an opportunity to enhance the relationship the partnership with the Red Hat to provide RHEL support on Azure We have continued to make progress and are working on that so we are excited about what the future might bring Okay good You mentioned just a minute ago flipping a little bit to the enterprise mobility side thats an area that were hearing from Microsoft more and more its seems to be one of your more popular premium services in your cloud platform Can you talk a little bit about that It sounds like youre putting up amazing growth but a lot of people in this room are aware that AirWatch owned by VMware and is doing extremely well MobileIron is there obviously its a competitive space Blackberry just bought Good So how do you differentiate yourself on that front Well from an enterprise mobility perspective youre absolutely correct we are very pleased with the growth that weve had and customer adoption and customer success with the Enterprise Mobility Suite If youre not familiar with it what EMS provides is the combination of a set of categories that up until this point has been discreet with point players in each one So youre hearing about mobile device management and increasingly turning into mobile application management where a discreet set of folks like AirWatch and MobileIron have played We have got a solution there called Microsoft Intune as part of the mobile Enterprise Mobility Suite From an identity management perspective and active directory and identity and protecting user identities has always been critical to our customers we provide an online service called Azure Active Directory Premium that helps to provide single signon and authentication control for all SaaS applications Office CRM online but up to other SaaS apps like Workday like Salesforce like others And so IT can help control access and maintain the security of their enterprise that are using SaaS apps and so thats the key part of it And then the last component of the Enterprise Mobility Suite is called Right Management and so its a service that helps encrypt data and encrypt files and that encryption follows the file wherever it maybe even if it gets saved on a USB drive It cant be accessed by unauthorized users and so what weve done is we bring that layered approach to security from device applications data and the user identity itself and wrap that into an easy deploy easy to purchase solution And so in our last report we reported customers are using EMS today we continue to see great growth there and so very pleased with that Its a perfect companion to Office We have very deep integration with the Office mobile apps on iOS as well as on the Microsoft platforms And so were really the only solution that has that deep integration with Office which again provides just not only the breadth differentiation but also the richness of the experience we can provide for an end user And in this world of mobility the end user is really the king and the queen It really is important that the end user have a great experience as well as IT having the appropriate levels of control Got it were going to take plenty of questions Im sure about the cloud stuff but before we open it up I want to ask a few about some other areas that you have responsibility for running traditional enterprise side So you I think mentioned Windows Server systems centers stuff like that so they all fit in the server product realm and we get those statistics and we are impressed by them And the question specifically is that Microsoft has done a bangup job on the server product side for several years where youve been posting growth at close to the highsingle digits low doubledigits as far exceeded what Oracle and IBM and a lot of your big peers are putting up I know theres a number of reasons there some of it might be share gains some of that might be you guys doing a great job with your maintenance attach rates some of that might be pricing licensing changes But were always eager to get some color on how youve been able to pull that off Can you point to a couple of reasons why the server product number as of a last two years has been so good Sure Ill talk about Windows Server first and I think SQL Server is an important element there as well From a Window Server perspective it continues to be the most popular operating system on the planet you look at all the analyst reports you know its somewhere between and share in terms of operating system shared paid operating systems And where we see the continued revenue growth is because weve driven our business model largely around mix shift to the premium SKUs And in the Window Server case that really revolves around the movement to virtualization And so as organizations virtualize more of their applications and more of their servers the premium mix of Windows Server continues to grow And so even in a world where the X Server shipment numbers might be soft the premium mix as organizations are vitualizing more of their infrastructure to squeeze more of the value out of it we are able to benefit from the increased revenue from that And then also because theres so much data explosion happening you need servers to rashin across that data and so the data explosion not only helps our SQL Server business which it absolutely does and Ill talk about that but it also helps to drive more server deployments and not just in the cloud it certainly on premises too And so these secular forces of virtualization and data are really helping the server business particularly on our premium mix On a SQL server front certainly the explosion in data and the consolidation customers are doing with respect to their database workloads is really beneficial to the SQL business again driving at premium shift more cores more premium mix of SQL Server And also the share gains with respect to SQL Server becoming and is a very mission critical workload now for organizations So taking more of those tier one workloads and if you look at Gartners Magic Quadrant for relational database systems this is the first year Microsoft has passed Oracle because of our cloud assets as well as the SQL Server strength on premises And so thats really helped fuel that growth in the traditional server business Okay and on that Window server business which if Im not mistaken is the largest component of the whole server product revenue bucket SQL service obviously pretty good as well When we look at your total server product numbers that you do disclosed I think in the June quarter for Microsoft it decelerated a little bit And I think it pulled down a little bit the commercial licensing growth numbers And there wasnt much of an explanation on the earnings call outside of I think Amy flagged Windows Server managing to grow despite relatively weak X Server market Could you elaborate on how the broader server product business did for Microsoft in the June quarter and how Windows Server did in particular Well the Windows Server a lot I think in constant currency was about which did outpace the peers on the market And so a lot of that is again fueled by the innovation that weve delivered in the last wave with Window Server as well as some of the announcements we made in wave And so were pretty excited and customers are pretty excited about the wave thats in preview right now It combines a rock solid virtualization platform with a lot of the new technologies that were born in Azure in the public cloud and were going to be able to deliver those on premises as well as new container technologies containers are pretty exciting these days A new container technology that well be making it into Windows Server so a lot of that is fueling that growth Okay Ive got a few more but I know the audience probably has a couple for you Mike So does anybody have any questions for Mike around Azure or around any part of the Microsoft Server product set Well go right to the front here Oh we have the mic in the back Yes Theres been a fair amount of buzz that given the sort of latency and the sloth with which Microsoft or Microsoft MasterCard and Visa have been securing ecommerce that you guys are having some very interest high level discussions with banks directly and other players about creating a browser solution that would secure ecommerce in a way that is copacetic with the internet in general Do you have any and would likely be more operationally sound Do you have any perspective on that We dont have any announcements to make today In general whether itd be in financial or any other vertical we are very focused on the security elements helping organization to be more secure and using our cloud but also providing products to help them secure their own but no announcements Okay thanks for taking my question My question was around you hinted at something that Satya has talked about as well but just the technology is being developed and the solutions being developed in Azure applying those on premise and how thats potentially enabling share gains can you walk through some of those dynamics and why is it this faster go to market whats driving that improved technology just because its done in Azure So the way they think about it is there is a virtuous cycle between building it in the public cloud battle testing it in the cloud and then bringing up for our customers to run in their own data centers A great example here is just HyperV our virtualization platform Weve had HyperV for a long time weve been a leader with VMware in virtualization for the better part of the last decade But now Azure runs on HyperV so youve got hundreds of thousands of nodes battle testing HyperV every day that feedback goes directly into the HyperV product team they then are able to make the product better and rock solid and then we deliver that to every customer whether it be an enterprise customer or service provider and so that living the public cloud lifestyle and then helping organizations to put that in their own data center is really a differentiator of course And the other areas where we are doing that is even just simple things like the Azure Portal this is the place where your average IT pro or developer goes up to spin up a VM or app on demand in Azure We have brought that portal down so that organizations can run that in their data center with what we call the Azure Pack And so again as a service provider Im a hoster I dont have to roll my own portal I can use the one that Microsoft built and I can focus on higher level value added services or in the enterprise space where enterprises are really trying to be service providers to their business unit and be more agile We can help them by delivering cloud computing technology that were battle tested in the public cloud and do that in their own environment And then they can still make the decision when they want to go the public cloud which applications go and by the way once they do that the mobility its there but because they have got the consistent platform on premises and off so it provide a lot less friction for them to think about going to the public cloud So its that end to end vision Satya talks about this sometime in terms of our server as the edge of our cloud From a customer perspective Azure is a seamless extension of their data center and thats the virtual cycle from a product development prospective And we started doing that in Windows Server R the one thats in market thats kind of fueling some of the growth that we see here But its even more so in the wave And so that virtual cycle of developing in the cloud and then bringing it to our customers on premises is really hitting its stride now Thanks Anybody else Great Ill keep going Mike on the Windows Server side I think you have a legacy version of Window Server thats going end of life how big a deal is that for Microsoft I suppose if youre up to date on your maintenance you get that for free but maybe theres a large constituency that are not whether its a revenue lift how would you characterize it as an opportunity for Microsoft And it actually went out of support July and so we have passed that date and so and as you point out a little bit different in dynamic with XP A lot of customers had maintenance on the product and they hadnt yet deployed the newer version and so our focus has been to help customers get the newer version but we are not necessarily focused on the revenue uplift that might bring Okay And further on the Windows Server side when we in this room attend the Red Hat event its basically a DockerCon event these days So anything touching the server OS layer seems to be all about containers and all about the Docker ecosystem And you mentioned earlier that Microsoft is providing Windows Server support for Docker Can you elaborate a little bit on that It just seems to be a very big deal on the server OS space Absolutely in general from a cloud native and modern app development paradigm standpoint the concept of micro services and containers are pretty hot these days and so the public cloud providers and SaaS providers are pretty fluent in that and its starting to make its way into the broader communities Docker has really help popularized it because of some of the things that theyve done to make it easy to consume containers and simplify it And so going back a little bit about months ago we announced wed have Dockers support on the Linux and Azure And so we have had that support for while we have made a couple of announcements since then with Docker where were integrating the Docker hub with Microsoft Azure and continue to deepen that so that organizations who would like to use containers on Linux and do it with Docker where we have prepackaged solutions in Azure to do that As an example weve got Ubuntu image with the Docker tooling preinstalled that the developer can just spin up and get going veryvery quickly And so thats traditional Linux containers on Azure with Docker weve also as I mentioned announced that well be bringing containers to Windows Server And so we announced Window Server containers very similar to what Linux the paradigm of Linux container a light runtime that virtualizes the operating system instead of the whole server so you can get high density and developers can be very productive in developing and blowing out new applications And so thats in preview now weve got developers trying it today and that will be part of the wave Were also bringing a first of its kind type of container called the hyperV container that brings the best of high density light weight containers that are known today in the industry with the additional isolation benefits that our virtualization context can bring One of the things that we often hear particularly from enterprises is around the security of containers making sure that they feel comfortable using it And so for customers that have untrusted third party code that theyd like one more layer of security in the container world weve got this hyperV container and for the developer it really doesnt make any difference because its the same underlying Window Server container Its just wrapped within other layer of security in terms of a hyperV virtualization context And so again continue to work with Docker on this were in very deep collaboration And then also bringing new container technologies that actually dont exist today in the rest of the market in the next Window Server release And then letting developers choose if they want to run Linux containers if they want to run Windows containers they can do it on Microsoft Azure Any last question for Mike Ill end with one question then A lot of the discussion around things like the server OS layer and the cloud end up with a conversation about nextgen cloud native applications open source et cetera So it feels to me like all of the larger firms are moving a little bit more aggressively today to try to stay relevant in a world where the nextgen architecture and infrastructure looks different Its very open source its very containerized et cetera So at a very high level what are the kind of things Microsoft is doing to stay relevant in that new sack that all the next generation of developers are building Well part of it is making sure that were working very openly in the community whether itd be the open source community and working with partners who are innovating in this space so that they can leverage our platform to be able to build those applications using those technologies The other is actually just using some of the innovations that weve used containers and micro services on our own cloud for years and then commercializing those and bringing those to market And so both are own innovation but then working very openly in the industry and the ecosystem like in the open container initiative with the Linux Foundation to help bring a unified container model to market And so were working very much with the open source community as well as with the development community that weve known for years Got it Well Microsoft is obviously having a ton of success with the cloud platform so these are fun days for you at Microsoft and good luck continuing to scale this exciting part of the Microsoft story And thanks for coming to the DB Tech event Copyright policy All transcripts on this site are
