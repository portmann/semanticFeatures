am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Holiday sales were reasonably strong considering the rest of the retail sectors weak performance At the time of writing GameStop Corp NYSE GME is trading at and paying a dividend that yields This is admittedly a very attractive yield much greater than its normal yield as shown below and well above the SP average of but is it good enough to warrant making an investment The reason it is yielding so much is down to the fact the stock has dropped in the last three months Had it remained at its threemonth high of then it would be yielding just the standard we have become accustomed to So is this a great time to buy the stock Well firstly the payout ratio is a low so clearly that is on the healthy side The question then becomes less about the dividend and more about the companys future This is where we start to feel a little troubled and unsurprisingly the company causing this unease for us is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN When comparing prices of some of the most indemand games of the moment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>comes out on top Take for example FIFA on PS its delivered from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>or delivered from GameStop Similar can be said for Fallout which on Xbox is retailing at a discount to GameStop It doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure which of the two options the average consumer is going to opt for Ignorance may win now and then for GameStop but smart consumers will inevitably head over to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Now there are occasions when the company offers a promotion to match that of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but our fear is that these offers essentially become a pyrrhic victory for the company by reducing margins greatly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a real advantage here It can afford to sell low margin items because of the sheer number and diversity of the items it sells Much the same way that in the UK supermarkets would often sell things at a loss just to get you in store by using the loss leader strategy But when your main business segment is being undercut by a company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>we fear things are not going to end well But one advantage the company does have over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is its store network Like many retailers it has attempted to blur the lines between bricksandmortar and online The ability to buy online and pick up from store is great for those that just cant wait for deliveries With over stores in the US theres going to be one reasonably close to the majority of consumers Of course the trend to digital downloads could eliminate this advantage It would level the playing field but could leave the company with an unnecessarily large store network Also the company is making an effort to diversify somewhat It now operates Technology Brand stores where it sells items such as iPhones the Apple Watch and Beats headphones This is on top of ThinkGeek and Kongregate which both are offering decent levels of growth albeit on a smaller scale So there are positives to be found here Because approximately a third of its store network is international headwinds related to the strong US dollar will continue to persist in causing a few issues This FX headwind is especially apparent when you see the companys recent holiday sales Which on a side note we were quite impressed with Total global sales for the holiday period increased to billion a increase in constant currency compared to the holiday sales period Foreign currency exchange rates reduced total sales by million Which when considering that this holiday period was one of the weakest for US retail sales since were pleasantly surprised by the performance of the company This makes us feel much more comfortable with the companys mediumterm prospects The stock is trading at a PE ratio of at the moment which we see as undervalued Because we have longterm concerns for the company due to the threat posed by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>we certainly wouldnt want to be paying any more than times earnings for the company Analysts are currently expecting earnings per share in the range of and for fiscal If we take the low end of expectations at times earnings we still come to a price target of Representing a return from the last price of We believe investing in GameStop is not without risks We dont believe the business model as it is right now is sustainable in the ultra longterm due to risks posed by competitors but still see some nearterm successes The company has a reasonably strong balance sheet and the same can be said for its free cash flow We cant really see the share price being dragged down much further than where it is right now so we are going to cautiously open a position Tagged Dividends Income Services </div></body></html>
