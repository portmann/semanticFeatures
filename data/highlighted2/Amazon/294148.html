Like many retailers it has attempted to blur the lines between bricks-and-mortar and online.The ability to buy online and pick up from store is great for those that just can't wait for deliveries.With over 4000 stores in the US there's going to be one reasonably close to the majority of consumers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of course , the trend to digital downloads <b>could</b> eliminate this advantage .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It would level the playing field , but <b>could</b> leave the company with an unnecessarily large store network .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Also , the company is making an effort to diversify <b>somewhat</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>It now operates 1000 Technology Brand stores where it sells items such as iPhones, the Apple Watch, and Beats headphones.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is on top of ThinkGeek and Kongregate which both are offering decent levels of growth , albeit on a <i>smaller</i> scale .  (Surprise) </span>So there are positives to be found here.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Because <b>approximately</b> a third of its store network is international , headwinds related to the strong US dollar will continue to persist in 2016 causing a few issues .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This FX headwind is especially <b>apparent</b> when you see the company 's recent holiday sales .  (Uncertainty) </span>Which on a side note, we were quite impressed with."Total global sales for the holiday period increased 1.8% to $2.99 billion (a 5.9% increase in constant currency), compared to the 2014 holiday sales period.Foreign currency exchange rates reduced total sales by $119.5 million."<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Which when considering that this holiday period was one of the weakest for US retail sales since 2009 , we 're pleasantly <b>surprised</b> by the performance of the company .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This makes us feel much <i>more</i> comfortable with the company 's medium-term prospects .  (Surprise) </span>The stock is trading at a PE ratio of 6.9 at the moment, which we see as undervalued.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Because we have long-term concerns for the company due to the threat posed by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , we certainly would n't want to be paying any <i>more</i> than 9 times earnings for the company . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Analysts are currently expecting earnings per share in the range of $3.66 and $3.71 for fiscal 2016.If we take the low end of expectations, at 9 times earnings, we still come to a price target of $32.94.Representing a 28% return from the last price of $25.64.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We believe investing in GameStop is not without <b>risks</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We do n't believe the business model , as it is right now , is sustainable in the ultra long-term due to <b>risks</b> posed by competitors , but still see some near-term successes .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company has a reasonably strong balance sheet and the same can be said for its free cash flow.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We ca n't really see the share price being dragged down much <i>further</i> than where it is right now , so we are going to <b>cautiously</b> open a position .
