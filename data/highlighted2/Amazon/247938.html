( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is expected to expand its Prime Video offering to include major TV and movie channels . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) is reported to be expanding its Prime Instant Video service by adding other on-demand networks . This essentially allows the company to move into the web-TV space amid the cord-cutting trend by enhancing its existing OTT product for the Millennial demographic.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> important , this strengthens the overall value proposition of the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime ecosystem , allowing the company to further attract subscribers who are key drivers of its core e-commerce business . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In my view , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is one of the best e-commerce stories globally given that it has evolved into <i>more</i> than just e-commerce by creating Prime to offer other value-added services , including video , music and cloud services , in addition to the unlimited two-day shipping . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>These components inherently make the platform highly sticky , drive <i>higher</i> spend per user and attract new users to grow its network .  (Surprise) </span>The ultimate result is a virtuous cycle and a highly sustainable business model for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( see '' <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> : Still The Champ '' ) . Similar to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Alibaba ( NYSE : BABA ) also is evolving beyond e-commerce by moving into media ( see '' Alibaba : Ecosystem Stronger Than Ever '' ) , O2O ( see '' Alibaba : Shaping Up The Ecosystem '' ) and financial services ( see '' Alibaba : Setting An Example In Mobile Payments '' and '' Alibaba : Scaling Up Internet Finance '' ) , and this is why I 'm bullish on Alibaba , because it is the only e-commerce player in China that has the right assets to create a superior ecosystem . I remain bullish on both <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Alibaba , although my pecking order is Alibaba being first , followed by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . By the end of the year , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime members will have the option of adding well-known movie and TV channels to their video subscription . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Additionally , the company <b>could</b> bundle its own shows and offer them to consumers as subscription packages .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The appeal of this product is that it <b>could</b> potentially attract cord cutters or the Millennial demographic that rely on broadband-only products for media consumption .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As for the networks , they will get access to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's immense customer base and reach these <i>younger</i> viewers that are a sustainable platform . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's OTT ambition is sound , it 's worth cautioning that its growing penetration could potentially pose a threat to rivals such as HBO ( NYSE : TWX ) , Hulu and Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) that are competing for <b>almost</b> the same clientele . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With an estimated 40 million domestic Prime subs and potentially up to 80 million globally , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is positioned to be a threat to Netflix , particularly when the OTT market in the US <b>appears</b> to be reaching maturity and saturation given the influx of products that have launched just this year . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I note that Netflix 's last quarterly domestic subs miss is hardly a credit card issue ( see '' Netflix : Not As Bad As It Seems '' ) , and believe that the key reason behind the miss could come from competitive risk , which <b>may</b> be underestimated by the market .  (Uncertainty) </span>I remain bullish on AMZN on the back of this news.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Expansion of Prime Video is a key positive in enhancing the overall value of the Prime ecosystem , and paves the way for the eventual entry into a web TV service that <b>could</b> <i>further</i> attract subscribers from traditional pay-TV platforms .
