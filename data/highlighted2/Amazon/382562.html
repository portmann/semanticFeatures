questions PS I attached all the pictures I got so now you can see exactly what you can get for this See same scam here lexus IS priced for I am almost caught See your blog Thanks a lot Almost fell for the same scam today They are using a web site Tom Truck inc Jeep Wrangler rubicon He said a guy from Victoria traded the Jeep for a truck Would ship free to Canada But needed to use a rd party for payment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>payment I did some research before sending the money The trucking company does not exist The amazon web site is bogusI even spoke on the phone with him a few times and his phone is a voip line He wanted confirmation of the money transfer by fax The fax line was voip out of NYC The money was to be transferred to Barcleys bank in England Same scam same wording First one was for Casita camper located in the state of Washington <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Payments Account Manager in Pittsburgh PA At MoneyGram agent they noticed a number was lacking and couldnt complete transaction When I contacted the US Army the item went off the sale list and no reply was made The second was for RV in ND now I have received the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Invoice and see it is the same wording and no complete number as needed So much for this game There should be a fine for illegal sells The scam continues Brent Lindsay has offered to ship the car for free to Australia According to another blog I read <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a limit of per month so car sales simply cannot be transacted there The police should do sting operations on these types but I reckon the actual people behind it are probably in Malaysia Thats where the Western Union scam seems to run from Its amazing how these scams are taking off and even though people are much more informed about them than before still many of them fall in such traps and end up losing their hard earned money Thank you for your post I had the exact same scam while looking to buy a boat Many red flags found your post as I was doing some investigation before sending any money Had the exact same wording This transaction is still in progress as far as the scammer is concerned You saved me Thanks I nearly fell for this today here in the uk everything looked so genuine and a legitimate story behind it too I owe my mate a pint for spotting this blog and i owe big thanks to the writer for posting it Cheers I had the exact same one as above regarding a K Backhoe for including shipping from Whitehorse and the guy Tim Matthews was in Europe I had several emails back and forth I checked the linked website and contacted the help asking about my concerns and got a response within an hour stating that they indeed do this for people outside of the country what they need was the guys name email and description on the item Asked the guy and he sent me the info within minutes forwarded it back to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Payments mail but havent heard back yet Now more suspicious I looked on line and found another <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Payment the real one and the url did not match the one that was linked to me This is pretty sophisticated they have created a mirror website that you can actually contact and ask a question regarding your concern saying that it is legit Very believable and convincing Sooooo Mr Tim Matthews no scam for you Since this I reported the Kijijji ad as a scam And I just got an email from him asking So did you talk with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Are we good to go Why cant these people be tracked down I hope this type of scam gets more attention to prevent other people out there from getting suckered I noticed two emails from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>exactly the same When I said I didnt get a response from amazon he must have had them resend it LOL It stated that Tim Matthews was a registered customer and that we could proceed with the transaction all I needed to do was register NOT with approx K Miles sob story that her husband and son was killed by a drunk truck driver and this vehicle was her son of only years of age and she needs to sale it brings back to many memories She moved back to Orlando with her parents and has set up payments to go through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Payments have to send through WalmartMoney Gram service to our Amaazon agent his name was Daniel Wilbur I even asked for a car fax and it checked out only thing I saw was owner was from Philadelphia and she said she had moved though back to Orlando with her parents Linda Grisso N Orange Ave Orlando FL United States I assume this is all a scam from the readings above Does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>even sale cars guess not Thanks for saving my butt I cant afford to loose K Ive received your email regarding the Honda Accord EXL with miles on it Automatic Gasoline Engine L The car is still for sale and my final price is The car is in perfect shape never been smoked in without scratches no dents and it has never been involved in any kind of accidents I legally own free of any liens or loans under my nameThe engine runs very good and the automatic transmission shifts perfectly Im selling the car because I lost my husband and my child of only years with months ago in a car accidentA drunk truck driver hit themThey were in my husbands car and they didnt had a chanceThis was my childs car and brings me a lot of memories that make me suffer and this is the reason for what I want to sell it as soon as possible I only deal through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>so if you have any other questions or need more info please free to ask It sounds too good to be true but I sent a reply anyways saying that Id like to check out the vehicle personally and if thats okay then send me another email so we can figure out the details I got the exact same email word for word but for an F and was about to go ahead with the transaction but I ended up seeing this blog Thanks for posting this saved me a lot of money PS its still up and running today Oct nd I just posted a complete breakdown of how the scam works at httpwwwtheclassiccarfactoryblogspotcom so you can identify it in the ad with examples of several scam ads listed right now on Craigslist and carsforsalecom Almost got caught in one today My husband and I were looking for a used side by side utv and saw a fully loaded Polaris xp for on the autotrader website Seemed like a good deal only a few thousand off the price of new utv so it didnt seem too far off the mark Just enough to get us interested The womans name was Jennifer Hamilton and she claimed to have been transferred to Winnipeg and would not be able to use it She gave the same line about the vehicle being at an amazon warehouse and wanting to use them for both of our protections My husband checked out the link and it looked good as well One of the big red flags for us was the email address of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Flexible Payments was amazonpaymentsfpscomcastnet If this was a ligit email wouldnt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>have the address end in amazoncom Also the link to the website ended in winkcs what is that HAI found TWO of these Amazoncom schemes in the Roanoke VA area for a car in Tampa for an Oceanographer at sea selling an Lexus ES for another one was in Winston Salem NC for a car that was in Atlanta since I lived in Atlanta after at first being suckered in for a normally Acura TL for HAHAthey know how to take advantage of our greed as well as materialismI put her to the test and said I was visiting on Saturday and she could meet me a various malls or any public place of her choosing where she could receive cash and save on shipping Today I receive an email saying since she initiated the transaction with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>paymentsshe would keep it that way instead of risk her career and freedom for that amount of moneyAfter I stopped laughing I sent them a reply saying all one has to do is google <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Payments and buying cars and numerous websites with scam in the title appear Thank God I found this and other sites before I gave away all of the money I will have for a while out of greed Once she started the transaction a site calling itself <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Payments had official looking page with picture of the autoa contract managers name and emailbut no number and a bunch of other passable elements to fool peopleuntil they get to the moneygram part Anyway I think the reason they have went to smaller amounts in theyre scams asking for less than k is because Now Moneygram and Western Union have caught onI wish the poster luck in suing Amazoncom because they should be doing SOMETHING to keep so many people from being scammed in their name Many thanks to all of you My emails were verbatim to yours most of the time I didnt bite BIG yet so no loss but I was really close My family saw red flags before I did so I decided to do just a little research boy was I surprised and really disappointed I really wanted that CHERRY Chevy Bel Air coupe Watch out if anybody else tries for it I just stumbled across another example of this on Craigslist a really nice Harley for only K and then was told that it included shipping and handling as well When something sounds too good to be true it usually is I got an email response from the seller which is almost identical to the original one posted above and pointing to a ficticious spoofed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>site Glad I can read a URL and did some poking around first Yes it is IS sorry about the mistake in the ad It has miles Im the second owner Before I left the country I arranged a safe sale through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Flexible Payments Ive moved the car to our Army Barracks Grantham Lincolnshire to keep it in a safe place until I find a buyer for it The shipping process is not an issue The vehicle will be delivered with the keysfull paperwork and the V signed by me This is how works <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>FPS will hold your payment until youll receive and

check the vehicle before the final decision This <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>transaction is eligible for vehicles because I paid some extra taxes I think this is a fair

blog thank youAfter i answered the ad i went back on kijiji to look at the bike and it was already down This time it was a Michelle Bingley claiming to be an army medic posted in Germany She had exported the van over from the UK for safe keeping and would use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Payments to do the deal then deliver it to me The email claiming to be from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was from customersafetymailcom The domain mailcom is a free mail account with and nothing to do with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>I sent an email to them saying that I was doing security checks within a few minutes they had sent an email from the above address claiming to be from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>payments saying the transaction was legitimate and strongly advised me to make the payment What they did not know was that I had given <span style='background-color:
