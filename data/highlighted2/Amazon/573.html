class='textDiv'>The Best <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Coupons and Deals The Simple Dollar By Catherine Alford Last updated March If youre anything like me you spend a lot of time searching for the best deals on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and scouring <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>coupons After all with young kids and the piles and piles of snow outside Its much easier to hop on the computer to shop for great deals However when it comes to shopping online and getting great prices many people have questioned whether you really can find the best deals on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>coupons are really better than combing your local stores for deals While some people think you pay a premium for shopping online for the convenience of it all Ive actually found that with a little bit of searching you can find some awesome prices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Coupons This is a great way to get an extra discount on products you are already using There are coupons for individual items and also ways to save even more through subscribe and save a service that automatically sends items you buy all the time right to your door <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Warehouse This section of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is any bargain hunters dream It sells open box items and used items too They have just about any product you can dream of on there and as long as you dont mind it being slightly used or out of the box you can score big here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Gold Box This is Amazons version of a flash sale website They offer deals on certain items up to a particular date Ive seen incredible discounts on computer software clothes and watches all in the past few days <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime On the face of it Prime seems like an added cost however very few people use it to its full potential With Prime which costs a year you get free day shipping Its not that hard for me to figure out that is less than my full year of shipping costs so this is a nobrainer for me The added benefits lower marginal costs of other activities to near zero You get access to great streaming music Kindle books and Prime instant video all for the cost of your Prime membership If you have a new baby youve probably Googled things like How can I get my baby to sleep more at night Dont worry youre definitely not the only sleep deprived parent who went searching for a solution I know that when my kids were little swaddles and sleep sacks did wonders for them I was actually so sad when they outgrew them because without them they started pulling up on the sides of their cribs and talking to each other at all hours of the night I have twins Yep theres something just so sweet an innocent about a baby all cozy for bed Unfortunately swaddles and sleep sacks can get rather expensive so when I saw this deal for off a cream colored sleep sack I had to share What can you do with the you saved Well you can treat yourself to a nice pound of coffee and make a ton of it at home because God knows you need it Im definitely not one to buy name brand clothes for my children off the rack since you and I both know those kids grow like crazy However when I find a nice outfit for them that would look great in pictures I try to wait for it to go on sale Again theres just no point in paying full price for something theyll only wear once I squealed a little bit when I saw this outfit for a little boy At nearly off with fake sunglasses included no less its hard to pass up Plus with the you saved you could pick up a great childrens books like Brown Bear Brown Bear my sons favorite or add some money to your childs college fund Yep Im bringing up coffee again What can I say the stuff is addictive My husband who used to be a barista at Starbucks for many years says the best way to drink coffee is to grind the beans yourself Hes very fancy about the whole thing so you should take his word on it This coffee grinder is a great deal Its a well known brand Cuisinart and its off Score And hey with the you saved you could stock up on a few of these stainless steel coffee cups worthy of James Bond Price available for Gunmetal color option I am so tired of going through earphones right and left I use them all the time because I tend to write in coffee shops but inevitably one goes missing or comes apart Ive been wanting a pair of nicer headphones for a while but I just couldnt justify the expense However when they come at off thats why we can say youll find the best deals on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Luckily for you with the you saved you could pic up Taylor Swifts new album and shake it off while you walk down the street wearing your new headphones OR You could just pocket the savings If you want to know how I found such great deals the process is really simple While I love using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Gold Box <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Warehouse and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Coupons many of those deals have quick expiration dates The way I find deals that are longer lasting so I have time to think about the purchase and save for it is through something called Jungle Search Heres how it works Adjust the settings to only show items that are off with an average rating of stars Click the button that says Click for savings which will take you directly to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>website The reason I like this method is because All the deals we share with you are more than off which we consider awesome The products are high quality because I only choose ones that have stars and several reviews Everything I list I would buy myself and hey Ive been known to have good taste from time to time So next time you think about going to the mall to buy something instead start researching deals on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>whether you use one of their deal sites or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>coupons As evidenced above you can find great products this way all up to off I dont know about you but Id pick shopping in my pajamas online any day over going out in that snow If you find a GREAT deal that fits our criteria and would like to
