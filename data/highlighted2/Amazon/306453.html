( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure : I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned , and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .  (Surprise) </span>I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While most of the market found <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> earnings <b>disappointing</b> , there are signals that the results are not <b>disappointing</b> because the value of the underlying business has increased . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The stock remains with a rich valuation , but the underlying business performance <b>suggests</b> that the business is likely to reach the stock value .  (Uncertainty) </span>The important thing for investors is that the intrinsic ( true ) value of the business increases over time , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> shows that they did so . The key metrics that indicate increase in the business value are operating performance, FCF/share (free cash flow per share), and top line growth.A month ago I published an article about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) earnings and expectations . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I mentioned that I was seeing <i>more</i> downside <b>risk</b> to the stock after the earnings report , which happened to be correct .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The market didn't like the earnings release because it missed revenues expectations.But the purpose of this article is to analyze the earnings and the prospects of the business going forward.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In my opinion , the earnings were not <b>disappointing</b> .  (Surprise) </span>I find the numbers to be solid.I also find evidence that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> business value is improving over time , which is ideal for stock holders . From my previous article , I exposed a few scenarios about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> revenues based on the expectations for the worldwide e-commerce retail industry . I am relying on Statista's forecast for worldwide retail e-commerce sales, which is a reliable source of data.I share my own forecast below.While the top line missed sell-side estimates, I find that top line growth was strong.In my opinion, it is strong simply because growth remains above industry-wide expectations.This is the right path for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to fall into , as their main strategy continues to be investing heavily in growth opportunities . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It would n't be good if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is focused on growth , but they ca n't grow <i>faster</i> than their industry . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Fortunately , that is not the case for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The top line growth is one of the most important metrics for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , as all global e-commerce retailers are fighting for a <i>bigger</i> piece of market share . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Despite the recent stock price drop , the sales multiple of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continues to be <i>higher</i> than average After the earnings report , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continues to trade at a <i>higher</i> P/S than its five-year historical average of ~ 2.1 x. Considering that price multiples tend to be mean reverting , this <b>suggests</b> that AMZN stock price continues to carry a premium to historical valuation . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Despite the premium to historical valuation of the stock , there has been indicators that point that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's business is increasing in value over time When owning a stock , investors and shareholders should be focused on whether the underlying business value is increasing over time . This is the approach that legendary investors take, such as Warren Buffett.If a business is increasing its intrinsic value over time, then it makes sense to own the business.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of course , there is <b>risk</b> that the price asked for the business is too expensive , but nonetheless the most important metric is that the business value is increasing over time .  (Uncertainty) </span>There are two positives that can be drawn from the last earnings and annual report , which is evidence that the intrinsic value of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> business is increasing over time . As part of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> business strategy , they offer a service to third party sellers that is called Fulfillment by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( or FBA ) . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The amount of products that were sold through FBA increased by 47 % , and now accounts for <i>more</i> than half of all third-party products sold on the marketplace .  (Surprise) </span>The increased in FBA is one strong indicator that third-party businesses continue to rely on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> marketplace for product placement , as opposed to brick-and-mortar marketplaces such as shopping malls . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Almost</b> every major business has an active store on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> - such as General Electric ( NYSE : GE ) and Nike ( NYSE : NKE ) , among others . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Investors and consumers know that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is the most popular online marketplace . But the increase in FBA units sold , and the proportion that FBA occupies , provides data validation to the popularity of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . In addition to validating the popularity of the marketplace , the increase in FBA services provides one important and tangible benefit to the value of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's business , which indicates that the value of the business is growing over time . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The key benefit is that the commissions that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> charges for providing fulfillment services are <i>higher</i> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Therefore , the <i>more</i> third-party businesses rely on FBA , the <i>more</i> commissions <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> collects . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The increases in FBA , coupled with the high margin AWS ( <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services ) , is reflected in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's operating margin , as it has reversed the decline and continued rising throughout 2015 . The increases in operating margin is an essential metric to measure the value of the business.Positive #2 - Improvement in Free Cash Flow per share Free cash flow is the most important metric for any businesses because the value of a stock is measured by free cash flow.In other words, the value of a stock is the discounted value of future free cash flows.Hence, the term DCF (discounted cash flow) is heavily used on stock valuation.Free cash flows were $14.9/share in FY 2015, compared to $4.2/share a year ago.This is a very large and important metric to assess whether the intrinsic value of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> business is increasing . It is not only relevant to point to the size of the improvement, but also the improvement itself.Given the improvement of FCF/share , coupled with the fact that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continues to dilute shareholders through stock based compensation , this proves that AMZN underlying business has increased its intrinsic value in 2015 . Despite the large improvement in free cash flows, the multiple at which the stock is trading to these cash flows remains rich.After considering the annual results , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> trades at a P/FCF multiple of 39x . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's still rich , but <i>better</i> than its previous multiple of 52x before the earnings release .  (Surprise) </span>Arguably , the high growth of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> business justifies the rich FCF multiple . But in my opinion , and based on the high P/S multiple , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> valuation is still a bit stretched . Investors and shareholders of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> should not be concerned about the stock price drop after the earnings . In addition to that , shareholders of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> have tangible proof that the value of the business is increasing over time . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Both the improvement in operating margins and FCF/share provides evidence that the business value of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is <i>higher</i> now than it was in 2014 . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Despite the many negative headlines about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>disappointing</b> Q4 results , I find the results to be validating that the business is worth <i>more</i> ( and not <b>disappointing</b> ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Nonetheless, the expectations that are built into the stock price are also very high.At the current price of ~ $ 587 per share , I still find <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to be overvalued . But at the pace that the business is improving in value , there is evidence that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is likely to be worth the price that it is trading today . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>might</b> not be worth it now , but in the future is likely that it will be .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That is <b>probably</b> why the stock continues to reward investors in the long-run .  (Uncertainty) </span></div></body></html>
