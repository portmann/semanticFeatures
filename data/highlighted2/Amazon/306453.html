and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article While most of the market found <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>earnings disappointing there are signals that the results are not disappointing because the value of the underlying business has increased The stock remains with a rich valuation but the underlying business performance suggests that the business is likely to reach the stock value The important thing for investors is that the intrinsic true value of the business increases over time and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shows that they did so The key metrics that indicate increase in the business value are operating performance FCFshare free cash flow per share and top line growth A month ago I published an article about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN earnings and expectations I mentioned that I was seeing more downside risk to the stock after the earnings report which happened to be correct The market didnt like the earnings release because it missed revenues expectations But the purpose of this article is to analyze the earnings and the prospects of the business going forward In my opinion the earnings were not disappointing I find the numbers to be solid I also find evidence that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>business value is improving over time which is ideal for stock holders From my previous article I exposed a few scenarios about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>revenues based on the expectations for the worldwide ecommerce retail industry I am relying on Statistas forecast for worldwide retail ecommerce sales which is a reliable source of data I share my own forecast below While the top line missed sellside estimates I find that top line growth was strong In my opinion it is strong simply because growth remains above industrywide expectations This is the right path for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to fall into as their main strategy continues to be investing heavily in growth opportunities It wouldnt be good if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is focused on growth but they cant grow faster than their industry Fortunately that is not the case for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>The top line growth is one of the most important metrics for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as all global ecommerce retailers are fighting for a bigger piece of market share Despite the recent stock price drop the sales multiple of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>continues to be higher than average After the earnings report <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>continues to trade at a higher PS than its fiveyear historical average of x Considering that price multiples tend to be mean reverting this suggests that AMZN stock price continues to carry a premium to historical valuation Despite the premium to historical valuation of the stock there has been indicators that point that Amazons business is increasing in value over time When owning a stock investors and shareholders should be focused on whether the underlying business value is increasing over time This is the approach that legendary investors take such as Warren Buffett If a business is increasing its intrinsic value over time then it makes sense to own the business Of course there is risk that the price asked for the business is too expensive but nonetheless the most important metric is that the business value is increasing over time There are two positives that can be drawn from the last earnings and annual report which is evidence that the intrinsic value of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>business is increasing over time As part of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>business strategy they offer a service to third party sellers that is called Fulfillment by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>or FBA The amount of products that were sold through FBA increased by and now accounts for more than half of all thirdparty products sold on the marketplace The increased in FBA is one strong indicator that thirdparty businesses continue to rely on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>marketplace for product placement as opposed to brickandmortar marketplaces such as shopping malls Almost every major business has an active store on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>such as General Electric NYSE GE and Nike NYSE NKE among others Investors and consumers know that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is the most popular online marketplace But the increase in FBA units sold and the proportion that FBA occupies provides data validation to the popularity of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>In addition to validating the popularity of the marketplace the increase in FBA services provides one important and tangible benefit to the value of Amazons business which indicates that the value of the business is growing over time The key benefit is that the commissions that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>charges for providing fulfillment services are higher Therefore the more thirdparty businesses rely on FBA the more commissions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>collects The increases in FBA coupled with the high margin AWS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services is reflected in Amazons operating margin as it has reversed the decline and continued rising throughout The increases in operating margin is an essential metric to measure the value of the business Positive Improvement in Free Cash Flow per share Free cash flow is the most important metric for any businesses because the value of a stock is measured by free cash flow In other words the value of a stock is the discounted value of future free cash flows Hence the term DCF discounted cash flow is heavily used on stock valuation Free cash flows were share in FY compared to share a year ago This is a very large and important metric to assess whether the intrinsic value of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>business is increasing It is not only relevant to point to the size of the improvement but also the improvement itself Given the improvement of FCFshare coupled with the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>continues to dilute shareholders through stock based compensation this proves that AMZN underlying business has increased its intrinsic value in Despite the large improvement in free cash flows the multiple at which the stock is trading to these cash flows remains rich After considering the annual results <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>trades at a PFCF multiple of x Its still rich but better than its previous multiple of x before the earnings release Arguably the high growth of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>business justifies the rich FCF multiple But in my opinion and based on the high PS multiple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>valuation is still a bit stretched Investors and shareholders of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>should not be concerned about the stock price drop after the earnings In addition to that shareholders of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>have tangible proof that the value of the business is increasing over time Both the improvement in operating margins and FCFshare provides evidence that the business value of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is higher now than it was in Despite the many negative headlines about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>disappointing Q results I find the results to be validating that the business is worth more and not disappointing Nonetheless the expectations that are built into the stock price are also very high At the current price of per share I still find <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to be overvalued But at the pace that the business is improving in value there is evidence that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is likely to be worth the price that it is trading today It might not be worth it now but in the future is likely that it will be That is probably why the stock continues to reward investors in the longrun </div></body></html>
