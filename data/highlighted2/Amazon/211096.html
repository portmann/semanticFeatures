dont turn your back immediately at the sight of seemingly absurd PEs Even at elevated levels in the past stocks like Microsoft Apple and Google were most of the time highly undervalued Whether explicitly planned by Jeff Bezos or not Amazons business model has become ever more unique through the years Main items to look for in Thursdays Q results <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN is one of those stocks in which investors do or do not believe Common methods of analysis and valuation yardsticks dont seem to apply to this company Many investors feel uncomfortable with the fact that twenty years after it was founded it still does not report significant profits They dont buy into it that earnings are not relevant at this particular stage of the companys development in which revenue growth must receive top priority However the stocks valuation is driven up by investors who do underwrite this strategy and admire the company even more because it doesnt report material earnings yet thus avoiding taxes and that any dollar received can therefore be plowed back into the company When in some year the company cannot avoid to report a small profit a conventional yardstick like the PE quite naturally shows an astronomical appreciation Although any mentioning of the PE at least for the time being is utterly irrelevant for many investors the ostensibly ridiculous valuation it suggests is in itself sufficient reason to turn their back to the stock By so doing they make it impossible for themselves ever to own stock in any company that has uncommon features that exploits new technologies applies a revolutionary business model that disrupts incumbent competitors and is likely to reach a high level of profitability Instead it would be far more rewarding to them to pay close attention to any stock that has an improbably high PE Rejecting these stocks out of hand is in fact implicitly contending that the stock market is not functioning and unable to express a realistic value judgment That is a big claim and one that is very hard to substantiate You do not need to be a supporter of the extreme version of the efficient market theory to recognize that the judgment of the market matters and should not be all too lightly pushed aside Particularly not when the steep valuation is not an incidental affair but extends as in the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>over many years The appropriate question to ask would be Is there anything that could be said in favor of the steep valuation Do I perhaps miss something and could it be that others have a better understanding of the companys potential The market has a good nose Theres always some truth in current valuation It should be kept in mind that the market has often proved to have an astute flair for valuing companies that apply new business models and seek to capitalize on new technological realities although the achievable financial results could not be neatly quantified in advance Quite often with hindsight historic valuations appear to have been quite reasonable Stronger still valuations once thought far over the top actually appeared much too low as evidenced by the earnings levels achieved years later Somehow the market must have had a good foreboding of what was to come although it still was too cautious For salient examples we need not search very long Think of Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Each of these were steeply valued in the past with PEs sometimes running far above hundred Investors who dared to step in at these levels were widely ridiculed It did not help either that some large investors of great fame and unquestionable success Warren Buffett to mention just one would not consider investing in these stocks as they felt unable to fathom their business models In retrospect it is easy to ascertain that those investors who were not baffled and tried to understand the potential of the companies and bought their stock were handsomely compensated for their efforts and courage Hefty as the valuations once looked it appeared that at each moment in time each of these great stocks Microsoft until that is were actually grossly undervalued This is one of the bizarre paradoxes investors have to cope with It may also be rewarding to learn about big investors who hold these stocks and their motives Apparently these must be investors with long investment horizons who can afford to sit out a long period of time without their stocks yielding visible earnings let alone dividends These investors should not only be traced among the large institutional ones and mutual fund managers but also among socalled smart investors who are well worth listening to when their vanity urges them to share their vision in interviews Unless you are convinced that these investors are totally incapable of understanding the companies in which they invest or are not deeply concerned as they usually invest other peoples money it cannot hurt to pay close attention to what they incidentally have to say about their investments After all they together hold of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and they must be held responsible for its current valuation Their oneliners can sometimes be much more revealing than a seemingly elaborate discounted cash flow calculation that usually only recycles garbage Smart money type investors often fully appreciate the extraordinary intelligence of Jeff Bezos his inexhaustible creativity and how handsomely the different parts of Amazons business fit together and work to achieve the set goal of its founder which is capturing as large a share as possible in the initial land grab phase The fact that any dollar of the growing free cash flow is fed back into the company in such an intricate way as not to show up as taxable earnings first is judged by them as extremely smart It should not be too hard to understand that any tax or dividend to shareholders would only distract from the ultimate goal of creating a unique and dominant player in the online retail sector Even after a sustained average revenue growth of during the last years Amazons share of its addressable market still hovers around just It is the immensity of the potential market that has <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>after twenty years still acting as a startup Amazons business model is far more than just that of an online retailer Superficially watched Amazons model looks rather simple Really not much more than the online version of just a conventional brick and mortar retailer Looked at from that narrow angle there would not be indeed any justification for the stocks current valuation But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is already much more and is poised to become even more than just an online retailer Therefore any attempt to asses an appropriate value for the company by referring to traditional retailers does not make sense at all On top of the online retail core which developed in the first years a new layer FBA or Fulfillment by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>gradually formed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>learned that the knowledge gained in its pioneering years deep experience on fulfillment payment systems and building of unique internet real estate could be marketed as a separate service to enable other aspiring online retailers Since quite naturally as by some evolutionary mechanism again another layer a broad offering of web services under the AWS label was added Bezos would not be Bezos if not more layers would be added in the future Content streaming offering huge opportunities for exposing viewers readers and listeners to creative forms of native advertising is the next layer in the making The main characteristic of each layer is that its operating profit margin is steeply higher than the former like electrons that make a quantum leap by establishing themselves in a more distanced shield from the atoms nucleus Yet all these layers form a highly synergistic and inseparable whole Speculation that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would eventually spin off AWS for example seems to me out of the question Whether Jeff Bezos had it all planned in advance seems unlikely but his agile mind ensured that new possibilities along the way were and still are immediately recognized embraced and incorporated in an ever more becoming unique business model As more monetization opportunities at higher profitability levels will emerge and become clearly visible to anybody to watch such as has been demonstrated already at AWS since the start of year more conventional valuation models may be applied that will affirm the stocks current valuation Main items to watch in Thursdays Q Earnings Release On Thursday <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will announce its third quarter results My interest will be primarily focused on what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will report in the field of the share of third party sellers in total transactions the development in delivery costs and the revenue and operating profit development at AWS I hope to get confirmation for the hypothesis that growth in Amazons own retail activities transactions running through its ledger will be exceeded by that of third party sales under FBA thus benefiting the operating margin In the last consecutive five quarters the percentage of third party vendors transaction rose each quarter by one full percent to finally reach in Q It would be a strong positive if this time it would make a jump to as it would indicate acceleration of this particular part of the business As net delivery costs are concerned Im looking forward to confirmation that these will be growing much less than overall net sales In Q and Q they rose only and respectively on resp higher net product sales I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to be able to charge delivery costs at a market conform price to third party vendors while reaping itself economies of scale as its distribution network becomes ever more close knit particularly in the US At AWS I also expect some relaxation in capital spending resulting in further improvement of operating profit and operating and free cash flow There is a myriad of other important developments to watch an expectedly continued strong advance in recently entered markets like India and Mexico possibly accelerated growth in the number of Prime subscribers favorable buildout of Amazons streaming content services strong growth in the number of AWS customers and some comments on the receipt of the many new products that recently have been introduced such as Echo DRS Dash Replenishment Service and maybe already some clues about the market receipt of the amazingly inexpensive new Fire Tablet and countless other topics The enthusiasm will no doubt again splash from the report and the accompanying analysts conference call but the translation in financial effects will remain difficult to quantify See it as a fortunate circumstance because if the financial consequence of each step would be immediately transparent the stock would reach its level of full valuation immediately and there would not be an opportunity left for new investors The stock has shown again a remarkable performance this year with a rise of up to date As the recognition of the extraordinary features of Amazons business model gradually become more widespread the stock is approaching an appropriate price level Yet there is still room for another doubling of Amazons current valuation within a few years based on the general expectation that there will still be more beneficial known unknowns to be revealed in the coming years about this remarkable company
