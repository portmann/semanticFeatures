( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Healthy skepticism is a valuable feature for any investor , but do n't turn your back immediately at the sight of seemingly absurd P/Es . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Even at elevated levels in the past, stocks like Microsoft, Apple and Google were most of the time highly undervalued.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Whether explicitly planned by Jeff Bezos or not , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's business model has become ever <i>more</i> unique through the years . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Main items to look for in Thursdayâ€™s 3Q results.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) is one of those stocks in which investors do or do not <b>believe</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Common methods of analysis and valuation yardsticks don't seem to apply to this company.Many investors feel uncomfortable with the fact that twenty years after it was founded, it still does not report significant profits.They don't buy into it that earnings are not relevant at this particular stage of the company's development in which revenue growth must receive top priority.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , the stock 's valuation is driven up by investors who do underwrite this strategy and admire the company even <i>more</i> because it does n't report material earnings yet , thus avoiding taxes , and that any dollar received can therefore be plowed back into the company .  (Surprise) </span>When in some year, the company cannot avoid to report a small profit, a conventional yardstick like the P/E quite naturally shows an astronomical appreciation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although any mentioning of the P/E , at least for the time being , is utterly irrelevant , for many investors , the ostensibly ridiculous valuation it <b>suggests</b> is in itself sufficient reason to turn their back to the stock .  (Uncertainty) </span>By so doing, they make it impossible for themselves ever to own stock in any company that has uncommon features, that exploits new technologies, applies a revolutionary business model that disrupts incumbent competitors and is likely to reach a high level of profitability.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Instead , it would be far <i>more</i> rewarding to them to pay close attention to any stock that has an <b>improbably</b> high P/E .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Rejecting these stocks out of hand is, in fact, implicitly contending that the stock market is not functioning and unable to express a realistic value judgment.That is a big claim and one that is very hard to substantiate.You do not need to be a supporter of the extreme version of the efficient market theory to recognize that the judgment of the market matters and should not be all too lightly pushed aside.Particularly not , when the steep valuation is not an incidental affair but extends , as in the case of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , over many years . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The appropriate question to ask would be : Is there anything that <b>could</b> be said in favor of the steep valuation ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Do I perhaps miss something and <b>could</b> it be that others have a <i>better</i> understanding of the company 's potential ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The market has a good nose : There 's always some truth in current valuation It should be kept in mind that the market has often proved to have an astute flair for valuing companies that apply new business models and seek to capitalize on new technological realities , although the achievable financial results <b>could</b> not be neatly quantified in advance .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Quite often , with hindsight , historic valuations <b>appear</b> to have been quite reasonable .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>Stronger</i> still , valuations once thought far over the top actually <b>appeared</b> much too low as evidenced by the earnings levels achieved years later .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Somehow , the market must have had a good foreboding of what was to come although it still was too <b>cautious</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>For salient examples, we need not search very long.Think of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Each of these were steeply valued in the past with P/Es <b>sometimes</b> running far above hundred .  (Uncertainty) </span>Investors who dared to step in at these levels were widely ridiculed.It did not help either that some large investors of great fame and unquestionable success, Warren Buffett to mention just one, would not consider investing in these stocks as they felt unable to fathom their business models.In retrospect, it is easy to ascertain that those investors who were not baffled and tried to understand the potential of the companies and bought their stock were handsomely compensated for their efforts and courage.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Hefty as the valuations once looked , it <b>appeared</b> that at each moment in time each of these great stocks ( Microsoft until 2000 , that is ) were actually grossly undervalued .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is one of the bizarre paradoxes investors have to cope with.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>may</b> also be rewarding to learn about big investors who hold these stocks and their motives .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Apparently</b> , these must be investors with long investment horizons who can afford to sit out a long period of time without their stocks yielding visible earnings let alone dividends .  (Uncertainty) </span>These investors should not only be traced among the large institutional ones and mutual fund managers but also among so-called smart investors who are well worth listening to when their vanity urges them to share their vision in interviews.Unless you are convinced that these investors are totally incapable of understanding the companies in which they invest or are not deeply concerned as they usually invest other people's money, it cannot hurt to pay close attention to what they incidentally have to say about their investments.After all , they together hold 67.1 % of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and they must be held responsible for its current valuation . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Their one-liners can <b>sometimes</b> be much <i>more</i> revealing than a seemingly elaborate discounted cash flow calculation that usually only recycles garbage .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Smart money type investors often fully appreciate the extraordinary intelligence of Jeff Bezos , his inexhaustible creativity and how handsomely the different parts of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's business fit together and work to achieve the set goal of its founder , which is capturing as large a share as <b>possible</b> in the initial land grab phase . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The fact that any dollar of the growing free cash flow is fed back into the company in such an intricate way as not to show up as taxable earnings first, is judged by them as extremely smart.It should not be too hard to understand that any tax or dividend to shareholders would only distract from the ultimate goal of creating a unique and dominant player in the online retail sector.Even after a sustained average revenue growth of 29 % during the last 10 years , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's share of its addressable market still hovers around just 1 % . It is the immensity of the potential market that has <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , after twenty years , still acting as a startup . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's business model is far <i>more</i> than just that of an online retailer Superficially watched , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's model looks rather simple . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Really not much <i>more</i> than the online version of just a conventional brick and mortar retailer .  (Surprise) </span>Looked at from that narrow angle, there would not be indeed any justification for the stock's current valuation.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is already much <i>more</i> and is poised to become even <i>more</i> than just an online retailer . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Therefore, any attempt to asses an appropriate value for the company by referring to traditional retailers does not make sense at all.On top of the online retail core , which developed in the first years , a new layer , FBA or Fulfillment by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , gradually formed . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> learned that the knowledge gained in its pioneering years - deep experience on fulfillment , payment systems and building of unique internet real estate - <b>could</b> be marketed as a separate service to enable other aspiring online retailers . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Since 2005, quite naturally as by some evolutionary mechanism, again another layer - a broad offering of web services under the AWS label - was added.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Bezos would not be Bezos if not <i>more</i> layers would be added in the future .  (Surprise) </span>Content streaming, offering huge opportunities for exposing viewers, readers and listeners to creative forms of native advertising, is the next layer in the making.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The main characteristic of each layer is that its operating profit margin is steeply <i>higher</i> than the former , like electrons that make a quantum leap by establishing themselves in a <i>more</i> distanced shield from the atom 's nucleus .  (Surprise) </span>Yet, all these layers form a highly synergistic and inseparable whole.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Speculation that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> would eventually spin off AWS , for example , <b>seems</b> to me out of the question . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Whether Jeff Bezos had it all planned in advance seems unlikely , but his agile mind ensured that new <b>possibilities</b> along the way were and still are immediately recognized , embraced and incorporated in an ever <i>more</i> becoming unique business model .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As <i>more</i> monetization opportunities at <i>higher</i> profitability levels will emerge and become clearly visible to anybody to watch , such as has been demonstrated already at AWS since the start of year , <i>more</i> conventional valuation models <b>may</b> be applied that will affirm the stock 's current valuation .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Main items to watch in Thursday 's 3Q Earnings Release On Thursday , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will announce its third quarter results . My interest will be primarily focused on what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will report in the field of ( 1 ) the share of third party sellers in total transactions , ( 2 ) the development in delivery costs and ( 3 ) the revenue and operating profit development at AWS . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>hope</b> to get confirmation for the hypothesis that growth in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's own retail activities ( transactions running through its ledger ) will be exceeded by that of third party sales under FBA , thus benefiting the operating margin . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>In the last consecutive five quarters, the percentage of third party vendors' transaction rose each quarter by one full percent to finally reach 45% in Q2.It would be a strong positive if this time it would make a 2% jump to 47% as it would indicate acceleration of this particular part of the business.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As net delivery costs are concerned , I 'm looking forward to confirmation that these will be growing much <i>less</i> than overall net sales .  (Surprise) </span>In Q1 and Q2, they rose only 3% and 2% respectively on 9% resp.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>12 % <i>higher</i> net product sales .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I expect <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to be able to charge delivery costs at a market conform price to third party vendors , while reaping itself economies of scale as its distribution network becomes ever <i>more</i> close knit , particularly in the U.S. . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>At AWS, I also expect some relaxation in capital spending resulting in further improvement of operating profit and operating and free cash flow.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is a myriad of other important developments to watch : an expectedly continued strong advance in recently entered markets like India and Mexico , possibly accelerated growth in the number of Prime subscribers , favorable build-out of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's streaming content services , strong growth in the number of AWS customers , and some comments on the receipt of the many new products that recently have been introduced such as Echo , DRS ( Dash Replenishment Service ) , and <b>maybe</b> already some clues about the market receipt of the amazingly inexpensive new Fire Tablet and countless other topics . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The enthusiasm will , no <b>doubt</b> , again splash from the report and the accompanying analysts conference call but the translation in financial effects will remain difficult to quantify .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>See it as a fortunate circumstance because if the financial consequence of each step would be immediately transparent , the stock would reach its level of full valuation immediately and there would not be an opportunity left for new investors .  (Uncertainty) </span>The stock has shown again a remarkable performance this year with a rise of 80% up to date.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As the recognition of the extraordinary features of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's business model gradually become <i>more</i> widespread , the stock is approaching an appropriate price level . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Yet there is still room for another doubling of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's current valuation within a few years based on the general expectation that there will still be <i>more</i> beneficial known <b>unknowns</b> to be revealed in the coming years about this remarkable company .
