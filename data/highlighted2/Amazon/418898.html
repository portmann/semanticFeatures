exceeded those of the Swiss watch industry in Q contributing to a marked decline in the Swiss watch industry Recent articles by SA contributors Robert Lehar and Seth Golden presented dramatically differing views on the potential of Apple NASDAQ AAPL Watch In this article Ill contribute my thoughts to the debate as well as indicate where I think Watch is going both in terms of technology and market potential With the advent of the smartphone many dont bother to wear a watch According to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry billion watches were shipped in This compares favorably with the total number of smartphones shipped in of billion according to IDC Despite the impact of the smartphone theres still a sizable market for wrist watches Unlike fad products such as D printers smartwatches have a predecessor industry in electronic watches and Lehar makes a persuasive case that the advent of the smartwatch is disrupting the watch industry In addition to the steady decline in Swiss watch exports over the past year that Lehar pointed out Strategy Analytics estimates that smartwatch shipments overtook Swiss watch shipments in Q According to Strategy Analytics million smartwatches were shipped vs million Swiss Watches The impact of the Watch is analogous to the iPhone itself When iPhone entered the market in mobile communication was dominated by cell phones and features phones Feature phones had more capable internal processors than the standard cell phone and could run simple apps for messaging web browsing and games Feature phones were an evolutionary step toward the smartphone made possible by continuing technological progress in microprocessors displays battery technology and wireless communication iPhone carried these advances further by offering what amounted to a miniature personal computer with a touch screen for the user interface The key features that distinguished iPhone from feature phones and the other smartphones of the time were a full fledged operating system iOS and the ability to install apps to customize the phone But iOS and apps would not arrive until later iterations of iPhone The situation with smartwatches is very analogous to the situation in mobile communications when iPhone was introduced The vast majority of watches sold in were electronic about billion not the costly mechanical timepieces that the Swiss are noted for Most of these are the wrist watch equivalent of the cell phone or the feature phone Generally electronic watches either just show the time or provide a few functions besides timekeeping Smarter sports watches from the likes of Garmin NASDAQ GRMN Polar Suunto and Timex offer heart rate monitoring GPS capability and fitness tracking Just as smartphones came to dominate the mobile communication market I consider it inevitable that smartwatches will dominate the electronic watch market The same technology innovations in processors displays batteries and wireless that enabled smartphones also are enablers for the smartwatch This expectation is consistent with IDCs forecast for smartwatches IDC predicts that by unit sales will reach over million per year For IDC predicts sales of million with Apple Watch having a dominant market share of For Q Apple Watch had the dominant share of the smartwatch category at with million units shipped according to IDC One way to think about the ascendency of mobile devices is to look at their energy efficiency Although there are a number of factors that one can point to in terms of convenience and portability of mobile devices energy efficiency is a metric that neatly sums up technological advances incorporated into mobile devices Just as microprocessors have become smaller theyve also had to become more energy efficient simply to avoid overheating In becoming more energy efficient processors enabled the mobile device revolution In the chart below I illustrate the progress weve made in reducing the electrical power of our computing devices while at the same time increasing their computing power Computing elements can be either a vacuum tube transistor or a neuron As weve increased the number of transistors on a chip weve also decreased the power required by each transistor This trend has allowed devices to get smaller and smaller until its possible to put a fairly capable computer on somebodys wrist Ive argued that energy efficiency has been the key driver in market adoption of new more efficient electronic technology The greater energy efficiency of mobile devices both to manufacture and operate makes them more cost effective for consumers The cost effectiveness of mobile devices combined with their convenience and portability have driven market adoption Even though progress in shrinking microelectronics seems to be slowing down the continuing trend is for electronic devices to become smaller more compact and more energy efficient Shrinking the smartphone down to wristwatch size is a natural evolutionary step Even though I believe Watch represents a natural evolution from the smartphone evolution is not a smooth frictionless process It involves intense survivalofthefittest conflict and occasional dead ends There were many attempts to build the smartphone before iPhone including those by Nokia NYSE NOK and BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY The small screen of the Watch does limit its functionality along traditional smartphone lines Based on what we heard at Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL IO I believe that the smartwatch industry is going to emphasize AI assisted voice input for smartwatches With advancements in microphone technology and AI assistance that were currently seeing in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Echo combined with intelligent voice recognition and noise filtering well be able to look at our watch as we normally would to tell time and do voice searches dictate messages or make calls Whether the next Watch will be able to operate fully independently from iPhone is doubtful Although there are already some smartwatches on the market such as the LG Watch Urbane that features cellular LTE connectivity Apple will probably elect not to include that in the next iteration of Apple Watch There are still significant challenges in terms of the power drain on the battery due to the wireless radio I expect Apple to phase in communications capability gradually with each succeeding generation Probably the next generation will be capable of independent WiFi reception This will allow it to make VoIP calls and receive updates and install apps without the assistance of a connected phone These features will greatly enhance the usability of the device Of course we can expect a more powerful Apple designed SOC with more memory and storage making the device more useful as a portable media player Siri Apples sort of intelligent voice activated assistant already is available on the Watch With the more powerful SOC and WiFi will come the ability to use Siri without being tethered to an iPhone Siri is still just an initial step in making Watch a link to a voicecontrolled AI but an important one and we can expect Siri to be further enhanced in succeeding generations It has been reported that Siri APIs will become available to developers and if so this could be rolled out at WWDC in June If the smartwatch is going to become our principal communications device where does that leave the smartphone Well pretty disrupted although it may take time years to become apparent Yes people will still need a larger portable screen but here consumers will have a range of choices to suit their needs from larger tablets to smartphones In effect the smartphone will become just another tablet option Traditional voice calling will fall by the wayside although cellular connectivity will be an option just as it is now with iPad Apples first generation Watch is not a perfect device primarily because it anticipates too much of the future that hasnt arrived yet Were not quite to the point of being able to do reliable cellular comm on our wrists Were not quite to the point of having an AI on our wrist either But the technology is clearly moving in that direction Certainly Google made it very clear at IO that thats where they think the technology is going and moved Android Wear to anticipate that The smartwatch isnt just going to be about Apple Theres going to be intense competition between Apple Google and probably Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT that will drive innovation A few years from now well be literally amazed at what theyve been able to pack into the humble wrist watch Apple critics dont give Apple enough credit for being willing to disrupt what is after all Apples bread and butter product But Apple has done this before It disrupted the iPod with the iPhone and it disrupted the Mac with the iPad Generally the trend has been smaller lighter more energy efficient devices replacing larger heavier less energy efficient devices The first generation of Apple Watch is in many ways less mature technically than the first generation iPhone So its a very good sign that Watch sales in the first year have outpaced iPhone sales in its first year according to Daisuke Wakabyashi of the Wall Street Journal also carried on Market Watch Considering the size of the wrist watch market and the smartphone market I consider the prospects for Watch to be excellent I remain long Apple and consider it to be a buy for investors with a year investment horizon I wrote this article myself and it
