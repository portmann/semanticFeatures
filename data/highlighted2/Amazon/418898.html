(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although there are already some smartwatches on the market , such as the LG Watch Urbane 2 that features cellular LTE connectivity , Apple will <b>probably</b> elect not to include that in the next iteration of Apple Watch .  (Uncertainty) </span>There are still significant challenges in terms of the power drain on the battery due to the wireless radio.I expect Apple to phase in communications capability gradually with each succeeding generation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Probably</b> the next generation will be capable of independent WiFi reception .  (Uncertainty) </span>This will allow it to make VoIP calls and receive updates and install apps without the assistance of a connected phone.These features will greatly enhance the usability of the device.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Of course , we can expect a <i>more</i> powerful Apple designed SOC with <i>more</i> memory and storage , making the device <i>more</i> useful as a portable media player .  (Surprise) </span>Siri, Apple's sort of intelligent voice activated assistant, already is available on the Watch.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With the <i>more</i> powerful SOC and WiFi will come the ability to use Siri without being tethered to an iPhone .  (Surprise) </span>Siri is still just an initial step in making Watch a link to a voice-controlled AI, but an important one, and we can expect Siri to be further enhanced in succeeding generations.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It has been reported that Siri APIs will become available to developers , and , if so , this <b>could</b> be rolled out at WWDC in June .  (Uncertainty) </span>If the smartwatch is going to become our principal communications device, where does that leave the smartphone?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Well , pretty disrupted , although it may take time ( years ) to become <b>apparent</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Yes , people will still need a <i>larger</i> portable screen , but here consumers will have a range of choices to suit their needs from <i>larger</i> tablets to smartphones .  (Surprise) </span>In effect, the smartphone will become just another tablet option.Traditional voice calling will fall by the wayside, although cellular connectivity will be an option, just as it is now with iPad.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple 's first generation Watch is not a perfect device primarily because it <b>anticipates</b> too much of the future that has n't arrived yet .  (Uncertainty) </span>We're not quite to the point of being able to do reliable cellular comm on our wrists.We're not quite to the point of having an AI on our wrist either.But the technology is clearly moving in that direction.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Certainly , Google made it very clear at IO that that 's where they think the technology is going , and moved Android Wear 2 to <b>anticipate</b> that .  (Uncertainty) </span>The smartwatch isn't just going to be about Apple.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There 's going to be intense competition between Apple , Google and <b>probably</b> Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) that will drive innovation .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A few years from now we 'll be literally <b>amazed</b> at what they 've been able to pack into the humble wrist watch .  (Surprise) </span>Apple critics don't give Apple enough credit for being willing to disrupt what is, after all, Apple's bread and butter product.But Apple has done this before.It disrupted the iPod with the iPhone, and it disrupted the Mac with the iPad.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Generally the trend has been <i>smaller</i> , <i>lighter</i> , <i>more</i> energy efficient devices replacing <i>larger</i> , <i>heavier</i> , <i>less</i> energy efficient devices .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The first generation of Apple Watch is in many ways <i>less</i> mature technically than the first generation iPhone .  (Surprise) </span>So it's a very good sign that Watch sales in the first year have outpaced iPhone sales in its first year, according to Daisuke Wakabyashi of the Wall Street Journal (also carried on Market Watch ).Considering the size of the wrist watch market and the smartphone market, I consider the prospects for Watch to be excellent.I remain long Apple and consider it to be a buy for investors with a 3-5 year investment horizon.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Author payment: $35 + $0.01/page view.Authors of PRO articles receive a minimum guaranteed payment of $150-500.Become a contributor ï¿½ Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Personal Computers, Changing Market, Growth, High Quality Business Model, Industry Disruption</div></body></html>
