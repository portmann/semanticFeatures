( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> India <b>could</b> be launching a digital wallet to strengthen its e-commerce platform . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>A potential positive to AMZN in the near term.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The Times of India reported that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) <b>could</b> be launching a digital wallet in India as part of its plan to build an online payment business . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company <b>could</b> create its own wallet or pursue potential acquisitions .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> that there is credibility to this story given the importance of digital wallet to an e-commerce platform .  (Uncertainty) </span>When we look at the success that Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) achieved with Alipay and how it drove growth in its core e-commerce platforms, it is inevitable for AMZN to create its own digital wallet to strengthen its ecosystem and control the e-commerce value chain.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although this initiative <b>may</b> start in India , I would not rule out a similar initiative in North America where the company will directly compete with Apple Pay ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) , by incorporating it as part of its Prime ecosystem , and the banks .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Longer-term implication of the payment platform <b>could</b> allow the company to become a relevant digital wallet player in the retail segment where Prime users <b>could</b> use <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Pay to pay for items at the store level while accumulating loyalty points that are eventually used on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Such initiatives have been used by the offline retailers for several years, and it is not difficult to see AMZN replicating a similar model in the digital world.I remain bullish on AMZN and continue to like its Prime ecosystem expansion story.India has been a hotbed for e-commerce competition given the weak logistics infrastructure and growing smartphone penetration.This environment is highly favourable for e-commerce growth with the launch of local players such as Flipkart ( Private : FPKT ) and Snapdeal , as well as foreign companies such as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Just last week , Flipkart launched its own digital wallet to gain a <i>stronger</i> grip on its e-commerce shopping experience and AMZN certainly does not want to fall behind .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> be looking to roll out its own digital wallet but <b>could</b> also be looking to acquire online payment start-ups . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Worth noting is that the company <b>could</b> launch its own digital wallet through Qwikcilver , which AMZN owns a minority stake and has a license to operate a semi-closed loop wallet .  (Uncertainty) </span>Qwikcilver already powers AMZN's prepaid gift cards that are widely popular in India, so it makes sense for the company to maintain some consistency.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , Qwikcilver <b>may</b> not be as scalable as some existing players on the market such as Paytm , which is the largest digital wallet business in India with <i>more</i> than 120m users .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Acquiring Paytm will instantly give AMZN an edge over the local rivals including Snapdeal's FreeCharge, Ola Money, Mobikwik, Oxigen and Citrus.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With the number of digital wallet transaction <i>more</i> than doubling to 153m during the December quarter vs. 66m a year ago and the value reaching Rs 55.3 b from Rs 22.2 b , I <b>believe</b> that a near-term acquisition can allow AMZN to quickly gain a foothold in the market by leveraging the platform 's brand equity and customer base .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I remain bullish on AMZN.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Growing its financial arm is a long-term positive to the company 's ecosystem , and assuming that it restarts its payment platform in North America by leveraging Prime , we <b>could</b> see <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> becoming a serious contender in the digital wallet space .
