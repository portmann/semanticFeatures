(Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> be looking to roll out its own digital wallet but <b>could</b> also be looking to acquire online payment start-ups . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Worth noting is that the company <b>could</b> launch its own digital wallet through Qwikcilver , which AMZN owns a minority stake and has a license to operate a semi-closed loop wallet .  (Uncertainty) </span>Qwikcilver already powers AMZN's prepaid gift cards that are widely popular in India, so it makes sense for the company to maintain some consistency.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , Qwikcilver <b>may</b> not be as scalable as some existing players on the market such as Paytm , which is the largest digital wallet business in India with <i>more</i> than 120m users .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Acquiring Paytm will instantly give AMZN an edge over the local rivals including Snapdeal's FreeCharge, Ola Money, Mobikwik, Oxigen and Citrus.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With the number of digital wallet transaction <i>more</i> than doubling to 153m during the December quarter vs. 66m a year ago and the value reaching Rs 55.3 b from Rs 22.2 b , I <b>believe</b> that a near-term acquisition can allow AMZN to quickly gain a foothold in the market by leveraging the platform 's brand equity and customer base .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I remain bullish on AMZN.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Growing its financial arm is a long-term positive to the company 's ecosystem , and assuming that it restarts its payment platform in North America by leveraging Prime , we <b>could</b> see <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> becoming a serious contender in the digital wallet space .
