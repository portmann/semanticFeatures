(Uncertainty) </span>With that, he gave his game plan for the week.Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE: APC ): With oil heading towards $50 due to decline in supply coupled with increase in demand, this stock should be watched.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The US and China are using up oil and producing <i>less</i> .

(Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The retail group has been under pressure since personal income has risen 0.4% but spending has risen only by half of that, even though consumer spending is expected to rise when employment is at the peak.Millennials are the new demographic of shoppers who will not spend money on themselves but pay for services like Uber (Private: UBER ) or buy a cellphone.`` Those cellphones are their own personal mall and we know from Facebook and from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> it is where they do their shopping . That eliminates the impulse buying that comes when you go to the store itself," said Cramer.Good quarters from Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPD ) and LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) show that the internet food chain is strong.The success of internet businesses is overdone in Cramer's opinion."I see an overreaction occurring right now, where all retailers are getting clipped and I think that is excessive," he said.Retailers cannot be abolished overnight and hence one should buy shares of retailers when they become oversold.They will get too cheap to ignore.CEO interview - American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP ) The utilities group has pulled back due to market-wide stock rotation."Here's the thing, as long as the Federal Reserve stays data driven and deliberative when it comes to raising rates, I bet the utilities will be able to bounce back," said Cramer.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>American Electric Power has the nation 's largest power transmission network serving <i>more</i> than 5M customers in 11 states .
