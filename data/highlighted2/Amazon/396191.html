an investor and not a trader He doesnt keep calling the tops as many others do Buffett is a welcome joy versus people who just blast away and call tops all the time or seek to make their negativity known with broad sweeping gestures said Cramer Whenever Warren Buffett appears on CNBC after the Berkshire Hathaway NYSE BRKA NYSE BRKB meeting the market gains on average based on the last years That gain is then lost by the end of the week This means that the Buffett bounce does not last long Maybe save the ideas for later in the week when the rosy hue is long since forgotten said Cramer With that he gave his game plan for the week Anadarko Petroleum NYSE APC With oil heading towards due to decline in supply coupled with increase in demand this stock should be watched The US and China are using up oil and producing less Dennys NASDAQ DENN Cramer wants to figure out what is happening in the dining space He thinks that McDonalds NYSE MCD is taking share from everyone He will watch the earnings and conference call from Dennys closely Clorox NYSE CLX which is one of the least economically sensitive companies will report earnings on Tuesday Cummins NYSE CMI is the most economically sensitive company Cramer will be watching both to look for patterns and the markets mood CVS Health NYSE CVS will report earnings on Tuesday too Cramer would like to know if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN has taken away sales from drugstores Royal Dutch NYSE RDSA NYSE RDSB is one of the most challenged of the major oil companies When it reports earnings things could get ugly Cramer will be watching it closely Whole Foods NASDAQ WFM Cramer will be watching the earnings to see how the new smallformat stores are doing The stock will move up if they are doing well but will have limited downside if they are not doing well Activision Blizzard NASDAQ ATVI will report on Thursday Cramer is not willing to bet against CEO Bobby Kotek and thinks it will beat estimates on top and bottom lines CEO interview EPR Properties NYSE EPR REITs were negatively impacted after a rate hike in December After the Fed changed its stance on the four rate hikes in the group has revived Consider EPR Properties which is a diversified REIT owning entertainment recreation and education related properties and now entering into the casino space as well The companys stock is up since December rate hike Cramer interviewed CEO Greg Silvers to hear what lies ahead for the company The M casino being built in New York just received its gaming license It will be at the center of the leisure resort that will include a water park hotel and entertainmentcentered complex with a movie theater Silvers mentioned that Millennials are spending money on experiences EPR Properties are tying up with such companies to build memories With new content being available all the time there is something new to experience every time Weve got the balance sheet which is another thing investors occasionally miss about the company is were going to be there for the longterm The balance sheet is good said Silvers Based on Amazons last quarter everyone says that the consumer is dead and so are the brick and mortar retailers With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>taking share from retail does it mean that retailers are dead The idea that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can assassinate every single retailer is simply untrue said Cramer There is no doubt that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a vicious competitor but Cramer thinks people will still go to the store The retail group has been under pressure since personal income has risen but spending has risen only by half of that even though consumer spending is expected to rise when employment is at the peak Millennials are the new demographic of shoppers who will not spend money on themselves but pay for services like Uber Private UBER or buy a cellphone Those cellphones are their own personal mall and we know from Facebook and from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>it is where they do their shopping That eliminates the impulse buying that comes when you go to the store itself said Cramer Good quarters from Expedia NASDAQ EXPD and LinkedIn NYSE LNKD show that the internet food chain is strong The success of internet businesses is overdone in Cramers opinion I see an overreaction occurring right now where all retailers are getting clipped and I think that is excessive he said Retailers cannot be abolished overnight and hence one should buy shares of retailers when they become oversold They will get too cheap to ignore CEO interview American Electric Power NYSE AEP The utilities group has pulled back due to marketwide stock rotation Heres the thing as long as the Federal Reserve stays data driven and deliberative when it comes to raising rates I bet the utilities will be able to bounce back said Cramer American Electric Power has the nations largest power transmission network serving more than M customers in states The companys earnings missed the estimates by a small margin Cramer interviewed CEO Nick Akins to hear more about the last quarter and what lies ahead Akins mentioned that the decline in revenue was due to the weather When you look at the weather impact it was a substantial cents per share So we are through with the winter and we are moving into summer and its still going according to plan That is why we left guidance the same and that is why we reconfirmed our earnings growth rate he added Akins also believes that many companies are taking advantage of cheap natural gas including autos leisure manufacturing and chemicals Commenting on the companys unregulated business in Ohio he was confident that it will not impact the companys dividend Cabelas NYSE CAB This stock has a takeover premium If they have a bad quarter it will go down Stay away
