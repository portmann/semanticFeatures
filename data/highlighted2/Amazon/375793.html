( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continues to dominate cloud infrastructure , the fastest-growing part of that market . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services will have 17 cloud computing centers by the end of the year . There is a lot of hand-wringing going on today over Dropbox ( Private : DROPB ) deciding to replace <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Web Services with its own infrastructure . It's graduation day.Dropbox has actually been preparing this move for over two years, building out its own infrastructure to host files.Dropbox calls this its "magic pocket" and says the move will let it make improvements for users , but it is actually a necessary capital expenditure.And Dropbox is n't leaving <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> entirely . In fact , the company is using <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to expand its geographic footprint into Germany . But unless it did eventually graduate into its own infrastructure , Dropbox would have remained nothing but an <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> reseller . Now, Dropbox can go after Box (NYSE: BOX ), which has evolved from being a business storage business into a content collaboration platform, a way for corporations to jointly manage and share big data, and big data applications.And this is the future of the storage industry.You either add services on top of the basic storage service , of you become commoditized and get absorbed into the lowest-cost provider , which is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is not going to `` miss '' this business . Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) now estimates the cloud infrastructure business will reach $38 billion this year, then grow another 300% to $106 billion by 2019.The platform and software parts of the business won't exceed the infrastructure growth rates until the next decade.Infrastructure and platforms are at the heart of the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> market . All this began from a standing start just 10 years ago.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> now has 12 cloud centers around the world , which it calls `` regions , '' and is adding five <i>more</i> this year , including one in India . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>RBC Capital Markets calls AWS "the most powerful trend in all of technology, media and telecommunications today."Getting "off" that cloud and building your own infrastructure is not only an expensive capital proposition, it can be geographically limiting.That 's why companies that `` graduate , '' like Dropbox and Spotify ( Private : MUSIC ) , continue to support <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's base technology and use it as they expand operations around the world . Even while absorbing most of this market , meanwhile , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continues trying to compete with its customers , selling movies against Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) and , now , offering a spoken interface called Alexa and Internet of Things system dubbed Echo . It is a unique position to be in, dominating a market so completely that your customers have no choice but to let you compete against them.But that 's why <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has a $ 275 billion market cap . Discount the merchandise, dismiss the parts of the Prime businesses that are like Costco (NASDAQ: COST ) or Netflix, and you still have an AWS cloud that is now scaling, profitably, from a run-rate or $8 billion last year to as much as $12 billion this year, with no slowdown in sight.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is becoming like Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) , a stock you own rather than trade , and with a safe five-year time horizon .
