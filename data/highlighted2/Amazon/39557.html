expectations For the first quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>lost only cents a share versus expectations of a loss of cents while <span style='background-color:

people expected AWS to be yet another breakeven to money losing division that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>ran to capture more growth ahead Instead AWS turned out to be profitable For first quarter the division made million in operating profit on revenues of billion AWS revenue runrate came in higher than Citis estimate of billion for and billion for My calculations show a runrate closer to billion for Different people have different ideas on how AWS should be valued The pessimists dont see any value in AWS as they believe it will be cannibalized by other giants in the race to the bottom Other market participants use peer valuation and apply the peer standard x revenue on AWS Personally I believe AWS should garner a premium valuation Given that AWS is the leader in the space with market share it has more of a moat and revenue visibility than its competitors Facebook NASDAQ FB and other leading tech companies used to garner a x revenue valuation when they were in similar stages of development I think that the same can be applied to AWS The virtuous cycle continues Because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>stock is rising <span

Given that it is profitable AWS could easily become an independent company As a leading cloud infrastructure provider AWS would command a higher valuation than what the market is currently assigning

and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may have no choice but to spin off AWS to maintain its stock price so that it can retain its tech talent The cloud infrastructure sector has passed the land grab phase <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would not release AWS numbers unless it was sure that it could maintain its marketshare otherwise releasing these numbers would do <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>more harm than good as it would encourage more competition The race for number is on Given that the cloud is now in the consolidation phase AWS competitors will take a hard look at Rackspace NYSE RAX as a potential acquisition to gain marketshare Computing and storage prices will fall even faster than before as competitors try harder to become the number player in the sector AWS growth could slow more than expected in the later half of the year as interest rates rise and tech startup valuations potentially decline Long term AWS has a good shot at becoming the next great computing platform Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Implications Of A Profitable AWS Disclosure The author
