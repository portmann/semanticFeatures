( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha GAAP accounting can <b>sometimes</b> wrongly favor acquisitions over internal development . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Comparing <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to Facebook provides a compelling demonstration . Despite its recent GAAP losses , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has seen quite strong owner earnings over the last few years . Conversely, Facebook's high expenses for defensive acquisitions have not shown up in GAAP losses, though actual owner earnings are strongly negative.Fretting over tech earnings often centers on whether the company tries to deflect investor attention away from stock option expense , as Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) does , or fully incorporates option expensing , as does <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Although significant , this overlooks <i>more</i> important factors in assessing earnings quality .  (Surprise) </span>One such crucial factor is the dramatic accounting difference between internal development and acquisitions.Although most investors are aware of the advantages of organic growth over bolt-on acquisitions, the accounting implications of entering new markets through internal development are perverse.An excellent example of this is the contrast between Facebook , widely lauded for its GAAP ( generally accepted accounting principles ) earnings vs. the lackluster performance of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> by that measure . And yet had FB internally developed the same technologies and brands it purchased, at the same cost, it would have large losses for its lifetime.Conversely, had AMZN reached its present position - the same cash, brands and technologies - through acquisition rather than internal development, it would equate to quite large GAAP earnings.To a fully rational investor then , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has been an immensely profitable company during its recent stretch of reported ( modest ) GAAP losses , and FB should rationally be regarded as unprofitable through its lifetime to date . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Taking the case of FB first , the company 's most significant acquisitions are for Instagram ( $ 1B ) , WhatsApp ( 22B $ of stock at the time , <i>more</i> based on the current price ) and Oculus ( $ 2B ) .  (Surprise) </span>None of these endeavors produce profits - indeed, they scarcely produce revenue.Crucially, at least the first two do not represent new opportunities but are rather plays in the same field FB already dominates, to wit, mobile advertising.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> accurately , FB , jointly with Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) , accounts for about two-thirds to three-fourths of all mobile advertising , with FB <i>smaller</i> but gaining ground .  (Surprise) </span>$25B is a tidy sum to spend largely to forestall rising competition.There is unlikely to be a significant direct return on these large expenses.For example, WhatsApp is most popular in parts of the world where the median income is a little above $1 a day.Most of its "customers" do not pay even the modest yearly fee.Such customers are not widely appealing to advertisers and cannot be charged significant fees - for example, for mobile payments - since they have so little to begin with.In any event, regardless of whether or not WhatsApp is ever successfully monetized, it is a play for the same mobile advertising pot.The cost of buying it is, therefore, an expense incurred to support Facebook's current primary business.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Intel spent a similar sum developing a new processor , it would not hold that cost on the books as goodwill , so that the impact on GAAP profits is protected .  (Uncertainty) </span>Facebook should not receive such an accounting pass either, at least from a careful investor.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Instagram also was a defensive purchase as the app was rapidly spreading among the most important audience - important to advertisers and also in terms of <b>predicting</b> future global trends - namely Americans below 25 .  (Uncertainty) </span>In retrospect the purchase was nonetheless a bargain as it succeeded in fending off the threat of an upstart.Inevitably Instagram has begun to languish under the benign neglect of FB management and has been surpassed by Snapchat.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Not in overall usage , but in the critical under 25 crowd in the United States , where time spent on social media is now <i>more</i> often on Snapchat than FB or Instagram ( that is , <i>more</i> hours are devoted to Snapchat ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although almost <b>unknown</b> and certainly unused by those above 30 , Snapchat has a fanatical following among teens and the youngest adults .  (Uncertainty) </span>Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel refuses to calculate "monthly active users" which FB touts.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Instead Snapchat focuses on daily and even hourly use , with 100 million active users under this <i>stricter</i> criterion .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Those are largely the 100 million most important individuals both to advertisers and to investors who wish to <b>predict</b> future trends .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company has, according to reliable rumor, turned down a $10B offer from Facebook.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Apparently</b> Facebook 's business requires periodic expenditures of large sums just to play defense .  (Uncertainty) </span>A monopoly typically cracks from the establishment of a niche, which then expands.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even if the young are regarded as a niche , they <b>may</b> age , continuing to use the same platform .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Conversely , FB need not <b>worry</b> about the geriatric set anytime soon .  (Uncertainty) </span>To be clear, the young also are on FB.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>For example , <b>nearly</b> three-fourths of all Snapchat users also are on FB - it 's just that they spend far <i>more</i> time on Snapchat .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>At any rate, most of Facebook's acquisition expenses are incurred chasing the very same advertising dollars rather than developing a new line of business.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This would still be true even if Instagram , Messenger or WhatsApp are eventually successfully monetized .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Oculus <b>may</b> be the exception to the rule , genuinely representing an attempt to enter a new business .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even there , depending on how the virtual reality product is implemented , it <b>may</b> be ultimately primarily incorporated into the existing products .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So far , however , Oculus has produced only <i>more</i> expenses .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For its lifetime as a public company , then , FB has spent $ 25B on acquisitions , which currently produce essentially <i>more</i> expenses while reporting GAAP earnings of $ 9.5 B. ( FB claimed earnings of $ 0.5 B in 2012 , $ 2.8 B in 2013 , $ 5.0 B in 2014 , and has fallen to $ 1.2 B for the first half to 2015 ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The irony is that , should FB admit that one or <i>more</i> of its defensive acquisitions were overpriced , the write-off of goodwill would be a non-cash expense .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even those who bemoan option expenses ( which FB tries to hide , for example by requiring analysts to <b>predict</b> future earnings on a non-GAAP basis ) typically give a pass for goodwill write downs .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Yet the cost to investors is quite real and indeed can be an order of magnitude <i>greater</i> than the promiscuous issuance of stock .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>By contrast , AMZN has , to a much <i>larger</i> extent , favored internal development over acquisition .  (Surprise) </span>As soon as selling books became profitable (indeed, slightly before), AMZN expanded into selling CDs and DVDs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As it became <b>apparent</b> that also would soon be profitable , AMZN began selling electronics , and so forth .  (Uncertainty) </span>After selling pretty much everything became profitable , AMZN invested into initially mysterious heavy tech spending , which later produced the Kindle and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services ( AWS ) , among other results . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To be sure , it also produced the Fire Phone , <b>probably</b> much to Tim Cook 's amusement , and certainly to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's loss , but all expenses for each effort were duly accounted for , not held as goodwill . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Out of these various new endeavors, AWS is, of course, the crown jewel.Indeed, AWS is a superlative asset whose like is not approached anywhere else in the tech world.This is not because of superior foresight.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That cloud infrastructure would eventually be huge was never a <b>surprise</b> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For as long as Google has been a publicly traded company it was assumed that it - <b>perhaps</b> along with Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) and <b>perhaps</b> IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) - would eventually duel it out for mastery of this potentially lucrative centerpiece of the future world of computing .  (Uncertainty) </span>Instead, AMZN, whose core principles include a bias toward prompt action, quietly established a dominant position while the others were still busy making strategic plans.It would be difficult to overstate the dominance of AWS in infrastructure as a service (IaaS, for those who favor altogether pointless acronyms).Several estimates put AWS infrastructure sales as equal to the next 14 competitors combined, but this still understates the situation.The next closest, albeit still distant, follower is MSFT, but its Azure is used only by those already using Azure for their web servers.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While hardly a negligible market , it 's <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> moribund , whereas Linux-based servers continue to rapidly expand .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Nearly</b> all of this fast growing group converges on AWS , which has by far the largest set of services with the largest supporting community surrounding it .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Thus for new tech companies their choices are AWS or - well , pretty much to <b>appear</b> peculiar and endanger their venture funding .  (Uncertainty) </span>Once a company begins using a particular cloud infrastructure platform, it is exceptionally difficult to ever switch.According to a recent (August 31, 2015 issue) BusinessWeek article, Netflix investigated switching, but decided moving from AWS would require a costly multi-year effort and decided to simply stick with their competitor.That is what sticky looks like.In the Q2 (July) report, AWS had $1.82B in revenue, up 81% y/y with $391M in profit.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is nothing <b>nearly</b> so superlative to compare with it in the cloud space , especially inasmuch as AWS actually showed accelerating , not decelerating revenue growth .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For contrast , Salesforce.com ( NYSE : CRM ) , with y/y revenue growth in the low 20s , and decelerating appreciably , has a Price/Sales of about 8 ( a little <i>less</i> after the recent crash ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If we estimate the next 12 months revenue of AWS at $ 12B , as its growth implies , this <b>suggests</b> a market cap of $ 100B for AWS .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Or it would , if AWS did not have vastly <i>greater</i> growth than CRM , and the advantages of being actually profitable , as well as dominating its space in a way that Salesforce does not .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In fact , no cloud company remotely has the combination of monopolistic <b>probabilities</b> and extreme high growth AWS does .  (Uncertainty) </span>Such superlatives merit and inevitably earn a premium in the market, typically proportional at least to the ratio of respective growth rates.Therefore a $300-350B market cap as a standalone company is plausible on a comparison basis.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To be sure , it 's a bit shady to use comparative valuations in a frothy segment , as cloud companies <b>doubtless</b> are , even after the recent sell off .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The comparison is offered only to <b>suggest</b> that a spin-off IPO would be highly lucrative .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has an asset it <b>could</b> dispose of , were it so minded . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A <i>better</i> fundamental valuation is to estimate likely earnings over the next 12 months .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The run rate is $ 1.6 B , but profit growth should be <i>more</i> than 100 % over the next year , as economy of scale kicks in .  (Surprise) </span>So let us say $3.5B in profits for the forward year, and taking into account the very rapid growth and high chance of monopolizing a potentially quite large market, 50x$3.5B = $175B as a conservative estimate.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Probably</b> too low , but at least high enough to scandalize Graham purists .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Core Retailing Profitability <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's core retail business also is quite profitable . With trailing twelve month revenue of $97B, AMZN's balance sheet shows $9B profit from operations.The $1.7B that came from selling stock (via option grants) should be deducted, as should the $0.4B attributable to AWS.Conversely, there are several large expenses which should be added back before considering the profitability of the core retail operation.These include large losses from the Fire Phone (not just the inventory write-down, but development and marketing), the cost of drone research, expensive efforts to break into China, and numerous new business efforts such as booking local contractors, home delivery of restaurant meals, and so forth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The total of all these efforts is <b>unknown</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Being a physicist by background I 'm <i>more</i> comfortable with a rough estimate than pretended precision .  (Surprise) </span>Let us take the total expenses not associated with current operations to be at least $3B.After deductions and additions then we come to $10B.With a currency adjusted growth y/y growth rate currently at 27%, this implies, at PEG=1, a valuation of $270B for the core retail business.Owner Earnings and Capital Expenditures Some investors mistakenly deduct AMZN's capitalized leases for new distribution centers from their operating cash flow.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In analyzing some , or <i>better</i> most , companies it 's quite proper to subtract similar sounding capitalized expenditures .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>No matter how much Intel spends on its current die shrink , it will need to spend as much again , or <i>more</i> , for the still <i>more</i> difficult shrink which follows .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is a marathon race which will <b>probably</b> outrun the investor 's lifetime .  (Uncertainty) </span>Likewise, a chain expanding across the country in company-owned stores will have to be building brick and mortar for decades.But this is not the case for much of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's capitalized leases ( which they virtually own , except in name ) . To understand why, it helps to consider a little history.On June 22 , 2000 , as the dot-com implosion was underway , an otherwise unremarkable and unremarked bond analyst , Ravi Suria of Lehman Brothers , created a media sensation when he announced that his gimlet-eyed analysis of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's cash flow showed that the company would be bankrupt by that fall . This was contrary to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's own analysis showing it nearing break-even cash flow ( but still with GAAP losses ) . Mr. Suria had the good fortune to be widely hailed as a hero and truth teller, touted for refuting the crazy supposition that a market capitalization of $2-3B was plausible for the leading internet retailer.The magazine "Individual Investor" named Mr. Suria "truth teller of the year" for 2000.As the stock fell below $5/share, it advised readers to "keep your shorts on."The fall cover of Individual Investor asked whether 2000 would be `` <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's last Christmas ? '' Actually, it was the last Christmas for Individual Investor.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For that matter , Lehman Brothers lasted a bit <i>longer</i> , but it too , is gone .  (Surprise) </span>As for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , a funny thing happened during the dot-com crash . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>AMZN did what its detractors claimed it <b>could</b> not , namely accumulated cash , paid down debt and became GAAP positive .  (Uncertainty) </span>This while fully expensing options at a time when companies like Intel and Cisco still refused to do so.Why was Lehman so wrong?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The mistake Mr. Suria made was to suppose that the construction of a few regional warehouses was a cash flow deduction that , like Intel 's die shrinks , could be extrapolated into the <b>indefinite</b> future .  (Uncertainty) </span>In fact, at the time of his announcement, AMZN already had all the warehouses it needed for its then current mode of operation.It was several years before targeting new opportunities that caused <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to enter another epoch of intensified capital spending . It would be a Lehman-sized error to make the same mistake about the current burst of capitalized spending.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In fact the current construction ( about 50 regional distribution centers , and they <b>may</b> not be quite done ) has little to do with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's current operations . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sees a future in which a delivery vehicle carrying goods for AMZN ( either directly or fulfilling a third party order ) goes up and down virtually every street in every populous neighborhood in the nation . Given their recent advances in warehouse robotics, the incremental cost of each delivery then shrinks considerably, while their tactical moat over competitors becomes overwhelming.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Crucially , these investments make it <b>possible</b> to sell groceries , a <i>larger</i> business ( $ 650B/year ) than everything else <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> currently sells combined . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Expenditures, which are not necessary for the current business, will occur only for a limited time, and are aimed primarily at a large new market are not properly deducted from cash flow.Instead it's those expenditures which are necessary to defend an existing business (Intel's die shrinks or FB's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp) that should be deducted from cash flow.In its short time as a public company, Facebook has spent $25B playing defense.This loss is unacknowledged on the books, which holds the full cost as goodwill.The money is still gone.Conversely , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> developed valuable assets , one of which alone is worth $ 175B . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However AWS has <b>almost</b> certainly produced a net recorded GAAP loss for its lifetime , given the years it took to build .  (Uncertainty) </span>Creating and owning an exceptionally valuable asset is not a true "loss."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One of several ironies of the situation is that even were FB to later write down the corresponding goodwill , most investors and analysts would give them a pass , wrongly <b>believing</b> that `` goodwill is a non-cash expense . ''  (Uncertainty) </span>Yet the money FB spent really is gone, and AMZN's asset is really still there.This yet understates the stark difference between owner earnings for the two companies.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The owner of FB , while paying out these whopping sums , would still be fretting about the rise of yet another youth niche social network ( SnapChat ) , as well as the possibility that fickle advertisers <b>could</b> find other ways of targeting their audience once the new wears off .  (Uncertainty) </span>Conversely, our AMZN owner is sleeping well, knowing that AWS and e-tailing are two key franchises in which the company is utterly dominant.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even better , a rather significant <b>possibility</b> exists of intruding into the advertising market itself .  (Uncertainty) </span>Both Facebook and Google , are acutely aware of the Amazonian danger ( that shoppers will begin to search on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's site first ) , hence the pair 's otherwise seemingly quixotic attempts to insert themselves into the shopping process . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has achieved its enviable dominance while encountering <b>surprisingly</b> little negative coverage - at least until fairly recently . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It has , for example , at least half and possibly two-thirds of the e-Book market , <b>depending</b> on the estimate .  (Uncertainty) </span>Yet - outside of the publishing industry - there is little appreciation let alone complaining about this dominance.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Indeed , one is likely to instead find analysts <b>worrying</b> that AMZN 's profits will be negatively impacted by the transition of media consumption to digital .  (Uncertainty) </span>Undoubtedly it has helped <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's image to have masked its large owner earnings through constant expansion . That expansion is not just of its existing businesses but also into distinctly different avenues.Profits are likely to be too large to hide soon, especially for AWS.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That fact , along with the <b>fear</b> AMZN engenders in the print industry , means a negative bias from the press is virtually inevitable in the near future .  (Uncertainty) </span>Naturally I am not referring to the New York Times article describing the shocking fact that one employee out of 80,00 sent an e-mail after midnight.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>No doubt the article was necessary , as that <b>probably</b> never happened anywhere else .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> investors should see appreciation the next few years . Facebook owners are not likely to be so lucky.Disclosure: I am/we are long AMZN.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .
