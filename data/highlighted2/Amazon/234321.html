are newly able to access the Internet thanks to cheap smartphones For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>it is already the largest contributor of new customers outside the United States But like local rivals Flipkart and Snapdeal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has struggled with deliveries in cities where snarlups are frequent and road signs unreliable In response firms have set up logistics networks and use motorbikes instead of trucks Flipkart for one has tapped Mumbais dabbawalas a more than a centuryold lunch box distribution service More than two years on from its arrival in India <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>says it is now ready to apply some of the innovations applied here to markets including the United States Mexico and Brazil Britain for example could get a delivery service called Easy Ship where orders are picked up by Amazons crew directly from sellers cutting out the time and cost of sending goods to a
