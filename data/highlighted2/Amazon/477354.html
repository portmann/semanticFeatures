(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's Turi acquisition is just the latest in a string of acquisitions related to artificial intelligence.Apple has shown that it can "come from behind" in AI as it did in mobile processors through acquisitions and R&D.Apple can exploit synergies through its control of both processor and OS development to field the most compelling mobile AI service.Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) acquisition of Turi bolsters its capabilities in machine learning and AI.Apple is following the same pattern it did in acquiring expertise in processor design, which thrust it into a position of leadership in mobile processors within a few years.Apple will pursue leadership in AI with equal vigor because AI is the ultimate killer app.I had the opportunity to participate in a podcast interview recently with fellow SA contributor Brian Bain, which should be coming out this week.During the interview, I brought up the fact that I expected one of the most significant innovations in the upcoming iPhone 7 to be in the processor.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I made the point that processor innovation is often ignored in media coverage of <b>rumors</b> concerning the next iPhone .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Brian questioned whether consumers really care about the details of processor technology , and I had to concede that they most <b>probably</b> do n't .  (Uncertainty) </span>It's a fundamental problem for Apple: how to translate its processor leadership into tangible benefits that consumers care about.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Sure , the processor helps everything work a little <i>better</i> , but it 's not an obvious feature the way an OLED screen is .  (Surprise) </span>At the same time, Apple has been roundly criticized for falling behind its competitors in AI and machine learning.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Alphabet 's ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) Google , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , and Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) all have much <i>more</i> robust and useful AI capability baked into their platforms , as I pointed out recently . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>SA contributor BayesianLearner has also criticized Apple's AI efforts, but wrote a very positive and informative take on the Turi acquisition: Apple did not just buy some algorithms or a team, it bought a platform that can be used as the basis for future machine-learning services.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Indeed , <b>perhaps</b> the most significant aspect of Turi 's offerings is that it advertises that its solutions are highly scalable from individual devices to cloud platforms .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And if it seems implausible that AI <b>could</b> be hosted on a smartphone , keep in mind that Qualcomm ( NASDAQ : QCOM ) recently announced a software development kit ( SDK ) to provide AI and machine learning on its Snapdragon 820 processor .  (Uncertainty) </span>Turi is just the latest in a string of acquisitions by Apple of companies with expertise or products related to AI.These include the purchase last October of VocalIQ , a UK startup specializing in natural speech recognition, and Perceptio specializing in image recognition.Perceptio is especially interesting in this context because Perceptio's goals were to implement its algorithms on smartphones, according to Bloomberg .In January, Apple acquired Emotient , specializing in facial expression recognition.Clearly, Apple's ongoing interest in preserving the privacy of its customers, combined with its own processor expertise, make localized AI a natural offering.To some degree, Apple's AI services will have to be distributed between individual devices and its cloud services.Search, maps, and AI based recommendations all necessarily have to be cloud based.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But localized AI gives Apple 's powerful mobile processors a raison d'etre that <b>perhaps</b> they have lacked until now .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple's position in AI reminds me of where it was in mobile processors prior to 2010.Despite the growing popularity of iPhone and iPod, Apple was still buying the processors for these devices from Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) in much the same way it buys processors for the Mac from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ).That started to change in 2010 when Apple introduced its own "custom designed" A4 system on chip (SOC) for the first iPad.Apple's claim of designing the A4 has to be taken with a grain of salt, however.Apple was in effect serving as a silicon system integrator, in much the same role as it is a system integrator of components for its Macs.Apple's design role for the A4 was confined mostly to selecting and integrating other companies' designs.It bought graphics processor designs from Imagination Technologies and it used a CPU core designed by a small startup, Intrinsity.Samsung served as the foundry for the part.At the same time, Apple had been building its own design capabilities.It had bought PA Semi in 2008, and then in 2010, it bought Intrinsity, which had supplied the A4 CPU core design to Samsung for use in a Samsung mobile processor as well as the A4.From that base, through rapid hiring and R&D expansion, Apple moved through a succession of A series SOCs until its first 64 bit custom processor, the A7, which debuted in late 2013 with the iPhone 5s.The A7 was a watershed event.Not only had Apple completely taken over the design of the CPU core, it had produced the world's first 64 bit smartphone processor.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The A7 was <i>faster</i> than any competing smartphone processor , and sent the industry reeling .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Today , <b>almost</b> every high and mid-tier smartphone uses a 64 bit processor , because they 're just much <i>faster</i> than the <i>older</i> generation 32 bit devices .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>As revolutionary as the A7 was, it didn't particularly help iPhone sales, since it was introduced into an "S" model year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It was n't until the iPhone 6 and its <i>larger</i> screen that Apple 's processor expertise was really put to good use .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple did n't just make a phablet , it made a phablet that was fast and fluid , that did n't hitch while scrolling , that <b>could</b> run apps and play games with high performance and excellent battery life .  (Uncertainty) </span>Now that large screens have become the norm, mixed local/cloud based AI provides a natural way to translate Apple's processor leadership into tangible consumer benefits.Apple will be able to offer powerful AI services with the best privacy protection in the business.Will Apple be able to progress as rapidly in AI services as it did in processor design?I think so.It took Apple about 5 years to go from the PA Semi acquisition to the A7.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It will <b>probably</b> take Apple about 5 years to go from the Turi acquisition to leadership in AI .  (Uncertainty) </span>Over that interval, Apple's AI capabilities will continue to improve with each new OS generation (all platforms).One of the key discriminators for Apple is that it controls its processor design, its device design, and its operating systems design.No other of Apple's competitors has control over all three areas.There are synergies to be had as a result that make Apple's products superior in ease of use and reliability.AI functionality is going to become another crucial area of synergy for Apple, and Apple most likely will achieve a leadership position as a result.I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy for investors with a 3-5 year investment horizon.Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, QCOM.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Editor 's Note : This article discusses one or <i>more</i> securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange .
