You Need <i>More</i> People ' - Netflix , Inc. ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) | Seeking Alpha Shock Exchange , New York Shock Exchange ( 800 clicks ) NFLX sold off after the company missed on its domestic subscriber growth metrics .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Management blamed the miss on miscues related to new chip-enabled credit cards that <b>may</b> have caused `` involuntary churn '' .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We do n't <b>believe</b> management ... It needs <i>more</i> people to corroborate its claims .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The culprit for Netflix's (NASDAQ: NFLX ) recent fall was the company's underwhelming domestic subscriber growth.Domestic and international subscribers were up Q/Q by 2.1% and 11.8%, respectively.The performance was consistent with that of Q2 2015 where domestic and international subscribers grew Q/Q by 2.1% and 11.4%, respectively.Management's rationale for the domestic subscriber miss was "involuntary churn": In net additions they were down year-over-year, and that we explained and attributed to our involuntary churn or payments-related churn.We think partially that was due to the transition to the chip cards, which is still ongoing.And we've reflected that trend going forward into Q4 in our guidance.Credit card companies are shifting to chip-enabled cards.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If the expiration date , security code , etc. changed on the <i>newer</i> cards , the cards <b>may</b> not have worked properly .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Customers <b>may</b> then have been required to manually enter their new information , and not doing so <b>may</b> have contributed to the involuntary churn .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This rationale simply does not hold water , and management needs <i>more</i> people to corroborate its claims .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I Found This Odd For The Following Reasons : Even if <i>newer</i> chip-enabled cards did not work , customers would have found a way to manually enter their credit card information if they wanted the service that badly .  (Surprise) </span>I have gotten new apartments where the first thing I set up was the cable - even before the furniture was installed.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>could</b> not live without ESPN , and watched it while organizing the furniture .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When I was <i>younger</i> and cash-strapped , I tried to stretch my payables to stem cash flow .  (Surprise) </span>However, I always paid the cable bill on time; I was addicted to it.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Management 's argument is there <b>may</b> have been hiccups in the service , yet consumers did n't frantically call to reconnect it .  (Uncertainty) </span>In my opinion, either customers are not "addicted" to Netflix much as we suspected or the domestic subscriber market has become saturated.There are several other companies with customers who use chip-enabled cards, so why wasn't their subscriber base negatively impacted?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Had other companies made similar claims , it would have lent <i>more</i> credence to Netflix 's argument .  (Surprise) </span>In fact, some companies dismissed them: But several firms and a retail industry association contacted by Reuters on Thursday, including Spotify, a music service with over 20 million subscribers, said they had not experienced issues with the new cards ... The National Retail Federation, an industry group, has "heard nothing at all" from its retail members about issues with the new cards, according to J. Craig Shearman, vice president of government affairs public relations.In Q3 2014, domestic describers only grew 2.7% sequentially, falling shy of the 2.8% expectation; the stock sold off 26% after-hours.NFLX has been fueled by international subscriber growth.Secondly, the domestic market was thought to be saturated in Q3 2014 when subscribers totaled 37.2 million.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Why would the market expect subscribers to keep growing <b>nearly</b> 3 % sequentially off a Q2 2015 subscriber base of 42.3 million ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Either analysts were unrealistic or management needed to do a <i>better</i> job of managing expectations .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In addition to the renewed focus on Netflix 's domestic subscribers , I <b>believe</b> investors are now scrutinizing crowded trades .  (Uncertainty) </span>Hedge funds have been making leveraged bets in the so-called `` FANGs '' - Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , Netflix and Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>These firms ' top-line growth in addition to tailwinds from QE and zero interest rates have driven their shares <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise) </span>However, over the past three months, things have changed.China threw the entire market for a loop when it devalued its currency in August.It was a de facto admission that the world's second largest economy was slowing.China has recently been the biggest contributor to global economic growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A slowing China <b>could</b> portend a slowing global economy .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Secondly , a Fed rate hike <b>could</b> stymie the general market .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If the Fed does n't hike , it <b>could</b> imply the U.S. economy is <i>weaker</i> than expected , which would not bode well for corporate earnings .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Over the past three months, NFLX has been the worst performer among the FANGs, having fallen about 6%.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The other participants all had stellar Q3 earnings results , which <b>probably</b> explains their <i>better</i> performance .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In my opinion, the market has reached an inflection point pursuant to the FANGs.Those that hit their metrics each quarter and continue to fire on all cylinders will remain market darlings.Those that do not will sell off.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do not <b>believe</b> management 's claims about the chip-enabled credit cards .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> Netflix 's domestic market has become saturated and market sentiment has turned .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company <b>may</b> hit its metrics in Q4 ; however , NFLX will eventually make a misstep and the stock will sell off violently .
