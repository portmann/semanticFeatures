Unfortunately, according to statistics published by the website analytics firm Compete, traffic to Dillard's website was down 35% year-over-year for the month of June, a trend the company will have to reverse.Based on the above valuation profile Dillard's trades at a significant discount to its overall industry.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> much of this disparity in valuation to be deserved based on the company 's very limited growth prospects and deteriorating position in a shifting market .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In a historical context Dillard 's does not <b>appear</b> to be trading at too steep of a discount either , with the company 's median price to earnings ratio for the past 5 years coming in at 12.89 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Therefore I <b>believe</b> shares are relatively well-priced by the market at current prices , with my price target of $ 104 ( 2016 EPS estimate * 13 P/E ratio ) indicating limited upside .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Dillard 's stock is down <i>more</i> than 20 % thanks to a <b>disappointing</b> earnings report .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Fundamentally the company remains relatively strong , but a look at the company 's growth story is <i>less</i> promising .  (Surprise) </span>Exacerbated by the fact that the company does not hold quarterly conference calls, the company's growth strategy is low visibility and there are few answers as to how Dillard's will maintain its market share in the face of stiffening competition.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Therefore while shares <b>could</b> very likely see a <b>relief</b> rally I am not looking to invest in Dillard 's at the moment .
