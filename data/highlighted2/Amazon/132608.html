company remains strong but the companys growth story is much more about maintaining than growing Shares of Dillards NYSE DDS have been on a rollercoaster ride this year After rallying to start the year and scraping the mark shares were sent lower on the back of disappointing results reported in May and have drifted lower ever since Presently shares are trading right around the psychologicallyimportant mark With this current leg lower being one of only a few major pullbacks the companys stock has seen since bottoming at in late and rallying ever since it may be time to see if shares are worth an investment Dillards has been a publiclytraded company since and therefore it is only appropriate that Dillards enjoys superior operational efficiency metrics although it has not always been so Currently the companys TTM operating margin of and TTM return on equity of both stand head and shoulders above the department stores industry average marks On an asset utilization basis Dillards generates more in revenue for every dollar in assets than the average company in the industry Looking to the companys balance sheet no major causes for concern are raised In total Dillards holds million in combined debt and capital lease obligations and million in cash and cash equivalents Overall Dillards sports a current ratio of and a debttoequity ratio of both of which indicate satisfactory financial strength Looking to the past Dillards revenue topped out all the way back in and has been on a steady decline ever since while the companys earnings have seen a revitalization like never before in recent years Moving forward analysts expect Dillards revenue to basically be flat in the future while mild growth is expected in the companys EPS as the focus in this mature company turns further to improving operational efficiencies It is worth noting however that EPS expectations have come down significantly in past months and now only anticipate and growth in and respectively For Dillards the growth story going forward is much more about maintaining and optimizing rather than expanding The company is currently only working on the construction of new stores all of which are expected to open in either August or October When the overall company consists of locations new locations does not move the dial much only representing store growth On the comparable store sales side of things Dillards is becoming increasingly reliant on its current stores to drive overall company growth In the companys most recent quarter comparable store sales actually declined yearoveryear indicating that the company lost ground to its competition The competition now not only includes traditional brickandmortar department stores but also <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>AMAZON among other online retailers Maintaining its share of the department store market will be crucial to Dillards future growth as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>continues to expand its presence in the space Cowen Research even sees Amazons market share of the US apparel and accessories market expanding from currently to by If Dillards has a chance at combating such intrusion by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and others the companys online platform and strategy will have to drive growth for the company Unfortunately according to statistics published by the website analytics firm Compete traffic to Dillards website was down yearoveryear for the month of June a trend the company will have to reverse Based on the above valuation profile Dillards trades at a significant discount to its overall industry I believe much of this disparity in valuation to be deserved based on the companys very limited growth prospects and deteriorating position in a shifting market In a historical context Dillards does not appear to be trading at too steep of a discount either with the companys median price to earnings ratio for the past years coming in at Therefore I believe shares are relatively wellpriced by the market at current prices with my price target of EPS estimate PE ratio indicating limited upside Dillards stock is down more than thanks to a disappointing earnings report Fundamentally the company remains relatively strong but a look at the companys growth story is less promising Exacerbated by the fact that the company does not hold quarterly conference calls the companys growth strategy is low visibility and there are few answers as to how Dillards will maintain its market share in the face of stiffening competition Therefore while shares could very likely see a relief rally I am not looking to invest in Dillards at the moment Source Dillards Finally Worth A Look Under
