(NYSE:DDS) | Seeking Alpha Dillardâ€™s stock has been on a crazy roller-coaster so far in 2015 that has ultimately left shares down 20%.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Fundamentally the company remains strong but the company 's growth story is much <i>more</i> about maintaining than growing .  (Surprise) </span>Shares of Dillard's (NYSE: DDS ) have been on a rollercoaster ride this year.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>After rallying to start the year and scraping the $ 145 mark , shares were sent <i>lower</i> on the back of <b>disappointing</b> results reported in <b>May</b> and have drifted <i>lower</i> ever since .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Presently shares are trading right around the psychologically-important $100 mark.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With this current leg <i>lower</i> being one of only a few major pullbacks the company 's stock has seen since bottoming at $ 2.50 in late 2008 and rallying ever since , it <b>may</b> be time to see if shares are worth an investment .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Dillard's has been a publicly-traded company since 1969 and therefore it is only appropriate that Dillard's enjoys superior operational efficiency metrics, although it has not always been so.Currently the company's TTM operating margin of 8.24% and TTM return on equity of 16.25% both stand head and shoulders above the department stores industry average marks.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On an asset utilization basis Dillard 's generates $ 0.34 <i>more</i> in revenue for every dollar in assets than the average company in the industry .  (Surprise) </span>Looking to the company's balance sheet no major causes for concern are raised.In total Dillard's holds $616 million in combined debt and capital lease obligations and $458 million in cash and cash equivalents.Overall Dillard's sports a current ratio of 2.01 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.39, both of which indicate satisfactory financial strength.Looking to the past Dillard's revenue topped out all the way back in 2000 and has been on a steady decline ever since while the company's earnings have seen a revitalization like never before in recent years.Moving forward analysts expect Dillard's revenue to basically be flat in the future while mild growth is expected in the company's EPS as the focus in this mature company turns further to improving operational efficiencies.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is worth noting ; however , that EPS expectations have come down significantly in past months and now only <b>anticipate</b> 3.6 % and 10.2 % growth in 2016 and 2017 , respectively .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>For Dillard 's the growth story going forward is much <i>more</i> about maintaining and <b>optimizing</b> rather than expanding .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The company is currently only working on the construction of 3 new stores, all of which are expected to open in either August or October.When the overall company consists of 297 locations 3 new locations does not move the dial much, only representing 1% store growth.On the comparable store sales side of things Dillard's is becoming increasingly reliant on its current stores to drive overall company growth.In the company's most recent quarter comparable store sales actually declined 1% year-over-year, indicating that the company lost ground to its competition.The competition now not only includes traditional brick-and-mortar department stores but also <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( AMAZON ) among other online retailers . Maintaining its share of the department store market will be crucial to Dillard 's future growth as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continues to expand its presence in the space . Cowen Research even sees <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's market share of the U.S. apparel and accessories market expanding from 5 % currently to 14 % by 2020 . If Dillard 's has a chance at combating such intrusion by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and others the company 's online platform and strategy will have to drive growth for the company . Unfortunately, according to statistics published by the website analytics firm Compete, traffic to Dillard's website was down 35% year-over-year for the month of June, a trend the company will have to reverse.Based on the above valuation profile Dillard's trades at a significant discount to its overall industry.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> much of this disparity in valuation to be deserved based on the company 's very limited growth prospects and deteriorating position in a shifting market .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In a historical context Dillard 's does not <b>appear</b> to be trading at too steep of a discount either , with the company 's median price to earnings ratio for the past 5 years coming in at 12.89 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Therefore I <b>believe</b> shares are relatively well-priced by the market at current prices , with my price target of $ 104 ( 2016 EPS estimate * 13 P/E ratio ) indicating limited upside .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Dillard 's stock is down <i>more</i> than 20 % thanks to a <b>disappointing</b> earnings report .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Fundamentally the company remains relatively strong , but a look at the company 's growth story is <i>less</i> promising .  (Surprise) </span>Exacerbated by the fact that the company does not hold quarterly conference calls, the company's growth strategy is low visibility and there are few answers as to how Dillard's will maintain its market share in the face of stiffening competition.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Therefore while shares <b>could</b> very likely see a <b>relief</b> rally I am not looking to invest in Dillard 's at the moment .
