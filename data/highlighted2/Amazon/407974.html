class='textDiv'>PayPal For The Long Run PayPal Holdings Inc NASDAQPYPL Seeking Alpha Trust your instincts this company has a great business model PayPal has industry dominance over competitors and room to grow When people look back on PayPal NASDAQ PYPL years from now many will wish they had invested in the company Although I believe the stock market is headed for a bumpy ride this company should continue to find success for many years As investors many times we worry too much about certain ratios the underlying value and hype around a company Yet we forget that investing can be simpler than we think One of the first books I read for investing was Peter Lynchs Beating the Street Two statements from this book that had an impact on me still hold true today The first was Peter stating that accountants and mathematicians arent the richest people in the world thus investing shouldnt be based solely on financials The second was Peter expressing industry dominance and how a company that controls their industry is usually a safe bet I shouldve remembered these statements years ago when I was skeptical about investing a large sum of money in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Was it overvalued at the time at a share Yes it was But instead of trusting my instincts to invest in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>I sought council from an experienced and successful friend who suggested staying away from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Unfortunately I did not invest and missed out on a great opportunity From this experience I learned a great lesson as an investor trust your instincts That is why I am bullish on PayPal and believe this is a great time to buy To make things simple this company has a great business model and has a clear path to keeping its position in this industry Global growth potential for PayPal is great and will only become better as time goes on PayPal will continue to lead the way for safer transactions and will shape the way the world handles money This company also has some great partnerships and has market penetration in multiple countries PayPal has a brand unlike any other in its industry Not only is PayPal considered a safer method for online money transfers but it can be used for virtually any transaction <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>had noticed the success PayPal achieved thus ending the use of PayPal in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>marketplace Yet this was when PayPal was still combined with Amazons competitor eBay Now that these two have split from one another there is potential for a future partnership with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>But even if PayPal never strikes a deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>they still have a partnership with Alibaba NYSE BABA These are steps PayPal has taken to grow their business globally and it is assuring to see them open a new door of opportunity when another one closed I didnt find it shocking to see that PayPal has over of market dominance with the next competitor being Stripe a company I have never heard of That is the kind of influence PayPal has over its consumers It holds such a command in its industry that it makes you question Who is the other guy With a solid track record of beating earnings its hard to imagine why they wouldnt be the industry leader First quarter results for PayPal were very strong with revenue up and net income increased to million As an established brand their customer base continues to grow with an additional million active customers added in Q and million active users overall Although these numbers are impressive they have yet to scratch the surface of available users globally Recently PayPal has partnered with Vodafone allowing them to penetrate the mobile side of their business in Europe which will lead to significant growth PayPal also offers financing for large purchases and is so widely used around the world that stores use PayPal for all their transactions With continued outreach to merchants PayPal added million to their platform within the first quarter alone This global outreach reflects PayPals PE ratio which is I believe this ratio is fine considering there is substantial growth within the company and industry as a whole As a college student I can assure you that Venmo is the go to app for online transactions among millennials Once millennials are hooked on a certain app there is little chance they will abandon the current software for a new one There are only a handful of students I personally know that do not use Venmo which is due only to security fears Yet most of those who were fearful have made the transition to use Venmo Millennials would rather use their smartphone than carry cash and it is a real trend I have noticed There is no charge for these transactions and it uses a social platform to make money transfers fun Ive met landlords that are using Venmo to accept rent from students which means this isnt just a millennial fad this has potential to be used by established businesses as well This application is able to reach all demographics through its simplicity After showing my mother Venmo she has taken a liking to the app and uses it regularly This personal experience matters because for the most part I am an exception to the stereotype of that fits millennials I am a millennial that dislikes social media and uses it on occasion Yet I have to say I do love to use Venmo for multiple transactions The increasing use of Venmo is evident in PayPals Q report which shows that Venmo processed billion total payment volume up YOY Its safe to say that this purchase by PayPal has paid off and will continue to add value to their company Trust your instincts and think long term because this company has potential to be a great long term buy for investors
