(NASDAQ:PYPL) | Seeking Alpha Trust your instincts, this company has a great business model.PayPal has industry dominance over competitors and room to grow.When people look back on PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ) years from now, many will wish they had invested in the company.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although I <b>believe</b> the stock market is headed for a bumpy ride , this company should continue to find success for many years .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As investors , many times we <b>worry</b> too much about certain ratios , the underlying value and hype around a company .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Yet , we forget that investing can be <i>simpler</i> than we think .  (Surprise) </span>One of the first books I read for investing was Peter Lynch's "Beating the Street".Two statements from this book that had an impact on me still hold true today.The first was Peter stating that accountants and mathematicians aren't the richest people in the world, thus investing shouldn't be based solely on financials.The second was Peter expressing industry dominance and how a company that controls their industry is usually a safe bet.I should 've remembered these statements years ago when I was skeptical about investing a large sum of money in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . Was it overvalued at the time at $150 a share?Yes, it was.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But instead of trusting my instincts to invest in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , I sought council from an experienced and successful friend who <b>suggested</b> staying away from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Unfortunately, I did not invest and missed out on a great opportunity.From this experience, I learned a great lesson as an investor: trust your instincts.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That is why I am bullish on PayPal and <b>believe</b> this is a great time to buy .  (Uncertainty) </span>To make things simple, this company has a great business model and has a clear path to keeping it's position in this industry.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Global growth potential for PayPal is great , and will only become <i>better</i> as time goes on .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>PayPal will continue to lead the way for <i>safer</i> transactions and will shape the way the world handles money .  (Surprise) </span>This company also has some great partnerships and has market penetration in multiple countries.PayPal has a brand unlike any other in its industry.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Not only is PayPal considered a <i>safer</i> method for online money transfers , but it can be used for virtually any transaction .  (Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> had noticed the success PayPal achieved , thus ending the use of PayPal in the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> marketplace . Yet , this was when PayPal was still combined with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's competitor eBay . Now that these two have split from one another , there is potential for a future partnership with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . But , even if PayPal never strikes a deal with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , they still have a partnership with Alibaba ( NYSE : BABA ) . These are steps PayPal has taken to grow their business globally and it is assuring to see them open a new door of opportunity when another one closed.I didn't find it shocking to see that PayPal has over 60% of market dominance , with the next competitor being "Stripe" (a company I have never heard of).That is the kind of influence PayPal has over it's consumers.It holds such a command in it's industry that it makes you question, "Who is the other guy?".With a solid track record of beating earnings, its hard to imagine why they wouldn't be the industry leader.First quarter results for PayPal were very strong with revenue up 19% and net income increased 43% to 365 million.As an established brand, their customer base continues to grow, with an additional 4.5 million active customers added in Q1 2016 and 185 million active users overall.Although these numbers are impressive, they have yet to scratch the surface of available users globally.Recently, PayPal has partnered with Vodafone, allowing them to penetrate the mobile side of their business in Europe, which will lead to significant growth.PayPal also offers financing for large purchases and is so widely used around the world, that stores use PayPal for all their transactions.With continued outreach to merchants, PayPal added 14 million to their platform within the first quarter alone.This global outreach reflects PayPal's P/E ratio, which is 36.04.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> this ratio is fine considering there is substantial growth within the company and industry as a whole .  (Uncertainty) </span>As a college student, I can assure you that Venmo is the go to app for online transactions among millennials.Once millennials are hooked on a certain app, there is little chance they will abandon the current software for a new one.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are only a handful of students I personally know that do not use Venmo , which is due only to security <b>fears</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Yet , most of those who were <b>fearful</b> have made the transition to use Venmo .  (Uncertainty) </span>Millennials would rather use their smartphone than carry cash and it is a real trend I have noticed.There is no charge for these transactions and it uses a social platform to make money transfers "fun".I've met landlords that are using Venmo to accept rent from students, which means this isn't just a millennial fad, this has potential to be used by established businesses as well.This application is able to reach all demographics through its simplicity.After showing my mother Venmo, she has taken a liking to the app and uses it regularly.This personal experience matters because for the most part, I am an exception to the stereotype of that fits millennials.I am a millennial that dislikes social media and uses it on occasion.Yet, I have to say, I do love to use Venmo for multiple transactions.The increasing use of Venmo is evident in PayPal's Q1 2016 report , which shows that Venmo processed $3.2 billion total payment volume, up 154% YOY.It's safe to say that this purchase by PayPal has paid off and will continue to add value to their company.Trust your instincts, and think long term because this company has potential to be a great long term buy for investors.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology</div></body></html>
