class='textDiv'>Handmade Reveals Amazons Most Important Moat Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>seems to be looking for top end prolific handmade sellers What Handmade at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>reveals about the market discovery process of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>With the launch of Handmade at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN the giant retailer continued its insatiable appetite for bringing new products or services to the marketplace Well get into the implications of that in a moment concerning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and how the decision process to enter this market revealed one of the most powerful moats <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has Well also look at the risk to Etsy NASDAQ ETSY and if its to the magnitude some believe As for the market on the sellers side of it this is part of an ongoing selfemployment freelancing trend that has been going on for years That coupled with more access to consumers because of Internet ecommerce has been a powerful catalyst continuing to drive this market From a consumer point of view theyre increasingly looking for unique items outside of massmanufacturing including a process they like to follow or measure from beginning to end to ensure it lines up with their ethics This isnt something all consumers are concerned with but in the handmade market its far more prevalent and important to buyers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will start off with a modest number of sellers of handmade goods having launched the service with approximately artisans They represent every state in the US and others from countries Initially items will be offered for sale A little over items will be made eligible for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime More will be added as the service grows The categories of products offered at launch will be Home products Art Baby Bedding Bath Bedding Furniture Home Dcor Kitchen Dining Lighting Patio Lawn Garden Storage Organization Party Supplies and Stationery and Jewelry according to the companys site <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will charge percent for the sales made by sellers on Handmade at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Sellers will be able to participate in discounted shipping and payment processing as part of doing business with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Sellers will be charged a monthly fee in the future if they sell over items a month on Handmade at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>In the beginning of the service it has been waived Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is charging a lot more to sellers per item sold it suggests to me its a screening device to keep certain types of sellers away The future monthly fee is probably another screening device used to weed out the less serious sellers The monthly fee wont be activated until August The company has positioned itself as an alternative to Etsy by not allowing any massmanufactured items to be sold in its marketplace That is in contrast to Etsys decision to allow some massmanufactured goods to be sold on its platform That has proven unpopular with many of Etsys sellers The easily anticipated conclusion that this is going to kill Etsy has already been made by some analysts led by a research note from Wedbush saying almost percent of Etsys sellers are planning to or are considering selling products on Handmade at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>One problem with that assertion is it was based on a sampling of only current Etsy sellers Wedbush believes this means Etsy sellers arent loyal to the company which implies they may leave en masse and join <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>In a recent S filing by Etsy it said almost a third of its active sellers and percent of its active buyers since through were still active Also in almost percent of Etsys gross merchandise sales came from repeat business Its highly unlikely sellers will abandon Etsy in large numbers in light of that type of performance From the sellers side of it over percent of gross merchandise sales was repeat business The point is looking at sellers is only one piece of the data The other is the buyer side and it appears they are very loyal to their artisans Of course thats a risk as well Its doubtful Etsy is the reason they buy from an artisan Its the artisan that has built a loyal following So if they were to pack up and leave Etsy their customers would certainly follow That said many sellers have been at Etsy for years and to simply abandon the store they have build up there would take more than grumbling about Etsys policies concerning massmanufacturing That may change if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does this right but in the next year or two I dont see this being much of an issue for Etsy other than looking over its shoulder at what may come next from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>As of June Etsy had million buyers and million sellers It charges percent for sales and a cent listing fee for each item listed on the platform What it looks like to me is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is attempting to siphon off its best sellers which if they see an opportunity to increase sales on the much larger customer base of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>it may result in them using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as their primary sales outlet In that regard Etsy could be at risk of retaining only lowerlevel sellers while losing its best to its new giant competitor Itll take time to see if Etsy is up to the challenge but in the short term it would be surprising to see if it has significant material impact on the performance of Etsy There are too many relationships built through the years to see it suddenly crumble The benefit will be to the sellers at first who will be given another outlet for their custommade goods If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>exceeds expectations for the prolific producers and sellers that is what to look for concerning the depth of impact it may have on Etsy Thatll take time In its press release vice president for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Marketplace Peter Faricy made what appeared to be an offhand comment about the impetus behind Handmade at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>That is what initiated the interest in creating the new platform and its one of the powerful moats <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has enjoyed for years Those businesses and entrepreneurs that understood that have used as a marketing research engine themselves <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has at its disposal extraordinary data which is generated from sales and customer searches on its site All it has to do is find patterns within the data to see if a specific market has a lot of potential and if consumers are looking to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to serve it Thats the embryo of many of Amazons businesses and why it has such an advantage over many of its competitors A lot of people dont understand that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is one of the top if not the top search engines in the world today Those millions of searches creates a treasuretrove of data that can be accessed for invaluable hints as to what consumers are looking for and what the company can do to provide a selling platform to meet that demand Internal search data is a giant moat of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>that very few competitors can match Im not sure any can within the market it competes in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has more immediate and open access to its own data and if other businesses find it extremely valuable its even more so for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>which has it all visibly at its fingertips The challenge for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is to make sense out of the gigantic amount of data it has to sift through Handmade at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>targets a very robust market one which has been growing for years and caters a number of trends that have converged to create the market for handmade goods It should do very well and provide another revenue stream for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>The question now is if its going to increase the size of the overall market because of its participation or if itll have to steal market share from Etsy and smaller competitors in order to grow If it does have to do that its own growth will be modest and Etsy will struggle to maintain market share even as it struggles to grow The major value in this initiative in my view is it reveals the powerful data machine behind this new business for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Having access to this enormous amount of material will be something its competitors never will have at the level it does and thats why new projects like this will continually emerge from its pipeline creating a variety of retail revenue streams in the
