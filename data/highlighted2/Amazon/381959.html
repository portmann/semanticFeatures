#A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>reported to be one of bidders for Frankfurt Hahn Airport Location is ideal and would allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to easily link all European warehouses overnight While much of the media was focused on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN airline operation in the United States over Christmas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was quietly running a similar operation in Europe linking Poland Germany and the UK with a Boeing freighter As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>tries to move deeper into the freight industry in Europe in addition to the United States it has been reported that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is one of three bidders for the Frankfurt Hahn Airport in Germany The facility in Hahn Germany just outside of Frankfurt is positioned ideally for an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>airline to connect all of Europe Ownership of the airport would give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in Europe what it has got in the United States with its air operation in Wilmington Ohio at the former DHL facility The Hahn airport which hosts several low cost airlines along with a few cargo airlines is currently loss making with ownership having previously changed in when owner Fraport sold of the facility for including in debt This debt has increased since the previous deal and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would likely have to take it on in any buyout Airlines have cut service to the facility and cargo which is a large focus of the airport has fallen at the airport in recent years leading the owners of the airport to try and sell it FedEx NYSE FDX UPS NYSE UPS and DHL OTCPKDPSTF all run large air cargo operations in Germany due to its status as Europes largest economy and also due to its ideal geographic location positioned almost in the center of Europe Img Boeing F Range From Hahn Airport The green circle shows the operating range from Hahn of a Boeing freighter the Boeing freighter aircraft with the least range Taking a closer look at the airport and its geographic location shows that using this Boeing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would be able to easily connect the airport to any city in Europe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could link cities near all of its European warehouses to this airport meaning that for instance a package could be delivered to Poland from a warehouse in Spain overnight via one stop in Hahn Germany This could make the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime program much more attractive to many customers in Europe Img Aerial View Of Frankfurt Hahn Airport Taking a closer look at the airport on Google Earth shows that it is in a very rural area surrounded by very little other than fields which is an ideal location if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>needed to build additional warehouses in the area to support growth of the air hub This is an important attribute as airports in much more built up areas such as Londons Heathrow airport see much needed expansion endlessly blocked due to its location in a built up area One of the major issues with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in much of Europe is its lack of products relative to its offerings in the United States Table <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Products For Sale By Country Having a system in place that could efficiently move products from a warehouse in the UK for instance to one in Italy could allow the retailer to list more items in many of these other countries In addition the TTIP a free trade agreement in the works would remove customs duties on many goods shipped between the United States and Europe This could make it possible in the future if implemented for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to fly goods to Europe overnight from its US warehouses for products that it does not stock in Europe This could increase the number of products available in its European markets substantially making it a more attractive platform for Europeans to shop on and in turn increasing sales The above map shows the current <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Airline operation in the United States The current operation though small allows the company to easily move goods to any region of the United States overnight from any of its warehouses The operation internally called project Dragon Boat aims to have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>control much of its supply chain Bloomberg has reported that the initiative may be formally launched as early as sometime this year as Global Supply Chain By <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Earlier this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>announced a deal with ATSG to lease Boeing aircraft and also registered with the US Federal Marine Commission allowing the company to sell ocean freight services Eventually a network of shipping trucking and aircraft could allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to become a global shipping powerhouse and as I described in my in depth analysis here could lead to a million revenue improvement by reducing shipping costs only Despite the positives there are many potential issues for such a project A rebound in oil could have severe financial implications for the project while FedEx and UPS could make life very difficult for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>if they believe the company is becoming a threat to them DHL tried to run an air operation out of Wilmington Ohio for its US cargo business and while the operation at its peak handled million packages per day and employed it was eventually deemed a failure and shut down This is from a company who serves almost every market on earth from North Korea to the United States So time will only tell if the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>bid for a German airport turns its retail empire into a supply chain empire or the operation goes the way of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fire Phone
