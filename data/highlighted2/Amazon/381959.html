( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> reported to be one of 3 bidders for Frankfurt - Hahn Airport . Location is ideal and would allow <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to easily link all European warehouses overnight . While much of the media was focused on the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) airline operation in the United States over Christmas , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was quietly running a similar operation in Europe , linking Poland , Germany and the UK with a Boeing 737 freighter . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> tries to move <i>deeper</i> into the freight industry in Europe in addition to the United States it has been reported that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is one of three bidders for the Frankfurt Hahn Airport , in Germany . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The facility in Hahn , Germany , just outside of Frankfurt is positioned ideally for an <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> airline to connect all of Europe . Ownership of the airport would give <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in Europe , what it has got in the United States with its air operation in Wilmington , Ohio , at the former DHL facility . The Hahn airport, which hosts several low cost airlines along with a few cargo airlines is currently loss making, with ownership having previously changed in 2009 when owner Fraport sold 65% of the facility for €1 including €120 in debt.This debt has increased since the previous deal and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> would likely have to take it on in any buyout . Airlines have cut service to the facility and cargo, which is a large focus of the airport has fallen 28% at the airport in recent years leading the owners of the airport to try and sell it.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>FedEx ( NYSE : FDX ) , UPS ( NYSE : UPS ) , and DHL ( OTCPK : DPSTF ) all run large air cargo operations in Germany due to its status as Europe 's largest economy and also due to its ideal geographic location , positioned <b>almost</b> in the center of Europe .  (Uncertainty) </span>Img 2 : Boeing 737-300F Range From Hahn Airport The green circle shows the operating range from Hahn of a Boeing 737-300 freighter, the Boeing 737 freighter aircraft with the least range.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Taking a <i>closer</i> look at the airport and its geographic location shows that using this Boeing 737 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> would be able to easily connect the airport to any city in Europe . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> link cities near all of its European warehouses to this airport , meaning that for instance a package <b>could</b> be delivered to Poland from a warehouse in Spain overnight via one stop in Hahn , Germany . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This <b>could</b> make the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime program much <i>more</i> attractive to many customers in Europe . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Img 3 : Aerial View Of Frankfurt - Hahn Airport Taking a <i>closer</i> look at the airport on Google Earth shows that it is in a very rural area , surrounded by very little other than fields which is an ideal location if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> needed to build additional warehouses in the area to support growth of the air hub . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is an important attribute as airports in much <i>more</i> built up areas such as London 's Heathrow airport see much needed expansion endlessly blocked due to its location in a built up area .  (Surprise) </span>One of the major issues with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in much of Europe is its lack of products relative to its offerings in the United States . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Table 1 : <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Products For Sale By Country Having a system in place that <b>could</b> efficiently move products from a warehouse in the UK for instance to one in Italy <b>could</b> allow the retailer to list <i>more</i> items in many of these other countries . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In addition, the TTIP , a free trade agreement in the works would remove customs duties on many goods shipped between the United States and Europe.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This could make it <b>possible</b> in the future if implemented for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to fly goods to Europe overnight from its U.S warehouses for products that it does not stock in Europe . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This <b>could</b> increase the number of products available in its European markets substantially , making it a <i>more</i> attractive platform for Europeans to shop on and in turn increasing sales .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The above map shows the current <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Airline operation in the United States . The current operation, though small allows the company to easily move goods to any region of the United States overnight from any of its warehouses.The operation , internally called project `` Dragon Boat '' , aims to have <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> control much of its supply chain . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Bloomberg has reported that the initiative may be formally launched as early as <b>sometime</b> this year as `` Global Supply Chain By <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . '' (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Earlier</i> this year <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> announced a deal with ATSG to lease 20 Boeing 767 aircraft and also registered with the US Federal Marine Commission , allowing the company to sell ocean freight services . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Eventually , a network of shipping , trucking and aircraft <b>could</b> allow <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to become a global shipping powerhouse , and as I described in my in depth analysis here , <b>could</b> lead to a $ 870 million revenue improvement by reducing shipping costs only 10 % . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Despite the positives there are many potential issues for such a project.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A rebound in oil could have severe financial implications for the project , while FedEx and UPS could make life very difficult for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> if they <b>believe</b> the company is becoming a threat to them . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>DHL tried to run an air operation out of Wilmington, Ohio for its U.S cargo business, and while the operation at its peak handled 1 million packages per day and employed 9,500 it was eventually deemed a failure and shut down.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is from a company who serves <b>almost</b> every market on earth from North Korea to the United States .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So time will only tell if the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> bid for a German airport turns its retail empire into a supply chain empire , or the operation goes the way of the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Fire Phone .
