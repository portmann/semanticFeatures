receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Amazons potential delivery service is not a significant threat to UPS The real problem they face is a slowdown in the economy When it comes to the United Parcel Service NYSE UPS investors love talking about the threat of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Theres constant chatter that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is creating a delivery network to crush UPS And thats why you should sell Yes its true You should sell UPS But not because of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may be a longterm threat but investors are blowing it out of proportion The real reason you should sell is because of massive macroeconomic headwinds These macro drivers trump any problems <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may cause UPS is in the business of making deliveries Theyre the busiest and most profitable when the economy is booming But thats not whats currently happening in the US Our economy is slowing The faltering economy along with lower oil prices and a stronger dollar are killing UPS As the story goes the relationship between UPS and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been on the rocks lately Costs became too much and forced UPS to raise their prices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was not pleased You dont raise prices on King Bezos You only lower them Bezos was famously quoted as saying With this kind of attitude higher prices wont work Especially when Bezos entire business centers around undercutting everyone Rumors have now surfaced that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is in talks with Boeing to lease jets for an aircargo business There are also reports that they purchased a large amount of trailers for their own trucking business Add this to their drone plans and Uberstyle metro delivery system and you can see a strategy forming This is what scares investors They worry that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will grow to become selfsufficient for deliveries They wont need UPS anymore Investors not only think that the resulting lack of ecommerce demand will kill UPS profits but also that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could also start taking over other delivery segments too But as weve said this sentiment is blown out of proportion First UPS does not make much money from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Losing them would not be a large problem It is true that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is UPS biggest customer and provides them over billion in revenue But thats only a tiny amount of their total expected revenues of billion in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a large customer but UPS is sufficiently diversified The margins on delivering Amazons packages are also razor thin The company makes almost nothing on those deliveries This is largely due to the huge discount <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>negotiates King Bezos usually gets what he wants In the year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>launched their Prime day shipping service UPS gave them delivery discounts of up to percent Discounts like that dont help the bottom line Accommodating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has recently become even harder due to a rise in delivery costs These higher perpackage costs place significant pressure on margins And when you combine them with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>discount the economics start to look terrible So while the general increase in ecommerce would seem to be good for UPS its actually more of a burden More ecommerce leads to more packages delivered to sprawling residential areas And these are the types of deliveries UPS barely breaks even on So no losing Amazons business would not be the end of the world And as far as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>building a transportation network thatll overtake every delivery segment To that we say investors need to slow down We agree its usually not wise to bet against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Its a capable company thats able to produce results in many different sectors But even so we shouldnt assume that they will dominate the delivery business UPS has been making deliveries for years In that time theyve become pretty good at what they do <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may be able to enter the market but dominating it is a different story There are many logistical and cost issues that UPS has been solving for over a century It will take <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>a good amount of time to cross those hurdles Theres no need to worry about their small scale operations at this point As weve explained the growth in ecommerce deliveries is not profitable for UPS But if thats true then where does UPS make its money The answer is bulk shipping UPS makes the most money when they deliver a large volume of items to a single place The main customers for this type of shipping are businesses For an example just think of bulk deliveries to corporate headquarters or business parks Businesstobusiness BB deliveries are the key to profits for UPS These types of deliveries increase when the economy is buzzing When businesses are doing well theyre making more deals They send more product back and forth to each other And this is where UPS comes in and makes their money in delivering that product A strong economy equals a strong UPS Based on a variety of indicators its clear the US economy is hurting This is a big problem for UPS when almost of their revenue comes straight from the US The graph below depicts US Industrial Production growth It measures the output of a variety of industrial businesses such as manufacturers As you can see industrial production decreased in December yearoveryear This follows the drop in November which was the first decrease since December The trend has been down for the entirety of and will continue to do the same in Lesser production means fewer deliveries This does not bode well for UPS Another way to look at the health of the economy is through the ISM Index This index shown below has been dropping since the end of and is now at Any reading below signifies a contraction in the manufacturing economy As we explained in our death of the bull market article contracting production has a history of preceding recessions The ISM and Industrial Production numbers above are not reassuring in this regard Were also in the middle of a expansion cycle thats longer than of the expansions since To say were due for a contraction at this point would be an understatement Another great signal for recessions is viewing the combination of order backlogs and inventory levels Stanford PhD John Hussman explained this concept in this article Hes recently seen companies order backlogs dry up while their inventories have grown Recessions usually occur when inventory levels become too high forcing companies to scale back their production The resultant decrease in private investment has a large negative effect on GDP helping to cause a recession A dull economy leads to less business activity and fewer deliveries If UPS gets less business their profits will decrease We can already see this decline happening with the Cass Freight Index The Cass Freight Index is useful to measure the health of transport companies The index measures monthly freight activity Freight activity includes goods transported by truck train ship or plane You can view the results below was a disappointment Monthly freight activity dropped significantly from Also much of the second half of the years activity was the lowest in years The deteriorating economy is having a large effect on transports For a more anecdotal example of how the economy is doing just look at the office furniture industry When the economy is doing well business booms and companies expand To expand and hire workers these companies need more office equipment Office furniture companies perform well in this environment But when the economy is struggling and companies stop expanding office equipment companies suffer Steelcase NYSE SCS is a company that makes many different types of office furniture Their latest earnings report was a disaster Their stock dropped over as a result Steelcase drastically lowered their sales forecast and stressed many difficulties going into As CEO Jim Keane explained The thing that was most pronounced was a decline in orders from large customers and a decline in large projects At the same time order growth in the US furniture industry has slowed as has overall US business capital spending Our orders and pipeline at the end of the quarter showed fewer large projects than last year The Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturers Association or BIFMA is the premier club for many different office equipment manufactures According to them office furniture growth has plummeted It dropped from in the beginning of the year to at the end The office furniture industry is a good example of the type of BB transactions that transports like UPS depend on If they run into trouble the effects carry over to UPS The transport sector in general has been in a steep decline Check out the Transport ETF NYSEARCA IYT below All the transports including UPS have been struggling with the slowdown in the economy Not only do you have a significant downtrend since the end of but now the transports are falling off a cliff They violated a major multiyear support line and are plunging lower As Steve Cohen said in Market Wizards percent of a stocks price movement is due to the market percent to the sector and only percent to the stock itself Much of the weakness in UPS comes from weakness in the general transports sector The bad economy is tanking everything And it will only get worse from here A look at UPS earnings shows that theyre already feeling the effects Revenue has not grown for the past years and margins have stayed around for the past years At best UPS is stalling Their latest third quarter revenues came in at billion which was a decrease from a year ago UPS reported slower growth in its US Domestic Package segment that accounts for over of its revenue Per package revenue decreased by and ground product delivery struggled because of lower industrial production and fewer BB shipments As weve explained this is a direct result of less business activity in a struggling economy The Supply Chain Freight segment makes up over of revenue This segment includes logistics services provided to other companies and also larger trucking activities The logistics side reported a drop in revenue Less business activity meant fewer companies needing help to route their trucks There was also a drop in freight revenue due to a reduction in tonnage The reason cited was soft market demand meaning fewer customers needing products shipped Of course thats again due to a slower economy On top of a struggling economy UPS also has to deal with lower oil prices affecting their business Most people would think that lower prices at the pump would help a delivery company like UPS Cheaper gas should lead to lower costs and higher profits right Many transports actually benefit from higher fuel prices because of fuel surcharges Fuel surcharges are costs passed on to customers based on fuel prices Although these surcharges are only supposed to cover the gas bill they usually cover a lot more too And this is why transport companies love them You see this phenomenon a lot in the long haul trucking industry but it also happens with delivery companies like UPS Just take a look at third quarter earnings again A decrease in fuel surcharges caused much of the disappointing results Operating profits in the US Domestic Package segment dropped by due to the lower charges The International Package segment also suffered for the same reason Package yield declined by Supply Chain Freight were affected too Businesses have a difficult time adjusting to rapidly changing fuel prices And the type of volatility that hurts them is exactly what were experiencing now As weve discussed in our oil article the volatile price decline will not end anytime soon UPS will continue to suffer A strong dollar has had an impact on most multinational companies UPS is no exception The revenue these companies make overseas are denominated in foreign currencies Companies have to convert this revenue back into dollars As the dollar grows stronger the conversion rate becomes a big hurdle and overseas revenues becomes worth less This in turn affects the bottom line The International Package division accounts for over of UPS total revenue And according to the latest earnings report it has been struggling Revenue in the segment dropped from a year earlier in most part due dollar appreciation Unfortunately for UPS the dollar will only grow stronger The Fed is expected to keep raising rates throughout helping to strengthen it And as weve explained before the rest of the world will also continue to devalue their currencies This sets up a lot of runway for further dollar appreciation The way the economy is trending is not good for UPS Its stock price will likely take a dive This is especially true because of how overvalued it is compared to its competitors Take FedEx NYSE FDX for example FedEx has been fast on the heels of UPS business for years Due to recent upgrades FedEx can now offer faster deliveries on of its routes At the same time UPS only has an advantage over FedEx on of its routes Its this type of hustle from FedEx that has allowed it to continuously gain market share for the past years straight FedEx is catching up overseas too With their recent acquisition of TNT they now own of the European express delivery market UPS only owns a little more at of the market FedExs revenue is almost as large as UPS revenue Its also posting faster earnings growth But even so FedExs market cap is less than half of UPS UPS also trades near x forward earnings while FedEx only trades near x Its clearly overvalued Its true that FedEx suffers from the same macro headwinds but due to its overvaluation UPS stock price has a lot more room to fall UPS recently broke a huge support line near This is a multiyear support level going all the way back to October At Foundation Investing we alerted our premium members to our short position on UPS should continue lower and we look forward to disappointing earnings on February nd that will likely cause further pain </div></body></html>
