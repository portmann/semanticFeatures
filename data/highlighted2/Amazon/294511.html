(Uncertainty) </span>As we've explained, the growth in e-commerce deliveries is not profitable for UPS.But if that's true, then where does UPS make its money?The answer is bulk shipping.UPS makes the most money when they deliver a large volume of items to a single place.The main customers for this type of shipping are businesses.For an example, just think of bulk deliveries to corporate headquarters or business parks.Business-to-business (B2B) deliveries are the key to profits for UPS.These types of deliveries increase when the economy is buzzing.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When businesses are doing well , they 're making <i>more</i> deals .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They send <i>more</i> product back and forth to each other .  (Surprise) </span>And this is where UPS comes in and makes their money -- in delivering that product.A strong economy equals a strong UPS.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Based on a <b>variety</b> of indicators , it 's clear the US economy is hurting .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is a big problem for UPS when <b>almost</b> 75 % of their revenue comes straight from the US .  (Uncertainty) </span>The graph below depicts US Industrial Production growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It measures the output of a <b>variety</b> of industrial businesses such as manufacturers .  (Uncertainty) </span>As you can see, industrial production decreased 1.8% in December year-over-year.This follows the 1.2% drop in November, which was the first decrease since December 2009.The trend has been down for the entirety of 2015 and will continue to do the same in 2016.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Lesser</i> production means <i>fewer</i> deliveries .  (Surprise) </span>This does not bode well for UPS.Another way to look at the health of the economy is through the ISM Index .This index (shown below) has been dropping since the end of 2014 and is now at 48.2.Any reading below 50 signifies a contraction in the manufacturing economy.As we explained in our "death of the bull market" article, contracting production has a history of preceding recessions.The ISM and Industrial Production numbers above are not reassuring in this regard.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We 're also in the middle of a expansion cycle that 's <i>longer</i> than 29 of the 33 expansions since 1854 .  (Surprise) </span>To say we're due for a contraction at this point would be an understatement….Another great signal for recessions is viewing the combination of order backlogs and inventory levels.Stanford PhD John Hussman explained this concept in this article .He's recently seen companies' order backlogs dry up while their inventories have grown.Recessions usually occur when inventory levels become too high, forcing companies to scale back their production.The resultant decrease in private investment has a large negative effect on GDP, helping to cause a recession.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A dull economy leads to <i>less</i> business activity and <i>fewer</i> deliveries .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If UPS gets <i>less</i> business , their profits will decrease .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>We can already see this decline happening with the Cass Freight Index.The Cass Freight Index is useful to measure the health of transport companies.The index measures monthly freight activity.Freight activity includes goods transported by truck, train, ship, or plane.You can view the 2015 results below.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>2015 was a <b>disappointment</b> .  (Surprise) </span>Monthly freight activity dropped significantly from 2014.Also, much of the second half of the year's activity was the lowest in 4 years.The deteriorating economy is having a large effect on transports.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For a <i>more</i> anecdotal example of how the economy is doing , just look at the office furniture industry .  (Surprise) </span>When the economy is doing well, business booms and companies expand.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To expand and hire workers , these companies need <i>more</i> office equipment .  (Surprise) </span>Office furniture companies perform well in this environment.But when the economy is struggling and companies stop expanding, office equipment companies suffer.Steelcase (NYSE: SCS ) is a company that makes many different types of office furniture.Their latest earnings report was a disaster.Their stock dropped over 20% as a result.Steelcase drastically lowered their sales forecast and stressed many difficulties going into 2016.As CEO Jim Keane explained: The thing that was most pronounced was … a decline in orders from large customers and a decline in large projects.At the same time, order growth in the US furniture industry has slowed, as has overall US business capital spending.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Our orders and pipeline at the end of the quarter showed <i>fewer</i> large projects than last year .  (Surprise) </span>The Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturers Association, or BIFMA, is the premier club for many different office equipment manufactures.According to them, office furniture growth has plummeted.It dropped from 10% in the beginning of the year to 3% at the end.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The office furniture industry is a good example of the type of B2B transactions that transports like UPS <b>depend</b> on .  (Uncertainty) </span>If they run into trouble, the effects carry over to UPS.The transport sector in general has been in a steep decline.Check out the Transport ETF (NYSEARCA: IYT ) below.All the transports, including UPS, have been struggling with the slowdown in the economy.Not only do you have a significant downtrend since the end of 2014, but now the transports are falling off a cliff.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They violated a major , multi-year support line and are plunging <i>lower</i> .  (Surprise) </span>As Steve Cohen said in Market Wizards, ....40 percent of a stock's price movement [is] due to the market, 30 percent to the sector, and only 30 percent to the stock itself… Much of the weakness in UPS comes from weakness in the general transports sector.The bad economy is tanking everything.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And it will only get <i>worse</i> from here .  (Surprise) </span>A look at UPS' earnings shows that they're already feeling the effects.Revenue has not grown for the past 2 years and margins have stayed around 16% for the past 5 years.At best, UPS is stalling.Their latest third quarter revenues came in at $14.2 billion, which was a 0.4% decrease from a year ago.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>UPS reported <i>slower</i> growth in its US Domestic Package segment that accounts for over 60 % of its revenue .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Per package revenue decreased by 2.5 % and ground product delivery struggled because of <i>lower</i> industrial production and <i>fewer</i> B2B shipments .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As we 've explained , this is a direct result of <i>less</i> business activity in a struggling economy .  (Surprise) </span>The Supply Chain & Freight segment makes up over 15% of revenue.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This segment includes logistics services provided to other companies and also <i>larger</i> trucking activities .  (Surprise) </span>The logistics side reported a drop in revenue.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Less</i> business activity meant <i>fewer</i> companies needing help to route their trucks .  (Surprise) </span>There was also a 8.6% drop in freight revenue due to a reduction in tonnage.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The reason cited was soft market demand , meaning <i>fewer</i> customers needing products shipped .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Of course that 's again due to a <i>slower</i> economy .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On top of a struggling economy , UPS also has to deal with <i>lower</i> oil prices affecting their business .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Most people would think that <i>lower</i> prices at the pump would help a delivery company like UPS .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Cheaper</i> gas should lead to lower costs and <i>higher</i> profits right ?  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Many transports actually benefit from <i>higher</i> fuel prices because of fuel surcharges .  (Surprise) </span>Fuel surcharges are costs passed on to customers based on fuel prices.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Although these surcharges are only supposed to cover the gas bill , they usually cover a lot <i>more</i> too .  (Surprise) </span>And this is why transport companies love them.You see this phenomenon a lot in the long haul trucking industry, but it also happens with delivery companies like UPS.Just take a look at third quarter earnings again.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A decrease in fuel surcharges caused much of the <b>disappointing</b> results .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Operating profits in the US Domestic Package segment dropped by 1.6 % due to the <i>lower</i> charges .  (Surprise) </span>The International Package segment also suffered for the same reason.Package yield declined by 3.5%.Supply Chain & Freight were affected too.Businesses have a difficult time adjusting to rapidly changing fuel prices.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And the type of <b>volatility</b> that hurts them is exactly what we 're experiencing now .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As we 've discussed in our oil article , the <b>volatile</b> price decline will not end anytime soon .  (Uncertainty) </span>UPS will continue to suffer.A strong dollar has had an impact on most multinational companies.UPS is no exception.The revenue these companies make overseas are denominated in foreign currencies.Companies have to convert this revenue back into dollars.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As the dollar grows <i>stronger</i> , the conversion rate becomes a big hurdle , and overseas revenues becomes worth <i>less</i> .  (Surprise) </span>This in turn affects the bottom line.The International Package division accounts for over 20% of UPS' total revenue.And according to the latest earnings report, it has been struggling.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Revenue in the segment dropped 7 % from a year <i>earlier</i> in most part due dollar appreciation .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Unfortunately for UPS , the dollar will only grow <i>stronger</i> .  (Surprise) </span>The Fed is expected to keep raising rates throughout 2016, helping to strengthen it.And as we've explained before , the rest of the world will also continue to devalue their currencies.This sets up a lot of runway for further dollar appreciation.The way the economy is trending is not good for UPS.Its stock price will likely take a dive.This is especially true because of how overvalued it is compared to its competitors.Take FedEx (NYSE: FDX ) for example.FedEx has been fast on the heels of UPS' business for years.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Due to recent upgrades , FedEx can now offer <i>faster</i> deliveries on 30 % of its routes .  (Surprise) </span>At the same time, UPS only has an advantage over FedEx on 3% of its routes.It's this type of hustle from FedEx that has allowed it to continuously gain market share for the past 16 years straight.FedEx is catching up overseas too.With their recent acquisition of TNT, they now own 22% of the European express delivery market.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>UPS only owns a little <i>more</i> at 25 % of the market .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>FedEx 's revenue is <b>almost</b> as large as UPS ' revenue .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's also posting <i>faster</i> earnings growth .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But even so , FedEx 's market cap is <i>less</i> than half of UPS ' .  (Surprise) </span>UPS also trades near 16x forward earnings while FedEx only trades near 12x.It's clearly overvalued.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's true that FedEx suffers from the same macro headwinds , but due to its overvaluation , UPS ' stock price has a lot <i>more</i> room to fall .  (Surprise) </span>UPS recently broke a huge support line near $93.00.This is a multi-year support level going all the way back to October 2013.At Foundation Investing , we alerted our premium members to our short position on 1/7/2016.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>UPS should continue <i>lower</i> , and we look forward to <b>disappointing</b> earnings on February 2nd that will likely cause further pain .
