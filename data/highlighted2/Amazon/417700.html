class='textDiv'>When Will <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Trade At A Justifiable Valuation Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Bulls say to give the company time to grow as an industry disruptor the profits will come Bears tend to focus on the past while also worrying about whether the company can execute on its initiatives Usually both arguments are heavy on qualitative thought and light on what matters the numbers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could trade at a reasonable valuation by on todays share price if revenue continues to grow and margins continue to expand Neither are guaranteed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN bears are likely a little shortsighted in their criticism of the company Yes the company trades at x ttm earnings Yes the companys international operations are currently operating at a loss But for a company thats rapidly disrupting and expanding in its market sometimes you need to be willing to pay a premium today for a company that will be tomorrows market leader At least thats what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>bulls say But when exactly was the last time you saw an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>bull tell you when the company will trade at a fair valuation I have no dog in this race Im a deep value investor but I thought it was time to bring a little math and a little common sense to a debate that often has neither Of course predicting a companys financials is difficult The further out you model the more and more sensitive your data becomes to even incredibly small variations in your inputs I never model out beyond five years for this reason But when youre playing with your future retirement money five years should be plenty of time for a company to meaningfully get to a decent value proposition Do you really want to invest your money in a company that isnt going to be reasonably valued more on that below five years from now I personally dont Tough enough question but one that has to be answered before we get knee deep in SEC filings and mathematical models Everyone has their own relative opinion of what a fair and reasonable valuation for a stock is and that obviously can vary even for the same individual investor It can differ based on the companys chosen business market its future prospects any risks such as secular trends along with a myriad of other factors For all intents and purposes Im going with a ttm GAAP PE of for this exercise It is nice and round eliminates all those pesky backouts like stockbased compensation that executive suites like to exclude nowadays and isnt far off the average ttm PE of large caps in the market that exists today If you dont like that number feel free to tweak it for your own uses For my own numbers thats what were rolling with We know our end goal here In order for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to trade at a PE the company must generate in the neighborhood of B in after tax GAAP profit based on todays equity price The after tax profit number for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in M Weve obviously got a long road to go to get this company to that number I would have loved to put this model together for you piecemeal line item by line item but it is difficult to put together in that fashion here on Seeking Alpha You can either read the line item information below for the assumptions I used and then go check the results or vice versa Net Sales Net sales have been accelerating posting a gain in and a gain in This trend has been mostly been driven by growth in the companys Services sales rather than product deliveries Services net sales up from B in to B in Overall Wall Street consensus currently calls for growth in slowing to growth in These average numbers are divisive estimates for revenue vary around the mean Well take the Wall Street guys at face value for and assume a more moderate growth rate for and onward given that a company with B in expected annual sales is likely to see some moderation over time due to sheer size Ive taken annual from there and went with it Thats plenty aggressive in my opinion Cost of Sales Gross margin was in in and in Trend is up but it has been a fluctuating target that has proven hard to estimate This is a lumpy expense category anything from the wholesale cost of consumer products that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sells to digital media costs associated with Prime Video and Prime Music are found here As the company gains size and scale however gross margins will tend to improve naturally If you look through Amazons SEC filings there is very little granularity provided when it comes to cost of sales which is what has led to such a surprise on bottom line expectations consistently for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>For our purposes well assume continued gross margin improvement due higher margins in the quicker growing Services segment and continued benefits from operational leverage Ive gone with bps in gross margin improvement in and falling to bps annual improvement thereafter Just remember that the higher Amazons gross margins go the more incrementally difficult it becomes to extract further gains Other Operating Expenses While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>breaks down this category in its financials Ive lumped Fulfillment Marketing Technology and Content and General Administrative costs altogether just for terseness For added detail on these expenses fulfillment costs relate to costs incurred in operating and staffing fulfillment and customer service centers along with payment processing costs creditdebit cards Marketing expenses are related to costs incurred in keeping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>a household name through the companys marketing initiatives Technology and Content expenses relate to most of the costs related to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services servers networking equipment payroll General Administrative is simply corporate overhead Overall these Other Expenses have been growing quicker than revenue growth in recent years Nominally now B in from B in You can pin most of the blame here on Technology and Content up from levels to B in due to the massive investment in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services including some hefty stock option expense and Fulfillment up from levels to B in due to massive investment in the companys distribution infrastructure Well assume <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has two more years of other expense growth that is higher than revenue growth Ive used growth in and and modeled other expense growth at growth for the remaining years generating the company a little operating leverage in and beyond Interest Expense As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>now generates free cash flow it is reasonable to assume interest costs will not grow unless the company wishes to intentionally lever the balance sheet Several of these debt notes that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>issued during the November and December debt raises will come due during our model timeframe and will need to be refinanced For the sake of simplicity well just assume M in annual run rate interest expense levels We dont need to make a mountain out of a molehill in this endeavor and any movement up or down in interest expense matters very little compared to the other assumptions Tax Rate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has paid varying amounts of taxes over recent years Ive assumed a tax rate the norm for established retailers in this industry see WalMart NYSE WMT Target NYSE TGT On the assumptions written above net income comes in at B in or a TTM GAAP PE of x on todays share price Not what we were looking for when it comes to fair but it isnt wholly unreasonable compared to a lot of equity valuations today Sanity check against Wall Street consensus makes sense on a M share count the above model sees in earnings in inline with the Street It varies significantly on earnings from average Street consensus but Wall Streets brokers have estimates ranging from share to share in it is basically a crapshoot and that comes down to the lack of margin granularity we highlighted above As weve erred a bit on the safe side when it comes to those Other Operating Expenses and when they begin to moderate this is why this forecasts only share in Critics might say that gross margins here are well above big retailer norms see WalMart Target once again as retailer examples falling in the gross margin range With that said they should be as gross margins are already higher than the traditional competition Amazons exposure to hightechnology fields are responsible for that outperformance and that is unlikely to change However if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is going to carry a fair justifiable value at some point <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services needs to continue to being a larger and larger contributor to operating income mirroring the impact that it has had in the past three years In AWS contributed just of operating income Nearly For a segment that only generated of net sales that is an incredibly large portion of the underlying profitability and a big driver of total company margin growth If youre an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>bull or bear that is where your focus should be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services health not on the big top line numbers the company might put out from selling a couple more pallets of paper towels For those who are curious if B in sales estimate is an accurate assumption for the company to reasonably be valued at x GAAP PE on todays share price operating margins need to come in around in Is that possible if the company is simply the next WalMart No Is it possible for a pseudo technologydisruptive retailer I dont see why not compared to many companies in technology operating margin is an easy hurdle to clear On the flip side of that if margins dont expand the story is broken In my opinion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is growing into its shoes provided it continues to execute on its growth initiatives and improving its margins Is there a significant gamble taking place in going long Certainly We assumed top line growth growing at annually on average for the next five years Thats a massive number for a company with sales already in excess of B We also assumed nearly in steady annual operating margin improvement while the starting point is low that is a fair challenge for even the best management Given the lack of forward guidance present from management each individual investor here has to set their own expectations and be willing to trade around those expectations when they are either not met or exceeded Overall the path to a fairer valuation is there and I can understand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>bulls fervor assuming the company can execute But it is important that investors pay special attention to margins going forward Moderation of the companys expense growth will make or break this story in the long run As mentioned I rarely invest in large caps growth stories or
