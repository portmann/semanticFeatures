Iowa farmer played by actor Kevin Costner is told by voices to build a field for baseball playing ghosts After the baseball diamond is completed the team of Chicago White Sox ghosts including Shoeless Joe Jackson come to play Well in the case of the internet streaming giant Netflix NASDAQ NFLX instead of chasing ghosts the company continues to chase the ghosts of profitability Netflixs share price has already soared this year as the company continues to burn hundreds of millions in cash while aggressively building out its international streaming footprint Unlike Kevin Costner Netflix investors are likely to eventually get spooked by the by the stratospheric valuation and bleeding cash At Sidoxia we may be a dying breed but our primary focus is on finding market leading franchises that are growing cash flows at reasonable valuations In sticking with my nostalgic movie quoting I believe as Cuba Gooding Jr does in the classic movie Jerry Maguire Show me the money Unfortunately for Netflix right now the only money to be shown is the money getting burned In a little over three years Netflix has burned over million in cash added billion in debt and spent approximately billion on streaming content about billion alone in the last months As the hemorrhaging of cash accelerates million in the recent quarter investors with valuation dementia have bid up Netflix shares to a headscratching xs estimated earnings this year and a still mindboggling valuation of xs Wall Street earnings estimates of per share Of course the questionable valuation built on accounting smoke and mirrors looks even more absurd if you base it on free cash flowbecause Netflix has none What makes the Netflix story even scarier is that on top of the rising billion in debt anchored on their balance sheet Netflix also has commitments to purchase an additional billion in streaming content in the coming years For the time being investors are enamored with Netflixs growing revenues and subscribers Ive seen this movie before no pun intended in the late s when investors would buy growth with reckless neglect of valuation For those of you who missed it the ending wasnt pretty Whats causing the financial stress at Netflix Its fairly simple Beyond the spending like drunken sailors on US television and movie content third party and original the company is expanding aggressively internationally The open check book writing began in when Netflix started their international expansion in Canada Since then the company has launched their service in Latin America the United Kingdom Ireland Finland Denmark Sweden Norway Netherlands Germany Austria Switzerland France Belgium Luxembourg Australia and New Zealand With all this international expansion behind Netflix investors should surely be able to breathe a sigh of relief by nowright Wrong David Wells Netflixs CFO had this to say in the companys recent investor conference call Not only have international losses worsened by in the recent quarter You should expect those losses to trend upward and into Excellent so the horrific losses should only deteriorate for another year or soyay While Netflix is burning hundreds of millions in cash the well documented streaming competition is only getting worse This begs the question what is Netflixs real competitive advantage I certainly dont believe it is the companys ability to borrow billions of dollars and write billions in content checks we are seeing plenty of competitors repeating the same activity Here is a partial list of the everexpanding streaming and cordcutting competitive offerings Sadly for Netflix this more challenging competitive environment is creating a content bidding war which is squeezing Netflixs margins But wait say the Netflix bulls I should focus my attention on the companys expanding domestic streaming margins This is true if you carelessly ignore the accounting gimmicks that Netflix CFO David Wells freely acknowledges On the recent investor call here is Wellss description of the companys expense diversion trickery by geography So by growing faster internationally and putting that content expense allocation more towards international its going to provide some relief to those global originals and the global projects that we do have that are allocated to the US In other words Wells admits shoving a lot of domestic content costs into the international segment to make domestic profit margins look better higher Longer term perhaps this allocation could make some sense but for now Im not convinced viewers in Luxembourg are watching Orange is the New Black and House of Cards like they are in the US If check writing and accounting diversions arent a competitive advantage does Netflix have a technology advantage Thats tough to believe when Netflix effectively outsources all their distribution technology to Amazoncom AMZN We run the vast majority of our computing on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services AWS Given this along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted While the retail side of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>competes with us we do not believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service Call me nave but something tells me <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could be stealing some secret pointers and best practices from Netflixs operations and applying them to their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Instant Video offering Nah probably not Like Netflix said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>wouldnt steal anything to gain a competitive advantage never Regardless the real question surrounding Netflix should focus on whether a billion valuation should be awarded to a money losing content portal that distributes content through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>For comparison purposes Netflix is currently valued at more than Viacom Inc NASDAQ VIA the owner of valuable franchises and brands like Paramount Pictures Nickelodeon MTV Comedy Central BET VH Spike and more Viacom which was spun off from CBS years ago actually generated about billion in cash last year and paid out about a half billion dollars in dividends Quite a stark contrast compared to a company accelerating its cash losses I openly admit Netflix is a wonderful service and I have been a loyal longtime subscriber myself But a good service does not necessarily equate to a good stock And despite being short the stock Sidoxia is actually long the companys bonds Its certainly possible and likely Netflixs stock will underperform from todays nosebleed valuation but under almost any scenario I can imagine I have a difficult time foreseeing an outcome in which Netflix would go bankrupt by Bond investors currently agree which explains why my Netflix bonds are trading at a premium to par Netflix stockholders and crazy disciples like Mark Cuban on the other hand may have more to worry about in the coming quarters CEO Reed Hastings is sticking to his burn it and they will come strategy at all costs but if profits and cash dont begin to pile up quickly then Netflixs Field of Dreams will turn into a Field of Nightmares DISCLOSURE Sidoxia Capital Management NYSE SCM and some of its clients hold positions
