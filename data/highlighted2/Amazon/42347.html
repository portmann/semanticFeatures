(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha �|� Apr. 27, 2015  2:18 PM ET �|� About: Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) by: Wade Slome, CFA In the successful, but fictional movie, Fields of Dreams, an Iowa farmer played by actor Kevin Costner is told by voices to build a field for baseball playing ghosts.After the baseball diamond is completed, the team of Chicago White Sox ghosts, including Shoeless Joe Jackson, come to play.Well, in the case of the internet streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), instead of chasing ghosts, the company continues to chase the ghosts of profitability.Netflix�s share price has already soared +63% this year as the company continues to burn hundreds of millions in cash, while aggressively building out its international streaming footprint.Unlike Kevin Costner, Netflix investors are likely to eventually get spooked by the by the stratospheric valuation and bleeding cash.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At Sidoxia , we <b>may</b> be a dying breed , but our primary focus is on finding market leading franchises that are growing cash flows at reasonable valuations .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In sticking with my nostalgic movie quoting , I <b>believe</b> as Cuba Gooding Jr. does in the classic movie , Jerry Maguire , Show me the money !  (Uncertainty) </span>Unfortunately for Netflix, right now the only money to be shown is the money getting burned.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In a little over three years , Netflix has burned over - $ 350 million in cash , added $ 2 billion in debt , and spent <b>approximately</b> - $ 11 billion on streaming content ( about - $ 4.6 billion alone in the last 12 months ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>As the hemorrhaging of cash accelerates (-$163 million in the recent quarter), investors with valuation dementia have bid up Netflix shares to a head-scratching 350x�s estimated earnings this year and a still mind-boggling valuation of 158x�s 2016 Wall Street earnings estimates of $3.53 per share.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Of course the questionable valuation built on accounting smoke and mirrors looks even <i>more</i> absurd , if you base it on free cash flow because Netflix has none .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>What makes the Netflix story even <i>scarier</i> is that on top of the rising $ 2.4 billion in debt anchored on their balance sheet , Netflix also has commitments to purchase an additional $ 9.8 billion in streaming content in the coming years .  (Surprise) </span>For the time being, investors are enamored with Netflix�s growing revenues and subscribers.I�ve seen this movie before (no pun intended), in the late 1990s when investors would buy growth with reckless neglect of valuation.For those of you who missed it, the ending wasn�t pretty.What�s causing the financial stress at Netflix?It�s fairly simple.Beyond the spending like drunken sailors on U.S. television and movie content (third party and original), the company is expanding aggressively internationally.The open check book writing began in 2010 when Netflix started their international expansion in Canada.Since then, the company has launched their service in Latin America, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Finland, Denmark, Sweden Norway, Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Australia, and New Zealand.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With all this international expansion behind Netflix , investors should surely be able to breathe a sigh of <b>relief</b> by now right ?  (Surprise) </span>Wrong.David Wells, Netflix�s CFO had this to say in the company�s recent investor conference call.Not only have international losses worsened by 86% in the recent quarter, �You should expect those losses to trend upward and into 2016.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Excellent , so the <b>horrific</b> losses should only deteriorate for another year or so yay .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While Netflix is burning hundreds of millions in cash , the well documented streaming competition is only getting <i>worse</i> .  (Surprise) </span>This begs the question, what is Netflix�s real competitive advantage?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I certainly don t <b>believe</b> it is the company s ability to borrow billions of dollars and write billions in content checks we are seeing plenty of competitors repeating the same activity .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Here is a partial list of the ever-expanding streaming and cord-cutting competitive offerings : Sadly for Netflix , this <i>more</i> challenging competitive environment is creating a content bidding war , which is squeezing Netflix s margins .  (Surprise) </span>But wait, say the Netflix bulls.I should focus my attention on the company�s expanding domestic streaming margins.This is true, if you carelessly ignore the accounting gimmicks that Netflix CFO David Wells freely acknowledges.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On the recent investor call , here is Wells s description of the company s expense diversion trickery by geography : So by growing <i>faster</i> internationally , and putting that -LSB- content expense -RSB- allocation <i>more</i> towards international , it s going to provide some <b>relief</b> to those global originals , and the global projects that we do have , that are allocated to the U.S. .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In other words , Wells admits shoving a lot of domestic content costs into the international segment to make domestic profit margins look <i>better</i> ( <i>higher</i> ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>Longer</i> term , perhaps this allocation <b>could</b> make some sense , but for now I m not convinced viewers in Luxembourg are watching Orange is the New Black and House of Cards like they are in the U.S. .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>If check writing and accounting diversions aren�t a competitive advantage, does Netflix have a technology advantage?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That s tough to <b>believe</b> when Netflix effectively outsources all their distribution technology to Amazon.com ( AMZN ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>We run the vast majority of our computing on -LSB- <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services -RSB- AWS . Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider, any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While the retail side of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> competes with us , we do not <b>believe</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Call me na ve , but something tells me <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> be stealing some secret pointers and best practices from Netflix s operations and applying them to their <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Instant Video offering . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Nah , <b>probably</b> not .  (Uncertainty) </span>Like Netflix said , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> wouldn t steal anything to gain a competitive advantage never . Regardless , the real question surrounding Netflix should focus on whether a $ 35 billion valuation should be awarded to a money losing content portal that distributes content through <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ? <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For comparison purposes , Netflix is currently valued at 20 % <i>more</i> than Viacom Inc ( NASDAQ : VIA ) , the owner of valuable franchises and brands like Paramount Pictures , Nickelodeon , MTV , Comedy Central , BET , VH1 , Spike , and <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Viacom, which was spun off from CBS 44 years ago, actually generated about $2.5 billion in cash last year and paid out about a half billion dollars in dividends.Quite a stark contrast compared to a company accelerating its cash losses.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I openly admit Netflix is a <b>wonderful</b> service , and I have been a loyal , longtime subscriber myself .  (Surprise) </span>But a good service does not necessarily equate to a good stock.And despite being short the stock, Sidoxia is actually long the company�s bonds.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It s certainly possible ( and likely ) Netflix s stock will underperform from today s nosebleed valuation , but under <b>almost</b> any scenario I can imagine , I have a difficult time foreseeing an outcome in which Netflix would go bankrupt by 2021 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Bond investors currently agree, which explains why my Netflix bonds are trading at a 5% premium to par.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Netflix stockholders , and crazy disciples like Mark Cuban , on the other hand , may have <i>more</i> to <b>worry</b> about in the coming quarters .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>CEO Reed Hastings is sticking to his burn it and they will come strategy at all costs , but if profits and cash don t begin to pile up quickly , then Netflix s Field of Dreams will turn into a Field of Nightmares .  (Uncertainty) </span>DISCLOSURE: Sidoxia Capital Management (NYSE: SCM ) and some of its clients hold positions in certain exchange traded funds (ETFs), AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, long Netflix bond position, long Dish Corp bond, and a short position in NFLX, but at the time of publishing, SCM had no direct position in VIA, TWX, SNE, or any other security referenced in this article.No information accessed through the Investing Caffeine (IC) website constitutes investment, financial, legal, tax or other advice nor is to be relied on in making an investment or other decision.Please read disclosure language on IC Contact page.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Source : Netflix : Burn It And They Will Come We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
