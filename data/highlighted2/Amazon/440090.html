(Amazon: Surprise) </span>In fact, only recently has it invested heavily in its online presence.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Better</i> late than never , though .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> that management is taking appropriate and vital action with its strategic investments to improve its relevance today .  (Uncertainty) </span>We hear about it a lot, but we really do think the omnichannel is going to be hugely important for Bed Bath & Beyond.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will <b>almost</b> always win on price , but Bed Bath & Beyond can fight back through the omnichannel if it is successfully implemented . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company <b>may</b> be late to the party , but several retailers such as Best Buy ( NYSE : BBY ) , Target ( NYSE : TGT ) , and Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) have already been there and delivered on it .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In fact , Wal-Mart 's CEO Doug McMillon <b>believes</b> that traditional retailers actually have the advantage over <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> as it is far <i>easier</i> to add digital capabilities to existing retail stores , than it is for an online retailer like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to add brick and mortar capabilities . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Well Bed Bath & Beyond are there now and we expect to see an improvement in its performance as a result.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>doubt</b> it will be an instant turnaround , but rather take a few quarters .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We are <b>optimistic</b> that earnings will get back on the right trajectory next year and the share price will start to make a substantial move <i>higher</i> again .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Management has been offering reduced shipping in recent months.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Ordinarily</b> to qualify for free shipping customers would have to purchase goods to the value of $ 49 .  (Uncertainty) </span>But this was reduced to $25.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>could</b> potentially negatively impact gross margins , but it <b>could</b> also boost online traffic and sales .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Whilst the company can not really afford to weaken its margins , see below , we are <b>hopeful</b> that the average ticket still remains high despite the promotion , thanks to a strong product assortment and exclusives such as a bedding line from Ellen DeGeneres .  (Uncertainty) </span>Finally, we are pleased with the acquisition of One Kings Lane .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although the true cost of the acquisition is <b>unknown</b> with management saying it was n't `` material '' , it has been estimated to be in the region of $ 150 million - far below its previous valuation of $ 850 million .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although flash sale sites have not fared well in recent times , we do feel that if Bed Bath & Beyond can integrate it successfully into their own e-commerce offering , then the company <b>could</b> achieve a strong return on investment .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For now we are not factoring One Kings Lane into our forecasts , but will revisit things once we learn <i>more</i> about management 's intentions in its next earnings call .  (Surprise) </span>We expect things will pick up over the next two to three quarters.By which point we feel that the market will be willing to pay in the region of 10 times earnings for the shares.We have reduced our full year earnings forecast accordingly and now expect full year earnings to come in a touch above guidance at $5.02 per share.This gives us a price target of $50.20 which is equal to a return of 13.9% from the current price.In our opinion Bed Bath & Beyond is a company that has come under a lot of pressure in recent times, but certainly has the potential to turnaround its fortunes with the omnichannel.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>may</b> take some time , but if investors can be patient we expect they will be rewarded .
