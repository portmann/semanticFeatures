CHICAGOSAN FRANCISCO Macys Inc MN is expanding sameday delivery to several new US markets this summer one of the most aggressive pushes by a brickandmortar retailer in an area dominated by ecommerce giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>AMZNO according to a Macys official Macys the nations largest department store chain already offers sameday delivery services in eight markets By partnering with Deliv an Uberlike startup that uses a fleet of contract drivers to pick up online orders from stores and malls the retailer has found a costeffective way to expand said the Macys official who spoke on condition of anonymity The official said that the initial plan is to offer the service in several more markets but there nay be additions later this year and that could take it ahead of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>which currently offers sameday delivery in markets Currently Macys is offering the service in Houston San Francisco San Jose Seattle Washington DC Chicago Los Angeles and New Jersey It couldnt be immediately ascertained which ones were being added The department store companys efforts come as the last mile the final portion of a packages journey that takes it from a retailers warehouse or store to the customers front door becomes the next battleground for retailers trying to increase online salesMacys has one possible advantage over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in that it has stores as of May in the US from which to source products for delivery meaning the packages often have less distance to travel against fulfilment centers and smaller distribution facilities run by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>But fast shipping is costly and most retailers who offer it currently lose money on the service warn logistics experts For example analysts estimate that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>loses billion to billion a year on its US Prime service which promises delivery within anything from one hour to two days Amazons net shipping cost rose to billion in up from billion a year earlier Macys spokesman Jim Sluzewski confirmed the retailers plans to expand the service this year but declined to give further details Faster delivery also becomes a differentiating factor when new online retail sites like Jetcom which launched on Tuesday promise to offer cheaper prices than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>The startup which will charge a year for membership claims its consumers can get the lowest price on anything they buy online with the tradeoff of being relatively slow delivery service Even as Macys rushes to extend fast delivery many other traditional retailers are far more cautious The costs of sameday delivery and ambivalence from many customers remain concerns analysts say Nordstrom Inc JWNN has offered sameday delivery for since but the service is still only available in three markets Seattle and Bellevue in Washington state and La Jolla in California A January survey of online shoppers by UPS and Comscore found that percent of people surveyed were willing to wait five days or more for their delivery The thing thats so perplexing about this last mile and same day is that the consumers overwhelmingly prefer free shipping over speed said Satish Jindel a logistics consultant and president of SJ Consulting Group That could change said David Bell a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvanias Wharton School and if consumers became accustomed to sameday service the result would be an expensive race to the bottom for retailers who would not be able to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>on the delivery cost Macys does not disclose how many items it has available for sameday delivery and Deliv will not say how many items it carries for Macys <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has more than a million products available for sameday delivery Macys charges its customers for sameday delivery but it is unclear how much of its costs that covers Deliv says its rates for retailers are in line with the average ground delivery cost of carriers such as UPS and FedEx but it was unclear whether thats what it charges Macys or whether it takes a loss to offer the service to Macys Its very hard to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but traditional retailers have an advantage in that they already have all of their inventory in place five miles from percent of their purchasing population at their stores said Deliv CEO Daphne Carmeli This is one of those opportunities to outAmazon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>she said Although Macys does not break out details of its online sales or shipping costs analysts assume the company is losing money on the service once additional costs are taken into account including finding the product getting the package ready for delivery and restocking expenses Only the biggest of retailers that are capable will be able to afford these operations said Jarrett Streebin the CEO of EasyPost a shipping startup He estimated costs per package could reach or more with additional logistics processes and staffing to handle the orders Whos willing to pay the bill he asked Thomson Reuters is the worlds largest
