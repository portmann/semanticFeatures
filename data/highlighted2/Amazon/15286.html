The opportunity to simply capitalize on every available opportunity based on the large installed base of users is becoming an argument that's both redundant and misleading, as Facebook's value to advertisers comes primarily from the volume of prospective customers they're able to generate via native ad units along the timeline.Various ad-agencies will compete aggressively for ad inventory, and will attempt to maximize the value for both lower cost- and higher cost- ad units.This implies that the cost of advertising will likely trend higher, which will make it even more difficult for direct-commerce transactions to flourish alongside ads that are intended for brand awareness, or conversions for services that cannot be transacted via a payment portal on Facebook's website.Also, the lack of scale is another concern that Facebook has yet to address.At the present moment, Facebook doesn't have hundreds of millions in debit and credit card account information; basically the total opposite of where Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Google are in terms of account information for their respective app ecosystems.It's simply easier to make transactions via the app store.I have the perceived notion of security when using a biometric reader to unlock the buy button.Also, various fraud prevention departments at my bank closely monitor every transaction that I make, especially on mobile.This sense of security isn't going to be felt on a social network, at least, not for quite a while.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There <b>may</b> be a method to monetize the messenger without damaging the user experience .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I anticipate that interaction with third-party developers <b>could</b> lead to creative developments that lead to a much better revenue model than charging fees for payment transfer services .  (Uncertainty) </span>Now Facebook is doing the same on mobile with the Messenger platform.It's extending what counts as family by inviting over 40 developers to build companion apps for creating and discovering content to be shared through Messenger.This time around, developers get help with discovery and virality, and again, Facebook gets to soak up all the engagement they lure in.Messenger usage translates to platform lock-in, driving views of Facebook's News Feed where it shows ads.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Also , I <b>anticipate</b> the ARPU figure to continue to trend higher , due to the addition of new services , and the broadening of ad inventory to other uses like video-based ads .  (Uncertainty) </span>Video ads have way higher CPMs, and the addition of ad-inventory from related applications will increase the amount of revenue that's generated on overlapping users across Facebook's network of applications.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , there are promising developments in tech like virtual reality , and augmented reality that <b>could</b> extend the growth phase for a couple additional decades .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sure , I <b>might</b> be arguing about `` future '' technology , but would n't you imagine the most important aspect of being a tech investor is the ability to capitalize on future tech before it 's ever monetized ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Well, in that case, Facebook still has a couple other areas in which growth can be exploited.Also, the company has a pretty consistent track record of growing sales and earnings, while having the right mentality towards innovation, and accretive acquisitions.Therefore, I continue to reiterate my high conviction buy rating.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , my expectations on payment-based revenue is low , as I do n't <b>anticipate</b> Facebook to earn any revenue from mobile-based payments for the foreseeable decade .  (Uncertainty) </span>But to be more blunt, it's entirely plausible that Facebook never generates any revenue from payment transfers between users on the "social network."Source: Facebook Sells Ads: It's Not Disruptive In Payments Or E-Commerce Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
