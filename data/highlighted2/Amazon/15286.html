(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>What 's <i>more</i> likely to drive growth in the messenger business is the involvement of third-party developers , as they will create new revenue models .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When looking at Facebook 's ( NASDAQ : FB ) recent efforts with the messenger platform , one could easily <b>assume</b> that Facebook will quickly capitalize on the payment transfer business by merely luring in users to use the service , and then charge for the service , thus earning a sizable chunk of the profit in the global payment services industry .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Sometimes</b> , it 's <i>better</i> to leave free things free , especially when everyone else is offering to do the same exact service for zero dollars .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I use PayPal (NASDAQ: EBAY ) to transfer money to friends� already.The only differentiator is that Facebook is able to transfer directly from one bank to the next.Banks already offer this service via an ACH transfer, and again, the theme repeats itself� ACH transfers are completely free.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The alternative is to wire money over to a friend in case of emergencies , but I often find that a PayPal transfer is even <i>quicker</i> , as I have transferred funds to another PayPal account in <b>roughly</b> two to three minutes .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That 's much <i>quicker</i> than a Wire transfer and ACH deposit , so I have a hard time imagining how the messenger business will grow gangbusters .  (Surprise) </span>Also, Facebook is targeting P2P transactions, i.e. peer to peer.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The downside to this model is that the transaction volume is n't likely to be all that meaningful , as debit cards have a <b>variety</b> of uses , of which very little is directed towards peer-to-peer transactions .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So the market opportunity is actually constricted to <i>more</i> of a narrow niche .  (Surprise) </span>When looking at the above diagram, mobile payments are not used in the vast majority of cases for any type of transaction.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Therefore , a Facebook enabled e-commerce platform is so improbable of succeeding ( in terms of revenue ) , I do n't see why people <b>speculate</b> on the monetization potential , when in reality , most people make large scale transactions directly with the vendor via a debit or credit card , and <i>smaller</i> transactions via cash .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>So if I were to lend my friend money, chances are I'd give them cash, not a PayPal transfer, even though I've went the PayPal route before.Also, Facebook doesn't have a way of skimming added value off the top of each transaction without blasting users with fees, so it's a free service competing with a network of other free services.When there's no flexibility to move pricing along a curve, to compete on the basis of price, it's hard to be competitive.Just look at Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) search, who's going to succeed at the search business by charging consumers to use their search engine?The answer is zero.Bing (NASDAQ: MSFT ) doesn't charge and neither does Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ), and yet they're still in second and third place.At this point, success should be measured by monthly active usage of the service rather than the amount of revenue that it generates.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For Facebook , creating a platform that 's perceived to be `` safe '' is a much <i>bigger</i> priority , than it is to earn revenue from payment services .  (Surprise) </span>Currently, users are skeptical of mobile wallet and phone application based transactions.When looking at the data, most rely upon cash, credit card, and debit cards to make a transaction.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The <i>more</i> direct the transaction , with limited <b>likelihood</b> of fraud or loss of data , the <i>better</i> ( at least according to the survey data presented by Walker Sands ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Also, consumers really like to transact via retail channels they have already had a positive experience with.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So , companies like eBay , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) , Target ( NYSE : TGT ) are uniquely positioned , as they 're able to provide users with secure transactions , and <i>lower</i> pricing . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>According to the Walker Sands report , four out of ten consumers were willing to buy via established e-commerce platforms , of which Facebook is n't included because they 're not a real B2C e-commerce platform , but <i>more</i> an intermediary that 's attempting to compete with eBay and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's 3rd party seller program . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The opportunity to simply capitalize on every available opportunity based on the large installed base of users is becoming an argument that's both redundant and misleading, as Facebook's value to advertisers comes primarily from the volume of prospective customers they're able to generate via native ad units along the timeline.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Various ad-agencies will compete aggressively for ad inventory , and will attempt to maximize the value for both <i>lower</i> cost - and <i>higher</i> cost - ad units .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This implies that the cost of advertising will likely trend <i>higher</i> , which will make it even <i>more</i> difficult for direct-commerce transactions to flourish alongside ads that are intended for brand awareness , or conversions for services that can not be transacted via a payment portal on Facebook 's website .  (Surprise) </span>Also, the lack of scale is another concern that Facebook has yet to address.At the present moment, Facebook doesn't have hundreds of millions in debit and credit card account information; basically the total opposite of where Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Google are in terms of account information for their respective app ecosystems.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's simply <i>easier</i> to make transactions via the app store .  (Surprise) </span>I have the perceived notion of security when using a biometric reader to unlock the buy button.Also, various fraud prevention departments at my bank closely monitor every transaction that I make, especially on mobile.This sense of security isn't going to be felt on a social network, at least, not for quite a while.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There <b>may</b> be a method to monetize the messenger without damaging the user experience .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I anticipate that interaction with third-party developers <b>could</b> lead to creative developments that lead to a much <i>better</i> revenue model than charging fees for payment transfer services .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Now Facebook is doing the same on mobile with the Messenger platform.It's extending what counts as family by inviting over 40 developers to build companion apps for creating and discovering content to be shared through Messenger.This time around, developers get help with discovery and virality, and again, Facebook gets to soak up all the engagement they lure in.Messenger usage translates to platform lock-in, driving views of Facebook's News Feed where it shows ads.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Also , I <b>anticipate</b> the ARPU figure to continue to trend <i>higher</i> , due to the addition of new services , and the broadening of ad inventory to other uses like video-based ads .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Video ads have way <i>higher</i> CPMs , and the addition of ad-inventory from related applications will increase the amount of revenue that 's generated on overlapping users across Facebook 's network of applications .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , there are promising developments in tech like virtual reality , and augmented reality that <b>could</b> extend the growth phase for a couple additional decades .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sure , I <b>might</b> be arguing about `` future '' technology , but would n't you imagine the most important aspect of being a tech investor is the ability to capitalize on future tech before it 's ever monetized ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Well, in that case, Facebook still has a couple other areas in which growth can be exploited.Also, the company has a pretty consistent track record of growing sales and earnings, while having the right mentality towards innovation, and accretive acquisitions.Therefore, I continue to reiterate my high conviction buy rating.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , my expectations on payment-based revenue is low , as I do n't <b>anticipate</b> Facebook to earn any revenue from mobile-based payments for the foreseeable decade .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But to be <i>more</i> blunt , it 's entirely plausible that Facebook never generates any revenue from payment transfers between users on the `` social network .
