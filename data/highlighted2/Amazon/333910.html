style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>India are seen behind a glass bearing the companys logo inside its office in Bengaluru India August LONDON <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has launched its biggest foray into food outside of the United States with a deal with British supermarket Morrisons to offer fresh and frozen goods to customers in some places as quickly as under one hour Enabling the online retail giant to compete with Britains biggest supermarket stores and smallest local shops the deal opens another front on Amazons assault on the billion pounds billion British grocery market already hammered by a brutal price war and changing shopping habits <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will now add hundreds of fresh and frozen products to its existing offering of packaged grocery goods setting it up to take on Tesco Sainsburys and WalMarts Asda as well as online specialist Ocado in one of the worlds most developed online retail markets The advance of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as a participant in UK grocery is a potential challenge to the whole trade in time Shore Capital retail analyst Clive Black said on Monday Any new entrant is but particularly the American behemoth The tieup boosted shares of Morrisons Britains fourth largest supermarket which has been a laggard in online sales Since it has outsourced logistics for its own online food business to Ocado Morrisons shares rose percent Those of Ocado fell percent on fears the deal would increase competition and reduce the likelihood that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could one day buy it Market leader Tescos shares fell by percent Tesco could soon be about to find out what its like to be David rather than Goliath said Retail Vision consultant John Ibbotson <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a market cap of billion The UK grocery market has been convulsed in recent years by thrifty shoppers turning to discounters Aldi and Lidl convenience stores and online shops The British Retail Consortium predicts that retail jobs could go by as the industry moves online <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the worlds largest online retailer launched a fresh food offering in Seattle in and has moved to a handful of other US cities since then but it has struggled to find the best pricing model with fresh food proving one of the toughest nuts to crack After waiving the membership fee for several years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>finally said last year it would begin charging customers a year for its Prime Fresh membership in the US Its expansion into food in the rest of the world has focused so far just on packaged goods due to the complexity of delivering fresh and frozen products However it is keen to extend its offering just as supermarkets are increasingly competing on its home turf by selling more nonfood products online The Morrisons tieup stops short of replicating its broader US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fresh service which offers about chilled frozen and perishable products and items from local shops that analysts have long speculated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was targeting for the UK But it gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>a platform to attack a UK online grocery market predicted to nearly double to billion pounds in the five years to according to industry research group IGD It has offered some food and drink items to British customers since and in November it extended a packaged groceries offer already available in Germany and Japan to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime subscription members in Britain Last year it added a small range of chilled and frozen items to its Prime Now service which offers onehour delivery in Britains two biggest cities <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has also begun surveying UK customers about their use of restaurant delivery services in what analysts said was likely the first step in an international expansion of a business it rolled out in the US last September Morrisons with a smaller footprint in the more affluent areas of London and the south east of England than Tesco and Sainsburys may have gambled that it could cope better with the arrival of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>which would typically target those areas Morrisons makes half of all the own brand and fresh food it sells a greater share than other British supermarkets and has spare capacity to service Amazons needs Morrisons announced separate plans on Monday to extend its own online grocery deliveries to the whole of the UK in agreement with Ocado It would take space in a new Ocado London warehouse while Ocado will provide Morrisons with software to fulfill online orders from its own stores For Morrisons a tieup with outside giants like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>might be described as letting the barbarians in said analysts at brokerage Bernstein Nevertheless the deal could be a convenient divideand conquer outcome where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Morrisons specialize where they are best and support each other mutually Bernstein said Morrisons may feel that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>isnt really a threat for its smaller stores in the North of England on the contrary on our recent
