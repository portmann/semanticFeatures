(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Wireless upgrades and software storage discourage upgrades of tablets and PCs.The heart of all upgrades is the operating system, a market Apple now dominates.Mac selling prices remain stable while those of PCs plunge.Advantage Apple.It's called the upgrade cycle.Consumers hate it.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Vendors <b>depend</b> on it .  (Uncertainty) </span>You've been playing it ever since you bought your first computer.A new operating system enables new capabilities that require new hardware."You say you've had your desktop for over a week?Throw that junk away, man, it's an antique.Your laptop is a month old?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Well that 's great if you <b>could</b> use a nice , heavy paperweight . ''  (Uncertainty) </span>The promise of devices wirelessly tied to cloud is that this cycle stops, or at least slows down a lot.Upgrades become automatic.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you have a Chromebook , powered by Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) Android , you <b>depend</b> on that broadband connection for getting your work done , and device upgrades , in theory , become unnecessary .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You <b>might</b> call this the new Golden Age of Radio , because WiFi and cellular networks both consist of radio waves , pushing data at high speeds that can be turned into sound , pictures , or programs .  (Uncertainty) </span>It's WiFi that is killing the upgrade cycle, and thus pushing down the sales of many computing devices.For decades the upgrade cycle was driven primarily by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), and its failure to offer anything new or compelling since Windows 7 continues to kill the PC space.Will Windows 10 change that?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Maybe , but it also increases the <b>dependence</b> of users on that broadband connection , on that cloud-driven software that 's updated once and updated for everyone .  (Uncertainty) </span>Why, then, replace something that works?The big, untold story in desktop computing is that the upgrade for Windows 7 is simply to buy a Mac.Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) share of the PC market is not just up 56% over the last five years, but it has managed to keep its average selling price at $1,300 while the price of a Windows machine has steadily plummeted to $379.This upgrade cycle, of course, is the reason why phone sales remain robust.If you have an iPhone 3 you have an old phone.Many people with an iPhone 5 think they have an old phone.By contrast, the PC I bought in 2011 works fine.It's the lack of an upgrade cycle that remains the one troubling aspect of Apple results.Tablet sales, even those of the iPad, continue to slump because there is no compelling reason to upgrade.Most have been bought as media devices , and once you have one there 's little reason to buy another , as Amazon.Com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) has found out with its Fire tablet , which started well but now languishes . I have one, it works, what do I need with another?All of which leads to a second tablet threat , TV `` sticks '' like the Google Chromecast , Apple TV and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Fire Stick which turn your TV into the functional equivalent of a tablet . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's <i>less</i> a question of which one will you buy , but that once you buy one why buy another ?  (Surprise) </span>So if you have a stick in your TV, and your TV is very large (as all TVs now are), your tablet becomes merely a mobile TV.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is why the latest raft of Apple iPad commercials emphasize its use in media creation , in its role as a <b>possible</b> PC replacement .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple highlights a number of such apps in its latest campaign.Post-It Plus from 3M (NYSE: MMM ).Tayusui Sketches for creating drawings on-the-fly.The iStopMotion app from Boinx.AutoCad 360 from Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Media creation requires software , software <b>may</b> be upgraded with new features , and new features that eventually require a new tablet .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That 's the <b>hope</b> , anyway .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>By tying its PC software to its Tablet software , Apple <b>hopes</b> to create a virtuous cycle benefiting both .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Building a new upgrade cycle , of course , is not just Apple 's <b>hope</b> , but the <b>hope</b> of every tablet and phone maker out there .  (Uncertainty) </span>The key to that will be new software applications that force users to upgrade their devices, like those being highlighted for the iPad 2.Until you find some it's hard to recommend any stocks beyond Apple in the device market, despite its tablet problem.And it's addressing that tablet problem.Source: The Golden Age Of Radio Bedevils PCs And Tablets Alike Disclosure: The author is long AAPL, GOOG, GOOGL.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) The author wrote this article themselves , and it expresses their own opinions .
