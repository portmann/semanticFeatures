upgrades is the operating system a market Apple now dominates Mac selling prices remain stable while those of PCs plunge Advantage Apple Its called the upgrade cycle Consumers hate it Vendors depend on it Youve been playing it ever since you bought your first computer A new operating system enables new capabilities that require new hardware You say youve had your desktop for over a week Throw that junk away man its an antique Your laptop is a month old Well thats great if you could use a nice heavy paperweight The promise of devices wirelessly tied to cloud is that this cycle stops or at least slows down a lot Upgrades become automatic If you have a Chromebook powered by Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Android you depend on that broadband connection for getting your work done and device upgrades in theory become unnecessary You might call this the new Golden Age of Radio because WiFi and cellular networks both consist of radio waves pushing data at high speeds that can be turned into sound pictures or programs Its WiFi that is killing the upgrade cycle and thus pushing down the sales of many computing devices For decades the upgrade cycle was driven primarily by Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and its failure to offer anything new or compelling since Windows continues to kill the PC space Will Windows change that Maybe but it also increases the dependence of users on that broadband connection on that clouddriven software thats updated once and updated for everyone Why then replace something that works The big untold story in desktop computing is that the upgrade for Windows is simply to buy a Mac Apples NASDAQ AAPL share of the PC market is not just up over the last five years but it has managed to keep its average selling price at while the price of a Windows machine has steadily plummeted to This upgrade cycle of course is the reason why phone sales remain robust If you have an iPhone you have an old phone Many people with an iPhone think they have an old phone By contrast the PC I bought in works fine Its the lack of an upgrade cycle that remains the one troubling aspect of Apple results Tablet sales even those of the iPad continue to slump because there is no compelling reason to upgrade Most have been bought as media devices and once you have one theres little reason to buy another as AmazonCom NASDAQ AMZN has found out with its Fire tablet which started well but now languishes I have one it works what do I need with another All of which leads to a second tablet threat TV sticks like the Google Chromecast Apple TV and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fire Stick which turn your TV into the functional equivalent of a tablet Its less a question of which one will you buy but that once you buy one why buy another So if you have a stick in your TV and your TV is very large as all TVs now are your tablet becomes merely a mobile TV This is why the latest raft of Apple iPad commercials emphasize its use in media creation in its role as a possible PC replacement Apple highlights a number of such apps in its latest campaign PostIt Plus from M NYSE MMM Tayusui Sketches for creating drawings onthefly The iStopMotion app from Boinx AutoCad from Autodesk NASDAQ ADSK Media creation requires software software may be upgraded with new features and new features that eventually require a new tablet Thats the hope anyway By tying its PC software to its Tablet software Apple hopes to create a virtuous cycle benefiting both Building a new upgrade cycle of course is not just Apples hope but the hope of every tablet and phone maker out there The key to that will be new software applications that force users to upgrade their devices like those being highlighted for the iPad Until you find some its hard to recommend any stocks beyond Apple in the device market despite its tablet problem And its addressing that tablet problem Source The Golden Age Of Radio Bedevils PCs And Tablets Alike Disclosure The
