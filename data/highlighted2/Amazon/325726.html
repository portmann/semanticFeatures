and will do so again WalMart NYSE WMT saw its share price fall in October to just under with the announcement that the company is planning to invest in its employees and its ecommerce operations to facilitate longterm growth a costly exercise that comes at the expense of shortterm revenue Shortterm investors reacted accordingly hence the fall in share price Other factors such as the US dollars strength impacting overseas sales also contributed but the key issue was the priority given to longterm growth over shortterm revenue Since then the share price has climbed back up to WalMart is now trading around fair value but the investment strategy is still ongoing ecommerce is still unprofitable and is expected to remain that way until But ecommerce is an area WalMart is serious about improving to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN They have seen investors pouring money into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>on the basis that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a faster growing business than WalMart with the result that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is now valued at a market capitalization of billion as opposed to WalMarts billion market capitalization From an investor perspective WalMart remains a better bet than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>trades at a pricetoearnings ratio of pays no dividend and for most of its existence has only been barely profitable Furthermore such profits as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does make are offset by capital expenditure on warehouses data centers and new market segments By contrast WalMart trades at a pricetoearnings ratio of is a dividend aristocrat that has paid rising dividends to shareholders since currently on a yield and is very profitable having generated billion in sales and revenues in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is growing faster than WalMart with an estimated earningspershare of as opposed to WalMarts but that is to be expected <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is still a rapidly growing company whereas WalMart is a longestablished bluechip company Amazons growth rate cannot continue indefinitely however and investors will be hit hard when the inevitable pricetoearnings compression takes effect However WalMart is not being complacent about Amazons ascendancy They are aware though are loath to admit that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has eaten into their consumer sales and that online shopping is the future trend Their WalMart Labs division has done much to enhance the retailers online operations with apps such as Shopycat and are continuing to develop other methods of enhancing WalMarts ecommerce Investment in ecommerce is one part of WalMarts effort to improve its operations going forward Investment in their staff is the other key aspect For years WalMart has been criticized as paying its staff poorly Founder Sam Walton was quoted as saying I pay low wages I can take advantage of that Were going to be successful but the basis is a very lowwage lowbenefit model of employment The increase in employee wages to per hour and provision of better training is an effort to break with the negative public image that the above quote typifies boost staff morale and reduce staff turnover Workers will receive better paid timeoff and more advanced notice of their shifts The cost of this investment will amount to billion this year In consequence earnings per share will be reduced and quarterly reports will reflect this Shortterm investors reacted badly to the initial consequences of WalMarts longterm strategy in October and there is every likelihood that they will do so again and again so long as it takes WalMarts strategy to pay off Longterm investors who missed the opportunity to initiate a position with the company during the selloff will be able to do so in the near future After all the stock price may fluctuate but that only reflects the mood of the market not the longterm health of the company And whatever happens with WalMart the stock WalMart the company remains the largest retailer in the world It generates more in sales than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>billion Costco NASDAQ COST billion and Target NYSE TGT billion combined It can still pressure suppliers to lower costs on goods and make up the difference on bulk sales which benefits customers and ensures repeat custom reinforcing that pressure The likely recession that many anticipate also makes WalMart an ideal investment candidate its reputation as a lowcost retailer means that customers are more likely to shop there when times are difficult than would otherwise be the case A recession then will not adversely affect WalMart in the same manner it would affect more upmarket retailers Wariness of the stock due to shortterm issues is therefore entirely unwarranted Once the transition period is completed greater growth and revenue will stream into the company as a consequence benefiting those shareholders who held on for the longhaul There is nothing wrong with investing in WalMart right now but for those investors who want an even greater margin of safety be patient The opportunity will arise soon enough DISCLAIMER I am not a financial professional and accept no responsibility for any investment a reader makes This article
