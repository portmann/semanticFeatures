(NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha Wal-Mart is in a lengthy period of transition.The short-term effects of this transition lowered the stock before, and will do so again.Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) saw its share price fall in October 2015 to just under $60 with the announcement that the company is planning to invest in its employees and its e-commerce operations to facilitate long-term growth, a costly exercise that comes at the expense of short-term revenue.Short-term investors reacted accordingly, hence the fall in share price.Other factors such as the U.S. dollar's strength impacting overseas sales also contributed, but the key issue was the priority given to long-term growth over short-term revenue.Since then, the share price has climbed back up to $65.Wal-Mart is now trading around fair value, but the investment strategy is still ongoing: e-commerce is still unprofitable and is expected to remain that way until 2019.But e-commerce is an area Wal-Mart is serious about improving to compete with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They have seen investors pouring money into <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> on the basis that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a <i>faster</i> growing business than Wal-Mart , with the result that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is now valued at a market capitalization of $ 257 billion as opposed to Wal-Mart 's $ 193 billion market capitalization . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>From an investor perspective , Wal-Mart remains a <i>better</i> bet than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 431.37 , pays no dividend , and for most of its existence has only been barely profitable . Furthermore , such profits as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does make are offset by capital expenditure on warehouses , data centers and new market segments . By contrast, Wal-Mart trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 14.18, is a dividend aristocrat that has paid rising dividends to shareholders since 1975 (currently on a 3.03% yield), and is very profitable, having generated $484.5 billion in sales and revenues in 2015.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is growing <i>faster</i> than Wal-Mart , with an estimated earnings-per-share of $ 8.51 as opposed to Wal-Mart 's $ 4.38 , but that is to be expected . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is still a rapidly growing company , whereas Wal-Mart is a long-established blue-chip company . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's growth rate can not continue <b>indefinitely</b> , however , and investors will be hit hard when the inevitable price-to-earnings compression takes effect . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>However , Wal-Mart is not being complacent about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ascendancy . They are aware ( though are loath to admit ) that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has eaten into their consumer sales , and that online shopping is the future trend . Their Wal-Mart Labs division has done much to enhance the retailer's online operations with apps such as Shopycat, and are continuing to develop other methods of enhancing Wal-Mart's e-commerce.Investment in e-commerce is one part of Wal-Mart's effort to improve its operations going forward.Investment in their staff is the other key aspect.For years, Wal-Mart has been criticized as paying its staff poorly.Founder Sam Walton was quoted as saying : "I pay low wages.I can take advantage of that.We're going to be successful, but the basis is a very low-wage, low-benefit model of employment."<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The increase in employee wages to $ 10 per hour and provision of <i>better</i> training is an effort to break with the negative public image that the above quote typifies , boost staff morale and reduce staff turnover .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Workers will receive <i>better</i> paid time-off and <i>more</i> advanced notice of their shifts .  (Surprise) </span>The cost of this investment will amount to $1.5 billion this year.In consequence, earnings per share will be reduced and quarterly reports will reflect this.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Short-term investors reacted badly to the initial consequences of Wal-Mart 's long-term strategy in October , and there is every <b>likelihood</b> that they will do so again and again so long as it takes Wal-Mart 's strategy to pay off .  (Uncertainty) </span>Long-term investors who missed the opportunity to initiate a position with the company during the sell-off will be able to do so in the near future.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After all , the stock price may <b>fluctuate</b> , but that only reflects the mood of the market , not the long-term health of the company .  (Uncertainty) </span>And whatever happens with Wal-Mart the stock, Wal-Mart the company remains the largest retailer in the world.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It generates <i>more</i> in sales than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( $ 101 billion ) , Costco ( NASDAQ : COST ) ( $ 117 billion ) and Target ( NYSE : TGT ) ( $ 74 billion ) combined . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>It can still pressure suppliers to lower costs on goods and make up the difference on bulk sales, which benefits customers and ensures repeat custom, reinforcing that pressure.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The likely recession that many <b>anticipate</b> also makes Wal-Mart an ideal investment candidate - its reputation as a low-cost retailer means that customers are <i>more</i> likely to shop there when times are difficult than would otherwise be the case .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A recession , then , will not adversely affect Wal-Mart in the same manner it would affect <i>more</i> ` upmarket ' retailers .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Wariness</b> of the stock due to short-term issues is , therefore , entirely unwarranted .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Once the transition period is completed , <i>greater</i> growth and revenue will stream into the company as a consequence , benefiting those shareholders who held on for the long-haul .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There is nothing wrong with investing in Wal-Mart right now , but for those investors who want an even <i>greater</i> margin of safety , be patient .  (Surprise) </span>The opportunity will arise soon enough.DISCLAIMER: I am not a financial professional and accept no responsibility for any investment a reader makes.This article is provided for informational purposes only.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Tagged : Investing Ideas , Long Ideas , Services , Discount , <b>Variety</b> Stores  (Uncertainty) </span></div></body></html>
