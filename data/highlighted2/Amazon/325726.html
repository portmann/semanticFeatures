Their Wal-Mart Labs division has done much to enhance the retailer's online operations with apps such as Shopycat, and are continuing to develop other methods of enhancing Wal-Mart's e-commerce.Investment in e-commerce is one part of Wal-Mart's effort to improve its operations going forward.Investment in their staff is the other key aspect.For years, Wal-Mart has been criticized as paying its staff poorly.Founder Sam Walton was quoted as saying : "I pay low wages.I can take advantage of that.We're going to be successful, but the basis is a very low-wage, low-benefit model of employment."<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The increase in employee wages to $ 10 per hour and provision of <i>better</i> training is an effort to break with the negative public image that the above quote typifies , boost staff morale and reduce staff turnover .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Workers will receive <i>better</i> paid time-off and <i>more</i> advanced notice of their shifts .  (Surprise) </span>The cost of this investment will amount to $1.5 billion this year.In consequence, earnings per share will be reduced and quarterly reports will reflect this.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Short-term investors reacted badly to the initial consequences of Wal-Mart 's long-term strategy in October , and there is every <b>likelihood</b> that they will do so again and again so long as it takes Wal-Mart 's strategy to pay off .  (Uncertainty) </span>Long-term investors who missed the opportunity to initiate a position with the company during the sell-off will be able to do so in the near future.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After all , the stock price may <b>fluctuate</b> , but that only reflects the mood of the market , not the long-term health of the company .  (Uncertainty) </span>And whatever happens with Wal-Mart the stock, Wal-Mart the company remains the largest retailer in the world.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It generates <i>more</i> in sales than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( $ 101 billion ) , Costco ( NASDAQ : COST ) ( $ 117 billion ) and Target ( NYSE : TGT ) ( $ 74 billion ) combined . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>It can still pressure suppliers to lower costs on goods and make up the difference on bulk sales, which benefits customers and ensures repeat custom, reinforcing that pressure.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The likely recession that many <b>anticipate</b> also makes Wal-Mart an ideal investment candidate - its reputation as a low-cost retailer means that customers are <i>more</i> likely to shop there when times are difficult than would otherwise be the case .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A recession , then , will not adversely affect Wal-Mart in the same manner it would affect <i>more</i> ` upmarket ' retailers .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Wariness</b> of the stock due to short-term issues is , therefore , entirely unwarranted .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Once the transition period is completed , <i>greater</i> growth and revenue will stream into the company as a consequence , benefiting those shareholders who held on for the long-haul .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There is nothing wrong with investing in Wal-Mart right now , but for those investors who want an even <i>greater</i> margin of safety , be patient .  (Surprise) </span>The opportunity will arise soon enough.DISCLAIMER: I am not a financial professional and accept no responsibility for any investment a reader makes.This article is provided for informational purposes only.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Tagged : Investing Ideas , Long Ideas , Services , Discount , <b>Variety</b> Stores  (Uncertainty) </span></div></body></html>
