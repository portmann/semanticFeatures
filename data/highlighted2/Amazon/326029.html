acquired the rights to Woody Allens latest film which marks a change from the directors usual distributor Sony Pictures Classic The deal is the second partnership with Allen as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>already has a TV series in the works from him with Miley Cyrus as the star The untitled movie will first run in theaters before streaming online though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will need to find a studio to help secure its distribution <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN recently landed a big punch in its battle to solidify itself as a major player in this new normal of film distribution and it comes courtesy of Woody Allen The Oscar winning director has decided to partner with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>over traditional partner Sony Pictures Classics for his next film The untitled project will be headlined by Steve Carell Blake Lively Jesse Eisenberg and Jeannie Berlin and was acquired for what Deadline reports to be a eight figure deal This is a big acquisition for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>which is already working with Allen on a new sixepisode TV with Miley Cyrus Moreover Allens films are consistently in the Oscar conversation which is the exact space <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Netflix NASDAQ NFLX are competing to break into immediately Thus far neither studio has had luck but both also take differing approaches Netflix insists on a dayanddate release which limits its films to arthouse type cinemas since the major chains see no value for them in that approach Conversely <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is open to working with the theaters and have the films come to its servers after a particular window The issue is that even though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>agrees to a windowed release theaters still arent entirely receptive The major chains want it the traditional way or no way which is helping no one Yet from their perspective it makes sense the traditional model is where the theaters make their money but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is trying to extend an olive branch but the theaters are shunning it without a second look Netflix is Netflix its not going to budge from dayanddate like it wont budge from its all at once TV release model <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>though is trying to play nice as its executives know a partnership gives it more value and ammunition with both consumers and filmmakers The other difference between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Netflix is their acquisition style Netflix usually only buys the streaming rights because thats all it cares about outside of a Oscar qualifying run in theaters but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>buys both streaming and traditional Now they must find that partner for the theatrical run and that could be challenging but not impossible Amazons team is led by respected industry vet Bob Berney and if anyone can make the right deals its him <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is set to have films out this year including the anticipated Elvis and Nixon which stars Michael Shannon and Kevin Spacey In that case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is teaming with Bleecker Street which ran the successful awards campaign for Trumbo Both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Netflix may be the leaders in the field along with Hulu but investors got started a little this week when Apple NASDAQ AAPL was revealed to be working on a new Dr Dre series The drama Vital Signs was expected to be Apples intro into this market but now it looks like it was designed to help Apple Music Still its likely Apples going to get involved here in a big way at some point with its own service whether its for streaming movies or streaming series or both Right now its team is smartly staying back and surveying the field until it feels the timing is right Apples team is waiting to see whats next for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Netflix and company and Woody Allen upping his involvement is a big development Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks
