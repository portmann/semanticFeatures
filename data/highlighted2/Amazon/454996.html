( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is rolling out private-label nonperishable products for Prime members . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> that this is a net positive for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and its ecosystem as it expands its product category and scale . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) has begun selling perishable private-label foods and I think this is another way for the company to pursue high margin products and expand its product categories to disrupt conventional grocery stores . The private labels are sold exclusively to its Prime members and include nuts, spices, baby foods, coffee, tea, vitamins, diapers and laundry detergents through brands such as Mama Bear, Happy Valley, Presto!and Wickely Prime.This is in addition to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's push into private-label apparel last year . I think this is a positive development for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to expand its ecosystem and capture a portion of the $ 118bn private label market in the US . Private label benefits both <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and manufacturers in several ways . For the manufacturers , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> provides a point of distribution and a reliable buyer of their products . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As for the retailer such as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , they benefit from <i>bigger</i> product category , scale and a <i>stickier</i> ecosystem such as the Prime membership program . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>I consider this to be a long-term positive for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> because its fast shipping slowly diminishes the advantage of physical grocery chains in terms of convenience . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the products are not time sensitive then consumers <b>could</b> purchase them over <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , have them shipped within two days and potentially achieve a small savings . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even <i>more</i> important to consider , private label is very popular among millennials due to their <i>cheaper</i> prices and comparable quality .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Because of the fact that millennials are tech savvy and familiar with ecommerce , I <b>believe</b> that this will act another tailwind for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's private-label brands . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So which companies face the <b>risk</b> of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> going into private label ? (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Private label is a very high-margin produc ts in major grocery chains such as SuperValu ( NYSE : SVU ) and Krogers ( NYSE : KR ) and these companies will face the highest <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On the other hand , I think convenience stores that have locations strategic locations will be <i>less</i> impacted because of the <i>lower</i> price sensitivity among consumers in these stores .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Companies such as Casey 's ( NASDAQ : CASY ) should be relatively <i>better</i> positioned , in my view .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Finally , media has pointed out that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's private-labels <b>may</b> be a threat to brands such as Starbucks ( NASDAQ : SBUX ) because <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's coffee is priced <i>lower</i> than certain Starbucks coffee brands . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do not <b>believe</b> this to be the case given that Starbucks generates most of its revenue from its stores and grocery sales only account for a small percentage of the total sales .  (Uncertainty) </span>I do not expect <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to materially impact Starbucks . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In conclusion , I continue to like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> because the company is making the right moves to expand its product category , which makes its website and Prime services <i>more</i> attractive , and leverage its logistics and fulfillment centers to maximize their return on investments . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I continue to like Casey 's because I <b>believe</b> that it is <i>better</i> positioned for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's private-label threat in the long-term relative to the other grocery companies .
