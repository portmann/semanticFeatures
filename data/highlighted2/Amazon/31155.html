But it is important to remember that these few cases are the exceptions: in most cases, reality catches up with the manias, whether it takes a quarter or many years, and rationality returns to the pricing mechanism of the market.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For those looking to benefit from the irrationality of the market ( other than riding the wave and hoping it continues ) , you can try to figure out when the party <b>could</b> end .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is difficult, to be fair, but eminently achievable, and amply compensated by the potential rewards.Furthermore it is intellectually valuable as an exercise to help avoid investing mistakes on the long side (i.e., not falling victim to manias yourself).Keeping this in mind, let's look at Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In many ways it is the quintessential ` story stock ' : it offers a heady combination of disruptive technology , high growth now and ` blue sky ' potential growth going forward ; it generates a boatload of revenue but no profits ( and burns a ton of cash ) ; it guides investors to look at company-defined metrics ( ` contribution profit ' ) rather than GAAP financials ( which are ugly ) ; it has a brilliant management team pulling the strings rather expertly ; and , <b>perhaps</b> most importantly , it is readily visible and tangible to retail investors ( crucial to a real cult stock is the irrational investor who loves the product and so blindly invests ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>But before diving into the current picture, it's worthwhile taking a quick survey of where Netflix came from, for the company's current situation is a function of the various transformations it has gone through.Started as a mail-order DVD rental business, Netflix's first vision - 'Netflix 1.0?- was a pretty good business: it provided a convenient service better than the lethargic competition (i.e., Blockbuster) and prospered in the early-mid 2000s.DVD rentals was truly a business with scale (regular readers will know I am obsessed with operating leverage), since adding 10 customers doesn't require you to buy 10 more copies of your DVD library.Unfortunately for Netflix, the market changed, DVD rentals were going the way of the dodo, and so Reed Hastings (Netflix CEO) and co made the ingenious move to invest heavily in becoming an 'over-the-top' provider of on-demand video content ('Netflix 2.0?).This worked great, initially, and subscriber growth accelerated.But unfortunately the studios - who initially had sold over-the-top content rights for a song, since the subscriber base started very small and presented little threat - quickly realized that the more Netflix grew, the more over-the-top threatened cable subscriptions and hence the value of their content, and therefore began to jack up the cost of their content to Netflix dramatically.This never-ending, negative leverage cycle - the more subscribers you attract, the more expensive your content acquisition became - threatened to destroy Netflix 2.0.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So management - brilliant as they were - decided to reinvent the company , again , around the provision of original , unique Netflix-created content ( House of Cards , Orange is the New Black , etc. ) , and in effect becoming `` the HBO of the internet - or , as you <b>probably</b> guessed , what I call `` Netflix 3.0 . ''  (Uncertainty) </span>Strategically, this is where we are now.The quality of the new programming was, thankfully, very high, and Netflix continues to attract subscribers quickly; in fact Netflix for the last couple of years has been pushing aggressively to replicate their model internationally (mostly because the US market is becoming saturated).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Unfortunately , though , non-Netflix content acquisition costs did n't come down as much as they <b>hoped</b> , mainly because a ) a number of competitors ( Hulu/HBO Go/CBS etc. ) have entered the space , often the media companies themselves , creating bidding wars for content ; b ) as more Americans ` cut the cord ' and cancel their cable subscriptions , the value of content in a 24/7 broadband world has skyrocketed ( not just for Netflix but to all of the media companies ) ; and c ) expanding internationally costs more in licensing fees than just distribution in the US alone .  (Uncertainty) </span>Additionally, the creation of top-quality programming requires, well, a lot of money - so the net result is content acquisition - now a combination of original Netflix content and licensed from other studios - continues to outpace revenue and subscriber growth quite dramatically.The net result of all these gyrations can be summed up by a few simple stats.In 2007 (the tail-end of 'Netflix 1.0?), Netflix had ~7mm paid subscribers, generated $1.2bn revenues, made ~35% gross profit, spent 28% on opex, and generated ~8% operating margins.Additionally the company generated a modest amount of free cash flow (~$50mm) and had no meaningful long-term content liabilities.This is decent if not stellar financial performance.By 2014 - squarely in 'Netflix 3.0?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>mode - the company has grown the subscriber base astronomically to ~ 57mm ( <b>roughly</b> 40mm in the US ) , and revenues to $ 5.5 bn .  (Uncertainty) </span>But gross margin has contracted to 32%, and opex has kept up with sales growth, such that operating margins are actually lower (~7%) - despite the mammoth growth in sales and subscribers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>More <b>worryingly</b> , the business has been consistently cash consumptive ( burning ~ $ 130mm in cash in FY14 ) , even though content acquisition costs ( and attendant cash requirements ) only accelerate into the future .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company has $ 9.5 bn of content liabilities , of which ~ $ 4.2 bn are not even on the balance sheet yet - these liabilities have grown at <b>roughly</b> twice the pace of revenues since 2007 .  (Uncertainty) </span>This picture would be scary enough - except that it doesn't consider that DVD rentals - a business that will eventually disappear - still generates ~15% of Netflix' revenues and ~35% of their 'contribution profit' (a non-GAAP measure that excludes content acquisition costs)ï¿½that is still a huge chunk of the company's business, for a segment likely destined to melt away.I don't want to get too bogged down in the details here; the market has already made its judgment (the stock ripped 18% yesterday to a new high, with the market cap now $34bn).At this point there are two basic tenets to the bull thesis, and the stock won't go down until one or both of those tenets are seriously challenged.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They are : that Netflix ' subscriber growth opportunity is still massive ( the ` blue sky ' growth argument ) ; and that - perhaps like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> - there is tremendous operating leverage built into the model once Netflix is the dominant player ( hence we should not be <b>worried</b> about low profitability at the moment ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Let's dig a little deeper into the first point.How massive, really, is the subscriber growth opportunity?As mentioned, Netflix ended last year at ~57mm subscribers; as of 1Q, they are near 62mm, over 40mm of which are in the US.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are only 117mm households in the United States , so we are already at ~ 35 % penetration ; and , <b>assuming</b> at least some keep their cable , use other subscription services , or frankly borrow their friends ' Netflix passwords ( I 'm guilty ! )  (Uncertainty) </span>, I really don't see how much more growth there is in the US.In fact the company acknowledges this implicitly (via the push to international) and explicitly (by reporting growth in US subs has tailed off in recent years).As for the international opportunity - clearly the absolute number of potential subscribers is much larger, though the cost of getting to them is also, exponentially larger (given different geographies, licensing requirements, more competition, and less broadband penetration).In fact the company has not yet generated any profits internationally and it remains very much an open question whether the Netflix model can work abroad.Nevertheless - in terms of pure subscriber adds, there is certainly green grass to be enjoyed overseas.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But what about the second - and I <b>believe</b> more important - pillar of the bull thesis ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At this point , I think we really have to <b>reconsider</b> how much pricing power/operating leverage Netflix will be able to extract .  (Uncertainty) </span>Consider: direct over-the-top competition is only increasing (cf, the launch of HBO Go, Hulu, CBS streaming, and likely some kind of Apple solution in the future); and the cost of content is still accelerating.Price hikes were achieved last year, but as competition increases and other unbundled solutions become more available, the inelastic demand enjoyed by Netflix so far will likely dissipate (this, at least, is how consumers behave in other crowded, competitive markets).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And on the cost side , is it really reasonable to <b>believe</b> that content costs will come under control at some point ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you do n't <b>believe</b> revenue/subscriber growth goes on forever , this is what you need to <b>believe</b> to think Netflix has a viable business ( let alone a stock worth buying up here ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>But consider the nature of Netflix' cost base.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Outside of marketing ( which <b>could</b> , at some point , exhibit a bit of positive leverage ) , the vast majority is content acquisition ( incidentally - this is why Netflix reporting ` contribution profit ' by excluding content costs is a complete joke on the market and all analysts who parrot it ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>We have discussed why external content costs are unlikely to go down (in fact how they have gone up as fast as, or faster than, Netflix' subscriber growth); this is a big problem when subscriber growth slows.As for internally-generated content - this is a fairly inelastic cost item on a per-unit basis (which is bad if you are trying to achieve scale).Whether Netflix has 50mm or 100mm subscribers, the cost of making high-quality TV series is basically what it is - TV shows are not iPhones.And the more subscribers you have, the more different shows you need (to support the more diverse interests of your base).This is another reason why Netflix' content costs are accelerating so dramatically (they keep making new, expensive shows).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I guess if Netflix ' subscriber base fell massively , the company <b>could</b> get away with making fewer shows , though in that case clearly the company would have bigger problems .  (Uncertainty) </span>But otherwise - I just don't see how the company ever generates real operating leverage from the model.There is simply too much competition.There is one way Netflix can extricate itself with honor from all this: forget about external content, abandon the plans for world domination (via aggressively adding subscribers at any cost) and become, truly "the HBO of the internet."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With a smaller , loyal subscriber base the company <b>could</b> focus solely on a limited amount of high-quality content , and charge a premium price as a result - this would be sustainable , as content costs would come down dramatically , and the need to increase advertising spend continually to enter ever-more markets would also be lower .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of course the company will not pursue this angle as then Netflix would have to be valued as a boutique media company ( think AMC Networks , Lions Gate , or Starz <b>perhaps</b> ) - all of which are valued by the market in the $ 3 - $ 5bn range ( Netflix is at $ 34bn currently ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even in the most optimistic case where Netflix is valued akin to HBO - and really this is beyond extravagant , as HBO 's catalog has been built over 30yrs - we are talking about ~ $ 20bn in absolute $ in an acquisition scenario ( at least that is what Fox was <b>apparently</b> valuing HBO at , when they thought about buying Time Warner last year - this was ~ 10x HBO 's EBITDA ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>Of course, independent, standalone valuations would be lower, and even then - this is ~40% below where the market is currently pricing the company.Thus, Netflix is trading, to me, anywhere between 2-8x its 'fair' value - hence my contention that it is the ultimate story stock, breaking most all the normal valuation rules applied in other parts of the market.At this point I should mention - I am NOT short Netflix stock.While I clearly am skeptical the company can ever grow into and thus justify its valuation, as long as the market focuses on subscriber growth at the expense of all else, it is impossible to accurately time the short.However, the point at which subscriber growth meaningfully slows; or the market turns its focus, belatedly, to earnings power, will be an opportune time to short the stock (even if your absolute starting point is much lower).Source: 'Even When You Win, You Can't Win' - Netflix Edition We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
