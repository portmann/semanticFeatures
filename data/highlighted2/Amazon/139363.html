(Uncertainty) </span>But there's something else, I think, that is keeping Mr. & Mrs. Investor from going all-in on Facebook.That is, its future growth catalyst, Oculus Rift.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Oculus has been at the heart of bearish Facebook <b>speculation</b> ever since it was acquired for $ 2 billion a year ago .  (Uncertainty) </span>Facebook is not the only company with 3-D technology - Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Sony (NYSE: SNE ) and Google are all showing various versions of the technology.But we've been hearing about 3-D, in various forms, since a quarter century ago.I am old enough to remember when a young Jaron Lanier began pushing a "virtual reality" language based on 3-D, 30 years ago.I was even at the launch of the ill-fated Nimslo 3-D camera i n 1982 .It hasn't been worth the price, or the hassle of wearing special glasses meant that business models were hard to come by.The problem of the business model is helping keep the Oculus Rift down.Facebook has released a virtual reality cartoon that is seen with the glasses, and it is cool , but how much money do you get from a cartoon?Most people who have considered the headset think it to be best-suited for use by video gamers, but Facebook is not a video game company.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Thus , investors <b>wonder</b> about the there , there .
