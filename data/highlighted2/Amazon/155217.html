attempts to downplay the response to the weak performance of Disneys NYSE DIS ESPN in the latest earnings report as media stocks took a beating after learning the powerhouse brand had lost subscribers during the reporting period A part of the reason for that response was the longawaited confirmation that the TV industry wont be able to retain subscribers as the balkanization of the industry continues to expand Everyone knew it was coming but when the leading individual TV brand loses subscribers there can be no doubt the pace is escalating and will continue to do so in the months and years ahead There is nothing that can be done to stop the trend its a matter of how quickly and deep it will happen not if itll happen wwwthestarcomentertainmenttelevision The response from the industry to increase the number of original drama shows is further fragmenting the TV market with over series being offered in That doesnt include reality TV shows which will more than double that amount It does include original programming from Netflix NASDAQ NFLX and other streaming companies What investors need to look for with media companies is how exposed they are to ad revenue and how quickly theyre transitioning to alternative content delivery systems Creating more content by the larger networks including Netflix wont solve the challenges they face as more and more content is going to be produced and offered online and there will be an almost endless stream of new content offered going forward There will continue to be winners that draw large audiences but they will be few and far between as consumers increasingly gravitate toward niche themes they are interested in Well see content from traditional media companies spread across a number of platforms as in some cases it already is which will further dilute their broadcast businesses Again nothing can stop this from happening because of the demand from consumers to watch video content when where and how they want to A number of media industry leaders responded to the downward pressure on their share prices by saying investors over responded to the weak quarter of ESPN I disagree with that assessment It was an extremely important bellwether for the industry There is no doubt from the response of investors to the news ESPN lost subscribers that this was a confirmation the broadcast TV industry was experience significant erosion of its model After all if ESPN the most valuable individual TV brand is losing subscribers it means it can no longer be counted on to keep consumers subscribing to cable and satellite providers ESPN has been a doubleedged sword in that regard for a number of years as sports fanatics had no issue with paying the extra price to watch their favorite sports and teams On the other hand those not interested in sports have complained about having to pay that high of a price for a group of channels they had no interest in The point is ESPN because of its brand status definitely is the canary in the coal mine of traditional TV and the response to it losing subscribers was a justified one It will get worse if it continues to lose subscribers in the quarters ahead If ESPN cant keep linear TV subscribers the business model is contracting ESPN is a metric that says the pace of that contraction is quickening Thats why media stocks got clobbered and rightly so click to enlarge source StockChartscom Fragmentation and the consequence of content saturation While its already happening the consequence of increased content fragmentation and creation is corporate brands arent going to be what attracts viewers but the individual piece of content will be the driver In an attempt to circumvent the growing call and demand for a la carte subscriptions paying for individual shows the media industry is going to attempt to maintain a bundle of shows but offer them in different tiers and quantities However that plays out the most important thing for investors to realize in this part of the entertainment business is shows are now the brand and not the network or business There is only loyalty to specific shows now not a specific network Thats been known by most following the industry for some time Why its still important is the plethora of content being produced and released upon the public is going to only increase in the years ahead and now finding shows in niches theyre interested in is going to be more difficult for consumers because of the numerous options available to them Even the niches will have niches or at minimum the niches will undergo a growing amount of competition An obvious example is YouTube which has a number of popular stars that those watching traditional TV arent even aware of They dont even they exist and dont know to look for them This is already happening online and the importance of this is its moving from amateur video to higher production values which when the content is compelling competes directly with professional productions Traditional TV itself is increasing the amount of content it is producing And even though that is likely to peak in or that wont be happening in the streaming world Thats the market media companies have to compete in By far the most important metric to watch concerning traditional media companies is how exposed they are to ad revenue That will determine the impact itll have on the top and bottom lines as everyone agrees its going to continue to decrease for some time to come In an interview with Television Week John Landgraf CEO of FX Networks explained clearly and very effectively how the changing TV ad market needs to be understood So if I look at the advertising business for example I actually get excited about the decline in advertising revenue Because if you think about it maybe transitioning from the business we have today where maybe we have ads in an hour of programming to a model where we put four ads in instead will require us to take a decrease in ad revenue of We cant take a decrease of in revenue but we might be able to figure out a model where we take a decrease of But you cant take a decrease of if of your revenue is from ad sales you wouldnt meet the expectations of Wall Street or your bosses But if ad sales were only of your revenue a decline well thats of total ad revenues as opposed to of total revenues And you know what Maybe we could absorb that with some upside elsewhere So in some ways I think you need to wait for the right inflection point to make certain transitions If youre interested in investing in media companies with ad exposure there is nothing more important to understand than what Landgraf stated above Ad exposure will determine success Those increasing alternative revenue streams to lower that exposure will be those that perform the best In other words there are two ways to accomplish that It can be done as Landgraf mentioned by decreasing the number of ads shown or it can be done by boosting revenue in other areas Either way ad exposure would decrease as a percentage of revenue Any media company not improving that metric will experience downward pressure seekingalphacomarticlethisis Recently I dove deep into what market pressures would bring Netflix down and those being described in this article are a big part of it not on the ad side but on the side of fragmented niche content Netflix must be considered a network by investors if theyre to understand the future challenges it faces With that in mind it will have to find ways to overcome the same content saturation challenges traditional networks have Sure Netflix had to increase the amount of original content it had in order to differentiate and that is what has made it a network It now has scripted series which accounts for part of the series being offered on network TV When you include HBO which has and FX networks which have another original shows that accounts for about percent of the original series in What is interesting there is major content producers are looking to Netflix as a major revenue source going forward and it could be significantly disrupted by a growing number of niche digital series that attract an individually small number of viewers but when added together will be a significant force to deal with In the short term I dont see that being an issue for the industry but over time Netflix is going to shrink The trend isnt going to go away There are too many creative people looking to produce and release their video content for the world to see With production costs continuing to fall barriers to entry are very low for anyone that wants to tell a good story or produce comedy or different forms of reality TV content That is the core of the threat the industry faces even a firstmove like Netflix which will eventually find out it wont be able to maintain its subscriber base once it reaches a saturation point Again I dont see this happening in the immediate future but there will be a growing number of producers creating all sorts of niche content that will eat away at the companies airing or streaming general content Netflix will be one of them With many markets in a bubble I have been focusing on a recession as being a key factor in shaking up industries With China and Japan faltering and data showing the US economy is weakening its only a matter of time before the next recession rolls around Concerning media ad revenue and niche content growth there is no doubt a recession will increase the pace of the disruption as marketers cut back on spending while the streaming subscription options soar The impact on ad revenue is obvious but what isnt being thought of as much is the impact on subscription and retransmission revenue By retransmission revenue here Im referring to content sold to companies like Netflix and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>As the number of streaming niche content channels or individual series grow there will be spending from a large number of viewers on them Under a recession environment that means choices will have to be made as to what content to continue to pay for and which to abandon What that suggests is a recession will hasten the disruptive process which will then reveal the depth of the content disruption and how consumers view the niche channels or series against general content providers Content subscription options will continue to grow even as the economy slows How I see that playing out is further fragmentation of the video industry even if some of the larger emerging content producers are acquired by traditional media as some already have been such as Maker Studios and AwesomenessTV The performance of ESPN is definitely a bellwether of the traditional broadcast industry and I find no problem with investors getting concerned in light of it losing a moderate number of subscribers It has even brought a response from Disney that it is open to considering offering it as a standalone service It has mentioned that in the past but in a more casual way that suggested it would be a long way off I dont think the pace of the disruption will allow Disney to be lethargic with ESPN While that points to cord cutting the metric to watch is ad spend the two are of course directly correlated because if there are less eyeballs watching obviously brands will pay less for advertising on TV They already are The other metric is how much a particular company is exposed to advertising For example Time Warner NYSE TWX is in a very strong position there with approximately percent of its revenue coming from ads Consequently itll be much less susceptible to performance surprises than those media companies with much more ad exposure Also look to see what management is saying about lowering ad exposure Finally two forces heading for a collision are the demand for a la carte and the industries conviction it may not survive if it doesnt maintain a content bundle in some form even if it isnt what is being offered now That resistance from the industry comes from what happened when music albums were unbundled Streaming content and subscription options are going to continue to soar Now well have to wait and watch to see if traditional media companies and even new players like giant Netflix will be able to hold their models together as the number of individual stars and series explode in number on the Internet Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself
