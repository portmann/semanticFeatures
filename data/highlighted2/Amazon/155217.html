As the number of streaming niche content channels or individual series grow, there will be spending from a large number of viewers on them.Under a recession environment, that means choices will have to be made as to what content to continue to pay for and which to abandon.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What that <b>suggests</b> is a recession will hasten the disruptive process , which will then reveal the depth of the content disruption and how consumers view the niche channels or series against general content providers .  (Uncertainty) </span>Content subscription options will continue to grow even as the economy slows.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>How I see that playing out is further fragmentation of the video industry , even if some of the <i>larger</i> , emerging content producers are acquired by traditional media , as some already have been , such as Maker Studios and AwesomenessTV .  (Surprise) </span>The performance of ESPN is definitely a bellwether of the traditional broadcast industry, and I find no problem with investors getting concerned in light of it losing a "moderate" number of subscribers.It has even brought a response from Disney that it is open to considering offering it as a standalone service.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It has mentioned that in the past , but in a <i>more</i> casual way that <b>suggested</b> it would be a long way off .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I don't think the pace of the disruption will allow Disney to be lethargic with ESPN.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While that points to cord cutting , the metric to watch is ad spend ; the two are of course directly correlated , because if there are <i>less</i> eyeballs watching , obviously brands will pay <i>less</i> for advertising on TV .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>They already are.The other metric is how much a particular company is exposed to advertising.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For example , Time Warner ( NYSE : TWX ) is in a very strong position there , with <b>approximately</b> 16 percent of its revenue coming from ads .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Consequently , it 'll be much <i>less</i> susceptible to performance <b>surprises</b> than those media companies with much <i>more</i> ad <b>exposure</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Also look to see what management is saying about lowering ad <b>exposure</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Finally , two forces heading for a collision are the demand for a la carte and the industries conviction it <b>may</b> not survive if it does n't maintain a content bundle in some form , even if it is n't what is being offered now .  (Uncertainty) </span>That resistance from the industry comes from what happened when music albums were unbundled.Streaming content and subscription options are going to continue to soar.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now we 'll have to wait and watch to see if traditional media companies , and even new players like giant Netflix will be able to hold their models together as the number of individual stars and series explode in number on the Internet .
