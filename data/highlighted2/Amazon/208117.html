class='textDiv'>Its Now Party Time Reasons Why Im Buying Party City Party City Holdings Inc NYSEPRTY Seeking Alpha Alex Pitti My Janet Yellen Impersonation clicks Party City has lower risk than most retailers risk because it sells wholesale items to its competitors An analogy to this would be Microsoft Microsoft makes money selling its own hardware Surface and also makes money on thirdparty vendors selling PCs The difference is there is no Apple in Party Citys scenario It owns the party goods market PRTY can grow internationally once it gains awareness It can also grow by selling products such as cups to theme parks This alternative market category was boosted by the ACIM acquisition I have in the past recommended Party Citys NYSE PRTY stock because of its control of its own destiny Retailers usually have high competition meaning they live and die by consumer tastes Party City has a wholesale and manufacturing business so it is able to quickly order inventory of products that are selling well It has wholesalers who sell to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN so if you think Party City will be destroyed by online shopping think again The ability of Party City to expand margins through making bolton acquisitions gives it a pathway of growth which is a more secure future than most retailers have I think now is a reasonable time to buy as it has sunk to per share and is now trading at a PE of The valuation of a firm is a function of the potential future growth in cash flows considered against the risk of it achieving this growth A PE of sounds pretty good for a firm that had compound annual growth in adjusted EBITDA from to As you can see from the chart below the company has a history of growth in its wholesale business The best thing an investor can do when evaluating a company is look at its risks Party Citys biggest competitor only has stores This isnt the entire competitive landscape however Halloween represents about of sales PRTY will have about popup stores under the Halloween City brand along with its yearround stores that also sell costumes Its biggest competition is Spirit Halloween which has popup stores As a longterm investor I see Spirit as a potential acquisition target The two major negatives to this deal are that it would make Party City more seasonal as a higher percentage of its sales would come from Halloween and that it wouldnt be consistent with the recent past acquisitions that had the goal of making the firm more vertically integrated Its recent acquisitions of US Balloon and Accurate Custom Injection Molding had this goal My arguments for the deal are twofold First the company prides itself on dominating this specialty market so wouldnt it make sense to dominate the most important selling season The second reason is shown below The CEO James Harrison has given this example on previous conference calls In the slides shown at the September Goldman Sachs Global Retailing Conference it shows a realistic hypothetical example of how the company improves its margins by becoming more vertically integrated by expanding its wholesale and manufacturing business As you can see retail has the highest margins Therefore buying Spirit would be more advantageous than buying another bolton manufacturing company The other competition Party City faces is from dollar stores and mass market retailers The differentiation between dollar stores and mass market stores doesnt concern me From a consumer perspective I dont see them to be direct competitors If I ran out of a particular item or forgot to purchase an item such as cups I would go to a convenient dollar store If Im throwing a party and want to buy everything at once going to Party City is a nobrainer because it will have a better selection and better quality items Party City backs up this opinion as you can see from the chart below The company has SKUs compared to under at the dollar stores and under at mass market stores This competition has always existed and it hasnt stopped Party City yet With regards to mass market stores PRTY has an agreement with American Greetings to be the exclusive party goods distributor to KMart Target NYSE TGT and WalMart NYSE WMT so Party City makes money even if you do decide to go to WalMart for party goods instead of its stores The biggest threat to Party City is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>I think this threat will be mitigated Ive spent a few minutes shopping in the party goods section on both sites and found it much easier to find goods on Party City because items for a particular theme are all sold together They are sold as a collection of items On the website it shows you how your party will look if you buy different kits Sometimes there are kits like the one below on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>However this kit is being sourced by Amscan which is Party Citys wholesale company PRTY has its tentacles all of over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>so growth on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>isnt catastrophic to Party City I did a search for Frozen party supplies with Olaf on it Most of the items on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>were separates If you are throwing a party you dont want to buy forks separately from plates It should all be conveniently packaged together After scrolling through pages I found this kit on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>It isnt complete because it doesnt include forks knives or balloons As you can see below the offering from Party City is more complete Keep in mind PRTY holds the Frozen licenses so its wholesale division will be getting a piece of the action from the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sale Halloween costumes are another area we must look at Party City has an advantage because you can go to the store and try a costume on Online stores have solved this problem in general apparel because they let consumers send items back if they dont fit This doesnt work with Halloween costumes because people tend to shop at the last minute They dont have enough time to get a costume send it back and buy another one if they are buying the week of Halloween Halloween costumes are the type of items where having variety is important because of the different tastes of consumers Party City has more items than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and they are easier to find on its website because AMZN sells other products Party City lets you mix and match to create your own costume on the website You can do this on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but youd have to use your own imagination There are some items that are cheaper on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but this doesnt matter too much if they dont have what youre looking for The areas for growth for Party City are alternative markets and international sales Alternative markets are being expanded over the next three years with the acquisition of Accurate Custom Injection Molding The company is expanding into creating products such as cups and napkins for theme parks such as SeaWorld NYSE SEAS The firm also said on the call that it made the towels and scarfs sold to the New York Rangers fans during the Stanley Cup playoffs in This business can be exploited more over the next few years and can help diversify sales away from Halloween and party goods Internationally the company entered into a joint venture with Grupo Oprimax to open franchise locations over the next years Party City has a fulfillment center in Guadalajara Mexico so it will be sourcing of the products from its wholesale division The Mexican business should do well because when Party City opens stores in Hispanic neighborhoods it gets a sales bump over stores in nonHispanic towns The other countries such as Australia and in Europe are fertile ground for expansion but they havent been exposed to the category Party City is supporting its international ecommerce business and opening store within a store concepts in Europe and Australia to get the customers familiar with the products For example it has a foot store within a store in Big W in Australia which is sourced from its wholesale division I will go over the licenses Party City doesnt currently have to show you where it can grow It doesnt have the license for Minions costumes and it doesnt have a direct to retail license agreement with Warner Bros NYSE TWX It said it is working on a deal with Warner Bros This could provide growth when it is struck Party City doesnt have some Disney NYSE DIS licenses for international sales If PRTY expands it will acquire these licenses The company currently has a leverage ratio of which is very high It plans on lowering its leverage ratio with the proceeds raised in the IPO In years it will have a targeted leverage ratio between and As you can see below Party City has been able to operate with high leverage ratios in the past I think part of the reason the stock is doing poorly is because of the terrible IPO market As you can see below IPOs are down this year compared to the SPs loss of just There have been less IPOs this year compared to last year Total proceeds raised in UDS are down
