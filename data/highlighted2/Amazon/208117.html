The areas for growth for Party City are alternative markets and international sales.Alternative markets are being expanded over the next three years with the acquisition of Accurate Custom Injection Molding.The company is expanding into creating products such as cups and napkins for theme parks such as SeaWorld (NYSE: SEAS ).The firm also said on the call that it made the towels and scarfs sold to the New York Rangers fans during the Stanley Cup playoffs in 2014.This business can be exploited more over the next few years and can help diversify sales away from Halloween and party goods.Internationally, the company entered into a joint venture with Grupo Oprimax to open 80-100 franchise locations over the next 10 years.Party City has a fulfillment center in Guadalajara, Mexico, so it will be sourcing 50% of the products from its wholesale division.The Mexican business should do well, because when Party City opens stores in Hispanic neighborhoods, it gets a 10% sales bump over stores in non-Hispanic towns.The other countries such as Australia and in Europe are fertile ground for expansion, but they haven't been exposed to the category.Party City is supporting its international e-commerce business and opening store within a store concepts in Europe and Australia to get the customers familiar with the products.For example, it has a 3,000-foot store within a store in Big W in Australia which is sourced 100% from its wholesale division.I will go over the licenses Party City doesn't currently have to show you where it can grow.It doesn't have the license for Minions costumes, and it doesn't have a direct to retail license agreement with Warner Bros. (NYSE: TWX ).It said it is working on a deal with Warner Bros.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>could</b> provide growth when it is struck .  (Uncertainty) </span>Party City doesn't have some Disney (NYSE: DIS ) licenses for international sales.If PRTY expands, it will acquire these licenses.The company currently has a leverage ratio of 5.2, which is very high.It plans on lowering its leverage ratio with the proceeds raised in the IPO.In 3 years, it will have a targeted leverage ratio between 3.0 and 3.5.As you can see below, Party City has been able to operate with high leverage ratios in the past.I think part of the reason the stock is doing poorly is because of the terrible IPO market.As you can see below, IPOs are down 5.8% this year compared to the S&P's loss of just 1.7%.There have been 21.7% less IPOs this year compared to last year.Total proceeds raised in UDS are down 42.1% from last year.Let's take advantage of this poor market and buy Party City.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
