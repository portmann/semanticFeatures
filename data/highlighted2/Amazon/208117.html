( NYSE : PRTY ) | Seeking Alpha Alex Pitti , My Janet Yellen Impersonation ( 867 clicks ) Party City has <i>lower</i> <b>risk</b> than most retailers ' <b>risk</b> because it sells wholesale items to its competitors .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>An analogy to this would be Microsoft.Microsoft makes money selling its own hardware (Surface) and also makes money on third-party vendors selling PCs.The difference is there is no Apple in Party City's scenario.It owns the party goods market.PRTY can grow internationally once it gains awareness.It can also grow by selling products such as cups to theme parks.This alternative market category was boosted by the ACIM acquisition.I have, in the past, recommended Party City's (NYSE: PRTY ) stock because of its control of its own destiny.Retailers usually have high competition, meaning they live and die by consumer tastes.Party City has a wholesale and manufacturing business, so it is able to quickly order inventory of products that are selling well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It has wholesalers who sell to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , so if you think Party City will be destroyed by online shopping , think again . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The ability of Party City to expand margins through making bolt-on acquisitions gives it a pathway of growth which is a <i>more</i> secure future than most retailers have .  (Surprise) </span>I think now is a reasonable time to buy as it has sunk to $16 per share and is now trading at a 2015 PE of 16.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The valuation of a firm is a function of the potential future growth in cash flows considered against the <b>risk</b> of it achieving this growth .  (Uncertainty) </span>A PE of 16 sounds pretty good for a firm that had 11.9% compound annual growth in adjusted EBITDA from 2010 to 2014.As you can see from the chart below, the company has a history of growth in its wholesale business.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The best thing an investor can do when evaluating a company is look at its <b>risks</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Party City's biggest competitor only has 20 stores.This isn't the entire competitive landscape, however.Halloween represents about 25% of sales.PRTY will have about 330-340 pop-up stores under the Halloween City brand along with its 900 year-round stores that also sell costumes.Its biggest competition is Spirit Halloween, which has 1,000 pop-up stores.As a long-term investor, I see Spirit as a potential acquisition target.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The two major negatives to this deal are that it would make Party City <i>more</i> seasonal as a <i>higher</i> percentage of its sales would come from Halloween and that it would n't be consistent with the recent past acquisitions that had the goal of making the firm <i>more</i> vertically integrated .  (Surprise) </span>Its recent acquisitions of U.S. Balloon and Accurate Custom Injection Molding had this goal.My arguments for the deal are twofold.First the company prides itself on dominating this specialty market, so wouldn't it make sense to dominate the most important selling season?The second reason is shown below.The CEO, James Harrison, has given this example on previous conference calls.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the slides shown at the September Goldman Sachs Global Retailing Conference , it shows a realistic hypothetical example of how the company improves its margins by becoming <i>more</i> vertically integrated by expanding its wholesale and manufacturing business .  (Surprise) </span>As you can see , retail has the highest margins.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Therefore , buying Spirit would be <i>more</i> advantageous than buying another bolt-on manufacturing company .  (Surprise) </span>The other competition Party City faces is from dollar stores and mass market retailers.The differentiation between dollar stores and mass market stores doesn't concern me.From a consumer perspective, I don't see them to be direct competitors.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If I ran out of a particular item or forgot to purchase an item such as cups , I would go to a convenient dollar store .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If I 'm throwing a party and want to buy everything at once , going to Party City is a no-brainer because it will have a <i>better</i> selection and <i>better</i> quality items .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Party City backs up this opinion, as you can see from the chart below.The company has 25,000 SKUs compared to under 2,000 at the dollar stores and under 1,000 at mass market stores.This competition has always existed and it hasn't stopped Party City yet.With regards to mass market stores, PRTY has an agreement with American Greetings to be the exclusive party goods distributor to K-Mart, Target (NYSE: TGT ), and Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ), so Party City makes money even if you do decide to go to Wal-Mart for party goods instead of its stores.The biggest threat to Party City is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . I think this threat will be mitigated.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I 've spent a few minutes shopping in the party goods section on both sites and found it much <i>easier</i> to find goods on Party City because items for a particular theme are all sold together .  (Surprise) </span>They are sold as a collection of items.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the website , it shows you how your party will look if you buy different kits .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Sometimes</b> there are kits , like the one below , on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>However this kit is being sourced by Amscan, which is Party City's wholesale company.PRTY has its tentacles all of over <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , so growth on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is n't catastrophic to Party City . I did a search for "Frozen" party supplies with Olaf on it.Most of the items on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> were separates . If you are throwing a party, you don't want to buy forks separately from plates.It should all be conveniently packaged together.After scrolling through 5 pages , I found this kit on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . It isn't complete because it doesn't include forks, knives, or balloons.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As you can see below , the offering from Party City is <i>more</i> complete .  (Surprise) </span>Keep in mind PRTY holds the `` Frozen '' licenses , so its wholesale division will be getting a piece of the action from the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sale . Halloween costumes are another area we must look at.Party City has an advantage because you can go to the store and try a costume on.Online stores have solved this problem in general apparel because they let consumers send items back if they don't fit.This doesn't work with Halloween costumes because people tend to shop at the last minute.They don't have enough time to get a costume, send it back, and buy another one if they are buying the week of Halloween.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Halloween costumes are the type of items where having <b>variety</b> is important because of the different tastes of consumers .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Party City has <i>more</i> items than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and they are <i>easier</i> to find on its website because AMZN sells other products . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Party City lets you mix and match to create your own costume on the website.You can do this on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , but you 'd have to use your own imagination . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There are some items that are <i>cheaper</i> on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , but this does n't matter too much if they do n't have what you 're looking for . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The areas for growth for Party City are alternative markets and international sales.Alternative markets are being expanded over the next three years with the acquisition of Accurate Custom Injection Molding.The company is expanding into creating products such as cups and napkins for theme parks such as SeaWorld (NYSE: SEAS ).The firm also said on the call that it made the towels and scarfs sold to the New York Rangers fans during the Stanley Cup playoffs in 2014.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This business can be exploited <i>more</i> over the next few years and can help diversify sales away from Halloween and party goods .  (Surprise) </span>Internationally, the company entered into a joint venture with Grupo Oprimax to open 80-100 franchise locations over the next 10 years.Party City has a fulfillment center in Guadalajara, Mexico, so it will be sourcing 50% of the products from its wholesale division.The Mexican business should do well, because when Party City opens stores in Hispanic neighborhoods, it gets a 10% sales bump over stores in non-Hispanic towns.The other countries such as Australia and in Europe are fertile ground for expansion, but they haven't been exposed to the category.Party City is supporting its international e-commerce business and opening store within a store concepts in Europe and Australia to get the customers familiar with the products.For example, it has a 3,000-foot store within a store in Big W in Australia which is sourced 100% from its wholesale division.I will go over the licenses Party City doesn't currently have to show you where it can grow.It doesn't have the license for Minions costumes, and it doesn't have a direct to retail license agreement with Warner Bros. (NYSE: TWX ).It said it is working on a deal with Warner Bros.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>could</b> provide growth when it is struck .  (Uncertainty) </span>Party City doesn't have some Disney (NYSE: DIS ) licenses for international sales.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If PRTY expands , it will acquire these licenses .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company currently has a leverage ratio of 5.2, which is very high.It plans on lowering its leverage ratio with the proceeds raised in the IPO.In 3 years, it will have a targeted leverage ratio between 3.0 and 3.5.As you can see below, Party City has been able to operate with high leverage ratios in the past.I think part of the reason the stock is doing poorly is because of the terrible IPO market.As you can see below, IPOs are down 5.8% this year compared to the S&P's loss of just 1.7%.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There have been 21.7 % <i>less</i> IPOs this year compared to last year .  (Surprise) </span>Total proceeds raised in UDS are down 42.1% from last year.Let's take advantage of this poor market and buy Party City.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
