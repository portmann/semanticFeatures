class='textDiv'>Staples Can Survive Without Office Depot Staples Inc NASDAQSPLS Seeking Alpha Staples isnt ceding commercial business to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the way Office Depot has Stabilizing companywide sales suggests Staples is near a positive turning point The past two weeks have been to put it bluntly miserable for owners of Staples NASDAQ SPLS as well as Office Depot NASDAQ ODP Office Depot shares are now down following a judges agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that it mustnt be allowed to merge with rival Staples as it would likely lead to noncompetitive pricing Staples shares have fared only a bit better currently down since that badnewsbomb was dropped after the close on May th It was bad news for both as neither believes they can compete with Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN on their own See <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is wading deeper into office supply waters recently reporting its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Business ecommerce venue BB mostly facilitated billion worth of sales in its first year The two office supply outfits say if left unchecked the ecommerce giant could drive them both into the ground unable to compete with Amazons enterpriselevel pricing power and presence Of the two brick and mortar names however one may have been exaggerating the dire straits its in as long as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is around To be clear the line between the consumer customer and corporate customer is a blurry one for all three names <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Business is aimed at corporatescale buyers but theres little doubt smaller buyers have tapped the venue And vice versa corporate customers may be at least some items from Amazons consumer interface Ditto for Staples and Office Depot Both offer enterpriselevel services but certainly some corporate customers patron a store from time to time By and large though the enterpriselevel divisions of Office Depot and Staples are well defined and wellaccounted for Theyre so well accounted for in fact that each companys corporatecustomer division has a basic PL This is where things get interesting The two graphics below represent the commercial divisions for Staples and Office Depot One of them is not like the other Staples is growing its enterprise business albeit anemically while Office Depot is losing ground Dont let the relatively simple charts oversimplify the situation On the other hand charts dont lie The obvious explanation is also the correct one Staples is simply much better at corporate sales than Office Depot That doesnt mean it still wouldnt prefer to have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>out of the way though and it doesnt mean it couldnt leverage a partnership with Office Depot to keep <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Business at bay to the fullest extent possible Thats why Staples was the pursuer and Office Depot was the target as part of the proposed merger Staples ability to hold its own against the venerable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may also explain why SPLS shares werent hit as hard as ODP shares were As for the future its telling that Staples had responded to the news within hours laying out a threepronged plan to rekindle the stocks value in addition to maintaining its stockbuyback program Though still vague it clearly indicated the company had been constructing these plans before the merger was quelled Even if just fluff although there was substance to it Staples clearly planned ahead for all contingencies That in itself speaks volumes Office Depot offered up its contingency plan earlier this week though many shareholders may still be wondering exactly what it is beyond continuing to integrate with Office Max following their merger something the office supply retailer was doing anyway The company is mulling the sale of some European operations perhaps swapping them for other domestic acquisition targets and continuing to develop its smaller outlet store concept Of the two though Staples has the more palpable plan with a key focus being the development of the middlemarket where it may be able to outservice and even outprice <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Its admittedly tough to distinguish the two office supply retailers at this point in time in that both superficially appear to have crossed the fine line between undervalued and cheap for a reason moving into cheap for a reason territory Theyre not of the same ilk though ODP is cheap for a reason SPLS is indeed undervalued even if volatility is going to be par for the course for the foreseeable future Its got plenty of work to do to be sure and stores to close It will be ugly Its forwardlooking PE of though says the worstcase scenario is already baked in Last quarters sales fell again though the pace of decline is slowing These results demonstrate management kept its eye on the ball during the prolonged Office Depot merger review process which we believe positions Staples well to take market share from its dazed and confused primary rival Chukumbas premise is supported by more than a small handful of other clues not the least of which is its ability to maintain its commercial business even as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>become a direct competitor Staples may be worth a bargainhunting shot as a
