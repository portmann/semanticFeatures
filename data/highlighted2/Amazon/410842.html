( NASDAQ : SPLS ) | Seeking Alpha Staples is n't ceding commercial business to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> the way Office Depot has . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Stabilizing company-wide sales <b>suggests</b> Staples is near a positive turning point .  (Uncertainty) </span>The past two weeks have been, to put it bluntly, miserable for owners of Staples (NASDAQ: SPLS ) as well as Office Depot (NASDAQ: ODP ).Office Depot shares are now down 45% following a judge's agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that it mustn't be allowed to merge with rival Staples, as it would likely lead to non-competitive pricing.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Staples shares have fared only a bit <i>better</i> , currently down 22 % since that bad-news-bomb was dropped after the close on <b>May</b> 10th .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It was bad news for both , as neither <b>believes</b> they can compete with Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) on their own . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>See , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is wading <i>deeper</i> into office supply waters , recently reporting its <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Business e-commerce venue ( B2B , mostly ) facilitated $ 1 billion worth of sales in its first year . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The two office supply outfits say , if left unchecked , the e-commerce giant <b>could</b> drive them both into the ground , unable to compete with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's enterprise-level pricing power and presence . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of the two brick and mortar names , however , one <b>may</b> have been exaggerating the dire straits it 's in as long as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is around . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>To be clear, the line between the consumer customer and corporate customer is a blurry one for all three names.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Business is aimed at corporate-scale buyers , but there 's little <b>doubt</b> <i>smaller</i> buyers have tapped the venue . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And vice versa ... corporate customers <b>may</b> be at least some items from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's consumer interface . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Ditto for Staples and Office Depot.Both offer enterprise-level services, but certainly some corporate customers patron a store from time to time.By and large though, the enterprise-level divisions of Office Depot and Staples are well defined, and well-accounted for.They're so well accounted for, in fact, that each company's corporate-customer division has a basic P&L.This is where things get interesting.The two graphics below represent the commercial divisions for Staples and Office Depot.One of them is not like the other.Staples is growing its enterprise business, albeit anemically, while Office Depot is losing ground.Don't let the relatively simple charts oversimplify the situation.On the other hand, charts don't lie.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The obvious explanation is also the correct one -- Staples is simply much <i>better</i> at corporate sales than Office Depot .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That does n't mean it still would n't prefer to have <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> out of the way though , and it does n't mean it could n't leverage a partnership with Office Depot to keep <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Business at bay to the fullest extent <b>possible</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>That's why Staples was the pursuer and Office Depot was the target as part of the proposed "merger."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Staples ' ability to hold its own against the venerable <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>may</b> also explain why SPLS shares were n't hit as hard as ODP shares were . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>As for the future, it's telling that Staples had responded to the news within hours, laying out a three-pronged plan to rekindle the stock's value in addition to maintaining its stock-buyback program.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Though still <b>vague</b> , it clearly indicated the company had been constructing these plans before the merger was quelled .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even if just fluff ( although there was substance to it ) , Staples clearly planned ahead for all <b>contingencies</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>That in itself speaks volumes.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Office Depot offered up its contingency plan <i>earlier</i> this week , though many shareholders <b>may</b> still be <b>wondering</b> exactly what it is beyond continuing to integrate with Office Max following their 2013 merger ... something the office supply retailer was doing anyway .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The company is mulling the sale of some European operations , <b>perhaps</b> swapping them for other , domestic acquisition targets , and continuing to develop its <i>smaller</i> outlet store concept .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Of the two though , Staples has the <i>more</i> palpable plan , with a key focus being the development of the middle-market where it <b>may</b> be able to out-service and even out-price <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's admittedly tough to distinguish the two office supply retailers at this point in time , in that both superficially <b>appear</b> to have crossed the fine line between `` undervalued '' and `` cheap for a reason '' ( moving into `` cheap for a reason '' territory ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>They're not of the same ilk though.ODP is cheap for a reason.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>SPLS is indeed undervalued , even if <b>volatility</b> is going to be par for the course for the foreseeable future .  (Uncertainty) </span>It's got plenty of work to do to be sure, and stores to close .It will be ugly.Its forward-looking P/E of 8.7, though, says the worst-case scenario is already baked in.Last quarter's sales fell (again), though the pace of decline is slowing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>`` These results demonstrate management kept its eye on the ball during the prolonged Office Depot merger review process - which we believe positions Staples well to take market share from its dazed and <b>confused</b> primary rival . ''  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Chukumba 's premise is supported by <i>more</i> than a small handful of other clues , not the least of which is its ability to maintain its commercial business even as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> become a direct competitor . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Staples <b>may</b> be worth a bargain-hunting shot as a turnaround play .
