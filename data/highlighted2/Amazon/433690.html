class='textDiv'>Retail Stocks That Will Survive Amazons Dominance Into The Next Decade Seeking Alpha Even hardcore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>fans will concede that its growth will not lead to complete destruction of brickandmortar retail stores We look at the retail segments which can not only withstand the onslaught by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but have the ability to grow in the changing retail environment Amazoncom Inc NASDAQ AMZN has shown rapid growth in the North American market in the past In this market it has shown sales of over billion with a growth of yearoveryear in fiscal More importantly the penetration of its prime membership has increased at a rapid pace which stood at million at the end of Q showing a growth of in The membership currently stands at over for all households varying from over penetration in households with income from to for households with income over Fig Percentage penetration of prime membership according to household income in US Source Piper Jaffray A higher prime membership usage puts greater pressure on traditional retailers as more customers find it cheaper to use Amazons platform instead of going to the stores However there are still retail segments which will not only survive but grow in this new retail environment Investors can focus on these segments to achieve above market returns and to reduce the risk associated with the retail sector OffPrice retailers Companies like TJX NYSE TJX and Ross Stores NASDAQ ROST offer heavy discounts on national brands They have a treasure hunt theme where customers look for the best offers Both TJX and ROST have shown good comp sales figure in the recent past and have a global worldclass purchasing organization which should allow them to offer better value to customers than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is one of the main reasons traditional apparel retailers like Macys NYSE M and Kohls NYSE KSS showed poor quarterly results in the recent quarter But a good deal of their business also shifted to offprice retailers like TJX showing the strength of their business model in the current economic environment Between TJX and Ross stores TJX has overseas stores whereas Ross operates domestically only Hence short term Ross stores might be a beneficiary of a stronger US economy compared to TJX which can face currency headwinds Also Ross has a greater opportunity to reduce inventories and increase margins Warehouse stores This concept has shown strong growth in the past few years Costco Wholesale Corporation NASDAQ COST is the biggest warehouse retailer and has shown above average comp growth More importantly it has seen its membership grow at a good pace providing an additional revenue stream of over billion in the latest fiscal Fig membership revenue and number growth in the last few years This has allowed the stock to give better returns Due to bulk purchases and limited variety it is able to provide customers a much better value than it would be possible for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Costco has only about to Stock Keeping Units SKUs in an average store which help in increasing the efficiency of the business model and also leads to much higher sales per employee On the other hand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sells millions of products which require good coordination between different fulfillment centers and also increases the shipping costs for the company Costco also boasts of high customer membership renewal rate which is in America Unless there are some meteoric changes in the way shipping is handled by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Think seamless robotsdrone delivery etc <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will never take away the bulk purchases from Costco which should allow Costco to be a significant retail player into the next decade Dollar Stores Dollar stores like Dollar General NYSE DG and Dollar Tree NASDAQ DLTR have shown the strength of their business model by giving consecutive comp sales growth for the past several quarters Their main advantage over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is the proximity to customers and the lower average transaction size in the store The stores are much smaller than the average big box retailer which allows placing them near to customers It also helps in rapid expansion as the smaller retail space is readily available For example DG which has stores is planning on opening stores in fiscal and another stores in fiscal The comp sales growth square footage growth and margin expansion should help deliver EPS growth in teens for the next few years As these stores get a better footprint across the urban centers they will be in a much better position to meet the challenges of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and give better returns to longterm investors than their bigger counterparts like WMT and TGT Beauty and Jewelry retailers Due to the very nature of these products customers prefer a more personal service which cannot be duplicated by an online platform Beauty retailers like Sally Beauty Holdings NYSE SBH and Ulta Salon Cosmetics Fragrance NASDAQ ULTA should perform at a better rate as the disposable income increases in the hands of the customers The products sold by these retailers are not dependent on highly efficient supply chain but require a specific knowledge about products and the ability to suggest ideal products according to customer needs Again <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will not be able to provide personal selling services which companies like ULTA are famous for Luxury brands Retailers selling luxury products should also be insulated by any market share loss to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Few customers making a purchase of hundreds or thousands of dollars would shift to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>from retailers like Kate Spade NYSE KATE and Michael Kors NYSE KORS These retailers provide the requisite environment which cannot be simulated on online platform Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is taking its initial steps into luxury fashion it still has a lot of catching up to do Specialty products Companies operating specialty retail business also have a wide moat against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as the brand and sales are focused on special products instead of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>which sells a wide variety of products An ideal stock in this category is L Brands NYSE LB which focuses on womens intimate personal care and beauty products At the same time department stores like WalMart and Target are facing the biggest threat from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and would need heavy investments in technology and infrastructure which should negatively affect their earnings and price for the next few quarters Both the companies are trying to differentiate themselves on the basis of personal customer service They started curbside pickup to reduce the time customers spent in shopping However the negative effect of this includes higher expense on labor which is going to get more expensive due to minimum wage hike in certain states Target is already in the process of stopping this service by th of this month WalMart is also looking for home delivery by partnership with Uber Private UBER and Lyft Private LYFT but again these initiatives will not work due to unit economics and higher cost involved in providing these services <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>with its sales growth in America will keep on pushing the envelope in terms of convenience delivery time and membership benefits which should end up eating the market share of these big store companies Even at low PE of TGT and WMT these companies do not have longterm growth prospects which should keep investors away <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has given many retailers sleepless nights however it will not be able to take away market share from incumbents in all retail categories Certain brickandmortar retail segments will always exist as they have a particular unique selling point which is not possible to duplicate on the online platform The main retail categories which investors can focus for future growth are offprice warehouse beauty luxury products and specialty products retailers Departmental retailers like WalMart and Target will continue to face increasing pressure from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as it increases its depth in logistics and invests in lastmile delivery options Disclosure Iwe have
