(Surprise) </span>Only a few major players will still own fabs and they are likely to be Intel and Samsung.Intel does have additional lead in cutting-edge technology.This article evaluates the complex semiconductor industry from the perspective of the current structure, stage of evolution, industry forces and macro-environment factors.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Based on these insights of this global industry , the outlook over the next five years is then <b>predicted</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>The industry involves design and fabrication of semiconductor devices for diversified application markets.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Moore 's Law <b>predicts</b> that the industry will double the number of transistors per chip every two years - at the same unit cost .  (Uncertainty) </span>In contrast, cost has grown exponentially in recent years (see figure 1).<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Figure 1 : Cost of building a leading-edge semiconductor factory For this reason , this industry has been gravitating toward Asia and <i>more</i> importantly it evolved into a vertical specialization model to spread the cost and <b>risks</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>From an industry predominantly of integrated device manufacturers (IDM), namely fabless manufacturers which design and outsource the manufacturing, contract manufacturers (commonly known as foundries) and back-end processes (assembly and test services), some IDMs also offer foundry service.There are companies which specialize in creation, licensing and trading of design modules.This diverse representation is noted in the top six companies for the first half of 2015 : Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), Hynix ( OTC:HXSCF ) and Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) are IDMs, Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) a vertically integrated IC supplier, TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) a pure-play foundry, and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) a fabless company.The C4 value is tabulated to be 35.9%, which represents the percent of industry sales taken by the top four companies.The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), another measure of market concentration, is in the range of 500.These figures indicated a low market concentration.In general, it means this industry is not dominated by few players and there are great competition among firms.Traditionally, the semiconductor industry has a high cost of entry due to substantial capital requirements for new factories, upgrades of facilities and R&D.This has been mitigated with the fabless business model where a company specializes in design and outsources the manufacturing.Joint ventures and government support also lowered the barrier.Recently, China set up a national semiconductor industry investment fund which not only focuses on the fab and IC design companies, but also to stimulate industry merger and acquisition activity in and outside of China.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Larger</i> firms within the industry are another source of financial funding to encourage new entrants .  (Surprise) </span>For instance, Qualcomm committed to invest an aggregate of $40M into four Chinese companies and the China Walden Venture Investments fund.Exit is costly as assets are not easily convertible into a different industry unless through acquisition or licenses/patents sell-offs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Differentiation is <b>possible</b> at a product level via its functional value , even with a commoditized product .  (Uncertainty) </span>For example, a microprocessor unit is differentiated in its platforms or total solutions offered like IBM's (NYSE: IBM ) System-on-Chip (SoC) products which integrated its trademarked microprocessors.Companies also discern themselves with earnings from an intellectual property portfolio, with Qualcomm as the best example for its 3G/4G licenses.The industry does not have perfect knowledge.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although standard information is available in terms of product listing , specifications and price , most information remains <b>confidential</b> - e.g. actual cost , capacity utilization and technology road maps .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The demand forecast also is unpredictable especially for consumer electronics which have short life cycles and <b>dependent</b> on a <i>broader</i> economic situation .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Generally, the industry shares the same technology and production economics for the factory setup, equipments, standards and efficiency improvement methodologies.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If a company owns the IPs over processes and designs , similar and <i>better</i> products are still susceptible to replication by competitors via reverse engineering .  (Surprise) </span>The industry remains prone to price taking with pressure coming from consumers, competitors and excess capacity circumstances.A thriving semiconductor firm needs to discern itself with a first mover advantage or product differentiation.Moreover, electronic products commoditize over relatively short life cycles, hence only design and software capability can rescue businesses from failing.Therefore, the number of design companies increase while IDMs decrease.Industry profit is still rising based on the global semiconductor sales trend in figure 3.Hence, the industry is at a growth stage with symptoms of early maturity as outlined in subsequent paragraphs.China became the prime source of industry growth as substantiated by semiconductor consumption trends in figure 4 and figure 5.As extracted from an article , Asia Pacific is forecasted to be the fastest growing region with 60% of the total semiconductor market by 2016.Growing demand is fueled by technological development in smartphones, tablets and the automotive sector.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Demand growth in 2014 was particularly sparked by a drop in supply , especially the dynamic <b>random</b> access memory and data flash memory after players left this segment .  (Uncertainty) </span>Qimonda, Promos and Powerchip left while Micron acquired Elpida and Rexchip.In addition, some front-end fabs were converted from DRAM to logic, flash or other purposes.The industry is driven by product and process innovation, a characteristic of growth stage.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The emerging applications market - i.e. renewable energy/clean technology , Internet of Things , 5G and many <i>more</i> will renew a stage of growing adopters .  (Surprise) </span>Standardization will occur around dominant technology as what Qualcomm realized for 3G/4G/LTE development.Players drop out from the industry mainly due to consolidation by merger and acquisition (M&A) (see figure 6).Rate of new capacity addition also declined, as shown in figure 7: At the current stage of evolution, this industry has to address these factors in order to stay in the game - price, delivery, quality, cost efficiency, operational efficiency and effectiveness.In this path, structural changes are imminent - i.e. closure, retrenchment, M&A, JVs, alliances and business model changes.Technological innovation and functional value to clearly differentiate a product is crucial to win the game.The fact is that semiconductor chips are heavily commoditized.Hence, R&D is of utmost priority.Again, M&A and strategic alliances also enable rapid diffusion of knowledge.Advancing Moore's Law is another means to widen the gap (time lapse to replicate) from competitors, albeit that requires high investment cost to upgrade facilities.Intel has consistently topped other companies in its R&D expenditures and this is exactly how Intel maintains its dominance in terms of technology nodes.No substitutes coupled with an abundance of complements are reasons for the industry's perpetual growth.Semiconductors are essential in any end consumer application.A boom in any segment - i.e. smart cars, e-commerce/social media, gaming, etc. - causes leaps and bounds in demand for chips.For instance , hyper-scale technology companies need to build their own data centers , such as Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) , Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . These data centers are powered by server processors from Intel, networking chips from Broadcom (NASDAQ: BRCM ) and memory from Micron and Sandisk (NASDAQ: SNDK ).Rivalry is high within this fragmented market and is the key force in constraining profitability.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Design houses without the burden of manufacturing have a <i>lower</i> exit barrier , exacerbating the threat of competition .  (Surprise) </span>IDMs and foundries have high exit barriers but obtain high returns during economic boom times.Companies struggle to gain a competitive advantage where the key determinant is product differentiation.Buyers are price-sensitive and there is low switching costs unless involving proprietary differences, customized processes/designs or specific quality requirements (i.e. in the automotive segment).Currently, Samsung holds a technological edge over TSMC when it comes to the latest manufacturing process with shrinkage of transistors to 14 nanometers whereas TSMC only begun shipping its 16nm technology recently.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) and IBM were having trouble designing chips that <b>could</b> keep up with Apple 's ambitions for Macs and MacBooks , so Apple went with Intel .  (Uncertainty) </span>What truly distinguish a company effectively is cutting-edge technology.The threat of entrants is moderate.Brand identity is not important and the high capital requirement is mitigated by a fabless business model, alliances, private investment and government funding.Design houses, without the burden of manufacturing, can proliferate.Theoretically, large companies with positive cash flow should still hold some advantage in coping with a price reduction and invest during a downturn to be ready during recovery.However, this dilutes R&D funding to catch up with technological advancement and new market demands.Figure 9 clearly showed a diminishing number of large IDMs with shrinkage of the technology node.At 14nm and beyond, it is now left with Samsung and Intel.STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM ) has dropped out from this race of leading-edge technology and is now struggling with its restructuring strategies.In contrast, the success of economies of scale is exemplified by pure-play foundry TSMC.First key force identified is the strong pro-industry policy in Asia - i.e. Taiwan, China, Korea and Singapore.For instance, China established a new policy in 2014 relating to the development of the semiconductor industry with potential financial support up to $170 billion over the next five to ten years.The Chinese government also is pushing for state-owned and private enterprises to purchase from local system suppliers.Thereby, rivalry in the region heightened with the prospect of market growth and opportunities.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Lowered entrant barriers <b>might</b> displace incumbent global players .  (Uncertainty) </span>Global players have to review their strategies to assert their presence in Asia.If the U.S. remains dormant in its unattractive tax policies and incentives, a shift in region dominance to Asia Pacific is inevitable.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The second significant force from the social aspect is the rising income of developing countries , turning electronics goods <i>more</i> affordable .  (Surprise) </span>Emerging countries are catching up with technology adoption.Their lifestyle changes to a world of connectivity is fueling growth in ownership of mobile devices.This force drives the attractiveness of the industry by enlarging the market and profitability.Further, a customer's price sensitivity likely decreases as middle- to high-income group increases.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On the flipside , it does increase a buyer 's bargaining power as these customers become <i>more</i> knowledgeable .  (Surprise) </span>Again, this stresses the importance of product differentiation to entice both new and repeated purchases.Third, the rapid technology changes entail high R&D spending, for instance to cope with the rise of "big data" and "Internet of Things."This technological factor also plays a vital role in reshaping the industry structure.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>High R&D expenses deplete profitability with <b>risky</b> returns .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Hence , the fabless model is <i>more</i> advantageous than <i>larger</i> IDM companies to meet dynamic changes in market needs .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The entry barrier for the foundry business will widen due to the capital involved for cutting-edge manufacturing capabilities though they also bear <i>higher</i> <b>risk</b> due to the short life cycles of products .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Successful R&D and time-to-market are crucial factors to stay ahead of the competition.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>From the legal aspect , IP ownership becomes a <i>stronger</i> determinant to distance potential entrants .  (Surprise) </span>With the IP protection law in place, infringement claims are being used as a form of retaliation.It can be observed that the business model of IP licensing is promising and M&As in order to take over IPs become a means of survival.The perennial growth rate is unique to this industry and what makes this maturing industry attractive.The competitive forces led the semiconductor industry ecosystem to remap its business models where specialization thrives over vertical integration.Companies will increase their presence in Asia, attributed to the government's active role in developing the industry.The future challenge is to stay ahead of new demand in the industry (i.e. emerging applications markets of IoT, big data, etc.).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This requires capital expenses in R&D , resources , compressed time to market and a <b>variety</b> of new product introduction .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Therefore , the fabless model is in a <i>more</i> favorable position to excel since these companies are able to focus on their value proposition without the high burden of fixed cost .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But no <b>doubt</b> it 's a tough battlefield in this dynamic industry driven by innovation and adoption of end-users .  (Uncertainty) </span>The top 10 companies are dynamically shifting, ranking as M&A and strategic alliances become common strategies to rapidly adjust their portfolio (especially through IPs, know-how and talent acquisitions).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Existing IDMs will become <i>more</i> fab-lite or fabless or go bust .  (Surprise) </span>Only a few major players will own fabs to gain priority access to modern facilities and they are likely to be Intel and Samsung.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With the consolidation , standing IDMs will gain <i>more</i> market share as rivals turn to them for foundry services as well .  (Surprise) </span>Although it is noted from macro-environment analysis that a monopoly or oligopoly is unlikely to happen with active antitrust enforcement.Moreover governments are interested in protecting their local semiconductor industry.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Foundries will remain concentrated with the caveats of high capital and large complex facilities to handle a <b>variety</b> of technological requirements from a diversified customer base .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Henceforth , TSMC has bright prospects due to a <i>higher</i> entry for foundries and its increasing bargaining power as a supplier .  (Surprise) </span>Surviving companies will be agile in repositioning portfolios in lieu of declining sectors and expanding its investments beyond their core competency.For instance, MediaTek, the MStar ( OTC:MSTZF ) buy, puts it directly into the smart TV business.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> recently , NXP 's ( NASDAQ : NXPI ) acquisition of rival Freescale will add Freescale 's computing power to NXP security and wireless communication strengths in order to drive IoT .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> of such ventures will happen over the next 10 years - acquisitions , investments in innovative start-ups and IP/license managements .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It will not be <b>surprising</b> to see unorthodox downstream integration like Intel 's past acquisition of McAfee .  (Surprise) </span>With the changing nature of rivalry, this industry will face new challenges in a complex relationship management.For instance, your supplier becomes your rival and vice versa.IP infringement litigation cases will be common as well.Another challenge will be the shortage of highly skilled resources to turn around fast-changing demand in this industry.To sum up, cost leadership is no longer the determinant for success, rather it is driven by differentiation of value proposition.The fabless model will flourish.Here, Qualcomm has already established an edge with a strong base setup in China and for owning a huge patent portfolio.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The flipside is companies must still have the economies of scale to weather volatility since the chip market is <b>dependent</b> on the health of the global economy .  (Uncertainty) </span>Indeed, it is forecasted in this article that further consolidation of IDMs and foundries will occur."Competition based on operational effectiveness alone is mutually destructive, leading to wars of attrition that can be arrested only by limiting competition" (Michael Porter).The memory business consolidation enables profit making which will continue to bring revenues to Micron.Finally, giants like Intel, Samsung and TSMC will continue to thrive.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Editor 's Note : This article discusses one or <i>more</i> securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange .
