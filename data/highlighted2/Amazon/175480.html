These data centers are powered by server processors from Intel, networking chips from Broadcom (NASDAQ: BRCM ) and memory from Micron and Sandisk (NASDAQ: SNDK ).Rivalry is high within this fragmented market and is the key force in constraining profitability.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Design houses without the burden of manufacturing have a <i>lower</i> exit barrier , exacerbating the threat of competition .  (Surprise) </span>IDMs and foundries have high exit barriers but obtain high returns during economic boom times.Companies struggle to gain a competitive advantage where the key determinant is product differentiation.Buyers are price-sensitive and there is low switching costs unless involving proprietary differences, customized processes/designs or specific quality requirements (i.e. in the automotive segment).Currently, Samsung holds a technological edge over TSMC when it comes to the latest manufacturing process with shrinkage of transistors to 14 nanometers whereas TSMC only begun shipping its 16nm technology recently.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) and IBM were having trouble designing chips that <b>could</b> keep up with Apple 's ambitions for Macs and MacBooks , so Apple went with Intel .  (Uncertainty) </span>What truly distinguish a company effectively is cutting-edge technology.The threat of entrants is moderate.Brand identity is not important and the high capital requirement is mitigated by a fabless business model, alliances, private investment and government funding.Design houses, without the burden of manufacturing, can proliferate.Theoretically, large companies with positive cash flow should still hold some advantage in coping with a price reduction and invest during a downturn to be ready during recovery.However, this dilutes R&D funding to catch up with technological advancement and new market demands.Figure 9 clearly showed a diminishing number of large IDMs with shrinkage of the technology node.At 14nm and beyond, it is now left with Samsung and Intel.STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM ) has dropped out from this race of leading-edge technology and is now struggling with its restructuring strategies.In contrast, the success of economies of scale is exemplified by pure-play foundry TSMC.First key force identified is the strong pro-industry policy in Asia - i.e. Taiwan, China, Korea and Singapore.For instance, China established a new policy in 2014 relating to the development of the semiconductor industry with potential financial support up to $170 billion over the next five to ten years.The Chinese government also is pushing for state-owned and private enterprises to purchase from local system suppliers.Thereby, rivalry in the region heightened with the prospect of market growth and opportunities.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Lowered entrant barriers <b>might</b> displace incumbent global players .  (Uncertainty) </span>Global players have to review their strategies to assert their presence in Asia.If the U.S. remains dormant in its unattractive tax policies and incentives, a shift in region dominance to Asia Pacific is inevitable.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The second significant force from the social aspect is the rising income of developing countries , turning electronics goods <i>more</i> affordable .  (Surprise) </span>Emerging countries are catching up with technology adoption.Their lifestyle changes to a world of connectivity is fueling growth in ownership of mobile devices.This force drives the attractiveness of the industry by enlarging the market and profitability.Further, a customer's price sensitivity likely decreases as middle- to high-income group increases.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On the flipside , it does increase a buyer 's bargaining power as these customers become <i>more</i> knowledgeable .  (Surprise) </span>Again, this stresses the importance of product differentiation to entice both new and repeated purchases.Third, the rapid technology changes entail high R&D spending, for instance to cope with the rise of "big data" and "Internet of Things."This technological factor also plays a vital role in reshaping the industry structure.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>High R&D expenses deplete profitability with <b>risky</b> returns .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Hence , the fabless model is <i>more</i> advantageous than <i>larger</i> IDM companies to meet dynamic changes in market needs .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The entry barrier for the foundry business will widen due to the capital involved for cutting-edge manufacturing capabilities though they also bear <i>higher</i> <b>risk</b> due to the short life cycles of products .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Successful R&D and time-to-market are crucial factors to stay ahead of the competition.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>From the legal aspect , IP ownership becomes a <i>stronger</i> determinant to distance potential entrants .  (Surprise) </span>With the IP protection law in place, infringement claims are being used as a form of retaliation.It can be observed that the business model of IP licensing is promising and M&As in order to take over IPs become a means of survival.The perennial growth rate is unique to this industry and what makes this maturing industry attractive.The competitive forces led the semiconductor industry ecosystem to remap its business models where specialization thrives over vertical integration.Companies will increase their presence in Asia, attributed to the government's active role in developing the industry.The future challenge is to stay ahead of new demand in the industry (i.e. emerging applications markets of IoT, big data, etc.).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This requires capital expenses in R&D , resources , compressed time to market and a <b>variety</b> of new product introduction .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Therefore , the fabless model is in a <i>more</i> favorable position to excel since these companies are able to focus on their value proposition without the high burden of fixed cost .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But no <b>doubt</b> it 's a tough battlefield in this dynamic industry driven by innovation and adoption of end-users .  (Uncertainty) </span>The top 10 companies are dynamically shifting, ranking as M&A and strategic alliances become common strategies to rapidly adjust their portfolio (especially through IPs, know-how and talent acquisitions).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Existing IDMs will become <i>more</i> fab-lite or fabless or go bust .  (Surprise) </span>Only a few major players will own fabs to gain priority access to modern facilities and they are likely to be Intel and Samsung.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With the consolidation , standing IDMs will gain <i>more</i> market share as rivals turn to them for foundry services as well .  (Surprise) </span>Although it is noted from macro-environment analysis that a monopoly or oligopoly is unlikely to happen with active antitrust enforcement.Moreover governments are interested in protecting their local semiconductor industry.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Foundries will remain concentrated with the caveats of high capital and large complex facilities to handle a <b>variety</b> of technological requirements from a diversified customer base .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Henceforth , TSMC has bright prospects due to a <i>higher</i> entry for foundries and its increasing bargaining power as a supplier .  (Surprise) </span>Surviving companies will be agile in repositioning portfolios in lieu of declining sectors and expanding its investments beyond their core competency.For instance, MediaTek, the MStar ( OTC:MSTZF ) buy, puts it directly into the smart TV business.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> recently , NXP 's ( NASDAQ : NXPI ) acquisition of rival Freescale will add Freescale 's computing power to NXP security and wireless communication strengths in order to drive IoT .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> of such ventures will happen over the next 10 years - acquisitions , investments in innovative start-ups and IP/license managements .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It will not be <b>surprising</b> to see unorthodox downstream integration like Intel 's past acquisition of McAfee .  (Surprise) </span>With the changing nature of rivalry, this industry will face new challenges in a complex relationship management.For instance, your supplier becomes your rival and vice versa.IP infringement litigation cases will be common as well.Another challenge will be the shortage of highly skilled resources to turn around fast-changing demand in this industry.To sum up, cost leadership is no longer the determinant for success, rather it is driven by differentiation of value proposition.The fabless model will flourish.Here, Qualcomm has already established an edge with a strong base setup in China and for owning a huge patent portfolio.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The flipside is companies must still have the economies of scale to weather volatility since the chip market is <b>dependent</b> on the health of the global economy .  (Uncertainty) </span>Indeed, it is forecasted in this article that further consolidation of IDMs and foundries will occur."Competition based on operational effectiveness alone is mutually destructive, leading to wars of attrition that can be arrested only by limiting competition" (Michael Porter).The memory business consolidation enables profit making which will continue to bring revenues to Micron.Finally, giants like Intel, Samsung and TSMC will continue to thrive.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Editor 's Note : This article discusses one or <i>more</i> securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange .
