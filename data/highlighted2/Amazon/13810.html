launched its fashion section in October last year many called it a late entry in a market dominated by Flipkartowned Myntra and Jabong Three months down the line the American online retail giant has registered a percent growth in apparel sales and fashion has become one of its top three segments in India The ecommerce industry in India is expected to cross billion in the next four years with percent coming from fashion alone <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has chosen a longterm layered strategy to tap into the demand from online shoppers set to cross million by The company has tied up with the countrys premier fashion body the Fashion Design Council of India FDCI and launched a designer store on its platform as part of the strategy But can designer wear be successful in a medium that attracts many of its users because of discounts Vikas Purohit head of fashion at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>India tells India Insight that he foresees the countrys top designers creating products especially suited to online retail to tackle price considerations Below are excerpts from the interview Quotes have been lightly edited for clarity Q Why is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>tying up with FDCI and sponsoring its ongoing fashion week A For us this is not a commercial arrangement and its not a partnership for the fashion week We have done a larger partnership with the FDCI where we will be doing many more things together They mentioned that they are an NGO and their objective is to grow fashion and fashion designers in India and outside India We came from a point of view where we believe that today <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has to play a role of building a fashion ecosystem Q Like other retailers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a platform for the masses And arguably designers and fashion weeks cater to a certain class A The assumption is not correct that it is for the masses If you look at the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>India Fashion Week it is centered around prt and diffusion lines So this is a more accessible part of fashion We realized that the number of Indians searching for Indian designers on our platform was quite a lot We reached out to designers through FDCI and the discussion happened that You people are wanted everywhere Today you have just two stores one in Delhi and one in Mumbai and you are creating products only for those two stores But if they get access to PIN codes they said they will be very keen to create different products because they want to become brands That is one part of the problem which is getting solved There is a bigger part of the problem which is also getting solved Think of the umpteen number of new designers that get out of design schools in India Now with this initiative that we are doing with the FDCI we want to open up the floodgates any designer can come on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and build his store Whatever he sells he pays us a small commission on that You will see many more new names coming up because they will see success on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Q The top fashion designers are usually considered exclusivist Do you think the problem of access can be solved A Its not that these designers dont have the aspiration to grow big The problem was that they didnt have market knowledge which we are going to provide to them Its very expensive to reach out to so many markets in India Q Were some designers reluctant to go online A There was aversion to going online The aversion was the fact that ecommerce is a discountled phenomenon We are very clear about it We dont control pricing so you choose at what price you want to sell your products We will ensure we work with you to create a great experience for your product for your store Most of them were convinced that this is an exponential way to grow Q So will the price of clothes by designers be the same online and in physical stores A What I foresee happening is they will start creating products which are very different from what is available in their couture stores Product usually will be a very customized product That is what they will create for this medium something that is more scalable and commercial Its an assumption that over and above what they have designers will create new ranges for ecommerce and the customer Q What if they dont play to the rules of ecommerce and dont offer discountscheaper alternatives A If designers are hungry to succeed the supply and the demand will merge We have the patience and the longterm vision to wait out for years to let that happen Q What about private labels on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>India Q Will the collections at this years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fashion Week be up for grabs on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>website A Its up to the designers how many of them want to put it up and ensure that it gets launched on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>first And those discussions are happening and you will see the products on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>soon A normal assumption is that any designer who will showcase his range in future fashion weeks would love to launch those on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>itself Most of them are coming
