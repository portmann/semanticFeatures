LF Capital Management LF Capital clicks Dec PM ET About United Parcel Service Inc UPS Includes AMZN UBER by LF Capital Management The shares of UPS are richly valued but many argue this rich valuation

gig economybased delivery systems will steal local BC market share from UPS Evidence strongly suggests <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is fleshing out its own delivery system and the company appears to be pursuing multiple different routes to squeeze UPS out of its delivery process The shares of United Postal Service NYSE UPS are richly valued but many argue this rich valuation is indicative of bullish secular trends including increased ecommerce adoption and a wide economic moat that ensures longterm success We challenge this premonition arguing that there are multiple headwinds that challenge the secular growth of the business We believe companies like Uber Pending UBER and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN that are already using the sharing economy to disrupt the delivery market pose a particularly imminent threat to UPS secular growth While we do believe UPS will remain the most popular and widely used form of delivery over the next years we hold that independent retailer testing of personal delivery systems coupled with sharing economy growth will eat away some of UPS market share As such we hold that the current valuation is overstretched and does not consider these imminent threats We believe the longterm short thesis is strong here despite increased ecommerce adoption Uber now has a billion valuation making it more valuable than of SP companies and this valuation comes with reason The company has already disrupted the taxi monopoly nationally by tapping into the sharing economy Now with an extensive driver network in all major US cities in its back pocket Uber is attempting to tap into multiple other markets including food delivery UberEATS and package delivery UberRUSH The service has already launched in three cities San Francisco New York and Chicago UberRUSH allows for metro delivery from a business to its customer called BC using the driver network infrastructure Uber has already created A customer makes an order from a boutique shop across town an Uber driver or biker in NYC shows up at the boutique shop to fetch the package and then the Uber driver delivers the package to the customer It isnt terribly expensive per delivery and is very quick most reports online say delivery time is between minutes and hour UberRUSH is essentially equipping SMBs across the nation with a fleet of ondemand delivery drivers An SMB owner in the LA area is quoted in this article as having called the service a Godsent gift On the whole UberRUSH cannot compete with UPS on a national or international scale UPS has developed and continues to finetune a quasiinimitable network of flying and trucking packages across the United States This is the wide economic moat that investors are buying into UberRUSH does not have the intercity let alone interstate gig infrastructure to support deliveries of that distance and on that scale UberRUSH does though have the intrametro gig infrastructure from its staple Uber service to rival UPS in the sameday local metro delivery space While this is likely a small portion of UPS total business BC shipments both local and nonlocal represent of total US Domestic Package volume and grew last year due to increased ecommerce adoption Unequivocally some of this BC shipment volume and growth is from local BC shipments intracity and this is the portion of the UPS business which is at risk to the sharing economy Speed of delivery is UberRUSHs biggest attribute and as speed and convenience become more embedded into the consumers preference UberRUSHs instant delivery as the default could prove to be critical It feels much more forwardthinking and Millennialoriented than UPS local nextday residential shipments for merchants The service also allows customers to track their package en route and this is a neat feature that could prove a reason why merchants and customers select UberRUSH over UPS for local BC shipments For important goods it could prove comforting to both the merchant and customer that they get to track the good especially when being driven by a volunteer driver It also gives the customer a heightened sense of delivery timing which allows for greater flexibility on the customers side Not only could UberRUSH eat away some market share in the local BC space from UPS but a loss of metro residential delivery volume could result in contracted UPS margins If metro residential volume slips then rural residential volume grows as a percent of total revenue This a lowermargin business now having a greater effect on the total business and it could mean lower net margins Evidence strongly suggests that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is fleshing out its own delivery system and the company appears to be pursuing multiple different routes to squeeze UPS out of its delivery process The first is through simply squeezing out the UPS middleman used to transport goods between fulfillment centers and sortation centers The company recently purchased a fleet of thousands of Amazonbranded trailers to do exactly that The second is through replacing the UPS atdoor delivery driver with an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>driver <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has rolled out its own gig economybased delivery system <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Flex in select metro areas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Flex drivers deliver <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Now packages to customers It is sameday delivery with delivery times likely closer to hours and drivers make between and per hour a compelling rate Here is a YouTube video of how the app works on the driver side The third is through drone delivery While this is a much more speculative method of transportation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may have just added some tangibility to its drone delivery system The company recently announced <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Air a hour drone delivery system and it actually looks like this service could launch in the near future FAA authorized testing in March and the service was announced a few days ago so the timing makes sense for a nearterm launch We think it likely <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Air launches sometime in the first half of For reference here is the companys latest drone video On a large scale <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is attempting to keep more of its logistics and transportation inhouse because the companys scale is now at point where it makes financial sense to do so It needs to get a handle on shipping costs billion last year as they account for roughly of net product sales in a business that is erratically and scantily profitable Many analysts see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>fleshing out a fullfledged delivery system that will first be for its own use and then will be offered as a thirdparty service to other retailers Essentially some analysts say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could be trying to entirely replace UPS Forrester analyst Sucharita Mulpuru has said They are indeed trying to own more of their fulfillment logistics Its likely to improve their delivery economics their capacity particularly during peak times like the holidays and their timing for deliveries While Robert W Baird analyst Colin Sebastian has said Will we eventually see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>cargo planes moving goods from New York to San Francisco I would not be surprised This wouldnt be a new route for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>The company did the same thing with AWS first built for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and then offered for sale to others Regardless if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is trying to replace UPS it is unequivocally attempting to squeeze UPS out of its delivery infrastructure With the purchase of thousands of trailers the rollout of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Flex and the announcement of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Air the company is taking the right steps towards entirely ousting UPS in its delivery process Several UPS analysts are running around saying it is a buy because of secular headwinds in ecommerce adoption They are slapping abovemarket price targets on UPS and buy ratings on the stock This pumps up the stock price stretches the valuation and inflates the multiples This is okay if the company executes on the lofty analyst growth projections What happens to the UPS valuation if UberRUSH eats away the local BC market share and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>creates an entirely independent delivery system The stock is trading at a x PE while the market is trading at x earnings so the stock is valued more richly than the market Moreover UPS trades at x E earnings on a year EPS CAGR of This gives the stock a year forward PEG of The enterprise value multiples arent much more attractive At x EVSales and x EVEBITDA the stock seems priced to perfection The most alarming thing is the valuation relative to its book value The stock trades at x book value while the market trades at a x PB multiple This is because the company is subject to a highly leveraged balance sheet UPS only has billion in cash of marketcap and billion in debt giving the company net debt of billion It has a hugely negative net current asset value NCAV or current assets less total liabilities of billion and a small working capital amount of billion of debt In sum the stock is trading at a premium valuation that is inconsistent with imminent threats in the delivery space and has a highly leveraged balance sheet in a rising interest rate environment In order to better establish what looks like fair value to us we have run a quick year DCF on UPS using UFCFsFCFFs unlevered free cash flow or free cash flow to the firm We model for revenue CAGR into and for annualized growth in operating profits We model for capex as of revenues and DA as of capex both in line with historical data We assume changes in working capital add roughly million to cash flows per year Using CAPM we arrive a cost of equity Given the threat of UPS being squeezed out as the middleman however we hike our required rate of return to to account for this risk Taking into consideration debt and the cost of debt we arrive at a WACC of Applying a perpetuity rate to our FCFFs we arrive at an enterprise value of billion Taking out net debt of billion we arrive at an equity value of billion On MRQ weighted average diluted share count of million this equates to a fair value of per share All things considered we are not interested in UPS on the long side at a quote We are interested in a short position especially considering the threats from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Uber and growth in the sharing economy The stock stands almost above our fair value while facing the imminent threats of Uber snagging away local BC business and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>building out its own delivery infrastructure The current valuation does not consider these threats and this makes UPS a good short candidate Only of the float is short so the short thesis lacks substantial following and for a reason UPS is a staple of American delivery Its economic moat is wide and the cost to replicate the delivery infrastructure is almost too high for most retailers to tackle The sharing economy however has already largely upended the multibillion dollar taxi industry and the delivery industry seems to be the next target <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has the infrastructure in place with its fulfillment and sortation centers to flesh out a fullfledged delivery service The threat of UPS losing delivery market share to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Uber is very real At x earnings x book and x free cash flow the stock offers zero margin of safety even without these risks
