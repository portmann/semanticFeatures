None have totally committed to content streaming in the way NFLX has, but they will.When a studio produces movies or TV shows, it distributes them on DVD and streaming media.Anyone can buy DVDs and rent them out an infinite number of times.People still buy DVDs for their collections, and parents get lots of DVDs for kids.Studios make some money on DVDs.The studio can also license its content exclusively to one streaming provider.Because it is an exclusive deal, it will charge more for that content.For example, NFLX ponied up big bucks for Disney's movies.All other content is sold on a non-exclusive basis.So all streamers strike deals with the studio to exhibit their content.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If NFLX does n't have the content you want , you can rent it <b>somewhere</b> else on an a la carte basis , or subscribe to another service that does have it .  (Uncertainty) </span>Thus, there is very little that is special about NFLX as a streaming service.They have some exclusive licensed content.They produce some great original programming in an attempt to attract new subscribers and retain others, but it comes at enormous expense.Eventually, Netflix will run into cash flow problems.If it can't make certain content payments, it will re-negotiate those deals.Why would the studios do that?Because the studios want to bleed Netflix just down to where it is barely able to survive, so it can bleed it again and again.The studios will take lower prices on non-exclusive deals just to bank the revenue.NFLX has zero leverage.The studios don't need NFLX.They want it to live.They want it to raise capital, so they can bleed it again.But they don't need it.Just look at Disney.They made exclusive deals to license content to NFLX.If NFLX goes away, they can still offer both exclusive licenses, or license stuff on a non-exclusive basis.And you know what?There will always be buyers.Why?BECAUSE IT'S DISNEY CONTENT.And neither you nor I will care if NFLX lives or dies, because as long as we can get our content someplace, we will be happy.I own Disney stock for a reason.NFLX stock is the sucker's bet.Disney uses NFLX as its blood bank.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Why are investors so excited to throw in with the blood bank when they <b>could</b> be invested with the vampire ?  (Uncertainty) </span>If you've got the stomach, short NFLX.It's ultimate value will be determined by its ability to make good on content payments that retain subscribers.If international streaming becomes as profitable as domestic (a long way off) and domestic eventually nets $500 million in net profit, that's $1 billion in total profit, but without any growth.Give it a 5x value, and it's a $5 billion company...90% below today's valuation.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
