browser settings or contact your network administrator After all these years of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime being around most of us know that a major perk of the subscription service is free expedited shipping But it looks like Amazons focus on getting packages to Prime customers has resulted in slower deliveries for shoppers who didnt ante up year for Prime This is according to online retail analysts at StellaService who recently told Forbes that Amazons regular shipping is starting to slip There are companies on our list and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has always been in the top explains Kevon Hills VP of research for StellaService This year weve seen them fall outside of the top which is the first time weve seen that happen Since Prime customers are not only paying for the guaranteed delivery dates but also tend to be more regular and loyal customers of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>it would seem to make sense that the company is going to great lengths to keep those shoppers happy But is it happening at the expense of the millions of casual <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>customers I think the focus for them has shifted from standard shipping to being fast and making sure they deliver on that promise for Prime Hills tells Forbes who notes that a number of other online retailers have made significant improvements to their shipping another reason <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has dropped down the list The industry is getting faster and weve seen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>fall off a little bit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Expands OneHour Delivery Service To Baltimore Miami <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Introduces Free Shipping On Some Small Items For All Customers Their standard shipping has gotten a bit slow generally when you order an item it takes at least business days before it leaves the warehouse and then another days for the delivery company to get it to you In he past items used to get a tracking number within a day along with an initial scan I think it may be due to their order system To better visualize it imagine a grocery store with checkout lanes but only cashier Lane is for premium customers and Lane is for the non premium customers If both lanes have people waiting then the cashier will ignore lane until lane is empty and then go back to servicing lane stopping whenever a premium customer joins lane In my case I ordered a pack of eneloop rechargeable batteries on a Monday got a tracking number really early in the morning on Thursday and got them in the mail on the following Monday At the same time I ordered a V AC adapter from chinaand the ems shipping service provided a tracking number and it arrived on the same day USPS While I understand that amazon needs to offer fast service to justify the prime cost they also need to ensure that standard shipments do not suffer too many delays eg if the item has not left the warehouse within hours of the order then drop it into the amazon prime priority status to ensure that standard orders can at least get a sub hour processing time Im not all that impressed with their Prime shipping lately I typically order something from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>every week and nary a month goes by when at least one prime order isnt a day or more late The products they ship via USPS or via FedEx or UPS but hand off to the postoffice for final delivery seem to be most likely to arrive late Its frankly amazing to me that they pretend this convoluted process is worthy of the phrase guaranteed to arrive by or appropriate for customers paying an extra a year A major issue is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>provides no means by which the customer can choose which delivery service they prefer even if they are willing to pay extra You have no idea which carrier they will use until after youve placed your order and receive an email that your order has been shipped So if you know UPS or another carrier has been unreliable in serving your house or your neighborhood its a crap shoot as to whether youll be stuck with that carrier Contrast Amazons policy with that of other online merchants such as BHPhoto which often gives you or different delivery choices from different carriers Mazda Recalls Stops Sales Of CX Vehicles Over Fuel Leak Concerns
