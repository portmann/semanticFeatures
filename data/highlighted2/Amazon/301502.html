it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Vicor provides a novel power saving architecture for Intel processors Vicors solution helps Intel in its battle against the lowpower ARM processor Vicor NASDAQ VICR is providing solutions that help Intel NASDAQ INTC compete against ARM in the battle for data center processors The issue facing Intel is the perception that ARM chips use less power Vicor provides an efficient power train that supplies power to the Intel processors that are used in the data center This power train reduces the total amount of energy used in a server The stakes are huge for Intel as Intel has of the data centers shipment share and of the revenue The manufacturers of ARM chips and systems are doing everything they can to get a piece of that business ARM was successful in the mobile market because of their low energy use Vendors are now trying to take that same concept to provide a lower power chip to compete with Intel in the data center Andrew Feldman corporate VP of AMD NASDAQ AMD said the energysipping ARM design is the architecture of the future At the Open Compute Summit in January he said By ARM will command of the server market and custom ARM CPUs will be the norm for megadatacenters such as those used by Facebook Microsoft Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>And ARM expects a market share by ARM vendors are looking at other solutions to reduce power including pairing an ARM processor with a FPGA So Intel bought Altera to bring FPGA technology into their server chips This battle for lower power has created a unique opportunity for Vicor and they are expecting a significant increase in revenue and earnings as a result of providing power train solutions for the Intel processors that are used in the data center Vicors novel Factorized Power Architecture helps Intel based servers use less electricity When looking at power usage one should look at the complete power train Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL states that up to of incoming Data Center electricity can be lost to transformation and distribution Google also claims that you can minimize power distribution losses by eliminating as many power conversions steps as possible One of the ways that Vicor saves power is by eliminating a voltage conversion step by providing a volt to processor soultion This architecture eliminates an intermediate conversion of volts to volts and then volts to the sub volt processor Intel has Voltage Regulation specifications that must be adhered to in order to power their processors The VR is Intels specification for the Haskell processor and the VR is the newer specification for the Skylake processor Vicor has delivered solutions for the VR processors and has VR solutions that are waiting on Intel to deliver production Skylake chips for servers Several years ago Vicor had zero revenue from the data center market This changed when Vicor supplied their CHIP and SIP solution for the Intel Haskell server processor with the Vicor VR solution Vicors VI Chip revenue experienced a jump as a result of this win but the results have been very lumpy due to a single data center customer Vicor had peak VI Chip and Picor sales of in Q This peak was the result of their data center customer accelerating their deliveries into the st quarter at the expense of the nd and rd quarter Vicors trough was last quarter at Vicors average quarterly revenue for FY was Now Vicor has design wins from at least two additional data center customers for their Intel Skylake VR solution as I noted in this Seeking Alpha Article As a result Vicor expects bookings to accelerate in the nd quarter of this year with an increase in revenue in the rd quarter These design wins along with others in the communications automobile Super Computer and highend server markets will provide Vicor a diverse customer base that will lead to less volatile revenue and will enable substantial incremental growth for the foreseeable future Intel is very interested in Vicor as they are helping Intel by providing very efficient power solutions for their server chips Intel needs every arrow in its quiver and will do whatever it takes to shore up its dominance This bodes very well for Vicor as Intel embraces and recommends their energy saving solutions Vicor expects to diversify its customer base in the second half of this year This will even out the wild revenue swings and lead to long term sustained growth Because of the explosive growth expected from their new products Vicor has a plan to triple its revenue in years While the time table for this plan has slipped it is still intact In December the CEO purchased additional shares between to That is well above the current price of a share I continue to rate Vicor as a strong buy I rate Intel as a buy as they will dominate the data center for years to come Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
