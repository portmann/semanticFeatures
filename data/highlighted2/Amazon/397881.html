class='textDiv'>Warren Buffett On Hyperactivity Berkshire Hathaway Inc NYSEBRKA Seeking Alpha We attended the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting and almost every topic was connected to hyperactivity We came away with some thoughts that are somewhat contrarian including some of his views we found disappointing If Buffett doesnt believe in some companies we believe he should sell them to someone who does and redeploy the capital elsewhere Longterm readers are familiar with our ownership of Berkshire Hathaway NYSE BRKA NYSE BRKB shares as well as our undying respect for Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger They have few peers among the best stock pickers and capital allocators in US history as measured by the returns on Berkshire Hathaway over the last years On April faithful shareholders gathered as Mr Buffett and Mr Munger shared copious and wise advice at the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting Ironically almost every topic was connected to hyperactivity We attended the meeting and came away with some thoughts that are somewhat contrarian including some of his views we found disappointing During the meeting Buffett explained in detail how expenses are the enemy of your investment portfolio He used the eightyear results of a bet he made where he pitted a lowcost SP Index against a multilayered list of top hedge funds It showed that the high expense levels overwhelmed the aggregate investment selections of the hedge fund managers after including their annual fee of and then taking of the profits The deficit they achieved was greatly impacted by the results of the hidden cost of trading in the individual hedge funds something that longterm readers know we have argued are as damaging to most money managers as annual fees Munger called Valeant Pharmaceuticals NYSE VRX business model a sewer He and Buffett had warned that using borrowed money to acquire healthcare companies hyperactively and then stripping their research and development budgets was a shortterm momentum favorite and a longterm loser Munger described the severe price increases as immoral Buffett added fuel to the conversation by calling them chain letter companies We think of it more as bigger fool theory You need a bigger fool to come after you to perpetuate the excitement Valeant ran out of buyout candidates to continue their pyramid scheme In the past Buffett has explained chain letter companies and other manias as being like Cinderella saying At midnight it all turns to pumpkins and mice Many high pricetoearnings favorites look like chain letter stocks to us when so much of the wealth that gets created is in stock price appreciation and appears disconnected from the profits of the business One blogger of the meeting said this Warren Buffett couldnt care less about those who have struck it rich in the frenzy of IPO activity in recent years Staying true to his oftcited advice for the average investor seeking longterm growth Buffett gave the verbal equivalent of an eye roll to anyone who tries to game the market Buffett stated that the unusually large position that the Sequoia Fund took in Valeant was a mistake and says that the business model of Valeant was enormously flawed Both Buffett and Munger shared that from their long experience in business they can spot patterns that frequently lead to bad outcomes and Valeant displayed those patterns and trends We would argue that those investors who seek a high margin of safety must avoid all of these kinds of investments even the ones which have worked so far like Tesla NASDAQ TSLA and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Buffett explained that poor underwriting results in the first quarter came from hyperactive hailstorms and dramatically higher than usual auto collision numbers nationwide He also explained how hyperactive competition in reinsurance caused him to sell Munich RE and Swiss RE He went on to show how enormously the overall Berkshire insurance business has grown in the last years and how erratic it has been from year to year To us it looks like a good example of where one may feel compelled to move hyperactively in and out of Berkshire Hathaway only to miss out on the real wealth creation A question came up concerning stock buy backs on Berkshire Hathaway shares The company has stated it is willing to buy back shares at times book value or lower Munger reminded everyone that hyperactive stock buyback programs unrelated to price considerations are unhelpful to shareholders Buffett only favors buys below intrinsic value which are theoretically useful to shareholders Buffett explained how difficult the packaged food business is getting According to ValueWalk The most interesting part of the answer was not specifically about how G operates but Buffetts quip that the volume trends in the package goods industry are not looking particularly strong To us this says something about confidence being placed in a wide variety of staple companies in the SP The chart below tells the story Source Merrill Lynch report March What Investors Want We believe there has been hyperactivity among investors chasing dividend stocks and paying high pricetoearnings multiples among staple industrial energy and other companies to get at those dividends Hyperactive Affection for Hyperactive Revenue Growth While Buffett and Munger warned investors about being envious of winning IPO investors and other tech darlings investments Munger called lottery winners they venerated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and heaped praise on their CEO Jeff Bezos Buffett described a reverence for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>despite the negative effects that has had on anyone in retailing He also complimented what he called pull marketing as practiced via <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime memberships We dont disagree with Buffett and Munger that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been amazing in its revenue growth market share and billion of annual sales but we are shocked that they made no mention of the pricetoearnings ratio of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and the fact that they have been one of Mungers lottery winners We remember Buffett and Munger telling us in shareholder letters and at prior annual meetings about what makes a business great They said A great company CEO goes to a mirror and says Mirror mirror on the wall should I raise my prices this fall The mirror replies Why wait <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>seems to only cut prices and the cost of delivery to gain market share and requires investors to believe in a sales growth story tied to a rising stock price Even the annual fees from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime get burned up in the cost of delivery <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is happy to report that Prime members buy way more stuff on way more occasions than they did before becoming a member As Buffett extolled it gets you huge market share and makes life miserable for anyone who competes with them In our case Nordstrom NYSE JWN and eBay NASDAQ EBAY have been negatively impacted by the momentum Bezos has created Our concern is that respect for manager genius is closely tied to stock price increases not profits Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Tim Cook were much more respected a year ago at per share than they were at on May In years past even Buffett and Munger were excited about the CEO at BYD a Berkshire holding that makes electric car engines in China They were noticeably silent on that subject this year Buffett and Munger described that they had people come hyperactively to sell them on investing in Valeant based on the genius of their CEO Michael Pearson He was adored by many highlythoughtof value investors and was a rock star when Valeants stock rose to over per share in Let it be said that we at Smead Capital Management want to avoid ascribing higher and higher intelligence to CEOs based on stock price performance If anything pride goeth before a fall Buffett seems to be afraid to confront hyperactive populist politicians on their ridiculous regulatory witch hunt with banks like Bank of America NYSE BAC and Wells Fargo NYSE WFC The Berkshire boys kind of mumbled something to the effect that these banks dont have as good of a business as they used to Did he and Munger mention what it would mean if the politicians found a new whipping boy Or did they explain what normalized economic growth and higher interest rates would do to bank earnings The answer was no Buffett and Munger also seem very hesitant to sing the praises of portfolio holdings like IBM NYSE IBM American Express NYSE AXP Bank of America and CocaCola NYSE KO All he said was these businesses arent as great as they used to be If Buffett doesnt believe in these companies we believe he should sell them to someone who does and redeploy the capital elsewhere If he believes that time will be the friend of these former stalwarts he should point out what it will look like when finicky investors could chase them higher if and when they produce better results in the future We think he believes they will be good investments and think he should cheerlead those
