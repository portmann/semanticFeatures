(Amazon: Surprise) </span>As Buffett extolled, it gets you huge market share and makes life miserable for anyone who competes with them.In our case, Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN ) and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ) have been negatively impacted by the momentum Bezos has created.Our concern is that respect for manager genius is closely tied to stock price increases, not profits.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) and Tim Cook were much <i>more</i> respected a year ago at $ 140 per share than they were at $ 93 on <b>May</b> 2 , 2016 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In years past, even Buffett and Munger were excited about the CEO at BYD, a Berkshire holding that makes electric car engines in China.They were noticeably silent on that subject this year.Buffett and Munger described that they had people come hyperactively to sell them on investing in Valeant based on the genius of their CEO, Michael Pearson.He was adored by many highly-thought-of value investors and was a rock star when Valeant's stock rose to over $200 per share in 2015.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Let it be said , that we at Smead Capital Management want to avoid ascribing <i>higher</i> and <i>higher</i> intelligence to CEOs based on stock price performance .  (Surprise) </span>If anything, "pride goeth before a fall."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Buffett seems to be <b>afraid</b> to confront hyperactive populist politicians on their ridiculous regulatory witch hunt with banks like Bank of America ( NYSE : BAC ) and Wells Fargo ( NYSE : WFC ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>The Berkshire boys kind of mumbled something to the effect that these banks don't have as good of a business as they used to.Did he and Munger mention what it would mean if the politicians found a new whipping boy?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Or did they explain what normalized economic growth and <i>higher</i> interest rates would do to bank earnings ?  (Surprise) </span>The answer was no.Buffett and Munger also seem very hesitant to sing the praises of portfolio holdings like IBM (NYSE: IBM ), American Express (NYSE: AXP ), Bank of America and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ).All he said was, "these businesses aren't as great as they used to be."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Buffett does n't <b>believe</b> in these companies , we <b>believe</b> he should sell them to someone who does and redeploy the capital elsewhere .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If he believes that time will be the friend of these former stalwarts , he should point out what it will look like when finicky investors <b>could</b> chase them <i>higher</i> if and when they produce <i>better</i> results in the future .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We think he <b>believes</b> they will be good investments and think he should cheerlead those like he does Geico , Mid-American Energy and the other private holdings .
