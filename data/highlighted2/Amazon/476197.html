device including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fire Tablets download the Hay Day app for free and get <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>appstore credit I have no idea what the game is about but if the credit is indeed only for apps then I can buy an educational app for my preschooler We like the Endless series by Originator and Endless Alphabet is free with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Underground For a limited time customers who download Hay Day from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Appstore between

from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Appstore are eligible for this offer Update This is showing up for me as a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>credit

to hours for you to receive an email confirming that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>credit has been applied to your account As of this day the credit also appears to be limited to App Store purchases as well Hay Day is actually kind of fun was one of the first apps I downloaded on my iPad and I still play it years later So how do I verify I have received the credit The app is downloaded installed and run once But no email confirmation no change in the balance listed at my MP GC check page Try this Add anything to your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>cart now and it should show a off promo credit I just bought some enzymatic dental treats for my dogs I have updated the original post For me it showed up as a promo credit on my next purchase of anything shipped and sold by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Im not getting a promo credit at least not on normal things from shippedsold by amazon It shows my promo from prime day but not this one Are you sure you didnt have another credit left in your account They just added a note about waiting hours to their terms and conditions No I had just ordered something right before I saw this and had used up all my other credits Per below my credit and others now appear to be app store only no credit towards amazon products or other digital content Seems like you caught a lucky bug Me either credit didnt show up Im going to give it a day or two and ill see if it shows up if not ill be contacting amazons customer service lol I actually emailed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>after I downloaded the game and asked them where I would find the credit They said they would make sure my credit was issued ok so i just read on the amazon store page that it may take up to hrs to receive an email confirming the app download and the credit Worked for me To see if it worked I added toilet paper and a credit showed up right away Thanks Jonathan I bought the app downloaded installed and played it NO sign of any credit Tried putting something in my cart and going to checkout nothing Checked my digital credit balance and its not there either However the full details of the promotion say For a limited time customers who download Hay Day from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Appstore between August and August will receive a credit toward purchase of digital content in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Appstore Only customers who have not previously downloaded Hay Day from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Appstore are eligible for this offer Please note it may take up to hours for you to receive an email confirming that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>credit has been applied to your account Download Hay Day on one of your compatible devices to receive your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Appstore credit by clicking below So this can take days to get the email Im assuming then that it can take days to get the credit Yes the hour bit was added recently it wasnt there when I first posted about this I never got any email but I did get the credit and used it already so Id recommend trying the shopping cart method after waiting hours Thank you for your download of Hay Day from the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Appstore Your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Appstore credit has been added to your account and will expire in days This credit is usable towards your next purchase of an app game or inapp purchase sold by Amazoncom I do NOT see a credit in my cart when trying to buy an item that is not an app The credit does not show up when I look at my digital credits httpamzntompbalance However I bought an app that Ive wanted for and I can see the credit in the invoice and the cost is So it does work but I cant see the digital app credit anywhere until after blindly buying an app I received an email stating Thank you for your download of Hay Day from the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Appstore Your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Appstore credit has been added to your account and will expire in days This credit is usable towards your next purchase of an app game or inapp purchase sold by Amazoncom Ive tried putting things in my cart sold by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and no credit shows Maybe it will only work for me if I buy an app game or inapp thing but nothing there appeals to me Agreed The credit seems to be now really only for app purchases doesnt show up before purchase and for the most part thats not really useful due to the light number of good paid apps on the app store I wouldnt trust making any major app purchases through a third party app store anyways even amazons Id rather get it from google play and know I wont have issues in the future They should make it like googles credits where at least you can also use them on video music and books The promo says credit toward purchase of digital content in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Appstore Thats pretty specific that the credit is just for the app store So apps only was the intention and how its working httpswwwamazoncomgpsigninhtmlrefmas_gc_siieUTFnodepathFmobileappsFbshowGCuseRedirectOnSuccess I had a digital credit from slow shipping I got the promo credit for Hay Day and then I spent on a game SO Ive got left of the promo credit THe link above is showing for me Notify me of followup comments by email Next Early Retirement Portfolio Asset Allocation MidYear Update Im Jonathan and Ive been
