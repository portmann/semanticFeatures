( INTC ) | By : Eric Jhonsa , SA Eye on Tech , SA News Editor Intel ( NASDAQ : INTC ) is buying Itseez , a Russian developer of computer vision algorithms and related technology for embedded systems .  (Uncertainty) </span>Terms are undisclosed.Intel: "This acquisition furthers Intel�s efforts to win in IoT market segments like automotive and video, where the ability to electronically perceive and understand images paves the way for innovation and opportunity.Itseez will become a key ingredient for Intel�s Internet of Things Group (IOTG) roadmap, and will help Intel�s customers create innovative deep-learning-based CV applications like autonomous driving, digital security and surveillance, and industrial inspection."<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The acquisition comes <i>less</i> than two months after Intel bought Yogitech , an Italian provider of functional safety solutions for chips - they help prevent chips within cars , industrial equipment , and other embedded systems from failing , and alert users in the event that they do .  (Surprise) </span>Last year, video processor developer Ambarella bought VisLab , an Italian developer of computer vision and intelligent control systems for cars and other products.Mobileye is currently the top provider of vision processors for the advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) market.NXP and Nvidia are also eying the market.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Earlier</i> : Intel abandons effort to sell VC portfolio assets Intel has a solution looking for problem , where as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Google identify problems first then looking for solution . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The value is not in problem solving, but solving the right problems.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The folks who know the problem to solve would get to the solution <i>faster</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Intel is lost in the post PC era.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b>Surprisingly</b> Microsoft looks to be much <i>better</i> positioned to survive the collapse of the PC market / wintel era .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Intel <b>appears</b> <i>more</i> & <i>more</i> vulnerable each day trying to put a strategy together .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>How can a company of its size be so short sighted is beyond my comprehension.I always had the impression that post PC era is the Data Center.What did you had in your small mind?Connecting devices to the web actually is a very powerful tool.Who wouldn't want to be able to turn off the stove or coffee maker that had been inadvertently left on while headed to work?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Or set the teenaged son 's <b>alarm</b> clock .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> unlocking a door of a house to let someone in when physically being present is difficult or impractical .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Perhaps being guided to an <b>optimal</b> parking spot .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> being notified when someone enters a particular area or notification of a physician when the blood pressure reading is excessive .  (Uncertainty) </span>IoT has very substantial potential to seriously reduce traffic gridlock.Turning off a washer if a leak is detected would also be a very desirable function.Security is the real issue.And if Intel can build a secure IoT chip, getting it to the market before anyone else, they still can enjoy a very lucrative business.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>IoT chips will go into far <i>more</i> than computers and smartphones .  (Surprise) </span>Every device, appliance, monitor and machine would be a candidate for such a chip including every household outlet and light switch.The chips are already here and secure.Now the fight is who has the best platform to serve the segment from A to Z. <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Google , Apple ... Are the system integrators trying to solve the problem end to end . They are the solution providers.These folks do not necessary use Intel chips.Intel try to see chips, it is IC chip centric rather than creating the whole ecosystem.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At the end of the day they <b>may</b> end up like what they end up in mobile .  (Uncertainty) </span>@Irrerational.Those 3 companies are lagging the hardware implementation knowledge as well, none of them have any clue of security.@Irrerational.Apple is not interested in building chips for IoT.They are interested in mobile computing platforms and likely an electric vehicle.Google builds TPUs which aren't useful in IoT and Google has not shown any interest in selling them either.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does not produce chips . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Samsung <b>might</b> produce its own IoT chips for their own appliances and televisions .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>LG <b>seems</b> to want to get into the chip business .  (Uncertainty) </span>But outside of those few companies, the market is wide open.Leviton, GE, Agilent, Whirlpool, Philips, Chamberlain and the list goes on and on regarding the lite companies who would benefit from integrating IoT chips into their products.The potential market is huge.What Intel has is the old semiconductor mind set.Look at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> echo and e-reader , apple IPhone and iwatch , fitbit . Google will go into anything that helps them in search revenue.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>These companies are <i>closer</i> to the end user .  (Surprise) </span>Nowadays, ICs by itself is not enough, you need tight integration between hardware and software.In fact the number of software engineers in many projects out number the number of hardware engineers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These are not IC companies , but <b>could</b> get their chips design if it suits them .  (Uncertainty) </span>GE , Leviton ... , these are the old classics who charge a premium on what ever they see is smart , but <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will provide the buttons to order supplies free . I wanted Intel to succeed, and has been waiting for too long and giving up on them.I recently bought a cloud storage device built with Intel chips that supports 4K, it is real slow and the software is unstable.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>My few years old PC with an NVDA graphics card is still much <i>better</i> .  (Surprise) </span>I have multiple examples of half bake products using Intel chips that got me no where.@Irrera.Can you please, provide me with the name of that "cloud storage device"?"I have multiple examples of half bake products using Intel chips that got me no where."Also can you please reveal which they are?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>ETF Screener : Search and filter by asset class , strategy , theme , performance , yield , and much <i>more</i> ETF Performance : View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes  (Surprise) </span></div></body></html>
