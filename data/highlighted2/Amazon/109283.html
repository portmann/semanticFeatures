( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has debuted dedicated mobile apps for its Cloud Drive . This is a big deal, and I think it can be a very big deal because of who and what weâ€™re talking about.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , at least I <b>believe</b> , is n't getting into the cloud storage business to offer cloud storage ; cloud storage is simply a user acquisition strategy . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>That said , where I really think <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is going with this is into app aggregation . I think the first one of the mega-tech companies or even the first cloud storage company to accomplish this moves ahead of the pack in a big, big way.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) had debuted dedicated mobile apps for its Cloud Drive as first reported by TechCrunch . This is a big deal, and I think it can be a very big deal because of who and what we're talking about.I'll explain.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> the Cloud Storage niche is a complete commodity .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Box ( NYSE : BOX ) is working hard to change its positioning under this storm cloud <b>assumption</b> with recent integrations , most notably with IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) , but overall I view the niche as a commodity .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> with the niche being a commodity that it is actively and will continue to be in a race to zero .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has actually greatly furthered that race to zero with its superbly low pricing of its skeletal service offering . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> currently prices Cloud Drive at $ 60/year under its Unlimited Everything plan . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Unlimited Photos plan prices even <i>lower</i> at a shockingly low $ 11.99 / year . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>For this particular service , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has no storage limit and now has a dedicated mobile app - Cloud Drive Photos . Outside of borderline negligible security offerings, integrations (although I'm reserving judgment of Box's integration with IBM as noted above), and price, these cloud offerings have zero differentiation.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The only way to aggregate users is to tether the storage to a <i>broader</i> platform , outspend from an S&M standpoint , or offer <i>cheaper</i> services .  (Surprise) </span>Differentiation is an issue in this niche and perpetuates the commoditization.With that out of the way , let 's talk about what I think <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is doing here in the early going . I should start by saying what a throwback <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's mobile apps are . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The below images have been provided courtesy of TechCrunch : But <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , like Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) , has this brilliant way of testing before doing - which <b>seems</b> like an obvious thing to do in tech , but still does n't get done all that often . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , at least I <b>believe</b> , is n't getting into the cloud storage business to offer cloud storage . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's getting into the business as an ancillary for its other , <i>more</i> monetizable , longer-term viability driving services .  (Surprise) </span>Cloud storage is simply a user acquisition strategy; a "try me" sign that isn't threatening and offers an existing familiarity.I think what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is doing is rolling out its dedicated apps in the way it is , skeletal and minimalist , to not be overwhelming . If you 've ever used <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's music services , you know how things can get overwhelming in a hurry , especially , if you 're coming from an alternative ecosystem . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> wanted to present a very basic , very easy to attach to interface that 's open about its limited use cases . For instance, you can't edit documents, upload from mobile, auto sync, etc.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think this is a low-risk , high-reward traction and usage test that if it proves out will show <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> expanding on the current app capacity and capability . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The apps just do n't make sense <i>longer</i> term as-is .  (Surprise) </span>That said , where I really think <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is going with this is into app aggregation . I mean, think about it.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's platform has been growing ever <i>more</i> all-inclusive - allowing a user to become fully immersed in the ecosystem . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>You can do everything from under the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> umbrella and within the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> bubble , including `` real world '' / non-digital actions . You can grocery shop, take delivery, listen to music, watch movies, and store digital content.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Just about `` the works , '' which is again why the apps do n't make sense as-is and why I <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> app aggregates as its way to differentiate . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I wrote an article a while back about app aggregation , which I <b>believe</b> is the next big thing in tech and which I <b>believe</b> is the next big expectation from user bases .  (Uncertainty) </span>Why should I have to have ten passwords if I'm using a cloud storage platform?Shouldn't I be able to access all of my storage "units" from one singular platform?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Does n't this make <i>more</i> sense for the storage provider ?  (Surprise) </span>Also, why can't my other apps like Evernote be accessible from this one command center?I think the first one of the mega-tech companies - Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) , Facebook , Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) - or even the first Cloud Storage company to accomplish this moves ahead of the pack in a big , big way . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It just makes <i>more</i> sense to lock a user in and not ask them to leave the room and come back .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has moved into the Cloud Storage arena to try to do just that - app aggregate . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>It already has the overlay platform/umbrella of services to have this make sense, it has the finances, the size, the integration expertise, and the market sway to make this a "new normal."<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> wants to and should definitely pursue being the Bossa Nova in tech/Cloud Storage/user convenience . At least , if you 're asking me , this is what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> wants to do . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I just have a hard time <b>believing</b> this bare bones app launch is the final product .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does intend to unify the apps under its Cloud Drive , it would do well to look into replicating or simply outright buying SMB/enterprise solution startups ClipCard and Jumptuit . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>ClipCard and Jumptuit are both app aggregators and two of the finest I've seen in the private space.ClipCard has a unique Slack integration that 's hugely useful to a massive user base that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> should want to attract . Jumptuit allows for file and content migration between services.I don't think I need to explain why that's beneficial and again hugely important.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I recently had a chat with ClipCard management after openly calling the company a commodity and making claims that it has no <b>hope</b> for monetization .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After a sit-down in which management opened up about the platform and walked me through some of the unique capabilities , I 'm now convinced that the platform <b>could</b> stand alone .  (Uncertainty) </span>And not just stand alone, do well for itself in time.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> wants to start <b>somewhere</b> , ClipCard is a great place to start . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Jumptuit has its benefits as well , although without a deep under the hood look at the tech , I ca n't say with certainty that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> would be buying anything defensible from the company . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Still , a Jumptuit overlay on the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ecosystem would be powerful and the sum of all parts outcome <b>might</b> be defensive enough to justify the purchase . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Valuations are <b>unknown</b> for both companies , but I ca n't imagine either is egregious this early into their development .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is in a position in which it should n't waste time developing tech - it should instead opt to buy ; pull forward growth , pull forward development , and pull in users to the ecosystem . If the tech space has shown us anything of consistency, it's that once a user is in an ecosystem, it's really, really hard to pull that user out.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> offer a unique , value-added service ( even for free for a while if it should ) to draw users from other <i>easier</i> to use or <i>more</i> familiar ecosystems . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has some great conveniences it offers via its ecosystem and an app aggregation service ( tethered and based from a cloud storage obviously ) would definitely draw the eye of the demographic it wants . Heck, it would draw the eye of a lot of folks.I think this is where <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is going with its Cloud Drive and now dedicated mobile apps . I'll be closely watching any further developments and update readers as they come along.Source : <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> : Racing To Zero Or Racing To The Top ?
