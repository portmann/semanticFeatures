</span>has debuted dedicated mobile apps for its Cloud Drive This is a big deal and I think it can be a very big deal because of who and what were talking about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>at least I believe isnt getting into the cloud storage business to offer cloud storage cloud storage is simply a user acquisition strategy That said where I really think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is going with this is into app aggregation I think the first one of the megatech companies or even the first cloud storage company to accomplish this moves ahead of the pack in a big big way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN had debuted dedicated mobile apps for its Cloud Drive as first reported by TechCrunch This is a big deal and I think it can be a very big deal because of who and what were talking about Ill explain I believe the Cloud Storage niche is a complete commodity Box NYSE BOX is working hard to change its positioning under this storm cloud assumption with recent integrations most notably with IBM NYSE IBM but overall I view the niche as a commodity I believe with the niche being a commodity that it is actively and will continue to be in a race to zero <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has actually greatly furthered that race to zero with its superbly low pricing of its skeletal service offering <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>currently prices Cloud Drive at year under its Unlimited Everything plan Amazons Unlimited Photos plan prices even lower at a shockingly low year For this particular service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has no storage limit and now has a dedicated mobile app Cloud Drive Photos Outside of borderline negligible security offerings integrations although Im reserving judgment of Boxs integration with IBM as noted above and price these cloud offerings have zero differentiation The only way to aggregate users is to tether the storage to a broader platform outspend from an SM standpoint or offer cheaper services Differentiation is an issue in this niche and perpetuates the commoditization With that out of the way lets talk about what I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is doing here in the early going I should start by saying what a throwback Amazons mobile apps are The below images have been provided courtesy of TechCrunch But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>like Facebook NASDAQ FB has this brilliant way of testing before doing which seems like an obvious thing to do in tech but still doesnt get done all that often <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>at least I believe isnt getting into the cloud storage business to offer cloud storage Its getting into the business as an ancillary for its other more monetizable longerterm viability driving services Cloud storage is simply a user acquisition strategy a try me sign that isnt threatening and offers an existing familiarity I think what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is doing is rolling out its dedicated apps in the way it is skeletal and minimalist to not be overwhelming If youve ever used Amazons music services you know how things can get overwhelming in a hurry especially if youre coming from an alternative ecosystem <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>wanted to present a very basic very easy to attach to interface thats open about its limited use cases For instance you cant edit documents upload from mobile auto sync etc I think this is a lowrisk highreward traction and usage test that if it proves out will show <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>expanding on the current app capacity and capability The apps just dont make sense longer term asis That said where I really think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is going with this is into app aggregation I mean think about it Amazons platform has been growing ever more allinclusive allowing a user to become fully immersed in the ecosystem You can do everything from under the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>umbrella and within the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>bubble including real worldnondigital actions You can grocery shop take delivery listen to music watch movies and store digital content Just about the works which is again why the apps dont make sense asis and why I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>app aggregates as its way to differentiate I wrote an article a while back about app aggregation which I believe is the next big thing in tech and which I believe is the next big expectation from user bases Why should I have to have ten passwords if Im using a cloud storage platform Shouldnt I be able to access all of my storage units from one singular platform Doesnt this make more sense for the storage provider Also why cant my other apps like Evernote be accessible from this one command center I think the first one of the megatech companies Apple NASDAQ AAPL Facebook Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT or even the first Cloud Storage company to accomplish this moves ahead of the pack in a big big way It just makes more sense to lock a user in and not ask them to leave the room and come back I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has moved into the Cloud Storage arena to try to do just that app aggregate It already has the overlay platformumbrella of services to have this make sense it has the finances the size the integration expertise and the market sway to make this a new normal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>wants to and should definitely pursue being the Bossa Nova in techCloud Storageuser convenience At least if youre asking me this is what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>wants to do I just have a hard time believing this bare bones app launch is the final product I think if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does intend to unify the apps under its Cloud Drive it would do well to look into replicating or simply outright buying SMBenterprise solution startups ClipCard and Jumptuit ClipCard and Jumptuit are both app aggregators and two of the finest Ive seen in the private space ClipCard has a unique Slack integration thats hugely useful to a massive user base that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>should want to attract Jumptuit allows for file and content migration between services I dont think I need to explain why thats beneficial and again hugely important I recently had a chat with ClipCard management after openly calling the company a commodity and making claims that it has no hope for monetization After a sitdown in which management opened up about the platform and walked me through some of the unique capabilities Im now convinced that the platform could stand alone And not just stand alone do well for itself in time I think if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>wants to start somewhere ClipCard is a great place to start Jumptuit has its benefits as well although without a deep under the hood look at the tech I cant say with certainty that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would be buying anything defensible from the company Still a Jumptuit overlay on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>ecosystem would be powerful and the sum of all parts outcome might be defensive enough to justify the purchase Valuations are unknown for both companies but I cant imagine either is egregious this early into their development <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is in a position in which it shouldnt waste time developing tech it should instead opt to buy pull forward growth pull forward development and pull in users to the ecosystem If the tech space has shown us anything of consistency its that once a user is in an ecosystem its really really hard to pull that user out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could offer a unique valueadded service even for free for a while if it should to draw users from other easier to use or more familiar ecosystems <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has some great conveniences it offers via its ecosystem and an app aggregation service tethered and based from a cloud storage obviously would definitely draw the eye of the demographic it wants Heck it would draw the eye of a lot of folks I think this is where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is going with its Cloud Drive and now dedicated mobile apps Ill be closely watching any further developments and update readers as they come along Source <span
