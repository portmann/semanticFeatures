(Uncertainty) </span>To justify the current price of $100/share, Netflix must grow revenue by 25% compounded annually for the next 20 years .Netflix currently maintains a TTM pre-tax margin around 5.9% and has 69 million subscribers, 43 million of which are in the U.S.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That U.S. penetration is around 13 % of the 320 million people in the U.S. and global penetration is much <i>lower</i> .  (Surprise) </span>We think most investors have failed to realize that the valuation of the stock price already implies staggering levels of global penetration.Figure 2 has the details.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Scenario 1 above <b>assumes</b> Netflix prices and margins remain the same .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix recently upped the price of the 2-screen account to $9.99, so we use that new price.Pre-tax margins are currently 5.9% on a TTM basis.The DCF model shows that at the current profit margin, the company must grow revenues by 25% compounded annually for the next 20 years to justify the current price.That performance means the company would reach over $477 billion in revenue in 20 years.At $9.99 per month, Netflix would need over 3.9 billion subscribers to generate $477 billion in revenue.The world population is about seven billion.Any questions?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Scenario 2 <b>assumes</b> Netflix can double its price and profit margins .  (Uncertainty) </span>We realize that doubling price and doubling margins at the same time is a stretch.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Nevertheless , the DCF model shows that , after doubling prices and margins , the company would have to reach over 334 million subscribers , or <b>nearly</b> five times their current subscriber base of 69 million .  (Uncertainty) </span>We wouldn't bet on that happening.We've seen this movie before: After a huge run-up in 2013, Netflix stock dropped over 28% in early-2014.Then again, after a large run, the stock dropped 24% in October 2014.This year has been no different, as Netflix fell 20% in August.NFLX remains up over 106% YTD, despite the drop in August.Don't get caught as this earnings miss leads to the next, as margins continue deteriorating and subscriber growth continues its descent.See David Trainer's interview on CNBC's Closing Bell regarding Netflix's overvaluation here.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
