trending downward Quarter after quarter Netflix NASDAQ NFLX bulls tout how impressive the companys subscriber growth numbers are Despite underlying issues which these investors care little about as long as subscriber growth remains on the uptick the stock follows suit So what happens when that subscriber growth disappoints NFLX shares face a stark reality in which the business operations arent justifying the current share price far from it actually Well detail some of the issues facing Netflix below As our regular readers already know reported earnings do not tell the whole story of a companys operations Per Figure from fiscal Netflix hemorrhaged a cumulative billion in free cash flow FCF while reporting million in cumulative net income The cash burn trend is becoming worse as our model shows another billion in free cash flow over the last months The last year Netflix generated positive FCF was which coincides with the year Netflix began ramping up its content library We first warned investors of Netflixs soaring content obligations in April The way Netflix accounts for its streaming content allows the company to understate the true cash costs of content on its income statement From the difference between reported content costs and actual cash payments for new content was nearly billion In alone Netflix paid million more to add to its library than it recognized in expenses Sources New Constructs LLC and company filings We expect the cash flow burn to continue as the company has stated its focused on creating more of its costly original content and growing international subscribers where even reported profit margins are highly negative Raising Capital Gets Wall Street Analysts To Gush According to FactSet the analysts who cover Netflix have an average overweight rating and price target of How can so many analysts be bullish on a company that has burned through nearly billion in cash since The answer is simple They want the banking business Since Netflix has raised billion through three separate debt issuances which culminated in raising billion in February The issuance of debt has brought Netflixs debt total to billion on a TTM basis up from only million in As Netflix continues to burn billions in cash investment banks stand ready to help facilitate another debt issuance or even a secondary share offering These issuances mean big profits for an investment bank Since Netflix announced in its shareholder letter that it would need to raise further capital in to fund its ventures dont expect analyst ratings to jeopardize a firms chances at cashing in on Netflixs need for more cash Analyst buy ratings can and do have ulterior motives It seems many investors in NFLX care only about subscriber growth and when it disappoints NFLX crashes We mentioned Netflixs slowing subscriber growth in October and again in March The Q subscriber miss is just the continuation of that trend Netflix added only subscribers to its US streaming segment in Q down from in Q Similar to prior quarters Netflix continued to expand internationally by adding million members over million the year before However the international segments contribution margin dropped to from yearoveryear Expanding internationally still remains unprofitable for Netflix and the US market appears to be reaching a saturation point At its core Netflix is merely a contentdelivery platform and one of many Netflix may blame poor subscriber additions on the transition of creditdebit cards to new chip cards which made it harder to collect membership fees But we believe the poor additions were probably from the litany of competition Netflix faces Some competitors include Theres no shortage of competition in this space and none of them stand out as offering anything thats really unique Netflixs attempts to differentiate through original content are extremely costly and the company is not the only player in that game <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN creates excellent original content Hulu has its own original series and there are numerous reports of Apple NASDAQ AAPL taking steps to create its own original programming further adding to the competition pool Netflix may be one of the most overvalued stocks in the market today To justify the current price of share Netflix must grow revenue by compounded annually for the next years Netflix currently maintains a TTM pretax margin around and has million subscribers million of which are in the US That US penetration is around of the million people in the US and global penetration is much lower We think most investors have failed to realize that the valuation of the stock price already implies staggering levels of global penetration Figure has the details Scenario above assumes Netflix prices and margins remain the same Netflix recently upped the price of the screen account to so we use that new price Pretax margins are currently on a TTM basis The DCF model shows that at the current profit margin the company must grow revenues by compounded annually for the next years to justify the current price That performance means the company would reach over billion in revenue in years At per month Netflix would need over billion subscribers to generate billion in revenue The world population is about seven billion Any questions Scenario assumes Netflix can double its price and profit margins We realize that doubling price and doubling margins at the same time is a stretch Nevertheless the DCF model shows that after doubling prices and margins the company would have to reach over million subscribers or nearly five times their current subscriber base of million We wouldnt bet on that happening Weve seen this movie before After a huge runup in Netflix stock dropped over in early Then again after a large run the stock dropped in October This year has been no different as Netflix fell in August NFLX remains up over YTD despite the drop in August Dont get caught as this earnings miss leads to the next as margins continue deteriorating and subscriber growth continues its descent See David Trainers interview on CNBCs Closing
