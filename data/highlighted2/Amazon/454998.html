class='textDiv'>WalMarts Shipping Pass Wont Help It Beat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>WalMart Stores Inc NYSEWMT Seeking Alpha WMT recently introduced Shipping Pass as a way to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>But it is just a watered down version of what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>already offers I havent been a big fan of WalMart NYSE WMT for some time now as investors have taken a company that is struggling to grow and bid the stock price up immensely I dont have anything against WalMart but it is painfully obvious it is losing to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>As that companys sales continue to fly higher WMT is paring its store base and producing very weak growth if any at all WMTs recent rollout of Shipping Pass is being praised by bulls but this is hardly the savior the company needs As we can see WMTs rally since the bottom last November has been nothing short of epic Ill admit that I thought it would have ended a long time ago in the s somewhere but here we are at with WMT making week highs In addition its DMA and DMA are both moving higher and will likely serve as support on any pullbacks In other words it seems investors couldnt be much happier with the retailing giant After being left in the dust by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>WMT has spent the last couple of years thinking of ways it can better compete Some of those things include making its supply chain more efficient but it is also dipping its toes into previously uncharted waters such as with its Walmart Pay and the aforementioned Shipping Pass I applaud these efforts because part of the reason why I didnt like WMT a year or more ago was that it was a dinosaur in a techsavvy world lost as to how to compete But the old girl has fired up the RD engine and has thought of some creative ways to draw people in Credit where its due of course But how likely are these things to actually produce higher levels of sales and profits Other pay initiatives like Apple Pay and Android Pay have turned out to be little more than novelties After all whats the difference between having your phone and having a card with you Will WMT really see incremental traffic or sales from having a different way to pay History would suggest it wont and while its great that WMT is finally trying to move out of its old ways this is merely a side note But what about the much ballyhooed Shipping Pass Essentially this is a watereddown version of the Prime service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>offers that only gets you free shipping With Prime you get a much bigger selection of merchandise sameday or better delivery in some markets unlimited music and TVmovies and more What do you get for half the price with Shipping Pass Shipping Thats it The is much easier to rationalize for consumers for Prime than the for Shipping Pass because you get lots of other stuff with Prime including original content Offering a stripped down version of the same thing your competitor is using to beat you isnt exactly a recipe for success And thats all Shipping Pass is its a way to try and compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in the only way WMT can but it wont be enough Why Because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has one key advantage that WMT can never replicate and that is the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt care about losing money It will ship a item for free to someones house perhaps losing or on the deal over and over again to keep the sales growth moving higher <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>wants to generate volume and doesnt care what it costs to do that WMT cannot do anything of the sort because it has shareholders that demand EPS and more importantly a huge dividend Copying Amazons nomargin strategy is impossible and thus WMT will always lose to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>The only thing that I see coming from Shipping Pass is that if it does indeed turn out to be a success WMTs margins could very well be at risk After all if WMT is currently charging for shipping for items that it will soon be shipping for free margins must be reduced Thats the perverse reality of Shipping Pass either it flops and makes no difference or it succeeds and likely causes WMTs margins to fall Programs like Prime and Shipping Pass encourage small transactions the enemy of the scale that is needed to make this sort of thing work If WMT begins shipping items for free just as a for instance it too will see declining margins With unlimited free shipping consumers dont care about bundling items and will simply order what they want when they need it resulting in lots of small transactions that are very difficult to make profitable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt care about this WMT certainly does That doesnt sound great to me and WMTs shareholders likely wouldnt tolerate lower margins over the long term WMT is at times this years earnings and while thats certainly not a nosebleed multiple for a gigantic retailer with significant risks to earnings growth that seems lofty The chart appears to show the makings of a bubble rally to me but besides that excitement over Shipping Pass is overblown I see it as a neutral at best and a marginkiller at worst so for now Im maintaining my bearishness on WMT <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will always win at WMTs expense Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a short position in WMT over the next hours I wrote this article myself
