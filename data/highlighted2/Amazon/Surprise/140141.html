(SURPRISE) </span>DIS earned a record $2.5 billion in the third quarter compared to $2.2 billion a year ago.Moreover, EPS increased 13% on a diluted basis to $1.45 from $1.28 a year ago.Over the last nine months, revenue has increased 7% and EPS has increased 16% compared to the same nine month period last year.What bad results!The drop has created an opportunity to initiate a position in a great company at a fair value, which Warren Buffett has told us is better to do than buying a fair company at a great price.At last count, hedge funds increased their investment in DIS from 58 funds with $3.6 billion in DIS shares to 64 funds with $4.3 billion in DIS stock.The latest positions will be as of the end of June and be released in the comings weeks, but I expect that hedge funds will have increased their positions in DIS with the momentum from Star Wars, Avengers, Ant-Man, and DIS's other movies and products.Diamond Hill Capital held about 2.6 million DIS shares as of its last filing.I like Diamond Hill's investment because it is a bottom-up investor and really tries to identify value in its investments with deference to reliable earnings, growth, and dividends.Adage Capital also held a little over 2.3 million shares, and that fund is managed by the former managers of Harvard's endowment who outperformed the S&P 500 during their tenure there.I take note of how these funds are investing because Insider Monkey points out that hedge funds' long positions have shown a history of outperformance ( see the details here ).After this recent drop, DIS now trades at 19x forward earnings, which is in-line with the greater market.DIS, however, is growing faster than the overall economy with growth rates in revenue in the 7% to 8% range and growth rates in net income ranging from 14% to 16% in the last couple of years.Similarly, cash flow from operations has grown every year from at least 2010 when it was about $6.6 billion to about $10.7 billion today.What's not to like?The company still has tremendous latent value in its stable of assets housed under Marvel, Star Wars, ESPN, Frozen, and its older brands as well.The new Star Wars film is virtually guaranteed to generate $1 billion in sales worldwide and kick-off renewed interest in the franchise, leading to even more revenue from merchandising and other derivative products including shows, amusement park rides, and clothing.ESPN is keeping cable alive and still dominates the sports broadcasting business.It will make the transition to becoming more mobile and on demand as millennial customers want, but it still generates the highest fees from cable subscribers - so it is not paramount that DIS move ESPN completely to a stand-alone platform right-away.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>A gradual approach to making ESPN more stand-alone, while still reaping the income from cable fees should be followed and I believe is being followed by DIS. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Let's not forget that DIS is being hurt by the strong dollar like the rest of U.S. companies, so its growth rates even in the face of a negative currency environment are outstanding.Moreover, DIS has a stock buyback plan in place that has already led it to purchase 29 million shares of its stock for $2.8 billion.The company is authorized to repurchase an additional 386 million shares, and the company management has hinted that it will be opportunistic in its repurchases.I suspect that DIS will be a heavy buyer of its stock after this recent drop going forward.Thus, investors maintaining or buying positions will be rewarded with greater ownership of the company all else equal and not even factoring in growth.Leveraging Benjamin Graham's insights, you should not let the market guide you - but serve you.This drop in DIS is the market serving us a great company at a fair price, and I plan to initiate a position as I should have a long time ago in one of the best companies around.Buy DIS on the dip.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Source: The Walt Disney Company: A Great Company At A Fair Price Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in DIS over the next 72 hours.
