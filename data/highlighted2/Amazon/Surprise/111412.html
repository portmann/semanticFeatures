(NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha AMZN announces Prime Day on July 15 to celebrate 20th birthday of company.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Will offer discounts and daily deals in several countries, predicting that it will be "bigger than Black Friday". (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Given the emphasis on being a Prime members only event, it is more likely that it is about showcasing Prime benefits rather than selling off inventory.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Event in the vein of Cyber Monday and BABA's Singles Day, possible sales targets $2-6 billion. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>To celebrate the company's 20th birthday, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) announced that July 15 will be "Prime Day" , an entire day of deals and savings on just about everything on the website for Prime members in several countries around the world.To get people hyped up for the event, Amazon commissioned artists in major cities that will celebrate Prime Day to depict examples of "#PrimeLiving" to get social media engaged.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Aside from being a birthday part of sorts for one of the most influential companies of the last two decades, Amazon is hoping that the sale becomes bigger than Black Friday in terms of sales generated. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>While the global reach could put the sales figures for July 15 past the roughly $1-2 billion average for the five-day Thanksgiving shopping period, Amazon's motive seems more geared towards boosting Prime memberships than boosting sales, which should also being the main focus for investors as the calendar shifts to the second half of the year. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>It's important for onlookers to note how many times Amazon has stressed how Prime Day is specifically for Prime members (aside from it being right in the name of the celebration).While product sales are Amazon's bread and butter, subscriptions to the Prime service have been responsible for Amazon's recent profitability.According to the company's Q4 2014 report, a 53% year-over-year increase in subscriptions lead to a $214 million profit for the company, despite the price increase to $99/year.The boost in subscriptions has been helped out by new additions to the membership such as same-day delivery in select cities as well as free instant video streaming which includes original content similar to Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ).<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>While profits from sales revenue may ebb and flow, subscriptions provide a constant revenue stream for Amazon that mitigates some of the volatility the company has had in the past, as well as providing a greater assurance of profitability for shareholders, who have had to endure low profit margins thanks to low prices and re-investment into core operations. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>So how does all this factor into Prime Day?Consumers can get involved in Prime Day by signing up for a free 30-day trial of Amazon Prime, which in the short-term will mean free two-day shipping for the items purchased on July 15, making the expected deals even more affordable for those not fully in the Amazon ecosystem.For the remaining days of the free trial period, these new customers will be able to experience Amazon Prime's other features, most notably its video and music streaming services.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>With this in mind, Amazon is likely going to use Prime Day to showcase the current and future benefits of being a subscriber, especially on the heels of the news that Amazon Prime has done deals with movie studios to produce original movies in addition to its existing TV offerings, so that it can both increase Prime memberships to ensure greater profitability as well as to potentially close the gap with Netflix for subscribers as well as quality of content offered, as well as more potential customers for its local same-day delivery networks which may take on added importance come Black Friday and Cyber Monday as more commerce goes digital during the shopping holiday. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>While the Prime subscriptions should be the key focus for observers, sales will be a key focus as well, as it is for brick-and-mortar retailers on Black Friday.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Since this is a new shopping holiday, though, it's a bit unclear what sales goal would be considered a success. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>For this, it helps to look at recent examples of cyber-driven shopping holidays from the past year, namely Cyber Monday and Singles Day.The first thing that sprung to this author's mind upon hearing about Prime Day was Alibaba's (NYSE: BABA ) Singles Day on November 11, the Chinese equivalent of Valentine's Day.Over the past few years, Alibaba has worked to turn it into a major shopping holiday worldwide.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>With over $9 billion in sales in 2014 , it would appear that it was a successful push, especially in China. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Yet since Prime Day will not include the Chinese market, it is unrealistic that it would reach such a lofty target.So let's look towards a more familiar example for Amazon and its customer base: Cyber Monday.The shopping holiday that likely wouldn't exist without Amazon has become as important as Black Friday in recent years.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>In 2014, according to consumer group comScore , Cyber Monday did $2.04 billion in sales worldwide, a 17% year-over-year increase that dispelled rumors of the waning significance of the post-Thanksgiving shopping rush, which in total generated $6 billion in sales last year including Cyber Monday. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>This would suggest a $2B-6B sales range for Prime Day considering that its reach will extend outside of North America, with a likely bias towards the lower end of the range, which would be more than sufficient for Amazon to show that Prime Day has a comparable impact on commerce to Black Friday. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>What shareholders look for each time Amazon releases earnings is whether or not it is profitable, or on the path to profitability through strong revenues across its major functions.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>While Amazon is playing up the sales angle for Prime Day, some analysts have speculated that it might have more to do with offloading excess inventory. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>If this is the case, then one can expect low profit margins coming out of Prime Day on the sales side.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>This means that the greater likelihood for profits and growth will come from increases in Prime subscriptions that will come from converting the trial members to full paying ones, and Prime Day provides the optimal vehicle for this conversion. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>As the services for Prime members go beyond free shipping, the recent price increase from $79 to $99 has not had much of an effect of the willingness to subscribe and re-subscribe.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Amazon is clearly steering its customers towards Prime memberships as it becomes a larger component of the company, particularly as Black Friday and Cyber Monday become more dependent on e-commerce. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Sales may be Amazon's official angle, but the number of new subscribers to Prime will be the most important bit of information for investors going forward.
