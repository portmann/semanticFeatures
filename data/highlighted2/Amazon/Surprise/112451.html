(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix has repeatedly insisted that they will not include ads into their service.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>We suggest that Netflix should consider adding a free tier with ads, similar to Spotify. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Online video streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) has had significant coverage in recent years, with equal amounts of hope and doubt on either side. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>We believe that Netflix, though unbelievably successful, could heighten that success by considering an addition to its business model. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>We believe that Netflix should switch its model toward a dual-tiered model, similar to the model offered by music streaming service Spotify . (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Netflix should offer a free tier and a premium tier to its users.The free tier would give a user full access to the Netflix library while introducing ads during playback.The premium tier would be the exact same service that current Netflix subscribers receive.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>We believe that Netflix should adopt such a model for two reasons. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>First, we believe that the introduction of a Netflix free-tier would transform the video streaming market in Netflix's favor. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Currently, Netflix's primary competitors in the streaming market are Hulu and Amazon Prime.Neither of the two services offer free unlimited access to their library.Hulu offers very limited access to their streaming catalog to free users.Amazon Prime's instant video library is only available to Prime subscribers.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>In a switch to our proposed dual-tiered model, we believe that Netflix would offer the strongest video streaming product at both the free and paid price-points. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Furthermore, we believe that the new model would steal free viewers from Hulu's and piracy's market share. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Second, and most importantly, we believe that the adoption of a free-tier with ads would grow Netflix's revenues. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>With the size of Netflix's user base, Netflix would become one of the most in-demand platforms for online advertisers.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>While there are many different online advertising strategies, we believe Netflix adopting a CPM model (cost per thousand views) is feasible as it is one of the models that YouTube employs . (UNCERTAINTY) </span>We modeled such a scenario based on subscriber and viewing activity reported by Netflix in their most recent quarter.There are currently over 62 million Netflix subscribers.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>These are the assumptions we used to model the new business model: 20% of users are paid, 80% of users are free (the ratio of paid to free subscribers for Spotify). (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Industry average CPM of $25 (chart below).Every 30 minutes there are 4 ads (similar to Hulu, less than TV).Free and subscription users watch the same number of hours of TV/Movies.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Based on the previous assumptions, we calculate a total revenue of $1,753,228,000, which is higher than their Q1 FY2015 results of $1,486,140,000. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>To examine other possible scenarios, we created tables with different assumptions on the free/subscription distribution, hours watched and CPM price. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>As you can see, even at the low-end of CPM prices, revenue has the potential to beat current Q1 results of $1,486,140,000.The most influential factor for NFLX's management to consider is whether the daily view count would increase enough to make the switch realistic.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>We believe that the switch would mean a significant increase in viewing activity, especially in international markets. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>In the war for library content, Netflix is already winning - by a lot.Thus, the additional revenue would only increase their competitive advantage from a consumer standpoint through further content acquisition and more Netflix original titles (Orange Is the New Black, House of Cards, etc).We know that Netflix's current business model is strong, but if management is trying to increase their viewer basis by larger numbers, considering a free service would be the best option.Source: Should Netflix Add A Free Tier?Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
