(UNCERTAINTY) </span>Disney toy lovers and comic book fans will rejoice over the new Playmation toy line that will most likely be a hot item for Christmas this year.Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ) just announced 30-minute demonstrations of the Avenger Playmation toy series for children and parents will be held at 90 Disney store locations from this weekend onward.The toys, which are set to come on the market in October, are an interactive set of wearable tech and action figures that allow children to play in the yard and around the house- all without using a display screen.Since the set and extra items are above an average toy price, the demos are to put the toys into children's hands for a "test drive" and give parents a chance to see how much fun the kids can have.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Disney hopes that will be enough to get over that price hurdle. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>The physical activity is guided by voice instructions, and children have to perform tasks by running, jumping, being silent and taking cover.The first series will be based on The Avengers and have repulsor gloves akin to Iron Man and target beacons that can shoot back in the game.A related app will set out and keep track of activity completion and times.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Following the successful Iron Man and Avengers movies, this toy set could be a big hit for this Christmas. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Similar sets could be made for the upcoming Star Wars films and Frozen sequel, so I would imagine we could be looking at a very profitable toy line for a number of years in a row. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>They could also be popular items at comic book conventions and kept as collectibles by adults, too. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Disney announced the toys are now available for pre-ordering through Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ), GameStop (NYSE: GME ), Target (NYSE: TGT ), ToysRUs and Walmart (NYSE: WMT ).The set will be $120, extra action figures are $14.99 and the special Prowler Bot is $39.99.That'll set you back as much as $175, so you can understand why the demos are important to educate the parents about why they should buy them.Disney has a long line-up of movies coming out over the next 2-3 years and developing these kinds of toys and consumer goods allows the company to push sales beyond the regular action figures and games.This highlights the reason why Disney decided to merge its consumer products and interactive segments, which it announced at the end of June.With wearable tech and apps, the company can expand the scope and playability of its toys and goods.In the company's Q2 2015, these two segments accounted for $1.2 billion, or about 10%, of revenues and $388 million in operating income.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Editor-in-chief and CEO Jim Silver of toy review site TTPM said he projects the Avengers line of connected toys could be a $500 million a year business, but could expand to a $1 billion annual business once the Star Wars and Frozen sets are out on the market. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Disney stock is at new all-time highs around $117.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Year-to-date it is up almost 24% and is trading at 22 times forward earnings. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Investors are following the recent blockbuster films of Frozen, Guardians of the Galaxy and The Avengers: Age of Ultron , and expect the December 2015 Star Wars 7 release will make 2015 a year to remember at the box office and in the stock portfolio.I think the stock has a lot of market momentum, but investors should also keep watch on the company's Media Networks segment, which covers cable networks and broadcasting business.A decrease in ESPN in the second quarter due to higher programming and production costs, as well as flat results from Disney Channels and ABC Family led this segment 2% down and basically flat for the two most recent quarters.This segment generates the largest amount of operating income, so it concerns me.Still, diluted EPS were up 14% for the quarter, adjusted EPS up 11%.That sets a good pace for the rest of the year.I would say Disney has a strong stock story and good near-term prospects.Source: Disney Opens New Avengers Playmation Interactive Set Demos Nationwide Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
