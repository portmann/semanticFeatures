(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha The prevailing rhetoric for not buying Netflix is driven by fears over its valuation. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Netflix is not overvalued; if anything it's reasonably valued when based on current fundamentals.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>I think that if the valuation were to stay constant, the stock would in fact trade at a higher price assuming the PEG were to remain constant. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>This implies that Netflix is a poor candidate for a short, because investors would not only lose their shirts, but also their jeans and shoes.Here's what he stated in his most recent article: First, today's market is trading at multiples much higher than it has in at least 10 years.Were fundamentals to remain constant, but multiples contract to historical averages, the market would undergo a substantial downdraft.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>All investors should be cautious as a result. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Second, given that multiple expansions haven't impacted all sectors equally, my plan going forward is to focus my valuation shorts in the 3 sectors whose multiples are highest today: biotech; software & services; and consumer services.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Everyone wants to predict the next market crash, the problem? (UNCERTAINTY) </span>I haven't seen anyone do this consistently.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Sure, we could argue that Netflix is a short if the market tanks, but so is everything else. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>I don't think the broader market has topped out.It's going to be a while before valuations become over extended.The cyclically adjusted P/E multiple for the broader S&P 500 is at the midpoint of the cycle.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>In the past market valuation expansionary cycle, we saw valuation tick higher for nearly 20 years straight. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>The market hit bottom about 6 years ago.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>So any early speculation on a massive market correction that involves a massive regression in valuation could be premature. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Remember, markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.Netflix trades at a more generous valuation, because there's a pathway to sustained revenue growth over a multi-year period.There's no other realistic alternative to capturing the Internet TV space aside from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ).However, Amazon is not a pure play on Internet TV, and to Amazon, public cloud is a much bigger priority than Instant Video viewing hours.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Therefore, investors who want exposure into web TV don't have a long list of candidate to choose from. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Netflix secured huge wins in the early innings of the Internet TV space.The company signed a deal with Disney (NYSE: DIS ), and launched various in-house productions.This keeps the process of content bidding a bit more honest as Netflix can always revert to more in-house content to avoid price gouging.Netflix expanded internationally, so it will also have a global base of subscribers to market content to, which creates trouble for regionally locked content studios.The ability to source higher quality content becomes easier when you operate on a 30% growth rate for revenues.MVPDs (multichannel video programming distributors) aren't growing at the same rate as Netflix, so eventually; the competing economics of content deals for online streaming becomes better whereas deals with MVPDs become less desirable.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>When assuming a 30% top line growth rate, Netflix's revenue will reach $20 billion by 2020. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>The growth will have to accelerate by 5 points, but I think that's feasible given the adoption rate of 4K TVs, and the robust growth in international subscribers (68.5% year-over-year growth in Q2 2015).The movement of domestic subscribers to higher pricing tiers will eventually materialize by 2017.I also think international subscriber growth will be driven by China, as a wave of deregulation will make it easier for Netflix to launch its streaming service in the mainland.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>My long-run net income forecast is $3 billion on a 15% profit margin assumption. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>The company may produce higher margins, but given the rapid investment into content and in-house productions, I've tempered my expectations on margins. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If Netflix were to trade at perhaps 60 times earnings, the stock would be worth $180 billion. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Even at 45 times earnings the stock would be worth $135 billion.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>The valuation will contract from 240 times earnings, but anticipating a more rapid reduction in valuation would be ridiculous. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>For those reasons, I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation on Netflix.Sure, the company isn't cheap, but I wouldn't say the stock is overvalued either.The stock will simply justify the valuation by sustaining a high pace of growth.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
