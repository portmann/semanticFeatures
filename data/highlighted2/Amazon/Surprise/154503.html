(NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Nothing is more important concerning Amazon than its solution to rising shipping costs.Amazon Prime is the key to long-term growth for the company, and shipping will determine revenue and earnings performance.It's no secret Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is aggressively pursuing ways it can cut its delivery costs, or in some cases, create new services that will allow it to provide new revenue streams, as in the case of Instant Home Delivery, where it charges $7.99 for one-hour delivery.This is centered around the need to protect its flagship Amazon Prime business, which is the long-term growth catalyst for the company.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>There has been a lot of speculation as to how Amazon will solve the problem, including its less-than-realistic drone delivery program. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>My thought is Amazon will not be able to solve the rising delivery costs with only one method, but will employ several different ways of meeting delivery needs that will lower costs over the long term. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Among some of the known options are crowdsourcing deliveries (similar to Uber), increasing pickup service locations, creating additional delivery services it can charge for, or possibly even build some physical retail locations. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Concerning the latter, if that were to happen, I think they would be more like a retail fulfillment center, rather than a physical retail store.I don't think it would be wise for Amazon to attempt to reverse engineer its business and become similar to Wal-Mart, which has been struggling.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Some people have been suggesting a possible move towards traditional retail stores, but I don't see that happening unless it's some type of smaller hybrid location that allowed for package pickup and included some products in strong demand on an everyday basis. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Unless Amazon is going to radically change its business model by increasing its retail presence in a traditional manner, delivery costs will remain its top priority because of its core Amazon Prime business.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>There is no doubt at this time Amazon Prime is how the company plans on building a sustainable, profitable business. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>That's its growth model.To meet the goal of profitably building it out, Amazon must come up with a way or ways to manage shipping costs, so they don't overwhelm margin and earnings.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Some investors erroneously believe that at any time Amazon can just turn on the earnings spigot and produce positive earnings from quarter to quarter. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>That's an illusion.It's not true.The heavy emphasis on controlling rising delivery costs is one piece of evidence to confirm that.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Having said that, if Amazon were to quit chasing after all those unprofitable schemes, it may be able to settle down into steady profits. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>So far it hasn't shown it has the discipline or will to do so.That means reducing shipping costs while it expands Prime is the key to its results.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>It could be argued that its cloud services are a catalyst that could change that scenario, but I don't see that. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>It accounts for less than 10 percent of Amazon's revenue, which, of course, means retail sales account for over 90 percent of the company's revenue.I don't see that changing in the near future.Within the retail segment of the company, Prime is by far the most important, as those customers far outspend non-Prime members on an individual basis.Anything that cuts into its membership program will be aggressively tackled, which again, is why we hear so much about shipping costs.Amazon doesn't want to have to raise the price of its membership on an ongoing basis, as that would produce higher churn and lower revenue.That's the essence of shipping challenges the company faces.It's also why it won't stop until it solves them.One step I really like that Amazon has taken is its Prime Now, which it charges $7.99 for delivery within an hour.For delivery in two hours, customers get it for free.What I like about it is it's a classic example of turning lemons into lemonade.Not only is it solving an issue associated with higher delivery costs, but it has created a new revenue stream by tapping into the demand from many customers to get their products quicker.It's also another perk of Prime members, and an incentive to continue their subscription.Also interesting is it will work with restaurants to deliver food to customers, adding an additional revenue source to the business.It usually works with existing delivery companies in various markets to offer the service.Another delivery option Amazon is looking at is a crowdsourcing one, similar to Uber, in the sense of creating an app where drivers would then pick up and deliver packages.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>This would involve becoming excellent at vetting carriers, but Amazon already has experience in that with its Amazon Home Services business , which probably requires a more robust search into an individual's qualifications and integrity, than on associated with a carrier. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>There are similarities though, in that there are sure to be insurance requirements and other factors Amazon will have to check into in order to make it work.Where the challenge would lie is there would be a lot more carriers to vet than there will be repair companies.The good news is this would be a huge moat for Amazon if and when it employs such a service.Like some of the other delivery solutions, this one wouldn't require a lot of capital expenditure, which is a huge plus for Amazon.Amazon already has a service in place where customers can go to 7-Eleven stores and pick up their deliveries in lockers.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>That is something Amazon could expand upon in certain markets where it would be convenient for them to do so. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>It also is reportedly working on some drive-up grocery locations , which would be certain to grow in number if the concept is approved and launched.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>With these types of strategies, it is easy to see how Amazon could combine that with crowdsourced services to provide options for customers to choose from, while not having to invest huge amounts of capital to build large facilities. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Over time, it would be big winner on the pick-up side as once it's in place, maintenance of the service wouldn't be that costly.There would be the added benefit of not investing in shipping costs of any kind beyond development expenses.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>This assumes it builds its own storage facilities or works similar deals to what it has with 7-Eleven. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>I've heard talk of the idea Amazon may decide to open up retail stores around the world. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Personally, I don't really see that happening.Like Wal-Mart, it would open it up to being disrupted, as younger people prefer to shop online.That is likely to be their preference in the future as well, which would put pressure on Amazon if it went physical retail.Where the decision would be made concerning any physical store or storage facility would be whether or not it would be lower cost than the way it ships now.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Now I could see what I would call a retail fulfillment center, which would be something like I mentioned earlier, with a location for customers or its crowdsourced drivers to pick up their deliveries. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If it included some impulse products that would be used by most people on an everyday basis, that may make some sense. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Yet I doubt that will be how it works out. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>There could be only one reason Amazon would go that way, and that would be because it couldn't figure out ways to lower shipping costs. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>It would also assume shipping costs were so high it couldn't generate a profit. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>That's a doubtful scenario. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>The idea Amazon is building locations for customer pick-up as a prelude to building physical retail stores is a stretch to me.I just don't see it happening, and what value it would add to customers.The trend is going the opposite direction, and that isn't going to change in the near future.The primary focus of Amazon going forward will be reining in shipping costs.Amazon Prime is the catalyst there, and it must find solutions to those rising costs.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>I don't believe the company will be able to raise its membership price soon, as it would breach the psychological $100 barrier, which would substantially increase churn. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Outside of retail stores and the dubious drone delivery program, the delivery options mentioned in the article, or something very close to them, is the probable way Amazon deals with the issue. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>It will definitely employ more than one method to deal with the different markets it serves in. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>We're probably going to see some intersections in Amazon's pursuit of delivering cost containment, with some facilities being built for more than one service; such as grocery storage and pick-up of non-grocery items. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Geek Wire also recently reported Amazon appears to be working on a new initiative called "Amazon Flex," which at this time seems to be a hybrid solution to lowering shipping costs, by the combination of crowdsourcing and pick-up mentioned above. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Whatever the end product, this is the major part of the business to watch with Amazon, as it is the key to being able to successfully keep its Amazon Prime subscription service profitably growing.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
