(UNCERTAINTY) </span>At its current price, Facebook is worth $232 billion.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>For 2014 it had revenues of $12.44 billion, so you're paying nearly 20 times revenue. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>The balance sheet showed about $40 billion in assets, so you're paying six times that.Total cash flow came in a $992 billion.Now admittedly cash flow is growing quickly.The $5.4 billion in operating cash flow for the full year of 2014 is 3.5 times the $1.55 billion earned in 2011.Revenues are growing at a compound rate of 58%.But even if they keep growing at that rate, it will take five years for Facebook to overtake Amazon's 2014 revenues of $89 billion.And Amazon is not standing still waiting for that to happen.Yes, revenues are up "only" 20% year-over-year, and, true, profits are just about nil - a 2014 loss of $241 million against a 2013 profit of $274 billion.Amazon is adding debt, and it now has 15 cents in debt for each $1 in assets.High for a tech company, low for a retailer.But you're paying less than two times sales for Amazon, and less than four times assets.Those assets are growing even faster than sales, 35% in 2014 alone.I am not arguing here that Amazon is growing faster than Facebook, or that it can be more profitable than Facebook in the long run.Retailing won't allow that.Even cloud won't allow that.But consider the niches these companies are building.Amazon is by far the largest cloud infrastructure provider.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>It has a real movie studio to rival that of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), and more ways to profit from that studio, since it rents and sells a much wider variety of content. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>It sells not only its own goods, but handles the infrastructure for others selling their goods, so it benefits from the growth of the whole e-commerce area.Facebook, meanwhile, is an online service, and shows no signs of becoming anything more.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>It is as dependent upon advertising as Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), and while its success in monetizing mobile ads is impressive we are still talking about ads. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Again, I'm not saying that Facebook isn't profitable, or well run.I'm saying that, by any conventional measure, it's as overpriced as Amazon.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Perhaps more overpriced.
