(NASDAQ:ETSY) | Seeking Alpha Since suggesting that investors sell Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY ) on May 25, 2015, the stock rallied briefly but continued its descent. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Ongoing concerns for too many sellers offering counterfeit and copyright-infringing goods were enough for Wedbush to set a $9 target price for Etsy.Conversely, Zacks upgraded the stock to a "hold."As I will argue, investors should continue avoiding Etsy stock.Etsy expanded a Craft Entrepreneurship program in June.Seasoned sellers on Etsy share their selling experiences on the site.Etsy is helping over 550 people with selling their craft.The program will reach five new cities, for a total of 19 cities participating.By following the crowdsourcing model like Kickstarter, Etsy will introduce buyers to sellers earlier in the phase of the seller's product development.The pilot project is running in the U.S. only, between June 16 and August 16 2015.The company faces major headwinds.Amazon.com's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) handmade marketplace initiative started first by invitation.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>The company reached out to artisans so that they may learn more about the site. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>In Etsy's defense, Amazon's promotional video only has 6,700 views .Still, direct competition with Amazon means Etsy will need to raise the quality and level of customer service.It needs its sellers to stay satisfied.The pressure from Amazon will also mean lower listing fees.While sellers benefit, this will hurt Etsy's revenue and profit margin.Amazon's introductory fee is 12 percent.For the first year (until August 2016), there will be no monthly fees of $39.99.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Amazon.com's entry in the homemade category may also shift the premium pricing of "homemade." (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>This category could become a commodity product if goods are no longer in limited availability and are not easily differentiable. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>In the months ahead, investors should brace for heavy insider selling.In April, a director sold 2.16 million shares at $14.96.This transaction value totaled $32.4 million.There are two short-term catalysts investors should not ignore.First, Amazon.com's entry in the homemade market will lead to a loss in sellers for Etsy.Second, Etsy's valuation is still excessive.The stock, at $13.40 per share, is still 7 times sales and 10.63 times book.By comparison, Overstock.com (NASDAQ: OSTK ), an online retailer that also offers handcrafted products, trades at 0.34 times sales and 4 times book.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Etsy continued developing its community in two ways, but expanding its total addressable market is also hurting the brand, alienating buyers and sellers, and introducing more risk to the business. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Until the company demonstrates meaningful revenue growth arising from the business plan, there are downside risks for investors.
