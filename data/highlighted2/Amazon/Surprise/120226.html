(NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Netflix earnings report had an interesting piece of data in it.That piece of data calls into question what we supposedly know about Amazon.com's Prime membership.Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Prime memberships are supposed to be growing by leaps and bounds.From less than 30 million at Q3 2014 quarter-end, they're supposed to have grown to 40 million by 2014 year-end.And in the last two quarters Amazon.com is supposed to have added a further 4 million members.(Source: IBD, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners ) So what's the riddle I allude to in this article's title?<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Well, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) reported its Q2 2015 earnings yesterday, and within its shareholder letter , we could find this chart: This shows us that in the Spring 2015 reporting period, Netflix had a 36.5% share of peak download internet traffic in North America, which compared to 2.0% for Amazon.com Video. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Thus, Netflix users were generating 18.2x more traffic than Amazon.com users.But that's not really the point.If we search for the previous period statistics by Sandvine.com, we find the following statistics: Amazon.com had 2.6% of the peak traffic.Already, this is sounding strange.Amazon.com lost a lot of share there, because going from 2.6% share to 2.0% share means its share dropped by a full 23%.But there's more.We should also take into account that Netflix had 37.22 million total memberships in Q3 2014 and 39.11 million in Q4 2014 in North America.This averages to 38.17 million memberships in H2 2014.And it had 41.40 million total memberships in Q1 2015 and 42.30 million in Q2 2015, which averages to 41.85 million memberships in H1 2015.As for Amazon.com, it had 30 million Prime memberships in Q3 2014 and 40 million in Q4 2014, which averages to 35 million in H2 2014.And it had 41 million Prime memberships in Q1 2015 and 44 million in Q2 2015, which averages to 42.50 million.So, using the figures calculated previously, Netflix has shown an increase in average memberships from H2 2014 to H1 2015 of 9.7%.This increase allowed it to increase its share of peak download traffic from 34.9% to 36.5%, a 4.6% gain in share, which implies it grew faster than the market.As for Amazon.com, it supposedly had an increase in average Prime memberships from H2 2015 to H1 2015 of 21.4%, which largely outstripped the Netflix gain.Yet, this large increase led to a drop in share of peak download traffic of -23%, which implies it grew a lot slower than the market.This simply doesn't add up.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Even if new Prime members saw no video at all, Amazon.com's share couldn't have fallen as much as it did! (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Indeed, under such a scenario Amazon.com's share would have dropped just around -4.6% instead of -23%.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>So we need to believe one of the following: All of Amazon.com's Prime members are watching much less video - doesn't seem realistic; Sandvine's statistics are all wrong - but its numbers are a sample from real data; or IBD's statistics regarding Prime memberships are all wrong - and remember, its numbers are a guess.
