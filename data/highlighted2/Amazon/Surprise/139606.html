(UNCERTAINTY) </span>Because, unlike other public companies that were (and are) obsessed with meeting and beating short-term shareholder demands, Bezos's game plan was (and is) focused on long-term investments and value creation.And boy, see how well that strategy has paid off for shareholders who have kept their trust in Bezos's game plan... US$ 100 invested in Amazon in its 1997 IPO is now US$ 31,036 - a 310-bagger, or a CAGR of 37.5%.That's huge by any standards, but something just a tiny number of investors - mostly Amazon insiders - must have earned.Most others would've left the ship after earning a 5-, 10-, or 20-bagger.Anyway, there are many invaluable lessons I've learned from Bezos over the years, but these five stand out and have helped me immensely in my roles as an entrepreneur and investor.I'm sure these will benefit you too.This is what Bezos said in an interview in 2011 (emphasis mine)... If everything you do needs to work on a three-year time horizon, then you're competing against a lot of people.But if you're willing to invest on a seven-year time horizon, you're now competing against a fraction of those people, because very few companies are willing to do that.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Just by lengthening the time horizon, you can engage in endeavors that you could never otherwise pursue. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>At Amazon we like things to work in five to seven years.We're willing to plant seeds, let them grow-and we're very stubborn.We say we're stubborn on vision and flexible on details.In some cases, things are inevitable.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>The hard part is that you don't know how long it might take, but you know it will happen if you're patient enough. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Ebooks had to happen.Infrastructure web services had to happen.So you can do these things with conviction if you are long-term-oriented and patient.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>What a wonderful and sustainable moat this is - long-term thinking. (SURPRISE) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Whether you are an entrepreneur or an investor, by thinking and acting (investing) long term, or just by lengthening the time you stay with a good-quality business, you can create wealth you could have never thought of. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Like the CEO of a privately held company who can make decisions for the future without worrying about next quarter's earnings, you can use time arbitrage to benefit from time-tested investment processes without the worry, and often, financial damage that comes from recklessly chasing quick returns. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>2) Focus on What's NOT Going to Change "What's not going to change is what we must focus on!"I tell myself each time I think about the future of Safal Niveshak .<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>And now, Anshul also has to bear with these thoughts, though I am lucky, because this is what he also believes in. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>"Stability", as Bezos mentions above, is what causes companies to endure over long periods of time.Look at the biggest wealth creators in the history of the world or in India.Those have been the most stable businesses that have not changed for years.And I am not talking about companies that did not change despite seeing changes in their industry (Nokia (NYSE: NOK ), MTNL, Kodak (NYSE: KODK ), etc.), but rather about companies that have continued to provide tremendous value to customers (the core of any business), even as they change with changing times.Is the core of this business going/prone to too many changes?Is this business open to disruption?(Anything that can be done via the Internet can be disrupted.)Is the current management too aggressive on growth?Do the customers love this business?Have they loved it for years?Would the business be selling similar products/services 10 years later?<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If the answer is "No" for the first three questions and "Yes" for the last two, it's most probably a good business to own (at the right valuations). (UNCERTAINTY) </span>This lesson holds special relevance for the entrepreneur in me, but I also apply this while analyzing companies."Do the customers love this business and the products/services it sells?"and "Have they loved this business for the past few years?"is what I ask.In hindsight, my biggest successes in investing have come from businesses that pass this test.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Now, it may somewhat be a case of survivorship bias, because some companies that customers have loved have done disastrously for me (like Leela Hotels), but then, the probability of a business doing well for an investor is high when the customers love its products/services over long periods of time. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Honestly speaking, I hate it when companies experiment a lot by venturing into unrelated areas through mindless acquisitions.But continuous experimentation within their circles of competence is an attribute of great entrepreneurs, like Bezos.So this is what I try to apply to my own business.I have had my share of failures and disbelievers - with people calling me names when I started charging a fee for my courses and newsletters, and telling me how these were "doomed to fail when everything is available for free on the Internet."But I have learned to live with this, for as I mentioned above, my focus is intensely on the value I provide to my readers and subscribers and for a really long period of time.Now, this is not something I have learned only from Bezos, simply because I have failed so many times in life that I have been searching for inspiration all around on accepting failure (again and again) but still moving on.I have learned this lesson especially from seeing my daughter grow up.Like when she was just a year old and was trying to take her first steps and repeatedly fell down, she tried again... and again... and again.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Sometimes she laughed. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Sometimes she cried. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Sometimes she laughed and cried at the same time. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>But she kept trying and trying... laughing and crying.She did not label her experience as a "failure".She just enjoyed it.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Unlike us adults, our babies don't know the possibility of a failure, so they happily keep falling down until one day they take a few steps, and then a few more. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Before long, they're jumping and running.All their trying pays off.They fall, but never fail.As grown-ups, what if we also simply choose not to fail?What if we treat our mistakes and failures not as things to be avoided, but things to be cultivated?You're going to make mistakes.You can't play in the game without making any mistakes.I don't think about it, I just move on.Most business mistakes are irreversible setbacks, but you get another chance.There are two things in life that you don't get another chance at - marrying the wrong person and what you do with your children.Business, you just go on.It's a mistake to dwell on mistakes, it's unproductive.It's like Mark Twain's story about the cat that sat on a hot stove - he never sat on a hot stove again, but he never sat on a cold one again either.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Life teaches us each day that stuff happens (and sometimes shit happens!) (UNCERTAINTY) </span>, but we don't need to give each of our experiences a label.Good, bad, hard, easy, success, failure, etc., do not exist but as labels in our minds.All we need to do to hold our head high is to break through these labels.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Conclusion: Bezos's Investing Checklist Over the past two decades, no matter how much its shareholders criticized about all the money Amazon was "wasting", no matter how often analysts opined that it "could never make money" and "would go bankrupt", Amazon (and Bezos) has maintained its relentless focus on the long term and on its customers. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>And this is seemingly the biggest reason it is the only one of the early Internet leaders that is still thriving.Amazon's approach should be a lesson to all companies, not just Internet companies, and also to us investors (because we also wish to identify such companies that would thrive over the long run).<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>In this regard, I believe it would pay a lot to take Bezos's advice on where and how to invest through a thought he shared in his 2014 letter to shareholders ... A dreamy business offering has at least four characteristics. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Customers love it, it can grow to very large size, it has strong returns on capital, and it's durable in time - with the potential to endure for decades.When you find one of these, don't just swipe right, get married.A business customers love, and which Can grow to very large size, and which Has strong returns on capital, and which Is durable in time - with the potential to endure for decades, and which If you find, you must load up and get married to.Finally, whatever people ultimately will remember Jeff Bezos for, there's still a lot we can learn from him right now.Anything you'd like to add about him, his legacy, philosophies, or inventions?Put it in the comments section of this post.I look forward to an enlightening conversation and more lessons from one of the world's best and brightest.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
