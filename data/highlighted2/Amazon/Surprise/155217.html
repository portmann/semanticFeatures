(UNCERTAINTY) </span>There is nothing that can be done to stop the trend; it's a matter of how quickly and deep it will happen, not if it'll happen.www.thestar.com/entertainment/television... The response from the industry to increase the number of original drama shows is further fragmenting the TV market, with over 400 series being offered in 2015 .That doesn't include reality TV shows, which will more than double that amount.It does include original programming from Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and other streaming companies.What investors need to look for with media companies is how exposed they are to ad revenue, and how quickly they're transitioning to alternative content delivery systems.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Creating more content by the larger networks (including Netflix) won't solve the challenges they face, as more and more content is going to be produced and offered online, and there will be an almost endless stream of new content offered going forward. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>There will continue to be winners that draw large audiences, but they will be few and far between, as consumers increasingly gravitate toward niche themes they are interested in.We'll see content from traditional media companies spread across a number of platforms, as in some cases it already is, which will further dilute their broadcast businesses.Again, nothing can stop this from happening because of the demand from consumers to watch video content when, where and how they want to.A number of media industry leaders responded to the downward pressure on their share prices by saying investors over responded to the weak quarter of ESPN.I disagree with that assessment.It was an extremely important bellwether for the industry.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>There is no doubt from the response of investors to the news ESPN lost subscribers, that this was a confirmation the broadcast TV industry was experience significant erosion of its model. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>After all, if ESPN, the most valuable individual TV brand is losing subscribers, it means it can no longer be counted on to keep consumers subscribing to cable and satellite providers.ESPN has been a double-edged sword in that regard for a number of years, as sports fanatics had no issue with paying the extra price to watch their favorite sports and teams.On the other hand, those not interested in sports have complained about having to pay that high of a price for a group of channels they had no interest in.The point is ESPN, because of its brand status, definitely is the canary in the coal mine of traditional TV, and the response to it losing subscribers was a justified one.It will get worse if it continues to lose subscribers in the quarters ahead.If ESPN can't keep linear TV subscribers, the business model is contracting.ESPN is a metric that says the pace of that contraction is quickening.That's why media stocks got clobbered, and rightly so.(click to enlarge) source: StockCharts.com Fragmentation and the consequence of content saturation While it's already happening, the consequence of increased content fragmentation and creation is corporate brands aren't going to be what attracts viewers, but the individual piece of content will be the driver.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>In an attempt to circumvent the growing call and demand for 'a la carte' subscriptions (paying for individual shows), the media industry is going to attempt to maintain a bundle of shows, but offer them in different tiers and quantities. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>However that plays out, the most important thing for investors to realize in this part of the entertainment business, is shows are now the brand, and not the network or business.There is only loyalty to specific shows now, not a specific network.That's been known by most following the industry for some time.Why it's still important is the plethora of content being produced and released upon the public is going to only increase in the years ahead, and now finding shows in niches they're interested in is going to be more difficult for consumers because of the numerous options available to them.Even the niches will have niches, or at minimum, the niches will undergo a growing amount of competition.An obvious example is YouTube, which has a number of popular stars that those watching traditional TV aren't even aware of.They don't even they exist, and don't know to look for them.This is already happening online, and the importance of this is its moving from amateur video to higher production values, which when the content is compelling, competes directly with 'professional' productions.Traditional TV itself is increasing the amount of content it is producing.And even though that is likely to peak in 2015 or 2016, that won't be happening in the streaming world.That's the market media companies have to compete in.By far the most important metric to watch concerning traditional media companies is how exposed they are to ad revenue.That will determine the impact it'll have on the top and bottom lines, as everyone agrees it's going to continue to decrease for some time to come.In an interview with Television Week , John Landgraf, CEO of FX Networks, explained clearly and very effectively how the changing TV ad market needs to be understood.So if I look at the advertising business, for example, I actually get excited about the decline in advertising revenue.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Because, if you think about it, maybe transitioning from the business we have today - where, maybe we have 20 ads in an hour of programming - to a model where we put four ads in instead - will require us to take a decrease in ad revenue of 20%. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>We can't take a decrease of 80% in revenue, but we might be able to figure out a model where we take a decrease of 20%. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>"But you can't take a decrease of 20% if 55% of your revenue is from ad sales - you wouldn't meet the expectations of Wall Street or your bosses.But if ad sales were only 25% of your revenue, a 20% decline, well, that's 5% of total ad revenues, as opposed to 11% of total revenues.And you know what?<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Maybe we could absorb that with some upside elsewhere. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>So in some ways I think you need to wait for the right inflection point to make certain transitions.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If you're interested in investing in media companies with ad exposure, there is nothing more important to understand than what Landgraf stated above. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Ad exposure will determine success. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Those increasing alternative revenue streams to lower that exposure will be those that perform the best. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>In other words, there are two ways to accomplish that.It can be done as Landgraf mentioned, by decreasing the number of ads shown, or it can be done by boosting revenue in other areas.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Either way, ad exposure would decrease as a percentage of revenue. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Any media company not improving that metric will experience downward pressure.seekingalpha.com/article/3453326-this-is... Recently I dove deep into what market pressures would bring Netflix down , and those being described in this article are a big part of it; not on the ad side, but on the side of fragmented niche content.Netflix must be considered a network by investors if they're to understand the future challenges it faces.With that in mind, it will have to find ways to overcome the same content saturation challenges traditional networks have.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Sure, Netflix had to increase the amount of original content it had in order to differentiate, and that is what has made it a network. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>It now has 36 scripted series, which accounts for part of the 400+ series being offered on network TV.When you include HBO, which has 25, and FX networks, which have another 20 original shows, that accounts for about 20 percent of the original series in 2015.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>What is interesting there is major content producers are looking to Netflix as a major revenue source going forward, and it could be significantly disrupted by a growing number of niche digital series that attract an individually small number of viewers, but when added together, will be a significant force to deal with. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>In the short term I don't see that being an issue for the industry, but over time, Netflix is going to shrink.The trend isn't going to go away.There are too many creative people looking to produce and release their video content for the world to see.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>With production costs continuing to fall, barriers to entry are very low for anyone that wants to tell a good story or produce comedy or different forms of reality TV content. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>That is the core of the threat the industry faces; even a first-move like Netflix, which will eventually find out it won't be able to maintain its subscriber base once it reaches a saturation point.Again, I don't see this happening in the immediate future, but there will be a growing number of producers creating all sorts of niche content that will eat away at the companies airing or streaming general content.Netflix will be one of them.With many markets in a bubble, I have been focusing on a recession as being a key factor in shaking up industries.With China and Japan faltering, and data showing the U.S. economy is weakening, it's only a matter of time before the next recession rolls around.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Concerning media, ad revenue and niche content growth, there is no doubt a recession will increase the pace of the disruption, as marketers cut back on spending, while the streaming subscription options soar. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>The impact on ad revenue is obvious, but what isn't being thought of as much is the impact on subscription and retransmission revenue.By retransmission revenue, here I'm referring to content sold to companies like Netflix and Amazon.As the number of streaming niche content channels or individual series grow, there will be spending from a large number of viewers on them.Under a recession environment, that means choices will have to be made as to what content to continue to pay for and which to abandon.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>What that suggests is a recession will hasten the disruptive process, which will then reveal the depth of the content disruption and how consumers view the niche channels or series against general content providers. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Content subscription options will continue to grow even as the economy slows.How I see that playing out is further fragmentation of the video industry, even if some of the larger, emerging content producers are acquired by traditional media, as some already have been, such as Maker Studios and AwesomenessTV.The performance of ESPN is definitely a bellwether of the traditional broadcast industry, and I find no problem with investors getting concerned in light of it losing a "moderate" number of subscribers.It has even brought a response from Disney that it is open to considering offering it as a standalone service.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>It has mentioned that in the past, but in a more casual way that suggested it would be a long way off. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>I don't think the pace of the disruption will allow Disney to be lethargic with ESPN.While that points to cord cutting, the metric to watch is ad spend; the two are of course directly correlated, because if there are less eyeballs watching, obviously brands will pay less for advertising on TV.They already are.The other metric is how much a particular company is exposed to advertising.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>For example, Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ) is in a very strong position there, with approximately 16 percent of its revenue coming from ads. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Consequently, it'll be much less susceptible to performance surprises than those media companies with much more ad exposure. (SURPRISE) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Also look to see what management is saying about lowering ad exposure. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Finally, two forces heading for a collision are the demand for a la carte and the industries conviction it may not survive if it doesn't maintain a content bundle in some form, even if it isn't what is being offered now. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>That resistance from the industry comes from what happened when music albums were unbundled.Streaming content and subscription options are going to continue to soar.Now we'll have to wait and watch to see if traditional media companies, and even new players like giant Netflix will be able to hold their models together as the number of individual stars and series explode in number on the Internet.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
