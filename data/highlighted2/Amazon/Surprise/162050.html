(NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon is out with a Dash button expansion.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>I believe this product launch will be helpful to EPS expansion in that it is near-zero capex, should increase volumes, and should also increase ARPU. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is out with an update on its young Dash button product/endeavor.The company has had a series of excellent product launches dating back the last 24 months, and none have been more well-timed or more customer-aware than that of the Dash buttons.Dash buttons - wifi-connected, IoT devices that allow for ordering of product with a click of a button - are very simple in idea, but potentially game changing from an execution and launch standpoint.I view Dash buttons as an extremely highly visible and realistic immediate-term EPS expansion product, inclusive of the $5.99/button cost that Amazon has now promised to refund upon first order.I do not, as some have opined, view Dash buttons as a loss leader , but as an efficiency and margin driver.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Being so early into launch and so early into Dash button vendor inventory build-out, I don't want to speculate as to how much EPS expansion the company should see, but I do expect this to immediately contribute, with the contribution growing as the product/endeavor matures. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>To state this clearly and simply, Dash buttons are a near-zero capex product launch that I believe will expand overall sales volume (which in itself leverages fixed costs and creates margin expansion) and will expand Amazon's version of ARPU. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>ARPU expansion will also work to leverage fixed costs and to create trickle-down EPS expansion.This model layover is smart and it is low-risk.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>The only risk that I see is that Amazon refunds the initial $5.99 charge, which it does upon first purchase per button, and takes a net loss on the total transaction. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>My guess is that even this isn't very realistic, as the company is most likely putting the brands associated with the buttons on the hook for most of the cost exposure. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Still, that is a risk. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Now, while I understand that ordering product from the Amazon app is easy enough, and re-orders take the proficient user roughly 15 seconds to complete, I am extremely bullish on the use case expansion and the intent placement of Amazon's value prop with Dash buttons. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Intent is a rare commodity that several companies across tech, including marketing platforms, relationship management platforms, and contact management platforms, have tried to control and create.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Amazon's Dash buttons, I believe will be able to do just this - as elusive as that may seem. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Yes, Amazon's app is easy-to-use Dash buttons are easier in requiring fewer steps.This should remove at least some of the overall friction to order and expand the top of the sales funnel.Yes, Amazon's mobile app is mobile and physically with users at all times, putting access to the seemingly endless inventory at ready reach, but Dash buttons are present at the time of having a need (at the inception of the need).<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Assuming users have the app installed and check their phone often, Amazon is a near-constant visual reminder of purchases that might need to be made, and this has obviously benefited the company to this point. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Dash buttons, assuming they are installed in relevant locations (for example, users place the Tide button on their washer machine), are even more visual and even more relevant. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Amazon, because of its closing of the distance between intent realization and value prop, has greatly limited the opportunity for sales loss.The company now offers users the ability to order when the intent is fresh and when the value prop of its service is greatest.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Being closer to the need and closer to the realization of the need is prime real estate for advertisement placement - real estate that the company not only now has access to, but that I believe Amazon will have user/shoppers proactively placing it in. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Amazon is now building a direct pipeline from its store to the becoming smarter (more IoT) home.Being able to give users a wider selection of buttons based on brand preference will only help drive the visibility of Dash buttons, in my opinion.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>I believe this will also mean greater usage by volume and that this will mean greater spend per customer (again, especially as Amazon builds out its Dash buttons inventory). (UNCERTAINTY) </span>This should also mean use case expansion.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Imagine setting up an Amazon account for an older relative or maybe a senior whom you're trying to make life a little easier for. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Now, you can deploy Dash buttons and give this individual immediate access to shopping.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>I believe this to be a less-friction option than trying to educate the individual as to how to use the mobile or desktop ordering service. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>But maybe the biggest longer-term opportunity for Amazon - though the company hasn't alluded to this in any way - is that it will be able to collect even more dialed-in analytics. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Amazon has the order data being sent to it from individual buttons - one would think it could use the data from multiple buttons in aggregate to help form learnings. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Amazon now has the possibility of being able to sell to its vendors data that helps them turn inventory quicker. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Or data that helps dial in marketing.Think about Tide running an advertisement on TV that allows for a discounted price on an Amazon order, but only via the Dash button and only within five minutes of the commercial airing.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Tide could test marketing penetration and take-rate. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>This would be incredibly valuable data - data that, in part, drives the market capitalization of companies like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ).<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>In any case, I believe this launch and expansion is going to be meaningful to the company's financials in the immediate and near terms. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Should Amazon be able to drive high volume ordering, higher average ticket ordering, or be able to more refine its total marketing strategy via Dash button data, look for its EPS to expand as a result.Of course, this would be good for the equity price and for forward-looking modeling.Forward-looking modeling revisions would be productive to valuation multiples, which would also be good for the equity price.I view Dash buttons as a low-risk, low-cost, potentially significant contributor to EPS expansion.Disclosure: I am/we are long FB, TWTR.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
