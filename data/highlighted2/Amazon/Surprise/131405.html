(UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Strategically this makes sense, as it optimizes node efficiency on a higher-margin product. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>The integration of FPGAs will boost compute performance for large-scale cloud vendors, which will result in a more virtuous cycle for Intel.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Demand seems robust as demanding use cases have cropped up over the years. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>The market has expanded in response to more powerful parts, which is counter intuitive.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) Data Center Group seems to be on the right track. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>In fact, it's the only division that seems to be getting it right these days as the various other segments have under performed due to competitive issues or market dependent issues. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>The stock has already responded to the weakness in PC fundamentals, and should eventually find some support on the back of reassuring comments from management on DCG and ongoing developments in the data storage space.I reviewed the Q&A session of Jason Waxman (DCG Group Vice President), which can be accessed on Intel's Investor Relations website.The conference got through a lot of pertinent information, which helped me to further understand the durability of earnings going forward.I can't cover everything, but I'm going to cover the three most pertinent points that surfaced throughout the conference call.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Intel's DCG may run on a tick tock cycle whereas PCCG will run on tick tock tock. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>This makes sense, because server chips have higher margins, and the initial ramp of a new process node tends to compress gross margins due to less-than-optimal yields.So, pushing the server chips into a more advanced node will sustain Intel's competitive advantage without impacting margins as significantly.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>This gives Intel time to optimize for 10nm on the server side, and develop more advanced architecture on the consumer side. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>By the time consumer chips reach 10 nm Intel will be able to maximize wafer production, and conversion of 14nm capacity to 10 nm will be less cost intensive.The acquisition of Altera will give Intel the ability to create a truly comprehensive platform for co-processors and GPGPUs.For algorithms that are repetitive in nature, i.e. file compressions, crypto currency mining and various other compute heavy tasks that are heavily repetitive, FPGAs fill in the hole.Furthermore, the energy efficiency, and the ability to scale the FPGAs is a huge selling point for top cloud vendors.The companies looking to implement FPGAs are at the cutting edge, so think in terms of Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), IBM (NYSE: IBM ), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ).The performance advantage of a fully integrated platform has left alternative server ecosystems dead in the water i.e. ARM based servers.Intel doesn't see meaningful deceleration in chip volumes even as reports indicate that the top cloud vendors are expected to reduce capex growth pertaining to data centers.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Perhaps, demand is coming from alternative sources? (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>The growth rate in DCG seems to have held up pretty well, which speaks volumes about the demanding computing needs that are being offloaded onto servers rather than being run on PCs. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Ideally Intel should have had a robust PCCG and DCG business, but at least mobile growth comes accompanied with more demanding data center usage on the back-end.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>To conclude, Intel is in a position of strength in the data center space, and I don't anticipate competitors to encroach upon those higher power envelopes. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Intel has optimized its server CPU architecture over the years. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>The simplicity of a cloud build out using Xeon CPUs and the better total cost of ownership has mitigated much of the hype presented by alternative platforms.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Therefore, the high growth nature of the business and the mix-shift to higher-margin SKUs across server class-CPUs keeps me optimistic. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>However, I didn't see any shift in prior financial guidance throughout the conference call, therefore, I continue to reiterate my $31.10 price target.I'm also reiterating my hold rating.Source: Intel's Saving Grace: The Data Center Group Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
