(NASDAQ:ETSY) | Seeking Alpha Bears mauled Etsy stock price by sending it down over 28% to $13.78.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>The cost of Handmade at Amazon may limit the number of Etsy sellers thinking of moving. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>The stock price of Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY ) was crushed after the release of earnings.The stock fell to $13.78, down $5.45 or over 28% on the day.Etsy's stock is flagged as hard to borrow, with over 10.5 million shares sold short as of July 15.Today the Bears won.Product listing growth at Etsy continues to increase, see chart below.The growth in listings is encouraging as it shows sellers continue to engage and list products.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>There has been some concern in the market that new Handmade at Amazon marketplace might affect listings. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Listings flat-lined in late May and June but have grown nicely since June 30. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>The flat-line in listing growth might have been a result of negative reports on counterfeit goods and the Amazon handmade initiative. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Whatever the reason, it appears that listing growth has reappeared. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>This is a welcomed development.Will Etsy sellers jump ship after building a following on Etsy for a new Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) platform?<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Some might. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>However, it reminds me of sites trying to lure eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ) sellers' away decades ago.Jumping to a new platform will require time and effort to learn.As the saying goes, "time is money."Additionally, the goodwill and reputation built on Etsy will require establishing on a new site.Will established sellers want to start from scratch?<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Some might, but many might not. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Then there is the question of the search results that track back to Etsy.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>A seller that abandons Etsy may confuse buyers and or help the sales of the sellers that stay. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Competition can be good for the marketplace, so the Amazon offering should not be feared. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Competition can make all platforms stronger and dynamic.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>It might also help expand the handmade market. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>On Amazon a search on "handmade" returns 5,547,802 items.On Etsy, the handmade category returned 23,973,573 items while a search on "handmade" returns 3,206,338 items.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Amazon may have a larger user base, but Etsy has more handmade items listed. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>A search on eBay for "handmade" returns 3,688,309 items.Again, Etsy has more items with fewer sellers.A product handmade by one of twenty employees is okay.A product handmade by one of one-hundred collective members is okay.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>However, a product handmade by a different artisan is not okay. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>What happens if the artisan is one of the twenty employees, or one of the one-hundred collective members?<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>MarketWatch has an article titled "Angry at Etsy, sellers and buyers may eye Amazon." (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>In part, it says: "We believe many sellers angered by the increasing presence of mass-manufactured and counterfeit goods on Etsy are likely to shift items to Handmade at Amazon," the analysts wrote. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Might the sellers and buyers consider products made by 20 to 100, as permitted by Amazon to be "mass-manufactured?" (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>I think they might. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If so, they might decide it is not worth moving to Amazon. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>A Professional Seller account is required for artisans to list on Handmade at Amazon .The $39.99 monthly fee ($479.88 annually) will be waived until August 1, 2016.The yearly Amazon seller fee exceeds the average gross merchandise sales ($458.60) generated by the average Etsy seller, see table below.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>The yearly cost of Handmade at Amazon might limit the number of Etsy sellers that could benefit from a move. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Without a broad offering of handmade items, it is unclear how attractive the Amazon marketplace might become. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Amazon and eBay are major competitors, however; their size might hinder attracting the craft or handmade seller. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>The Handmade at Amazon platform is not currently live.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>So the size of the product selection is unknown. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Comments on the Etsy discussion board suggest that some sellers appear interested in expanding where they list items and not deserting Etsy.

(UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>It might be worthwhile for management to consider a listing cap for new sellers as a way to help control bad debt expense. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>The weakness the stock price before and after earnings may provide investors a decent entry point.
