Lohier Jr.Apple had no immediate comment to the WSJ.It can now either ask the Second Circuit to hear the case or ask the U.S. Supreme Court to take it up.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Click to print (Opens in new window) Apple�s Appeal Of E-Book Price-Fixing Verdict May Hinge On Court�s View Of Amazon Two States Probe Apple Music Over Antitrust Concerns With No Credit Cards Allowed, No Cash In ATMs, No Banks Open, Tourists In Trouble In Greece All Major U.S. Airlines Offer Free Cancellations Within 24 Hours, Except One United Airlines Flight Forced To Turn Around After Passenger Refuses To Stop Smoking Now Available At Petco: One Long-Tailed Grass Lizard Skeleton For Only $9.99 Consumerist is currently testing a new user experience.$UNCERTAINTY</span>If you received an invitation to participate in the beta test, please sign-in below.If you are part of the beta test group, you will receive a link that will allow you to create a new password.If you are not part of the test group, you can learn more here .Email check failed, please try again</div></body></html>
