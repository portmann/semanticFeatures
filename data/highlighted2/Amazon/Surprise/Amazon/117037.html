(NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon going on the defensive in its most important business.Wal-Mart looking to grow its online business as it struggles at its physical stores.The growing and very successful subscription service of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) - Amazon Prime - has been doing well enough to attract the attention of its key retail competitor - Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) - which in June announced it would compete against Amazon Prime with its own subscription service named "Shipping Pass," which will cost about half of $99 per year Prime subscribers must pay.For some time I've known the key to Amazon's current and future success will be the growth trajectory of Amazon Prime.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>The attack from Wal-Mart confirms it has been making a lot of headway, and presumably is not only taking enough business away from the struggling Wal-Mart to cause the Bentonville company to take this type of action, but shows it is considered a significant future threat as well.$UNCERTAINTY</span>On the other hand, the quick response by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos to the attack on its flagship business also confirms he can't allow Wal-Mart to take away market share.If that were to happen, I don't see Amazon having the ability to become profitable on a consistent basis.That means this is going to be an entertaining but expensive battle now and in the future.Early outlook for Wal-Mart's Shipping Pass Although the first phase of Shipping Pass was launched in June, it will take time for the company to completely roll it out.That has given Amazon time to formulate a response, and it has.We'll get into that a little later.Citing a survey from Prosper Insights, CNBC said the response of the 6,000 people asked about whether or not they'd acquired a membership from Wal-Mart, only 12.4 percent said they "were 'likely' or 'very likely' to sign up for Shipping Pass."<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Working that out, it suggests approximately 18 million households would participate in the service.$UNCERTAINTY</span>That is in comparison to the estimated 40 million subscribers Amazon Prime has.And it still has growth momentum for the service.One bright spot to the survey was close to 50 percent of respondents said they were millennials.The other was those that were open to subscribing had incomes about 5 percent above the usual Wal-Mart shopper.When the service is fully rolled out, what will determine the depth of its attraction to consumers will be what else it adds to the service.I think it'll have to be more than competing on price alone.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Subscription service success in a variety of businesses depends upon the perception of value.$UNCERTAINTY</span>That's what makes them attractive to users.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Being an expert on taking costs out of its products, Wal-Mart may have a slight advantage on Amazon there, although that hasn't helped the company through the years, as Amazon continued and continues to perfects its business model.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>One area that AMZN may be vulnerable in is when the next recession comes.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Shoppers have traditionally gravitated to Wal-Mart when times get tough.Even higher-end shoppers ended up in the aisles of Wal-Mart during the Great Recession.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>That could happen again.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>That is where consumers could abandon Amazon Prime for what is perceived to be, or in reality is, a less-expensive alternative.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Finally, if consumers consider the ability to return an item to a physical store as highly valuable, that is another area WMT would have an advantage.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Amazon is of course at a strong advantage in this battle, and will be for a long time - assuming Wal-Mart continues to push forward with this; giving it time to scale to its potential.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Even though WMT is marketing Shipping Pass as a low-cost alternative to Prime, it has a lot of obstacles to overcome before it is able to convince consumers to give it a try.First is its brand, which is very strong.I felt that way when I first heard what Amazon was going to call its subscription service.Shipping Pass doesn't have that same feel to me as Amazon Prime.That said, Wal-Mart will have an uphill climb in its branding efforts to get this name positioned in the minds of consumers.The most obvious perk of Prime membership is its video streaming service.It generates reluctance to leave.A number of analysts and commentators attempt to compare it with Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), as if that's the company it is competing against.They're wrong.This is about lowering churn, not competing directly in the streaming video market.That doesn't mean Amazon isn't working at making it an excellent service.Because it is.What it means is the priority isn't to become the top video streaming company in the world.The goal is to become the top digital retailer in the world.Streaming video is a means to that end.Since Wal-Mart will have to come up with its own perks to attract and maintain subscribers, and since it's taking a page directly out of Amazon's playbook, it'll be interesting to see if it includes a streaming service as part of the subscription price, in a similar way Amazon has.Another feature that keeps consumers from abandoning Prime is its cloud photo storage service, which allows for an unlimited number of photos to be saved there.There is also the free two-day shipping feature which is very popular with subscribers.In this regard from the introduction of Shipping Pass, Amazon has Wal-Mart beat, as at this time it only offers free three-day shipping.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>As mentioned about the threat that could come from the next recession, Amazon will have to continue to add value to Prime to the point it'll be hard for consumers to leave it.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Battle for subscribers already underway It didn't take long for Bezos to respond to the new competition, as he announced there will be a gigantic sales event on July 15 which will be only available to members of Prime.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>The strategy is to circumvent Wal-Mart's new service by getting press coverage and further exposure of Prime to the general public.$UNCERTAINTY</span>The end result is Amazon is using the new competitive environment to generate further interest and win new subscribers to the service.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>That could also lower interest in Wal-Mart's still relatively unknown Shipping Pass, which could lower the interest in signing up for it.$UNCERTAINTY</span>WMT has responded to "Prime Day" with its own sales initiative, where it has the marketing pitch it will include ""more deals than Black Friday."Even though Amazon got the first strike in, Wal-Mart is launching its sale the day after Amazon's, offering over 2,000 discounts through its online channels.Also, to be more competitive, WMT decided to change its initial free shipping offer from orders of $50 to orders of $35.To attract a large number of potential subscribers, Wal-Mart will offer the sale over a period of 90 days.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>I have no doubt Amazon won't just sit there and let Wal-Mart do that without further responses.$UNCERTAINTY</span>This has the potential to be a serious threat to Amazon, in light of the fact Amazon Prime is the way it decided to move toward being sustainably profitable.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Amazon has online sales of approximately 6 times the $12.2 billion Wal-Mart has, but that could change quickly if Wal-Mart can do this right.$UNCERTAINTY</span>As already mentioned, the big challenge will be when the next recession comes, as consumers are socialized into gravitating toward Wal-Mart to stretch their dollars during tough economic times.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>With its added value at this time and under these economic conditions, I would be surprised to see AMZN's subscriber base abandon Prime and try out Wal-Mart instead.$SURPRISE</span>How WMT adds value going forward is a key to the competitive level it decides to compete at.There is also the added costs of adding value that must be considered, and as Amazon already found out, it had to boost its Prime subscription fee in order to cover rising shipping costs.Wal-Mart will eventually be faced with similar challenges.What remains to be seen is if the online retail subscription market grows from all of this, or Amazon and Wal-Mart fight over mostly the same consumers.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>It appears there are many millions of consumers to compete over that aren't part of Prime at this time, and it will force a powerful response from both companies in order to attract them.$UNCERTAINTY</span>The cost to do so is what is of concern to me for both companies, and that is already going to put pressure on margin, based upon the decisions of both to offer major discounts in the early stages of the battle.On Wal-Mart's part, the company knows this is the future of retail, and as younger people age, the existing customer base that prefers to shop at the physical store will shrink, which means it must find a way to get ahead of that before it crushes the company.For Amazon, this is really the first time since it become the online retail market leader that it faced this level of threat from a company large enough to do some serious damage.It has put it on the defensive in the segment of the company that is being counted on to generate consistent earnings.How it responds will dictate the future of the company.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>I believe Prime is that critical to it at this point in time.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Source: Wal-Mart Going After The Heart Of The Amazon Beast Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72
