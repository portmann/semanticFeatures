(NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon recently purchased 2lemetry, an IoT platform vendor.2lemetry provides a way for the company to establish itself in the growing enterprise IoT field.Amazon can then leverage a foothold in enterprise IoT to sell additional cloud services.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has a reputation for dabbling in a wide variety of industries outside of its ecommerce origins.$UNCERTAINTY</span>These side ventures include everything from AWS (Amazon Web Services) to Kindle tablets to streaming media devices.Most recently, the company acquired 2lemetry , a company that develops Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions for enterprises.Some of the initial coverage of this acquisition has focused on Amazon jumping into yet another new category, or on 2lemetry's retail-focused offerings.However, instead of viewing this as a new venture, the acquisition is better seen as a play by Amazon to help cement AWS as the go-to cloud service for enterprise.I've previously written about the potential of B2B-focused IoT companies and the opportunity this market presents.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Many companies are just beginning to connect their machinery (and create "smart" factories), and the IoT market is estimated to grow to approximately $14 trillion by 2020 .$UNCERTAINTY</span>Vendors that can get in on the ground floor of this transition can set themselves up for long-term success.2lemetry's ThingFabric platform operates in this enterprise IoT niche.It essentially helps companies connect their machines together and then export the data to various enterprise apps.2lemetry's current client list includes a few major names, such as Honeywell (NYSE: HON ) and Demeter Power Group.The real potential for Amazon, though, isn't in just getting companies to connect their machines using Amazon-powered tech - it's in selling enterprise companies an entire integrated stack of connectivity, storage, and analytics products through AWS.2lemetry is a step in that direction.It's been clear for a while that cloud storage alone isn't a fantastic business.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>For the last few years Amazon, Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) have been locked in a price war that's quickly driving storage costs to almost zero .$UNCERTAINTY</span>Google's Nearline service , which offers 1GB of storage for $0.01, is just the latest development in this spiral.The money lies in the services and applications that companies can offer on top of these storage platforms.Enterprise IoT is a particularly nice opportunity for Amazon (and other cloud providers), because it requires a large stack of platforms to work fully.Enterprises need to connect their devices and machines together, which is where 2lemetry's technology comes into play.They need a way to store all of the resulting data, which is where AWS storage is key (this will likely one day be provided as a free value-add).Then, enterprises need a way to sort and analyze all this data in order to help them make business decisions (the original promise of IoT).Amazon will now be able to directly offer two of these three services in an integrated offering.And while it doesn't currently offer a true business intelligence product, it does provide the infrastructure for some of the most popular ones.When assessing the viability and market position of AWS, investors should consider Amazon's IoT services an integral component of that strategy.2lemetry's platform allows Amazon to establish a foothold in the growing enterprise IoT market, which can be leveraged to later sell additional AWS services.In this way, the acquisition really isn't about expanding into a new vertical, but rather, strengthening the company's current offerings.In next few weeks, I'll be writing more about the opportunities that IoT (both consumer and business-facing) presents for new and established companies.This will include a larger overview of the general IoT landscape that assesses which established tech companies are leading the pack.Source: How 2lemetry Plays Into Amazon's Cloud Computing Strategy Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
