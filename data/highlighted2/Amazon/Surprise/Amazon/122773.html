(NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha AMZN will report on the 23rd with consensus expecting -$0.14 in EPS and $22.37b in revenue.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Prime ecosystem could gain further traction, a negative to eBay.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) will report its quarter on the 23rd.Consensus expects a loss of $0.14 and $22.37b in revenue.Heading in the quarter, I will be focusing on the status of the Prime ecosystem and performance of the AWS segment.Judging by the solid performance we saw from both segments last quarter, I would remain bullish on AMZN shares.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>For Prime, the ecosystem is gaining traction in North America and I believe that the higher penetration over time will make AMZN a stickier ecommerce platform, which will be a negative for rival eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ).$UNCERTAINTY</span>One interesting data point is the recent Prime Day when we saw sales on that single day surpassing that of Black Friday.It is quite impressive given that Prime Day was limited to AMZN Prime users rather than all the consumers.The idea of Prime shoppers generating sales that was more than that generated by both Prime and non-Prime shoppers on Black Friday is simply mind boggling and it really highlights the stickiness and the adoption of the Prime ecosystem.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>The combination of cloud service, online video and two-day shipping already offer the consumers significant value-add, and I believe that AMZN will continue to expand Prime services similar to that of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) adding services such as Music and potentially web TV to strengthen its ecosystem.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>One area that AMZN could consider is the potential entry into wireless services by becoming an MVNO similar to Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) by offering Prime members an additional wireless service on AMZN's own smartphone.$UNCERTAINTY</span>This will not only allow higher ecosystem penetration but also would be accretive to AMZN's hardware initiative.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>While I agree that the first Amazon phone was not as successful as expected, I believe that the added wireless service could be an attractive value proposition.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Recall that last quarter Amazon's AWS sale was significantly higher than its second largest rival, Microsoft Azure, which had around $700m in sales last year.More importantly, AMZN was able to achieve 14% operating margin despite the competitive price war among the cloud service providers.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Given that pricing appears to be stabilizing, I expect AWS to accelerate its growth this quarter and when AMZN ventures deep into the SaaS market via its WorkMail application and Internet of Things services.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Looking at the long term, pricing will likely to come down so one differentiator is the level of services and customer relationship that a vendor establishes over the years.$UNCERTAINTY</span>AMZN has been building relationships with developers who trust AWS's reliability, functionality and ease of use.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>With competition likely to increase in the long run, I believe that the relationships AMZN have accumulated will allow the company to ensure a stable market share.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Source: Amazon: Price Ecosystem Expanding, AWS Accelerating Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
