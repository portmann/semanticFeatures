the final portion of a package's journey that takes it from a retailer's warehouse or store to the customer's front door - becomes the next battleground for retailers trying to increase online sales.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Macy's has one possible advantage over Amazon in that it has 886 stores as of May 2 in the U.S. from which to source products for delivery – meaning the packages often have less distance to travel - against 50 fulfilment centers and smaller distribution facilities run by Amazon.$UNCERTAINTY</span>But fast shipping is costly and most retailers who offer it currently lose money on the service, warn logistics experts.For example, analysts estimate that Amazon loses $1 billion to $2 billion a year on its U.S. Prime service, which promises delivery within anything from one hour to two days.Amazon's net shipping cost rose to $4.2 billion in 2014, up from $3.5 billion a year earlier.Macy's spokesman Jim Sluzewski confirmed the retailer's plans to expand the service this year but declined to give further details.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Faster delivery also becomes a differentiating factor when new online retail sites like Jet.com, which launched on Tuesday,  promise to offer cheaper prices than Amazon.$UNCERTAINTY</span>The startup, which will charge $49 a year for membership, claims its consumers can get the lowest price on anything they buy online, with the trade-off of being relatively slow delivery service.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Even as Macy's rushes to extend fast delivery, many other traditional retailers are far more cautious.$UNCERTAINTY</span>The costs of same-day delivery and ambivalence from many customers remain concerns, analysts say.Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) has offered same-day delivery for $15 since 2011, but the service is still only available in three markets: Seattle and Bellevue in Washington state, and La Jolla in California.A January survey of 5,118 online shoppers by UPS and Comscore found that 85 percent of people surveyed were willing to wait five days or more for their delivery."The thing that's so perplexing about this last mile and same day is that the consumers overwhelmingly prefer free shipping over speed," said Satish Jindel, a logistics consultant and president of SJ Consulting Group.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>That could change, said David Bell, a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, and if consumers became accustomed to same-day service, the result would be an expensive "race to the bottom for retailers" who would not be able to compete with Amazon on the delivery cost.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Macy's does not disclose how many items it has available for same-day delivery, and Deliv will not say how many items it carries for Macy's.Amazon has more than a million products available for same-day delivery.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Macy's charges its customers $5 for same-day delivery, but it is unclear how much of its costs that covers.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Deliv says its rates for retailers are in line with the average $8 ground delivery cost of carriers such as UPS and FedEx, but it was unclear whether that's what it charges Macy's or whether it takes a loss to offer the service to Macy's.$UNCERTAINTY</span>"It's very hard to compete with Amazon, but traditional retailers have an advantage in that they already have all of their inventory in place five miles from 90 percent of their purchasing population at their stores," said Deliv CEO Daphne Carmeli."This is one of those opportunities to out-Amazon Amazon," she said.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Although Macy's does not break out details of its online sales or shipping costs, analysts assume the company is losing money on the service once additional costs are taken into account, including finding the product, getting the package ready for delivery, and restocking expenses.$UNCERTAINTY</span>"Only the biggest of retailers that are capable will be able to afford these operations," said Jarrett Streebin, the CEO of EasyPost, a shipping startup.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>He estimated costs per package could reach $20 or more with additional logistics processes and staffing to handle the orders.$UNCERTAINTY</span>"Who's willing to pay the bill?"he asked.Thomson Reuters is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, providing investing news , world news , business news , technology news , headline news, small business news , news alerts, personal finance , stock market , and mutual funds information available on Reuters.com, video , mobile , and interactive television platforms.Thomson Reuters journalists are subject to an Editorial Handbook which requires fair presentation and disclosure of relevant interests.NYSE and AMEX quotes delayed by at least 20 minutes.Nasdaq delayed by at least 15 minutes.For a complete list of exchanges and delays, please click here .</div></body></html>
