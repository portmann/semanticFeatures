Must Face Trademark Lawsuit Over Wristwatch Search Results – Consumerist Whoops!It looks like portions of our site are being blocked!Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If Amazon doesn�t sell a specific product I�m looking for, should it simply tell me �Sorry, nothing here� or should it bring up a slate of other, possibly similar, competing products?$UNCERTAINTY</span>To one high-end watchmaker that�s been involved in a four-year legal battle with Amazon, these questionable search results aren�t just an annoyance but constitute trademark infringement.And yesterday, a federal appeals panel said Amazon must face this trademark complaint in court.In a 2-1 opinion [ PDF ], the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a lower court ruling that Amazon would not have to go to trial over a trademark dispute with watchmaker Multi Time Machine Inc.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>MTM first filed the lawsuit against Amazon back in 2011, claiming the retailer�s search results cause confusion for its potential buyers.$UNCERTAINTY</span>MTM sells its watches directly to consumers and not through other retailers, including Amazon.However, MTM�s suit claims that when an individual searches for the military-style watch on Amazon the results turn up a list that includes several trademarked �MTM Special Ops� references in the search field and immediately below the search field, a list of similar products, and no indication that the online retailer doesn�t actually carry the products.Once the customer has clicked on a particular result, he will see the particular product’s brand name and the product title, which also shows the brand name (e.g., Luminox),� MTM contends in its suit.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>On the top of the product detail page, the customer’s initial inquiry, �MTM Special Ops,� will still appear in the search field.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Nothing on either of the pages states that Amazon does not carry MTM products.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>According to MTM, these results could cause customers to buy from a competing watchmaker.$UNCERTAINTY</span>The company says that other online retailers like Overstock.com and Buy.com do not subscribe to the same search methods and instead clearly state that no search result match a search for �MTM Special Ops.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>MTM asserts that even if shoppers knew they weren�t purchasing from the company, the list generated by Amazon could cause �initial interest confusion,� a point the appeals court�s opinion agreed with.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>The [Los Angeles] district court found Amazon’s use of MTM’s trademark created no likelihood of confusion as a matter of law,� the Appeals Court opinion states.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>But we think a jury could find that Amazon has created a likelihood of confusion.$UNCERTAINTY</span>We therefore reverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of Amazon.In reversing the lower court�s decision, the appeals panel disagreed with Amazon�s defense that using �MTM Special Ops� as a search on the site didn�t constitute �use in commerce,� which means the bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade.This court has held that use of a trademark as a search engine keyword that triggers the display of a competitor’s advertisement is a �use in commerce� under the Lanham Act ,� the opinion states.We hold that the customer-generated use of a trademark in the retail search context is a use in commerce.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>In a dissent for the court, 9th Circuit Judge Barry Silverman wrote that Amazon�s search page clearly labels products with their manufacturer�s names, concluding that �there was no likelihood of consumer deception as a matter of law because no reasonable consumer could have been deceived by the label/advertisement at issue.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Click to print (Opens in new window) Tagged With:
