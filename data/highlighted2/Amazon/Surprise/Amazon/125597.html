Penney Co. and Nordstrom Inc., according to sales receipts.Jet’s prices for the same 12 items added up to $275.55, an average discount of about 11% from the prices Jet paid for those items on other retailers’ websites.Jet’s total cost, which also includes estimated shipping and taxes, was $518.46.So in other words, the 11% pricing discount above is not due to an awesome business model yet.They are being artificially suppressed with investor money.Now, spending venture capital funds in the search for rapid growth is common for internet start-ups, but I don�t remember any of my early Amazon orders coming in a Barnes & Noble box.As a consumer, I suppose the best thing to do is simply enjoy the loss-leader savings during your free trial and then decide if it�s worth $50 a year.Costco is highly profitable but even they offer their $4.99 rotisserie chickens as a loss-leader, losing $40 million a year in order to keep people coming in the door.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If you signed up with Jet earlier, don�t forget that you may have gotten a 6-month free trial.$UNCERTAINTY</span>(The trial doesn�t start until your first purchase.)If you sign up now, you can still get a 3-month free trial.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Notify me of followup comments via e-mail Previous: 4 Different Rules of Thumb For How Much House You Can Afford I'm Jonathan and I've been writing about money since 2004.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Father of two, DIY investor, aspiring early retiree, and perpetual learner.Learn more about me and my money .Jet.com: Loss Leader Pricing on Everything?MyMoneyBlog.com is for informational purposes only.Do not take it as legal, financial, or tax advice for your personal situation.Always consult with an appropriate expert.Rates and terms set on third-party websites are subject to change without notice.Per FTC guidelines, MyMoneyBlog.com has financial relationships with the merchants mentioned.MyMoneyBlog.com is compensated if visitors click on any outbound links and generate sales for the said merchant.I thank you for supporting this site.This is an independently-owned site and all opinions expressed are my own and have not been reviewed, approved or otherwise endorsed by anyone else.</div></body></html>
