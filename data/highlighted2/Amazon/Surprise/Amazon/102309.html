(NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon is expanding its business loan services to its online vendors in eight new countries.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>To avoid liability risk, vendors are chosen by invitation only, based on past sales and inventory data which Amazon has on each vendor.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Alibaba has opened a new online bank that will make business loans to its small and medium business vendors on Tmall and Taobao.Alibaba chairman Jack Ma has called for more US vendors to sell through Alibaba's sites to Chinese consumers, who want more overseas goods.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Amazon hasn't been successful in China, but it could have better opportunities in India if it moves quickly and strongly now.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is opening up its regular online vendor business loan service in eight new countries.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Up until now only US- and Japan-based Amazon vendors could take out a business loan with Amazon.$UNCERTAINTY</span>I think this is an excellent way to support and encourage current online vendor members to expand their business, which in the end raises their sales volumes and Amazon's revenues.Also, I can see this move making Amazon more attractive to new business owners looking to set up an online shop.Amazon has built a huge online space where vendors everywhere can find customers, but now equally huge companies like Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) are stepping up their game and expanding more internationally.In Q1 2015, Amazon's North America net sales and operating income grew 24% and 78%, respectively.However, international segment net sales slipped 1.75% and the operating loss grew larger from a minus $33 million to a minus $76 million.Of course, some of that decline is due to the strong dollar, but it does show Amazon needs to shore up its international business.One way to incentivize vendors to join Amazon is to have the option of getting business loans once online sales are good enough.The company has to start now to solidify the potential growth in vendor numbers so that they will be there in the future.Amazon vendors in the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Canada, India and China can now apply for a business loan.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>But Amazon's not dumb- it still has to separate out the real business opportunities to avoid taking on unnecessary risk.$UNCERTAINTY</span>It does this by only offering lending to select vendors by invitation only.When Amazon started making business loans in 2012, it was always Amazon choosing and approaching suitable vendors- not the other way around.If a vendor had increasing sales and good inventory turnover, they would catch the attention of Amazon, and get an email from the company saying the vendor is eligible for a loan up to a certain amount.Up until now it has been successful.Among the new countries, the big ones for me are China and India based on sheer retail volume potential.These will also be the hardest fought, in my opinion.Alibaba is the largest e-commerce company in China, similar to Amazon in scale and current market cap (Amazon- $201.3 billion vs Alibaba-$207.8 billion).In early June, Alibaba chairman Jack Ma did a series of speaking engagements in a number of major US cities to call for US vendors to sell into China through Alibaba's two e-commerce sites, Tmall and Taobao.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>He said he wasn't planning to "take over the US", but just the same, I think Amazon management was listening intently, and probably decided to accelerate its vendor business loan service expansion to start getting ready to compete more in these eight countries as well as the US.$UNCERTAINTY</span>If I just confine my argument here to concerning China's internet market alone, that would still be considered massive.Already, the number of Chinese internet users is closing in on 700 million, which is more than double the users in the US, and that's with only less than 50% internet penetration of the total Chinese population.If you think the US internet market is big, imagine potentially 3-4 times that just within China in the future.Amazon hasn't really been successful in taking a sizeable market share of China's e-commerce sector.The two biggest operators, Alibaba and JD.com, pretty much dominate that market.As a sign of their overwhelming control, Amazon has even opened a store on Alibaba's Tmall site to reach more Chinese consumers.Another event that will make it even more difficult for Amazon in China is Alibaba has just announced opening a 100% online bank called MYbank that will concentrate on lending to small and medium businesses as well as entrepreneurs.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Of course, these vendors will first have to be selling on Tmall and Taobao- and successfully at that- to show they are good credit risks.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Alibaba's financial arm, Ant Financial, has been offering business loans to Alibaba vendors for years, and to-date has financed over $64 billion in loans to more than 1.6 million small businesses.Similar to Amazon, Ant Financial and the new online bank look at the financial, transaction and inventory ordering data it has on a vendor to assess their creditworthiness.For the most part, it has been successful, with Ant Financial's bad-debt ratio at less than 1.5%, comparatively low for Chinese banking.My view is that Amazon is going to keep on struggling in China.Just like in a classic Chinese chess, or Go, game, before you try to take too much territory space in your opponent's area, you first consolidate firm control of your own.Chairman Jack Ma fought an earlier battle with eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ) to protect Alibaba's territory as the e-commerce auction site attempted to expand into China.In the end, eBay acquiesced in its failed business expansion there.Amazon shouldn't give up on the China market altogether, though.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>There are millions of consumers who are looking for and appreciate overseas goods that Amazon could potentially supply.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Unfortunately, that's exactly why Alibaba chairman Jack Ma was visiting the US- to invite and assemble those US vendors to his sites to satisfy that Chinese demand.Whether Amazon has a big chance of success in India is whole other ballgame.China's big e-commerce sites will be moving to take market share in India as well, but at least they're not the home team, either, so Amazon has a better chance to compete.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>India has almost matched the number of US internet users.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>There could be much more business potential for Amazon because only 20% of India's population have internet presently and e-commerce is not as developed and pervasive yet.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Amazon should push into India as much as possible to capture market share.$UNCERTAINTY</span>I think it would create a solid base for further growth in the region as the rest of Southeast Asia develops and modernizes along with India.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Source: Amazon: Business Loans To Online Vendors In China
