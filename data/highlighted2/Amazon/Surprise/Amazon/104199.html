(NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon's Growth strategy is piggybacking on its Amazon Prime scale.Amazon Prime Now expansion offers insight into how Amazon plans on growing.Delivery expertise and execution is the moat Amazon and its competitors are battling over to develop.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>There's no longer much retail companies can do to differentiate from their competitors, now that most niches have been carved out and price is all that they can compete on.$UNCERTAINTY</span>With that as a challenge, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) recognizes it must go in another direction in order to build a moat it can rely on for years into the future.If it isn't able to accomplish that, there will be little reason for customers to hang around.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Contrary to what investors in Amazon believe, it is far from clear the company can turn a switch on and immediately launch into a significant earnings phase.$UNCERTAINTY</span>While some tech companies are able to accomplish that after spending to scale its market, I don't see Amazon being in that place, as something like that is accomplished at a far quicker pace than Amazon has been performing at.So while the strategy of Amazon is easily understood, when and if it can take advantage of that scale is a real issue investors need to look at going forward.Recently I wrote on why Amazon must be successful with its shipping strategy in regard to cutting costs in that area in order to have a chance at sustainable profitability.In this article we'll look at the flip side of that, which is how the company plans to grow while lowering costs related to Amazon Prime.As Amazon continues to mature, investors must look at how it is going to generate earnings in the future.It is far from clear it can simply boost the price of products or services to increase earnings, as other tech companies in the past have been able to do after they scale.Not only have those companies done it much quicker, but did it with a clear and simple plan in mind.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>For example, just about everyone knows that Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is almost totally reliant on mobile for its revenue and earnings growth.$UNCERTAINTY</span>It's easy to understand, and the company is positioned via scale to take advantage of that.A lot of its expense associated with scale has been already incurred, and it can focus on how to generate earnings from that reality.Amazon on the other hand continues to spend as if it just launched and is battling to scale in order to position itself to profitably grow.The question many investors are asking is this: When and how will this end?In the first quarter Amazon had a net loss of $57 million.It generated $22.7 billion in sales, with operating expenses coming in at $22.5 billion.Essentially, that's the Amazon narrative.The only way I see the retail giant changing that narrative is to focus strongly on and improving its Amazon Prime and ancillary services, while cutting costs and not trying to open up new frontiers that pressure earnings on a continual basis.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>It's almost like Amazon can't neglect a market another tech company starts to compete in, as if it's going to miss out and fall behind in a market it has no expertise in.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>I see the need for it to bear down even harder on Amazon Prime and shipping, as that is the only hope I see of it delivering on expectations so many have in the company.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Apparently that's what it is starting to do.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If it can keep its hands out of the endless number of projects that have some potential, it could possibly start to reach its own potential in the core business it competes in.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Since no retail company can profitably compete on price for the long term, there has to be something else it offers in order to retain and grow its customer base.Amazon has of course decided to use its Amazon Prime service to launch that initiative, and while successful, it does have the challenge of cutting costs in order to make it highly profitable over time, as mentioned earlier.The other challenge is to manage churn while it builds out the service.It does that through its popular to-day free shipping promise and continuing to add other products and services to keep people in the Prime fold.Since it is becoming difficult to maintain profitability, Amazon is looking for ways to generate more revenue from that base.To that end it has developed Amazon Prime Now, which offers customers in select cities and neighborhoods one-hour delivery for an additional fee.I like this because it's on top of the annual fee consumers must pay to enjoy the perks of the service.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>This has a lot of potential, and if done right and it generates enough scale, could be a big win for Amazon and investors.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Why Amazon Prime Now is important for investors is I believe it gives a look into what it is Amazon plans to do in order to provide predictable and sustainable profitability, which is to piggyback other products and services within its Amazon Prime ecosystem.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Now that it has positioned itself to serve some important regions with its physical presence in a variety of locations, it is feverishly working on differentiating via improvement in its delivery service by developing a variety of ways to bring specific products to a desired location within an hour.$UNCERTAINTY</span>It offers Amazon Prime Now in the U.S. in certain sections of New York City, Miami, Baltimore, Dallas, Atlanta and Austin, and just announced it is going international with it, offering it in parts of London to begin with.It will expand to a number of other locations in the U.K. in the near future.An interesting aside to the service is if a customer wants delivery within two hours, they can get it for free.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>What this suggests to me is the products offered by Amazon will be related to those needed very quickly by consumers.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Another interesting part of the service is it requires minimum orders, which will add to the base sales revenue of Amazon Prime, with not a lot of added expense.For what is considered a tech company, Amazon is growing old.In a couple of years it will be its 20th anniversary since going public.How long can some investors, and the company, talk about scale, before the question is considered of where it has more room to do so?At this time Amazon should easily be turning a healthy profit on a continuous basis, and yet it struggles to do so.Investing in delivery infrastructure, while legitimate, should be close to being in place - especially in the U.S.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Now that Amazon sees it must be a market leader in delivery in order to separate itself from its competitors, we may start to see some very specific spending that will make sense.$UNCERTAINTY</span>It's not that spending is bad, it's that the spending has been spread across a lot of dubious projects that aren't related to its core business.That has to change if Amazon is to survive and thrive.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Even if it's not being overstated at this time, it seems to me that Amazon is hitching its future on Amazon Prime and the revenue it can add to that important customer base for years into the future.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Without that, I see no real future for Amazon.Amazon Prime Now is a good example of providing another revenue stream for customers that make it difficult to abandon.The fact that few if any companies can compete with it at that level confirms this is an excellent strategy.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Once it becomes highly efficient at one-hour delivery in many markets in America and around the world, it definitely could move the company to a level where it may become consistently profitable.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>No one knows how many millions of customers have signed up for Amazon Prime, but the lowest estimation would probably be around 20 million.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>It could be significantly higher than that.$UNCERTAINTY</span>If that's the case, it's easy to see how customers would be willing to pay more for the convenience of getting a much-needed product to the home in a very short time.That would be on top of the annual fee paid to participate in the Amazon Prime program.These are the types of things I'm looking for when evaluating the legitimacy of Amazon and its business model.I don't care about all those secondary products it pursues outside of any connection to Amazon Prime.Even if some of them work, they'll only be a small part of the revenue and earnings potential represented by the current business model it employs.What I'll continue to look for concerning Amazon is how it spends to boost the value of its Amazon Prime customer base and ways it can increase revenue and earnings without needing to increase its delivery infrastructure in a major way.For that reason the company has Amazon Prime Now, as it taps into its existing and most important customer base without the need to spend huge amounts of capital.That also sets the stage for the inevitable time it will have to increase the annual Amazon Prime fee, where consumers will consider it a service they must have in order to maintain their quality of life in this particular area.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If Amazon can get expenses under better control and discipline itself in regard to focusing primarily on its core business, it may be able to come close to fulfilling the high expectations it has garnered from investors.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Source: Amazon Prime Now Reveals Company's Strategy And Future Promise Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions
