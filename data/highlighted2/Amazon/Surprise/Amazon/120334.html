Customizing ads based on your supposed demographic profile is nothing new.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Back in 2012, for example, Orbitz decided to prioritize more expensive hotel listings in results for Mac users, on the theory that users of that brand would be willing and able to pay for a premium experience rather than hoping to find the best deal.$UNCERTAINTY</span>And there is now an entire industry based on mining and aggregating and sorting out every detail about every digital profile in order to target advertising in just that way.But available credit, of course, does not necessarily correlate to �has the money available to spend.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Having a $0 balance on your credit card is not a sign that you should immediately charge a $1300 MacBook to that credit card, nor is a steady income an indicator that you should replace your $500 iPhone with a $600 iPhone as soon as possible.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Similarly, a lack of available credit does not correlate to �cannot be a customer.Plenty of the under-18 set (who theoretically have no credit) get their families to buy them gifts of Apple products, and adults are capable of saving and managing budgets, and also of receiving gifts or irregular, but significant, income streams.This is just a patent application, not a finished product, so it�s far too early to get worked up about Apple using your bank account balance as a marketing factor just yet.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>It may never happen at all.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>But the fact that companies can now plan to target or ignore consumers not just at such a granular level, but also at such a personal one, seems to be where the future is heading.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Forget Fingerprints, Amazon Working On Ear-Unlock Feature For Phones Google Receives Patent For Wearable �Odor Removal Device� � Suspected Shoplifter Runs From Security, Dies After Jumping Off�Ledge 3 Obvious Signs This "Walt Disney-World."<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Facebook Giveaway Is A Scam Customers Report Receiving $15 Best Buy Gift Cards For $15 After Pricing Error Netflix CEO Hints At How He Hopes To Get People To Pay More Consumerist is currently testing a new user experience.$UNCERTAINTY</span>If you received an invitation to participate in the beta test, please sign-in below.If you are part of the beta test group, you will receive a link that will allow you to create a new password.If you are not part of the test group, you can learn more here .Email check failed, please try again</div></body></html>
