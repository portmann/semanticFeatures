(AAPL) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Apple Watch (NASDAQ: AAPL ) accounted for well over 100% of the $952M in annual revenue growth seen by Apple's Other Products segment in FQ3, CFO Luca Maestri mentioned on the earnings call.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Bloomberg observes Maestri's remarks point to 1.9M+ Watch sales, if one assumes a $499 ASP.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>(live blogs: WSJ , BI ) Tim Cook stated Watch sales were higher in June than in April or May.$UNCERTAINTY</span>He once more declined to provide specific Watch revenue/unit figures, while asserting Apple has chosen not to do so to keep info out of competitors' hands.He also once more defends the iPad (units -18% Y/Y to 10.9M), estimating Apple has 76% of the market for $200+ tablets and stating customer sell-through (11.2M) was better than sell-in thanks to a 300K-unit drop in channel inventories.The iPhone (units +35% to 47.5M, but below a ~49M consensus) saw channel inventories fall by 600K Q/Q, bringing them to the low end of Apple's 5-7 week target range.Greater China iPhone sales were up 87% Y/Y and Mac sales 33%.27% of iPhone users are said to have upgraded to a 6/6+.Also: 1) A strong dollar had an 8% impact on revenue growth, and a $24 impact on iPhone ASP; the latter was still up $99 Y/Y, thanks in part to the 6+.2) 89% of Apple's cash balance is offshore.3) The retail store count is up to 456 (190 outside the U.S.).4) 8,500 third-party Watch apps are now available.Nothing speaks louder than clear sales figures.That has always been a clear indication of the health of a product.Cook effectively signalled the failure of the watch even before it went on sale when he stated that he wouldn't reveal sales figures.And now, he is having to justify the watch couched in descriptive adjectives that mean nothing other than that he is trying to hide the failure of the product.It's a sad turn of affairs.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>I wonder if he will use the same tactic for Apple Music.$SURPRISE</span>I note that he was happy to boast of millions of people signing up for itâ€”even though it's currently free.Is that not helping the competition?<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Apparently not in Cook's book.$UNCERTAINTY</span>But will he give concrete figures after a year of paying subscribers?If he doesn't, we will know it has failed, as he has already divulged a rough figure of millions now.I guess we now know what all that sapphire was wanted for: mirrors.The smoke is provided by the forest fires in drought-stricken California.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Seems like production ramp on the Watch was very slow.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Lots of issues and supply didn't even come close to catching up with demand for some time.One key number Cook said on the call.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>June sales were better than April or May.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Considering how many of models weren't even available until June, this shouldn't be surprising, but it's a good data point.$SURPRISE</span>The market is hot wind which blows for a day..The market overprices Amazon and FB with things perceived in the wind.Lets get real..This is an opportunity to buy AAPL cheap as the company is only one worldwide with such a breadth of integrated products.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Its customer's are solidly locked into its products, the quality is exceptional... The Watch will increase rapidly - hopefully offering in all markets worldwide by Christmas/Holiday season.$UNCERTAINTY</span>The critics haven't been able to find flaws in the Apple Watch unlike its competitors.I was lucky as I ordered on line 2 minutes after the opening time I received my Apple Watch on Day 1 - I love it.Marketing that includes retail sales and all countries in the world will see a huge surge by December.The integration of AAPL products is exceptional in a fragmented market.People ask me all the time about my watch and when they see it run through its paces they say they want one..<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>some are very disappointed because they do not have an iPhone and they then say that they will have to change their phone... So basically, a blowout and the stock drops.$SURPRISE</span>Love it!Great opportunity here to sell puts or put spreads.Anyone that thinks Apple will fall for a while is mistaken.Lots of share repurchase authorization left - it will find a bottom fast.Despite all the negative Apple comments that you will hear, they had a 43% earnings increase this past quarter.Over $200 billion in cash.Apple is alive and doing very well.Just ask Siri, she'll tell you.Thats what I said e years ago when it lost close to 50%of its stock value.I'll wait and see.They have to come up with something innovative in order to move the needle.iwatch isn't it.I love apple and it will continue to go higher over the years.How high and how fast?Who knows.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Almost 1 Billion in watch sales and this is a failure?$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>I believe this will grow now that the early  production  issue with one of the two component suppliers is fixed....and the roll out has been deliberately careful to be able to ship good quality......customers will realize what the watch can do and will become buyers in the future.$UNCERTAINTY</span>This is a new device with a new  functionality......Apple is now a one trick pony.iPhones are its bread and butter.Timmy boy better get his act together or just run for office This next couple of quarters will tell the tale on the watch.My sense is that it will find its way to the top of Christmas lists, and will be the next "must have" to be accepted by the "in crowd".<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Interesting to note almost two million have been sold thus far with a pick up in sales in June.$UNCERTAINTY</span>I wouldn't consider those numbers to be a failure.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>There are early buyers that eagerly have been showing off their watches, and then there are cautious buyers that are waiting for the refining process that always goes on with new products.$UNCERTAINTY</span>I'm betting that watch sales will continue to pick up in the months and years ahead as refinements are made and more application software becomes available.Love all this one trick pony stuff.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>First and foremost that one trick rose 59% year of year basis, revenue rose faster than the last three years, China sales double, earnings were at high end for a conservative guidance company, EPS beat by 2%, Mac kicked ass while PCs are irrelevant see IBM and others, nearly $10 B in other revenue and we are stuck on one trick.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Remove the trick and you still have better numbers from and EPS and growth perspective that the GOOG which missed revenue for the 10th straight quarter and went up $80.Or why does nobody slander Mr. I Will Buy the Washington Post as my Dandy, because I have only earned $2 B on $420 B of lifetime sales!<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Market penalizes established money makers because they are afraid future looks grim.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Sure my million dollar position might take a whack from this but happy to add 1,000 shares if given the gift of 110 maybe even more.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Yes comps become exceedingly difficult but that is a good problem to have when you are doing nearly a half billion a day in sales.$UNCERTAINTY</span>China is going gang busters, when India catches up we will see another explosion of foreign sales.Here the thing can you real say that a first year run rate of gen 1 product watch at a guess of 8 million units is a failure, has Audemars sold that in their existence -- nope.Granted Apples (hah play on play) versus diamonds but thats the point its a watch and first gen ..lots of folks hugging the sideline... we haven't see anything yet from iPay Europe  and beyond, Apple music, future transportation, etc.Bottom line its ecosystem is undeniable.Apple is gobbling up their own shares, and divvy will double in next few years.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>As a Father of Four from college grad to twelve, my kids brought this to me, my goal is to leave them a few thousand shares each, I am at 1,004 per kid, rest mine, hope to get a chance to add more, sell away drive it to 100 please, truck is in reverse!$UNCERTAINTY</span>Samsung or Google Watch that would be Iolwth?I'm not a die hard Apple fem boy and I bought one.The watch is great and will sell better over the holidays and with due refinement.Everyone has to consider the market for smartwatches.In 2014, a TOTAL of 6.8 million smartwatches were sold worldwide ( http://bit.ly/1LBEMQZ ).The estimates from many of the analysts for the Apple Watch is between 1.9 million to 2.2 million units (current quarter).Ladies and Gentlemen.....to me these numbers are outstanding for a 3 month period (be it with a planned slow ramp up in sales by Apple).Also, their comps Y/Y is 33% which includes a 112% Y/Y increase in China.Many international companies are citing China's economy as a drag on their sales.....Not so for Apple!We consider Apple a strong buy and see this stock price decline as a huge buying opportunity.Keep in mind that Apple's buyback program kicks in this Friday....which will mean Apple will be buying Apple at a lower price point....great for shareholders.ETF Screener: Search and filter by asset class, strategy, theme, performance, yield, and much more ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key
