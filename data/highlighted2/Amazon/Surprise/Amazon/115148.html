Glaser, DealNews' features editor."They aren't even aware there is an official policy offering refunds."<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Keep in mind what else might be affecting shipment times, though, such as credit-card charges that did not go through, attempted deliveries that were not successful, or missed order deadlines.$UNCERTAINTY</span>But if eligible shipments keep turning up later than promised, you can ask for that free month multiple times a year, DealNews discovered."If for some reason our delivery promise hasn't been met, customers can call or e-mail and we can extend them an extra month of Prime membership," confirms Amazon's Julie Law."But we don't allow people to abuse that."<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Of course, customer-service reps can also respond to late shipments in different ways, such as offering to expedite new deliveries, as they have often done with Jason Jepson.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>In other cases, you might be offered Amazon credits that could be worth even more than the free month membership, noted Glaser.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>That is not official policy, but depends on a case-by-case evaluation of customer experience, said Amazon's Law.$UNCERTAINTY</span>And, if you are not in a rush to get your stuff, you can even opt out of two-day shipping for a particular item, and get a $1 video credit for your troubles.It makes sense that the retailer needs to take good care of its Prime customers.They spend an average of $538 a year shopping at Amazon, or 68 percent more than non-members, according to a survey by RBC Capital Markets.And 61 percent of respondents reported upping their spending after becoming Prime members.As such, Prime is a critical growth engine for the retailer.Memberships grew worldwide by 53 percent from 2013 to 2014, says Law, and the Reuters/Ipsos survey found that 96 percent were satisfied with the service.That is why, despite anecdotal reports of late deliveries, the magazine Consumer Reports judges Prime service to be worth the cost."You look at what you get, and it's actually quite a lot," says Tod Marks, the magazine's senior projects editor."As annoying as it is to pay the $99, you can earn it back very quickly."(Editing by Beth Pinsker and Andrew Hay) Thomson Reuters is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, providing investing news , world news , business news , technology news , headline news, small business news , news alerts, personal finance , stock market , and mutual funds information available on Reuters.com, video , mobile , and interactive television platforms.Thomson Reuters journalists are subject to an Editorial Handbook which requires fair presentation and disclosure of relevant interests.NYSE and AMEX quotes delayed by at least 20 minutes.Nasdaq delayed by at least 15 minutes.For a complete list of exchanges and delays, please click here .</div></body></html>
