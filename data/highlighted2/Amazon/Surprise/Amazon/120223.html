(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix continually attracts more eyeballs, but that isn't enough to guarantee future revenue.Eyeballs will only stay sticky if Netflix keeps up the great original content.That will be expensive, and difficult to do consistently.In Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), the market continues to enthusiastically applaud member growth.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>The more eyeballs the better, it seems, and NFLX has consistently attracted more eyeballs.$UNCERTAINTY</span>But while we remain impressed with member growth overall, numbers actually came in a bit below our estimates this time around (see chart below), notably on the domestic front.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This makes us wonder, what happens if NFLX sneezes and misses total international subscribers estimates?$SURPRISE</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>And as the company gets more exposed to FX, what happens when investors see a subscriber growth figure that seems uncorrelated with revenue?$UNCERTAINTY</span>Will more eyeballs always mean more revenue, and vice-versa, or are eyeballs not really the be-all and end-all?<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>In a "cult stock" like NFLX, we worry about skewed valuation, and especially about the near- to intermediate-term downside risk in the event of this type of "miss" or FX-related confusion.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>While we don't want to be downers, the hype that surrounds NFLX heightens the worry, and it keeps us away.$UNCERTAINTY</span>While subscriber growth buoys NFLX's price, we want to get back to what we think is a matter of longer-term importance.In our initiation , we pointed out that what it really comes down to for NFLX is content.Content is King.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Along these lines, two quotes stood out to us from the press release : "We are making great progress shifting to exclusive content and expanding our original content, which differentiates our service, drives enjoyment for existing members and helps motivate consumers to join Netflix." "$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>anticipate global content spend approaches $5B in 2016 on P&L and over $6B in cash, we will devote more investment to originals both in absolute dollars and percentage terms."$UNCERTAINTY</span>Management clearly knows what it is doing in this regard.Netflix must have great content to be able to renew subscriptions and generate interest for new growth.Quality shows typically last 9-10 seasons, so we think NFLX's all-stars, like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black, will be the cornerstones that Netflix can grow on.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>We remain somewhat unimpressed with the newest offerings, however, and believe that other people feel similarly, which demonstrates that expectations are extremely high for continued successful releases.$UNCERTAINTY</span>This has good and bad sides, but we still applaud Mr. Hastings on continuing the focus on good content through this point.It's been good enough to garner lots of Emmy nominations, and that's saying something.There's an old adage that nicely fits Netflix and its performance of late: Great company, terrible stock.Despite the simple math that a stock-split does not create shareholder value, shares were up heading into the quarter on this bit of news alone.Two times more shares with half their former value is still equal to one.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Thus we believe the stock remains overvalued, especially given the run.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Long-term longs - congrats.Otherwise, it's time to sell and here's why: Expectations for new successful shows and now movies are extremely high.Last time we checked, there was no baseball player that ever batted a 1.000 in their career nor any network or content provider that hit on every show.Top-line results / net subscriber adds were relatively inline with our numbers, but bookings/billings (change in deferred revenue + recognized revenue) came in well short of our ~$1.7B as FX had an ~5% ASP hit ($7.35 CC) and still fell ~$0.30 per user per month short of our estimate as the company searches for growth internationally.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>On top of this, expansion into China is questionable until 2016, and even then it may not happen, taking a large market opportunity away.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Profitability will be purposefully be kept low to invest into the business until after 2016 where management expects to turn on the profitability button thereafter.Bears will target this, bulls will laud it.Too much of a potential train wreck for us.Below, we show our estimates vs. reported for Q2 for a quick reference and our estimates vs. given guidance for Q3, as at the end of the day, the numbers are what will really matter from a stock perspective.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>We believe there is room for upside to net adds, though revenue internationally will remain pressured.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Cash flow came in better than we had anticipated but as "value" choosers, the company's lack of profitability keeps us on the sidelines.$UNCERTAINTY</span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Bulls' valuations seem to be relying on some variety of EV/Eyeballs rather than EV/Sales, which seems dangerous to us.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Eyeballs won't stick without something to stick to, and that's where "Content is King" will always come back to roost.So while subscriber growth, which we look for as a healthy sign, is fantastic, we should always remember that content needs to be kept up.This will require large investments that will weigh on profitability likely over the medium-to-long term.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Companies like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) have "gotten away" with this due to a mixture of FCF generation and pure market share dominance, but NFLX already (1) has competition and (2) may face price wars.$UNCERTAINTY</span>On the latter, we point to the famous "Dollar Shave" club battle going on - commodity businesses (of which razors are one) lend themselves to price wars.We're not saying that NFLX is facing a pricing war at this time, as it maintains best of breed content (original content is not a commodity - see why it's so important?)and the ability to stream anywhere, anytime, on any device.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>However, our risk-reward numbers ($99 PT, with risk-reward $95-$103) and this larger medium-term risk just keeps us away from the stock.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Good quarter, but the narrow focus on "eyeballs" has run this stock into overvalued territory.Source: Netflix: Eyeballs Aren't Everything Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
