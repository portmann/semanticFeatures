Penney Co. and Nordstrom Inc., according to sales receipts.Jet’s prices for the same 12 items added up to $275.55, an average discount of about 11% from the prices Jet paid for those items on other retailers’ websites.Jet’s total cost, which also includes estimated shipping and taxes, was $518.46.So in other words, the 11% pricing discount above is not due to an awesome business model yet.They are being artificially suppressed with investor money.Now, spending venture capital funds in the search for rapid growth is common for internet start-ups, but I don�t remember any of my early Amazon orders coming in a Barnes & Noble box.As a consumer, I suppose the best thing to do is simply enjoy the loss-leader savings during your free trial and then decide if it�s worth $50 a year.Costco is highly profitable but even they offer their $4.99 rotisserie chickens as a loss-leader, losing $40 million a year in order to keep people coming in the door.Update: People report success getting a free 1-year membership with promo code CURISMA.There is also the code FREE6 which gives you a free 6-month membership.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If you signed up with Jet earlier, don�t forget that you may have gotten a 6-month free trial already.$UNCERTAINTY</span>(The trial doesn�t start until your first purchase.)<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>It appears on the normal website, they give out 3-month free trials.$UNCERTAINTY</span>I checked out Jet when they finally invited me to log in a month or so ago.I was underwhelmed by the prices on the few items I checked (my local Wegmans was much cheaper, Amazon was also cheaper).They didn�t have a price comparison tool then � or if they did I totally overlooked it.I�ll be happy to use them if they can beat grocery store prices for staples, but I�ve yet to see it consistently on any online store.There�s a convenience factor of ordering online, but it�s not really more convenient than just stocking up on 6 months� worth of things like paper towels while I�m already picking up vegetables.In playing around with it now again, it looks like a great service for getting Amazon coupons.Lots of items are Amazon Price + coupon, so I guess I can save money that way.I give up prime shipping, Amazon customer service, and ease of delivery.Not sure there�s much benefit.Amazon prices aren�t a great thing to try to beat for grocery items as Udo mentioned.They can be absurdly expensive (5-10 times) local grocery store prices for a LOT of items.Jet.com is much more expensive than my local Walmart.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>They may beat Amazon prices on groceries, but that�s no big feat.$UNCERTAINTY</span>For example, snack packs that cost $1.00 at Walmart cost $3.57 on Jet.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>That�s almost four times as expensive.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Their selection is also much more limited than Walmart.For example, although Chlorox bleach costs $3.75 on Jet and $3.84 at Walmart, Walmart has its own �Great Value� brand at $2.94 � much cheaper.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>I think they are going to burn through their cash and either have to change their business model (raise prices/charge for shipping) or go away, depending on the scale they can build in the first year or so.$UNCERTAINTY</span>I don�t have enough interest and time to search a website and comparison shop on things I need every few months, like toilet paper.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>I just look at deal sites and if it lists TP for sale somewhere, I buy it.$UNCERTAINTY</span>I figure it�s a good enough deal and it usually is to within a few cents per roll.I managed to score a free lifetime membership because of referrals but honestly, not sure how much life Jet will have if it�s burning through VC money buying stuff at a loss to ship out orders.Feels very internet bubble-ish business practices.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Notify me of followup comments via e-mail Previous: 4 Different Rules of Thumb For How Much House You Can Afford I'm Jonathan and I've been writing about money since 2004.$UNCERTAINTY</span>Father of two, DIY investor, aspiring early retiree, and perpetual learner.Learn more about me and my money .Jet.com: Loss Leader Pricing on Everything + 1 Year Free Promo Code MyMoneyBlog.com is for informational purposes only.Do not take it as legal, financial, or tax advice for your personal situation.Always consult with an appropriate expert.Rates and terms set on third-party websites are subject to change without notice.Per FTC guidelines, MyMoneyBlog.com has financial relationships with the merchants mentioned.MyMoneyBlog.com is compensated if visitors click on any outbound links and generate sales for the said merchant.I thank you for supporting this site.This is an independently-owned site and all opinions expressed are my own and have not been reviewed, approved or otherwise endorsed by anyone else.</div></body></html>
