(NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha AMZN concludes Prime Day with mixed reviews from the blogosphere, but strong sales numbers reported.Estimates say AMZN hit 97% of Black Friday sales, 60% of Cyber Monday sales in the US."Hundreds of thousands" of new Prime members signed up, the key concern for AMZN's potential long-term profitability.Complaints of Prime Day being about unsold inventory not alleviated as towels, food containers among top-selling items, not enough AMZN hardware to meet demand.With Prime Day come and gone, both Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and the investing community are taking stock on what was billed to be "bigger than Black Friday".If you're Amazon, it was a resounding success, as order figures and consumer engagement eclipsed Black Friday with over 380 orders per second, a huge improvement compared to last year's Black Friday sale.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>If you're a consumer though, it was a frustrating endeavor as Prime customers found that the best deals ran out by the middle of the afternoon, and the sales were more reminiscent of a garage sale than the kind of quality of items people were expecting from Amazon. (SURPRISE) </span>So what is the official verdict from Prime Day?<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>While hard sales figures remain unavailable, and new Prime subscription figures are spoken vaguely as "hundreds of thousands" of new members, there is still enough information to sort out the real story from the positive and negative spin from Prime Day's supporters and detractors. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>The goal of Prime Day was to provide a shopping holiday bigger than the iconic Black Friday that occurs after Thanksgiving.In terms of orders, it achieved that with an 18% improvement compared to Black Friday in products moved, representing over 34.4 million items bought across all participating countries.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>In terms of sales, while Amazon has not released official figures for revenue, independent analysis from ChannelAdvisor shows that Prime Day had 97% of the sales from last Black Friday and 60% of the sales from Cyber Monday in the United States, suggesting between $750 million and $1 billion in revenues from the American market. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>While a far cry from Alibaba's (NYSE: BABA ) Singles Day, it's in line with what Amazon can expect from Thanksgiving holiday sales once European sales are calculated, which would signal that Prime Day was a success from a sales standpoint.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>The supposed sales success of Prime Day might be tempered somewhat by the fact that many of the best-selling items were items like food storage containers and microfiber towels, while Amazon hardware like the new Fire TV stick and Kindles didn't have enough supply to meet the demand. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>The lack of supply for hardware, and pushing of unexciting merchandise adds to original suspicions that Prime Day was less about celebrating Amazon's 20th birthday and more about moving unsold inventory at discount prices.Social media analysts at Adobe were quick to point out that Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) was 13% negative towards Amazon on July 15, up from 7% the previous day, while positive feedback was relatively unchanged at 23% compared to 22% the previous day.In a seperate survey , 50% of US customers experienced "sadness" with Prime Day, with many of the complaints over selection and a lack of customer support to address grievances with quick ending sales on electronics.Amazon did announce that it moved over 47,000 televisions and 41,000 Boss headphones during the sale, but it also praised the high sales of iRoombas and Lord of the Rings DVD box sets, which doesn't exactly appease the critics even if the sales were strong across the board.As soon as Prime was announced, the main draw was going to be how many Prime subscribers Amazon would get to sign up, and everything else would be just gravy.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>This matters more to investors because Prime members generate consistent revenue that isn't cyclical or dependent on days like Black Friday or Prime Day, which generally means profitable quarters. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Amazon announced that "hundreds of thousands" of new members signed up for the free trial, and others reactivated their memberships.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>While the official numbers may not come out until Q3 ends (which would also show how many became paying members once the 30-day trial ends), it is safe to say that this will generate tens of millions of dollars in additional revenue. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>For a traditionally down quarter for online retail outlets, this is both a sign of a strong quarter for the company as well as a way to generate momentum headed into the holiday season.Despite the poor feedback, sellers on Amazon were thrilled with the results of Prime Day as they were able to move merchandise during a traditionally sleepy quarter.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Sales were comparable to Black Friday, and orders exceeded those from Black Friday, so the claim that Prime Day would be bigger than Black Friday was at least somewhat fulfilled. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>More importantly, Amazon has announced that this will become a yearly thing, meaning that as time goes on, bigger brands will offer quality items as long as Amazon is committed to working out the kinks with its lightning deals and having enough Kindles and Fire products to go around.Additional subscriptions to Prime are set to net Amazon a huge new revenue source, which in the past has meant profitability for a company with traditionally low profit margins, meaning that the primary goal has been met even without hard numbers.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>While the doubters will likely not be silenced, especially when Amazon basically acknowledged the less-than-highbrow items that got moved the most and the Internet's mixed emotions to the sales day, Amazon is right to pat themselves on the back, and has something to build on for Black Friday, and for Prime Day 2016.
