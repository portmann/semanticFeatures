(NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon can leverage its existing international consumer audience (1.6 billion monthly visits globally) to build the Amazon Prime sub base globally.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Including cost-savings from free shipping, we believe Netflix is more than 20% more expensive on an annual basis than Amazon. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Amazon can leverage IMDB's size and international popularity to generate traffic to its Instant Video segment, as the feature becomes offered in more and more countries internationally.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>HDTV penetration is much higher in the US than other countries, and we believe this negates the HD advantage Netflix enjoys in the US. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Amazon Prime is creating the first Internet one-stop-shop, a central location where visitors can do all things Internet on one platform.We recently wrote an article detailing why Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) had a significant competitive advantage in Japan over streaming rival Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ).The two companies will make excursions into the Japanese market within the next month.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>We believe the competitive advantage Amazon will benefit from in Japan is internationally transferable, and gives Amazon significant leverage in international markets. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>While we do not believe Amazon's significant leverage will dramatically hurt Netflix until Amazon Instant Video's library can reasonably compete with Netflix's streaming content, we believe it does position Amazon Prime as an international juggernaut. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>According to Similar Web analytics , Amazon.com gets roughly 1 billion unique visits globally per month. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>This makes Amazon.com the 14th most visited website in the world, and the most visited shopping website in the world.Visitors to the website also visit with a purpose, and are among some of the most engaged audiences on the web.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Visitors spend an average of 8 minutes and 30 seconds per visit and scroll through roughly 11 pages per visit. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>A low 27.71% bounce rate means that users are engaging with a high number of the pages they visit.It is important to note here that these are visits to simply Amazon.com.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Amazon operates under several different domains specific to countries of operation. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Amazon.de, the company's German-specific website, generates roughly 180 million visits per month and is the third most visited shopping website in the world and the fifth most visited overall website in Germany. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Amazon's UK domain receives roughly 140 million visits per month and is the sixth most visited shopping website in the world and the eighth most visited overall website in the UK. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Amazon's Japan domain receives roughly 140 million visits per month and is the seventh most visited shopping website in the world and seventh most visited overall website in Japan. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>All told, Amazon generates traffic upwards of 1.6 billion global visits per month to its online platforms.The US accounts for 74% of Amazon.com's 1 billion monthly visits, and a rough average of 5% (rough average of US traffic share on foreign domains) of the remaining 600 million of the traffic through other Amazon domains.That equates to the US accounting for just around 770 million of the 1.6 billion global visits per month, or 48%.The US accounts for less than 50% of the online traffic to Amazon.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>This means that 52%, or roughly 830 million visits per month, of the online traffic to Amazon is from foreign countries. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>We believe Amazon can leverage these 830 million international monthly visits to generate mass market adoption of Amazon Prime in international markets. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>As Amazon continues to bundle features into it's $99 annual Prime subscription, market adoption of Prime should be even further strengthened.In Japan, for example, Prime will cost only $32 per year, versus Netflix's subscription price of $65 to $144 per year, and these rates do not account for the money saved through Free Shipping offered in the Prime subscription.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>On prices, we believe Amazon Prime is much more favorably priced than Netflix, even in the US. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>In the US, Prime is offered for $99 per year while Netflix will cost users $108 per year.To understand the magnitude of cost-savings via free shipping, Amazon reported $849 million in shipping revenues in Q1 2014.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Roughly 60% of sales were from North America, so transferring that 60% North America mix to net shipping revenues, we arrive at a rough estimate of $509 million in US shipping revenue in Q1. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>In the same quarter, 198 million US consumers bought something online.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If we assume every single one of those people bought something from Amazon, that equates to an annualized rate of around $10 in shipping per online shopper. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>In reality, not all US online shoppers in the quarter shopped at Amazon, but we believe this assumption is offset by the fact that not all North American revenues are from the US, so we believe the $10 shipping revenue per shopper is as good an estimate as possible. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>For more comparable services of streaming content, then, the price difference in the US can be seen as roughly $89 per year for Amazon versus $108 per year for Netflix, meaning Netflix is more than 20% more expensive on a comparable, annual basis. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Prime also includes music and photo content that Netflix does not include, so the true comparable prices are actually more skewed in favor of Amazon's cheapness (streaming video content vs. streaming video content).A lesser-known but nonetheless poignant advantage of Amazon Prime Instant Video over Netflix is IMDB.The International Movie Database, or IMDB, was acquired by Amazon in 1998.It is a place where individuals can browse, rate, comment on, view show times and release dates of, and discuss movies and television shows.Most importantly for Amazon Prime Instant Video, though, IMDB provides links to watching streaming movies online.Seeing as IMDB is owned by Amazon, the only links provided are Amazon Instant Video links.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Each movie's page will tell the browser if that movie is or is not available on Amazon Instant Video, and provides a link to watching the movie on Amazing Instant Video if it is available. (SURPRISE) </span>The same goes for TV shows.There exist significant synergies here.Amazon.com is the top destination site for those visiting IMDB.com, and IMDB.com is among the top referring sites for Amazon.com.This means a significant amount of IMDB's traffic flows through to Amazon Instant Video.IMDB is no small website either.The website generates 380 million global monthly visits, making it the 32nd most popular website in the United States and 57th most popular overall website in the world.More importantly, though, IMDB is the number one movie website in the world.This is because IMDB has a huge international presence.Like Amazon, less than 50% of is internet traffic comes from the US.Only 37% of IMDB's internet traffic is from the US.By comparison, rival movie website Rotten Tomatoes, which features links to all streaming content providers including both Amazon and Netflix, generates less than 10% of the traffic of IMDB and is much more centralized in the US.Amazon can leverage IMDB's size and international popularity to generate traffic to its Instant Video segment, as the feature becomes offered in more and more countries internationally.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>We believe this is a significant competitive advantage that will generate substantial traffic. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>We see users being attracted to this model in the same-way consumers prefer to shop at one-stop-shops.In many ways, Amazon and its online platform are becoming the Internet's first one-stop-shop through diverse shopping categories, video streaming services, video recommendation and rating services, music content, photo storage, and more.The Netflix Advantage - HD and Exclusive Content While Amazon has a larger content library than Netflix, Netflix has more HD offerings .HDTV penetration reached 81% of US homes in 2015.That number has grown since 2014, according to Ofcom Consumer Research ,who found that 66% of US homes had an HDTV in 2014.HDTV is clearly ingrained in American society and has become the standard.Accordingly, non-HD streaming is an issue for a majority of Americans, and Netflix's larger HD portfolio is considerably more attractive than Amazon's smaller HD portfolio in the US.This is not the case in other countries.Outside of Spain (61%), Austria (67%), and the United Kingdom (63%), other nations have a considerably lower HDTV household penetration rate than the US.Italy only has 56% HDTV penetration, while Germany, France, and China have 48%, 40%, and 37%, respectively.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Japan comes in at a startlingly low 27%. (SURPRISE) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>We believe this lower-than-US HDTV household penetration will buy Amazon some valuable time to increase its HD portfolio. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>We do not forecast a smaller HD portfolio as a hindrance to Prime subs in countries outside of the UK, Spain, and Austria given low HDTV household penetration.We also affirm, however, that HDTV is growing in popularity globally and that Amazon must increase its HD portfolio in the long-term to retain Prime subs.Netflix does have a distinct advantage in terms of exclusive content.Amazon is attempting to expand its exclusive content portfolio, but the popularity of Netflix-exclusive shows like "House of Cards" and "Orange is the New Black" makes it difficult for Amazon to compete on exclusive content.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>It is estimated that Amazon Prime has roughly 41 million subs in the US. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Those 41 million members spend on average more than 2x the non-Prime Amazon customer on Amazon.com.Timothy Stenovec at The Huffington Post had this to say about Amazon Prime users: Prime is "creating all of these loyal Amazon customers that increasingly look to Amazon before they go anywhere else," Michael Levin, a partner at CIRP, told The Huffington Post."People aren't even going to the retail outlets.They're starting at Amazon."As we said earlier, Amazon Prime is creating the first Internet one-stop-shop: a location where visitors can do all things Internet on one platform.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>We see this next-gen Internet one-stop-shop as having huge upside, and believe Amazon Prime may a bigger juggernaut than most currently believe.
