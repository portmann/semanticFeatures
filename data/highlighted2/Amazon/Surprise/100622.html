(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple Music, the product of Apple's acquisition of Beats, will go live Tuesday.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>The key market discriminator for Apple Music appears to be in the creative leadership provided by the Beats team, enhanced by Apple tech. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Apple Music debuts Tuesday amidst fierce competition from streaming music rivals such as Spotify and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Play Music.Has Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) found the necessary discriminators that will put it ahead of the competition?More importantly, what is the business case for such a service?Apple investors will soon learn if the Beats acquisition has been worth the $3 billion purchase price.On the surface Apple Music can be characterized as just another example of Apple playing catch up with industry leaders such as Spotify or even Google Play Music.I've often seen the criticism in comments that Apple doesn't usually take a leading role, but deliberately waits for others to go first.This is certainly true in the case of Apple Music.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>The comment of Jonathan Forster , head of Spotify's European operations that Apple Music "validates" Spotify's business model may be the understatement of the year. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Digital content of all types is moving to the subscription revenue model.Whether that content is an app, a song, or a video, content producers love subscriptions.There are two basic reasons for this.The first is that subscriptions smooth out the revenue stream for the given content.Instead of an up front surge of one-time purchases, there's a monthly income.More importantly, subscriptions, with the appropriate digital rights management, pretty much eliminate piracy, which has been the bane of both the music and movie industries.Subscriptions also provide a win-win for content producers and consumers.For instance, Apple Music, Spotify, and Google Play Music subscriptions all cost about $10/month, and offer unlimited access to the music libraries of the respective services.That access includes downloads to all the user's devices, such as all the user's iOS devices for Apple Music.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Apple and Google Play are touting music libraries of about 30 million songs, which is far more music than could be purchased for the same $10/month over a human lifetime. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>So Apple has belatedly realized that the subscription model is replacing the on line purchase model that Apple itself pioneered with iTunes.Apple has typically entered new markets only after carefully reviewing the existing state of the art and coming up with something better.What is it that's better about Apple Music?I got the impression from Jimmy Iovine's presentation at WWDC where he introduced Apple Music that he and Apple's leadership are still struggling to find an answer to this question.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>More than with any recent or past new product introduction, from the iPod to Apple Watch, the case for Apple Music seems shaky at best. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Unlike with most other new products, Apple Music seems to exist because, well, the other guys have subscription music services, so Apple needed one too. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>The technical discriminators just aren't there for the consumer.Apple's subscription music library is about the same size as Google Play Music.The audio format and quality will be about the same as what Apple currently makes available for iTunes purchases (256k AAC) that is supposed to be better than the standard 320k MP3.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>I doubt anyone will notice the difference. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>And of course, subscriptions will come with DRM that will keep music from leaking out of the subscriber's set of iOS devices.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>With Apple Music, the company seems to have embarked on an interesting, and perhaps not uncharacteristic strategy of pushing the technology into the background, humanizing it by bringing the artists into the foreground. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>The key elements of this strategy are the Connect service and Beats 1 radio and music recommendations.All the artists in the Music library get their own blog pages.This has been compared to SoundCloud, but it's not quite so unlimited.Connect is only open to artists who have music in the Apple Music library, which means having a label or going through an Apple-approved aggregator .<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Connect will provide artists with a means of communicating with their following and will probably be most valuable to artists who are already well known. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>The star system isn't dead, although perhaps the music labels are dying. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>The main humanizing element is of course contributed by Beats.Beats 1 radio, along with curated play lists, is clearly intended to set Apple Music apart by providing an element of artistic leadership that other services lack.This kind of creative leadership has always been a part of the business of music and film, and still is.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>But it's always been a double-edged sword, since it depends on the acumen of the media producer in spotting a trend and identifying a hit. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Often there are as many misses as hits, and the traditional movie studios and record labels have seen highly variable revenue as a result. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If the error rate of the traditional media businesses has been rather high, Apple Music may provide its leadership with a technical means of reducing that error rate. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Apple Music will be able to provide its leaders with considerable real time feedback heretofore lacking in the traditional media businesses.Apple will be able to derive real-time stats on what's popular, as well as the demographics of the audience for a particular music type, artist or song.Likewise, Beats 1 radio will provide feedback about who's listening and where, what songs resonated with listeners, or how much a song was skipped.The Connect service will also provide another source of feedback about the audience of artists and their popularity.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>With Apple Music, Iovine, Cue et al. may have created the music producer's dream. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Now music producers won't have to guess about what works and what doesn't, won't have to rely exclusively on their own intuition or tastes, although these will still be the starting point.Very quickly (as in hours or days at most), Apple Music execs will know if a particular new song or artist is making it.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>This combination of artistic sensibility and real time feed back is probably the key discriminator provided by Apple Music. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>What are the prospects for Apple Music as a contributor to Apple's revenue?Actually pretty good.The Apple Music app is being built into the next iteration of iOS, version 8.4, which will be released a few hours in advance of Beats 1 going live on June 30.I've previously estimated the worldwide iOS device population to be upwards of 800 million.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>If we assume an average ownership rate of 2 devices, then the target market on day one of Apple Music is about 400 million people. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>If 10% sign up for the paid subscription service in the first year, that's 40 million subscribers.The correlates pretty well with another estimate by Jan Dawson of Jackdaw research reported by the NY Times .<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Dawson estimates that Apple Music could have 100 million subscribers in two years, more than double the subscriber base of 41 million of all the other music services combined. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>The math on this is pretty attractive.100 million subscribers is about $1 billion/month in revenue.Apple will pay artists about 70% of this, keeping about 30%, pretty close to the usual iTunes/App store fee Apple charges.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>There are additional costs for server maintenance and software development, but this is probably fairly high margin for Apple. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Using Apple's overall operating margin of 30% yields an Apple Music operating profit of about $270 million per quarter on revenue (after content expense) of $900 million per quarter.Apple has been posting some huge operating profits lately, about $15 billion per quarter, average in calendar 2014.So this isn't a huge uptick at the operating profit level, about 2%.But it's growth that adds to the bigger growth picture for Apple.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>The bigger growth picture is almost certainly a subscription video service equivalent to Apple Music. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>There are substantial hurdles yet to be overcome, not the least of which is content availability.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>The limited content available on services such as Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Prime demonstrate how reluctant video content creators are to participate in the subscription model But if Apple Music succeeds, and I believe it will, a video subscription service on similar terms won't be far behind.
