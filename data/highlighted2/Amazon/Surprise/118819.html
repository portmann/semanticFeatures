(NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha A flight to safety or preference for dividends will sink Amazon.Amazon Prime is hard to value, but invaluable to the whole.I have drawn a lot of criticism here over my pounding the table for Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ).Things got testy in March, when I called the shares cheap when they were below $380.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>When I talked about re-pricing its "secret sauce," Amazon Prime, in May, the shares had just passed $425. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Full disclosure.I started buying Amazon on the way down, eventually gathering up 100 shares at an average price of $330 for my retirement account.The shares fell below $300 for a time, a time where I compared them with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) at $400.It is important to note at this point that, at some time in the future, the bears will be right.Nothing rises forever.But at its current valuation of $210 billion, you're still paying a little over $2 for each $1 in estimated 2015 revenue, which should run at about $100 billion.Or more.You will still get your investment out.What makes things hard for everyone to value is Amazon Prime.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>It looks like a "Free Shipping" deal, a subsidy to regular customers which the bears assume must be costing Amazon a fortune. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>They forget Amazon's complex pricing algorithms that can roll those costs into the prices shown on a user's screen - which may be different for two users looking at the same item at the same time. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>They also ignore Amazon's infrastructure for breaking bulk and shipping cheap, which means its operating costs are far lower than anyone else in the e-commerce industry.In other words, there's retail margin there, operating profit being made available to other operations.While Amazon Prime creates loyalty for profitable business, the money is run more like Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ).Amazon Prime includes a ton of "free" music and "free" video, plus something Netflix does not offer - stuff you can buy on top of all that.You can rent or buy all sorts of stuff that's not on Prime, using the same studio "window" they use for Blu-Ray sales, with Christmas releases like "Unbroken" and even later releases like "The Kingsmen" available now.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>In practice, this means incremental revenue for video, on top of the roughly $8/month customers are paying for the "free" video. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>The reason it doesn't show up as profit is because Amazon uses this money to grow the business.The studio is scaling, just like the warehouses and cloud are scaling.It can be hard to pull this out from Amazon's reported results.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>While the company did deliver on its promise to break out Amazon Web Services last quarter, a business that could be worth $50 billion , and while we know about how many Amazon Prime customers there are (about 40 million), meaning that's a $4 billion top line by itself, we don't get visibility into all the moving parts and how they inter-relate. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>How many additional rentals are made by Prime customers and how many purchases?We know that Prime customers are far more loyal than any other e-shoppers, abandoning far fewer shopping carts before completing their purchases.So is Prime part of the marketing budget?Yes, it is.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>What could cause Amazon to miss its "whisper number," which presently stands at a loss of 12 cents per share on revenue of $22.36 billion? (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Maybe the European tax man will finally get his due - that could cause a shortfall on the bottom line. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Maybe cloud customers are finally turning away from "bare iron" infrastructure toward structured software and services, although I have seen no evidence of it. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Maybe Amazon's consumers just did not buy much last quarter, which is why Amazon is going out of its way to create "Prime Day" today, with tons of stuff on sale? (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Maybe it's just an over-hyped clearance sale, not a new holiday at all. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Let's summarize.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Out of a market cap of $206 billion there's $50 billion for cloud, probably $40 billion for Prime, and $110 billion in market cap to cover what looks like another $90 billion in 3025 revenue. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>In this market that's not unreasonable.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>When the market changes, when it starts demanding dividends, or when there's a flight to safety and a flight out of risk, then Amazon will fall. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>But not to zero.At $463, Amazon is priced to perfection, as is Netflix, and only a few other companies in the investment world.All such stocks have their Waterloo.But it won't be this week.Now, read the following discussion thread closely, and listen to what the bears say.Consider it carefully before you make an investment.Without predators, prey like bulls over-populate and starve for lack of forage.I like bears.In this case I just don't happen to be one.Source: When Will The Amazon Bears Be Right?Disclosure: I am/we are long AMZN, AAPL.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
