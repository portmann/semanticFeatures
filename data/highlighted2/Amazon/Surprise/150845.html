(NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha Wal-Mart is at a critical technical level: A heavy volume trade through $70 and the stock could be broken. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Looking at the Wal-Mart US segment, there appears to be an operating margin problem. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Wal-Mart's US revenue growth has actually been improving, while Sam's and International remain volatile. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ), the world's largest retailer and the "every day low price" (EDLP) leader until Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) came along, will report its fiscal Q2 '16 financial results before the opening bell on Tuesday, August 19, 2015.Street consensus, per Thomson Reuters, is expecting $1.13 in earnings per share (EPS) on $119.7 billion in revenue for an expected y/y decline of 7% in EPS and flat or just a slight +0.5% growth in revenue.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>The consensus Q2 '16 EPS estimate has fallen from $1.16 as of the May 2015 earnings release to $1.12 today, while the consensus revenue estimate has fallen from $120.9 billion as of the May 2015 release to $119.77 billion today, or roughly a $1.2 billion deceleration. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>While WMT is expecting just flat revenue growth in 2016 and 3% revenue growth in fiscal 2017 and 2018, thanks to pressure from Amazon.If readers would jump to the table below, you will see that while WMT US (essentially the US SuperCenter and big box business) is seeing improving revenue, the US segment's operating margins have begun to suffer.The reason is pretty clear too: Wal-Mart is in the proverbial death match with Amazon (long Amazon) and it is not scheduled to end anytime soon.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Joe Nocera, the famed New York Times business writer who had a featured column in the Saturday business section, once wrote in that column (in the early 1990s) that Wal-Mart was probably the single largest reason that inflation remained subdued during the late 1980s, early 1990s. (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>In hindsight, maybe technology had something to do with that low inflation rate, but today, and certainly since the late 1990s, and during the decade of the 2000s, Amazon's emergence and its price leadership has pressured even Wal-Mart's pricing ability, and likely continued to keep a lid on the core CPI. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Wal-Mart's recent initiative to pay core employees a higher wage is likely a smart move to retain store employees and ultimately improve store productivity.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>July 2015 retail sales: With WMT accounting for roughly 10% of all retail sales, and the July retail sales just reported Thursday, August 13, 2015, investors and those that follow economic data found that ex-auto and ex-gas, July retail sales rose +0.4% and overall +0.6%. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Per Bespoke's excellent research, some of which can be found free-of-charge on Seeking Alpha, "the strongest sector for the month was Non-Store (online) retail sales which grew 1.5% m/m."The point of this is that brick-and-mortar, particularly general merchandise retailers, some of which reported tough quarters this week, such as Macy's (NYSE: M ) and Kohl's (NYSE: KSS ) (no positions), continue to suffer from the migration to e-commerce and online shopping.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>This should not be a big surprise to readers, but the point being (again) that with Wal-Mart having such a large retail market share, the pressure on their top-line from Amazon must be excruciating. (SURPRISE) </span>Also, e-commerce is a double-edge sword for WMT since the retailer is having to really ramp up its spending on WalMart.com.Some think that WMT has the advantage in the e-commerce war since the stores can act as a shipping point or even a pick-up point for customers, but how delivery (same-day, overnight, Uber, LYFT, etc.) is managed and ultimately falls out will likely matter quite a bit.Signs of improvement: However, there have been some small signs of improvement the last few quarters: "Traffic" has been positive the last two quarters albeit only to a small extent, and ex-gas, "comps" have been positive the last four quarters, or at least three of those quarters were positive and the other quarter was flat at 0%.The challenge Wal-Mart is having is that, with pressure from Amazon and the dollar stores, it has had to use "ticket" to stabilize comps, so in effect WMT has had to strategically raise prices to stabilize comps, which is basically anathema to its business model.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Since last 2012, inventory growth has exceeded sales growth for all but one of those 11 quarters, but that difference has started to diminish. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>In the April 2015 quarter, inventory grew 2% while revenue was flat y/y, so WMT is adjusting the model to slower revenue growth.Gross margin has been positive the last two quarters after falling y/y the previous four quarters.The new urban stores like Walmart Neighborhood and Walmart Express have been comping mid-single digits.This is Wal-Mart's answer to incredibly enlightened urban areas like Chicago and other major cities that are anti-Wal-Mart.Wal-Mart's disclosure in its quarterly earnings reports is excellent.It provides investors with a lot of useful detail.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Wal-Mart US: This table surprised me in that it shows WMT US has an operating margin problem in the US, which is predominantly WMT SuperCenters and Wal-Mart e-commerce. (SURPRISE) </span>Revenue growth of 4% is pretty decent, particularly given the pressure by Amazon; however, it is clear that WMT US' operating margin has been under pressure for the last 6 quarters.Sams: The warehouse club game has been won by Costco (NASDAQ: COST ) by a pretty substantial margin, but Sam's - at least according to the above table - hasn't seen a revenue or operating margin issue until the last two quarters.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>I don't have much insight into the division other than COST seems to have won the market share and "best in show" battle. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>International: Mexico and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act still lingers as an expense issue.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>International is roughly 25% of total revenue and 15%-17% of operating profit. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Summary/conclusion: What is the end game for WMT in a incredibly competitive US market with Amazon and other low-cost providers?<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Here is an article written a few months ago, wondering if Home Depot's (NYSE: HD ) strategy of fewer stores, less headcount, and tremendous return of capital to shareholders is something Wal-Mart could duplicate? (SURPRISE) </span>Home Depot has opened four stores in the last year and has kept its square footage basically flat.Comps have improved dramatically, with store productivity and the free cash flow generation being enormous.HD's stock has risen from $30 to $120 in about four years.Technically, WMT needs to hold the $70.25 level hit in early 2000 during the halycon days of large-cap growth and tech in the late 1990s.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>A trade below the $70.25 level could indicate that WMT management isn't ready to change their stripes and focus on shareholder returns. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>The stock is oversold on the daily and weekly charts to a pretty strong degree.The $70 is an important level in my opinion.Fundamentally, WMT is not really cheap on any metric other than the 0.50(x) price-to-4-quarter trailing sales.At 9(x) cash flow, the retailer isn't compelling with little revenue or earnings growth and flat comps (at least thus far).<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Sentiment: Given the fundamentals and the stock price action, sentiment around WMT is probably as negative as it has been in years. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>That is a good contrarian sign, but still WMT management must make the store and productivity changes to drive EPS growth in a challenged revenue environment.<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Positive signs I would love to see come Tuesday morning, August 18th, 2015: Upside surprise on quarterly comps, say 2%-3%, with traffic growth and a slight decline in average ticket. (SURPRISE) </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>An upside revenue surprise: WMT has missed on the revenue consensus 11 of the last 14 quarters per my internal spreadsheet. (SURPRISE) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Some strong indication by management, including Doug McMillon, that maybe fewer stores, less headcount, and a better US segment operating margin could generate excess capital that could be returned to shareholders. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>Slower store growth, which means less capex (WMT's capex is currently 45% of its cash flow, while HD's capex is 15% of its cash flow).Today, I would much rather own Wal-Mart than Home Depot after Home Depot's run and current valuation.Per Morningstar, WMT still has "wide-moat" status, which is a far better designation than many mass merchandise retailers garner, but I think WMT needs to focus on operating margins and returning more capital to shareholders.Wal-Mart and Amazon are the two premier retailers in America today and neither is really going away.<span style='background-color: #77ff33'>Unless it is part-and-parcel or really integral to an e-commerce strategy (which maybe I don't understand yet), does WMT management really think the future is more and bigger US SuperCenters in America? (UNCERTAINTY) </span><span style='background-color: #77ff33'>A roughly 3% position in WMT and a similar position is held for clients in Amazon, and I'm happy with both right now. (UNCERTAINTY) </span>It is highly unlikely that WMT will be traded prior to Tuesday's earnings release and the technical action in the stock on Tuesday will tell me much about the prospects.Disclosure: I am/we are long WMT, AMZN, HD.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
