Additionally, this percentage will increase even more as 4K continues to become more popular, and LTE and fiber Internet continue to improve.Netflix does not own any of the internet bandwidth.They have deals for the short-term with the ISPs, but it's hard to imagine a scenario where Netflix can continue to ride on this platform with increasing bandwidth usage without having their costs increase.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix acknowledges this <b>risk</b> , and has already taken steps to innovate its way out of this problem .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>According to <b>Variety</b> , Netflix is re-encoding all of it 's content with more granulated bitrates .  (Uncertainty) </span>In order to understand what this means, you just need to know that all shows are different in the bitrate they require.A cartoon with a limited amount of colors and camera movements doesn't demand the same bitrate as an action movie like World War Z.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They are <b>hoping</b> that this will produce about 20 % in bandwidth savings .  (Uncertainty) </span>In addition to the decreased cost of bandwidth, ISP networks won't get as much traffic, thus customers like you and I will use less data, allowing us to save on data costs/usage.These algorithms that were created will scan every episode and movie in the Netflix library to determine how complex it is and what type of bitrate it requires.This encoding technology is especially great news for those overseas that have slower bandwidth speeds.Take a look at the chart below which examines internet speeds in Mbps (Megabits per second) produced by?Tech 2 First Post Report , citing the Akamai 1Q15 State of Internet Report: This new encoding technology that allows for Netflix to deliver high-quality videos with lower bandwidth usage will help launch a successful expansion into places like India in the future, and southeast Asia in early 2016.Netflix is a growth stock and is not valued based on profitability and ability to generate free cash flow in the short term.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However it <b>seems</b> to be valued based on it 's potential future earnings and it 's subscription growth , which will continue to remain at a healthy growth rate for a long time .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix is profitable in the US and expects to be close to breaking even in international markets in 2016.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This will be a big positive catalyst that can be expected <b>sometime</b> in the last half of 2016 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Most important and what will drive Netflix's growth in subscribers is it's incredibly positive reputation with consumers.This affects their ability to retain as well as attract new customers.This positive reputation is mostly due to Netflix's original content, which has an incredible amount of die-hard fans.Netflix set a record this year as the first online streaming service provider to garner the most Golden Globe nominations, at eight.This is also the first time since the year 2000 that HBO isn't leading the nominations in the television categories.Our world is only going to become increasingly personalized and "internetized," especially in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, where most of Netflix's long term growth is going to come from.All FANG stocks are going to benefit from this long term trend, especially Netflix since it is still barely penetrating most international markets.Of it's about 70 million subscribers, about 44 million are in the United States.Netflix's seemingly lofty valuation of $50 billion in market cap doesn't seem so lofty when you consider all of the potential it has due to having so many loyal customers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> the majority of subscribers would tolerate Netflix increasing prices $ 2 - $ 3/month domestically for it 's streaming subscription , providing a huge boost to their bottom line .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix raised the price of this service $1/month back in October to $9.99, and the market reacted very positively, shares of Netflix closed up 6.3% on the day of the announcement.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are many other long term growth options to consider when trying to value Netflix , which is why it 's such a hard stock to value and why there has been a lot of short term <b>volatility</b> with it 's share price .  (Uncertainty) </span>Think about what would happen to the stock price if they began streaming live sports?Or if they began placing ads on the side of their library to start bringing in ad revenue, like websites such as a Facebook have?Netflix is still far from being a mature company, and the market for subscribers will continue to increase at a very healthy rate.Here is a simple chart looking at domestic and international subscribers (in millions).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Here I am <b>assuming</b> a slower domestic growth rate in 2016 which will sustain in 2017 and 2018 , then the market will become saturated domestically and subscriber growth will drop to 3 million per year in 2019 and 2020 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For forecasting international growth I modestly put in a 9 million per year subscriber growth rate for the next five years , which would still <b>nearly</b> double the amount of subscribers that Netflix has now .  (Uncertainty) </span>With 70 million subscribers and about $7 billion in revenue this year, that means that Netflix is trading at 7 times it's revenue.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> in the year 2020 that Netflix is charging $ 9 per subscribing member of it 's streaming service ( which is conservative in my opinion ) and have no other sources of revenue , they will bring in about $ 14.3 billion in revenue .  (Uncertainty) </span>Which means that if their market cap was still $50 billion, they would only be trading at 3.5 times their revenue, which is more than reasonable given the growth opportunities.It is also helpful to imagine what type of premium a buyer would have to pay for Netflix when trying to determine a proper valuation, since that ultimately is what a company is worth, what someone is willing to pay for it.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For a mediocre comparison ; Snapchat was valued at $ 16 billion in it 's last funding series in <b>May</b> 2015 , and what do you think there revenue is going to be in 2015 ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Enough said.In summary, there are a plethora of growth options and positive upsides in the future that make it hard to value this growth stock.However, you have to be short-sighted to not see Netflix justify an even higher market cap in the upcoming years.If you haven't already, it's still not too late to jump onboard the Netflix bull train.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
