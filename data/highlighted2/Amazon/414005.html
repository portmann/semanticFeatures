What Can Netflix Do about the 20% Quota?The first option is to play it how the EU wants it: Add a bunch of EU programs to your lineup - at a hefty cost.NFLX can take the hit and become an on-demand NPR.Subscribers should not mind as long as none of the international programs are cut.The second option is to go into it half-assed: Sign a bunch of EU indie programs that won't be popular while cutting down on international content to reach that magical 20%.Subscribers will likely leave in this case, making it a cost/benefit trade-off.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But a possible side-benefit here could be to get the consumers on NFLX 's side , much like the <b>dreaded</b> `` This video is not available in your area due to your country 's regulations '' message on many EU versions of YouTube .  (Uncertainty) </span>Obstinate viewers circumvent these nanny laws by using VPNs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Perhaps Netflix can even assist in helping its subscribers learn and use VPNs - <b>maybe</b> offering a free VPN as part of the subscription .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This would be a clear attempt to elude the EU 's regulations , but what <b>could</b> the EU do ?  (Uncertainty) </span>NFLX is simply providing another service to its subscribers.The logical solution here is to let consumers decide what they want and to let companies decide what they offer.Of course, governments - especially those in the EU - are not exactly logical.In this light, the restrictions placed on NFLX are truly concerning.NFLX is unlikely to find an easy solution to this one.With much of its growth and P/E being bolstered by international subscriber growth expectations, the EU deal can easily become a significant headwind to NFLX.The easiest way to envision this is to be a Netflix subscriber in the US.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the government <b>suddenly</b> taxes Netflix , at least a part of that tax will be passed onto you .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Your cost has <b>suddenly</b> increased but with no corresponding benefit ; would you drop the service ?  (Uncertainty) </span>This is what NFLX faces in Europe.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And if NFLX gives in , other countries will see the potential to do the same .  (Uncertainty) </span>We are seeing this already in New Zealand.My Exploiting Earnings premium subscription is now live, here on Seeking Alpha.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In this newsletter , we will be employing both fundamental and pattern analyses to <b>predict</b> price movements of specific companies after specific earnings .
