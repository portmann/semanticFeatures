(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha The 20% quota and imposed financial contributions on Netflix certainly present a significant threat to its overseas growth.This regulation hurts Netflix in at least two ways: directly and via the subscriber base proxy.A recent article in the Financial Times reports Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) facing a 20 % local content quota in Europe . While this mandate has not yet been passed, it certainly presents a significant threat to NFLX's overseas growth.But let 's start with a side-note about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , so that I can clarify my reason for writing about NFLX 's future while ignoring that of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's main profits come from the cloud and from e-commerce at the moment , making <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime threats not <b>nearly</b> as serious as those targeting Netflix . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix is a subscriber-based business model , whereas <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is <i>more</i> of a transaction-based business model ( and a B2B business model for its cloud services ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Thus, I will focus on the threat to NFLX, not AMZN.That said, much of the following also applies to AMZN's Prime business.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Is the proposed mandate a form of socialism - taking from successful corporations and giving to <i>less</i> successful .  (Surprise) </span>One clause of the mandate says "yes": EU nations will have the ability to impose financial contributions - "impose" and "contributions" form an oxymoron, by the way - on Netflix to fund national works.This certainly betrays the entire idea of on-demand media, which brings consumers the ability to freely decide on what they watch.Gone are the days when everyone watches the same handful of channels (this still goes on in Japan).Netflix's major appeal - at least at the beginning - was its destruction of national boundaries when it came to media.Now, nations plan to "impose" upon Netflix to reinstate those boundaries, at least to a 20% extent.This regulation hurts Netflix in at least two ways.First, the imposed financial contributions will directly affect the company's bottom line.This comes at a time when the valuation of the company is falling.EBITDA/EV can be thought of the company's earnings performance versus its stock price.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It has been shown to be perhaps the strongest <b>predictor</b> of future stock price , and NFLX is performing quite poorly in this parameter , thanks to a toppling EBITDA : Now is not the time NFLX wants to see any financial impositions .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company 's growth has slowed and any headwinds simply give investors all the <i>more</i> reason to drop the stock until the situation improves .  (Surprise) </span>In addition, the proposal will restrict the advertisements allowed on NFLX, specifically targeting food and alcohol ads.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Second , the possibility of subscriber loss <b>appears</b> along with this proposal .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For example , one option NFLX has to meet the 20 % quota is to cut down on international programs ( as opposed to adding <i>more</i> domestic programs ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The loss of certain programs <b>could</b> drive away subscribers , exacerbating the damage of the original financial attacks .  (Uncertainty) </span>What Can Netflix Do about the "Financial Contributions?"The future is not set in stone.Netflix has several options.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>First , Netflix can simply give in , take the financial hit and <b>hope</b> to corner the market in Europe .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Other on-demand media companies , such as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , will also be affected by the regulations and <b>might</b> simply decide to stay out . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This <b>seems</b> to be <i>less</i> of an option for Netflix , which is much <i>more</i> of a one-trick pony than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>This would hurt Netflix initially, but as a relatively young company, it likely has the pivoting power to find a way to evolve and survive among the tight regulations.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If NFLX wants to be <b>optimistic</b> about the situation , it can see itself as a cable company , which traditionally must pay taxes .  (Uncertainty) </span>But then again, cable companies are what consumers are attempting to avoid with Netflixâ€¦ Second, Netflix can opt out.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With the EU looking for a piece of almost every sort of revenue stream , it <b>might</b> be wise of Netflix to avoid the trouble and remain a foreigner .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company <b>could</b> simply set its own rules to work with only nations that are tax-friendly .  (Uncertainty) </span>Already having an international foothold, Netflix pulling out of a country would certainly upset consumers.But to where do the consumers direct their anger: Netflix or the local government?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This solution will also hurt NFLX 's bottom line but <b>could</b> help it in other areas that matter , such as legal and operation fees .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Third , NFLX can offset the financial hit by charging <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span>If the company really does corner the market by accepting these rules , it can switch to an <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime model , in which subscribers pay per episode . This would drive away subscribers, but at what rate when other options are not available?When <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> begins making its monthly subscriber fees in three video streams instead of dozens , profit/data cost skyrockets . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Again , the subscriber loss <b>could</b> kill this solution , especially as consumers become <i>smarter</i> about seeking out free content online .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Torrenting and streaming sites provide everything Netflix does for free ( legality aside ) , and some subscribers simply wo n't be able or willing to handle the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime price model . What Can Netflix Do about the 20% Quota?The first option is to play it how the EU wants it: Add a bunch of EU programs to your lineup - at a hefty cost.NFLX can take the hit and become an on-demand NPR.Subscribers should not mind as long as none of the international programs are cut.The second option is to go into it half-assed: Sign a bunch of EU indie programs that won't be popular while cutting down on international content to reach that magical 20%.Subscribers will likely leave in this case, making it a cost/benefit trade-off.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But a possible side-benefit here could be to get the consumers on NFLX 's side , much like the <b>dreaded</b> `` This video is not available in your area due to your country 's regulations '' message on many EU versions of YouTube .  (Uncertainty) </span>Obstinate viewers circumvent these nanny laws by using VPNs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Perhaps Netflix can even assist in helping its subscribers learn and use VPNs - <b>maybe</b> offering a free VPN as part of the subscription .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This would be a clear attempt to elude the EU 's regulations , but what <b>could</b> the EU do ?  (Uncertainty) </span>NFLX is simply providing another service to its subscribers.The logical solution here is to let consumers decide what they want and to let companies decide what they offer.Of course, governments - especially those in the EU - are not exactly logical.In this light, the restrictions placed on NFLX are truly concerning.NFLX is unlikely to find an easy solution to this one.With much of its growth and P/E being bolstered by international subscriber growth expectations, the EU deal can easily become a significant headwind to NFLX.The easiest way to envision this is to be a Netflix subscriber in the US.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the government <b>suddenly</b> taxes Netflix , at least a part of that tax will be passed onto you .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Your cost has <b>suddenly</b> increased but with no corresponding benefit ; would you drop the service ?  (Uncertainty) </span>This is what NFLX faces in Europe.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And if NFLX gives in , other countries will see the potential to do the same .  (Uncertainty) </span>We are seeing this already in New Zealand.My Exploiting Earnings premium subscription is now live, here on Seeking Alpha.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In this newsletter , we will be employing both fundamental and pattern analyses to <b>predict</b> price movements of specific companies after specific earnings .
