( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Netflix has completed its `` cloud transition '' to Amazon.com cloud services . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite software that <b>could</b> let it get out , Netflix remains in with a primary competitor .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) has finished its "cloud transition," the company says in a blog post .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But there is a <i>more</i> important story here .  (Surprise) </span>That story is the Netflix-Amazon . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) alliance , an alliance that only <b>seems</b> to have grown <i>stronger</i> with time .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>And the fact that it is just one of many such alliances.Netflix has not always felt easy about having its service served by a primary competitor.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The company created its own Open Connect Network , a standard designed , in part , to make it <i>less</i> dependent on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , <i>better</i> able to move traffic and storage to other cloud providers that <b>might</b> provide it with a <i>better</i> deal . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Netflix now accounts for 37% of the Internet's traffic during peak viewing times - you can think of it as the 900-pound gorilla of Internet streaming.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But after a seven-year transition , during which it did everything it could have done , technically , to reduce its dependence on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services , Netflix is signaling that it 's <i>more</i> <b>dependent</b> than ever . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In reporting on this Business Insider made a common mistake by comparing <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> cloud revenues with those of Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) . They noted that Microsoft claimed $ 6.9 billion in cloud revenue last quarter , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> $ 2 billion . ( The original story calls this a one-year figure for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , and I expect that correction will have been made by the time you read this . ) <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's revenue is <b>almost</b> entirely driven by cloud infrastructure , bare bones rental of its cloud data centers . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft is selling software, booking that to cloud revenue when the software is used there.These are two different businesses.Despite Microsoft 's efforts to compete with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> on price regarding bare bones infrastructure , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's lead there continues to grow . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Netflix might love to be <i>less</i> <b>dependent</b> on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> infrastructure , and it has spent hundreds of millions of dollars preparing to be <i>less</i> <b>dependent</b> on it . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Yet it is <b>dependent</b> on it .  (Uncertainty) </span>Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) bit the bullet on this years ago, and began building its own cloud data centers, using cash flow from its basic business to do so.Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) can easily afford the $1 billion/quarter cost of being in the game from its search business, and now from YouTube revenue.Microsoft has used software as an ante into the cloud game, and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is now investing the necessary cash to get into it, according to Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's lead now has <i>less</i> to do with raw capital power and <i>more</i> to do with hard-won lessons learned in making that investment . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Cloud has consolidated , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is the winner . This is not a box Netflix can get out of.The company reported revenue of $ 1.8 billion last quarter , against $ 35 billion for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . It has about $1.8 billion of cash on its books, but it has committed that cash into its work in building a studio to rival Viacom's (NASDAQ: VIA ) (NASDAQ: VIAB ) Paramount, Disney (NYSE: DIS ), Fox (NASDAQ: FOX ) (NASDAQ: FOXA ), Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ) and Comcast's (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) Universal.That is its strategy, and throwing $1 billion/quarter into data centers would, at this point, make it impossible for the company to free itself from those content suppliers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Thus , Netflix has chosen to remain <b>dependent</b> on its primary competitor in net streaming .  (Uncertainty) </span>What is true for cloud infrastructure is also true for commerce infrastructure.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has several billion-dollar `` competitors '' who use its delivery infrastructure to serve their customers . It has many other companies using its payment infrastructure, especially now that sales taxes on online sales are becoming routine, raising the cost of compliance beyond what many small players can afford.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is an infrastructure company . Do not analyze it as a retailer.Do not analyze it as a streaming company.Don't even analyze it based on cloud revenues.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is infrastructure , infrastructure on which global commerce is increasingly <b>dependent</b> .
