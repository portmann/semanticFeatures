class='textDiv'>The AmazonNetflix Alliance Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Netflix has completed its cloud transition to Amazoncom cloud services Despite software that could let it get out Netflix remains in with a primary competitor Netflix NASDAQ NFLX has finished its cloud transition the company says in a blog post But there is a more important story here That story is the NetflixAmazoncom NASDAQ AMZN alliance an alliance that only seems to have grown stronger with time And the fact that it is just one of many such alliances Netflix has not always felt easy about having its service served by a primary competitor The company created its own Open Connect Network a standard designed in part to make it less dependent on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>better able to move traffic and storage to other cloud providers that might provide it with a better deal Netflix now accounts for of the Internets traffic during peak viewing times you can think of it as the pound gorilla of Internet streaming But after a sevenyear transition during which it did everything it could have done technically to reduce its dependence on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services Netflix is signaling that its more dependent than ever In reporting on this Business Insider made a common mistake by comparing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>cloud revenues with those of Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT They noted that Microsoft claimed billion in cloud revenue last quarter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>billion The original story calls this a oneyear figure for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and I expect that correction will have been made by the time you read this But Amazons revenue is almost entirely driven by cloud infrastructure bare bones rental of its cloud data centers Microsoft is selling software booking that to cloud revenue when the software is used there These are two different businesses Despite Microsofts efforts to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>on price regarding bare bones infrastructure Amazons lead there continues to grow Netflix might love to be less dependent on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>infrastructure and it has spent hundreds of millions of dollars preparing to be less dependent on it Yet it is dependent on it Facebook NASDAQ FB bit the bullet on this years ago and began building its own cloud data centers using cash flow from its basic business to do so Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL can easily afford the billionquarter cost of being in the game from its search business and now from YouTube revenue Microsoft has used software as an ante into the cloud game and Apple NASDAQ AAPL is now investing the necessary cash to get into it according to Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan But Amazons lead now has less to do with raw capital power and more to do with hardwon lessons learned in making that investment Cloud has consolidated and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is the winner This is not a box Netflix can get out of The company reported revenue of billion last quarter against billion for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>It has about billion of cash on its books but it has committed that cash into its work in building a studio to rival Viacoms NASDAQ VIA NASDAQ VIAB Paramount Disney NYSE DIS Fox NASDAQ FOX NASDAQ FOXA Time Warner NYSE TWX and Comcasts NASDAQ CMCSA Universal That is its strategy and throwing billionquarter into data centers would at this point make it impossible for the company to free itself from those content suppliers Thus Netflix has chosen to remain dependent on its primary competitor in net streaming What is true for cloud infrastructure is also true for commerce infrastructure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has several billiondollar competitors who use its delivery infrastructure to serve their customers It has many other companies using its payment infrastructure especially now that sales taxes on online sales are becoming routine raising the cost of compliance beyond what many small players can afford <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is an infrastructure company Do not analyze it as a retailer Do not analyze it as a streaming company Dont even analyze it based on cloud revenues <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is infrastructure infrastructure on which global commerce is increasingly dependent Disclosure I amwe are long AMZN GOOGL AAPL MSFT CMCSA I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for
