( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b>May</b> 4 2016 , 13:15 ET | By : Stephen Alpher , SA News Editor Speaking at Ira Sohn , Social Capital 's Chamath Palihapitiya says <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( AMZN -0.4 % ) is the one U.S. company with the potential to reach a $ 1T valuation . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The main driver will be <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime . Though the company doesn't disclose membership, estimates put it at 80M globally, and that's just the beginning, says�Palihapitiya.As for IT , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will do for it what it did for retail . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services is a `` tax on the internet , a tax on innovation ... that s owned by a for profit company that we can all own . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , he says , will be a $ 3T company by 2025 , with retail worth $ 1T , AWS worth $ 1.5 T , and other operations and cash of $ 500B . Yep.Remember that!I remember taking substantial profits in December 1999 when I heard that.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I should have taken <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I can also <b>predict</b> numbers out in 2025 .  (Uncertainty) </span>It's not like anyone will remember if I get them wrong.Not that I will get them wrong.I always nail the numbers 10 to 20 years out in the future.If you invite me to a conference I'll tell you.Contact me for fees.Soon no.By 2025.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And I 'm laughing at anyone making <b>predictions</b> with 10 years timeframe because they are literally impossible to make .  (Uncertainty) </span>Only hit by pure chance.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Just go back 10 years and check how many <b>predictions</b> became accurate on any given industry .  (Uncertainty) </span>Do n't take it personal on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . It's not like we are hurting its feelings go back 10 years ?no, only one year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>at the beginning of last year , 12 economists surveyed made <b>prediction</b> of the economy last year , 100 % were wrong as of year end .  (Uncertainty) </span>To quote the late Senator Dirksen from Illinois: I remember this kind of talk was associated with Apple a few months back.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Maybe after Q4 it <b>might</b> be time to get out if you have a position .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 'm not sure whether this guy believes that their market cap will be 3T by then or not , but the last I looked the US market cap right now is below 25T , so he is <b>predicting</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will be a huge share of US market cap , even accounting for over all growth . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Good luck with that!He's spinning a yarn.- $4.4 billion longterm debt/capital lease principal repayments -———-———-———-———-——— So AMZN's FCF is negative now and has been declining from positive over the past several years.In particular, debt and capital lease principal repayments are growing massively.E-commerce and AWS don't generate sufficient FCF on their own to fund cloud data centers, so AMZN must resort to debt and capital lease financing to fund and maintain its AWS cloud infrastructure.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will be cash flow-negative in perpetuity . AWS's reported "profits" are an illusion.When ongoing capex for AWS and ongoing debt/capital lease principal repayments are deducted, AWS is in the red forever.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is making rocket ships ... thats worth trillions ! Think of how many books they can sell on Mars!And with their rocket ships, they can ship everything to Mars for $99 a year!Who cares if they only make a $1 billion a year today (and most of that comes from AWS) they are making rocket ships people!<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>ETF Screener : Search and filter by asset class , strategy , theme , performance , yield , and much <i>more</i> ETF Performance : View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes  (Surprise) </span></div></body></html>
