costly federal student loans The perks of an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime membership cant make up for the fact that private education loans still have fewer consumer protections than federal loans Suzanne Martindale policy counsel for our colleagues at Consumers Union tells Consumerist Unlike private students loans like the one being touted by AmazonWells Fargo federal loans always come with flexible repayment and discharge options by lawThose options include protections if you lose your job or experience other hardships that make it tough to afford your payments Other advocates say the Wells FargoAmazon offer could mislead consumers into thinking theyre getting a good deal when they might not be For example federal student loans currently have a fixed interest rate of while private loans can reach as high as This is the kind of misleading private loan marketing that was rampant before the financial crisis Pauline Abernathy executive vice president of The Institute for College Access Success TICAS said in a statement Private loans are one of the riskiest ways to finance a college education Like credit cards they have the highest rates for those who can least afford them but they are much more difficult to discharge in bankruptcy than credit cards and other consumer debts Abernathy warns potential borrowers to be on the look out for the fine print of the loans <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Wells Fargo are trumpeting a discount while burying the skyhigh rates on these private loans and without noting that they lack the consumer protections and flexible repayment options that come with federal student loans she says Additionally the fine print for the loans includes a notice that Wells Fargo reserves the right to modify or discontinue interest rate discount programs for future loans or to discontinue loan programs at any time without notice That means that while you might receive a discount when taking out the loan it isnt guaranteed to stick While Wells Fargo and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>contend their new partnership is a way to provide options to collegebound students advocates say the offer is a new twist on an old scheme Private lenders entering into business partnerships to entice students is nothing new Martindale says In the previous decade these lenders partnered directly with college campuses to market their loans and the schools got kickbacks every time students signed up Those revenuesharing agreements between schools and lenders are now banned Financing ones higher education can be a difficult and informationpacked endeavor And with nearly twothirds of students who take out student loans unprepared for the financial obligations associated with the debt advocates advise that they should look at all options available to them If youre trying to figure out how to pay for college start with federal aid options first Martindale said Take out any available grant money then consider federal loans Military Personnel Face Student Loan Issues Despite Required Protections Wells Fargo Reportedly Under Federal
