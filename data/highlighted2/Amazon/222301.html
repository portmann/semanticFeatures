words or less for a cent payment and a semidetailed product review for a quick While many of the tasks are lowpaying they can add up fairly quickly if you have the patience to wade through the riffraff to find the better paying tasks If you work at a job that has regular short delays a customer service rep jumps to mind Turk could make for a great way to fill those breaks with tasks that pay Another cool way to essentially let <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>pay you is to create an account at Snagshout The site is completely free and works by giving you access to a large marketplace of extremely discounted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>products in exchange for an honest review of the discounted products you buy Were talking discounts that range from to off the original retail price Surprisingly some of the items are actually free or only cost cents You simply shop like you normally would then after the item arrives youll be asked to leave an honest review of the product By doing so youll gain access to another plethora of highly discounted items If used correctly youll be getting paid via huge discounts on items youd hopefully be purchasing anyways While some of these tips require more upfront work than others they all have the potential to be lucrative This is especially true if you have a blog in place and can incorporate
