( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services is now officially the highest operating income earner for the company . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The CFO says margins <b>may</b> be bumpy moving forward .  (Uncertainty) </span>I add that they won't show any significant decline because of a key factor.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services takes over the responsibility of EPS growth for the foreseeable future , it will boost market <b>confidence</b> in the company 's high valuation . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> than two months ago , on February 23 , I wrote an article called `` <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services : Holding The Profitability Bag For <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> '' . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>In that article , I spoke about why I thought AWS would soon become the highest earner ( by operating income ) for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) at the pace it was growing . My reasons were simple: the company's cloud unit was growing along with the industry at double-digit levels with very high margins of over 20%, while the retail business was continuing to see a fraction of that filtering down to the bottom line.But to be honest , even I did not expect AWS would overtake <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's North America segment in as little as one quarter . As of Q1-2016 , it officially leapfrogged over <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's domestic retail business to become the lead operating income earner for the company . Despite healthy overall sales growing across all three segments - North America revenue grew by 27 % , and International revenue grew by 24 % - it was the 64 % growth in AWS that has bought in ample breathing space for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's overall bottom line . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So AWS , which accounted for a mere 8.81 % of total revenue , is now responsible for <i>more</i> than 50 % of the company 's operating income as of Q1-2016 .  (Surprise) </span>But even in its two retail segments, the company has seen slight improvements in its operating margins.Are These Stellar Margins Temporary?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> recorded a healthy 23.5 % operating margin in AWS , but the company is not very <b>confident</b> of maintaining that high level moving forward . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>During the Q1 earnings call, CFO Brian T. Olsavsky said: "We're very pleased with the quarter, we came in at 23.5% operating margin - the new basis including stock-based compensation and other.We're very pleased.But stepping back with the 64% growth in AWS which is now a $10 billion business, but on the margin side, I would caution you that we're pleased, but it is very early to start drawing too many conclusions on the long-term margins in this business, they'll be bumpy over time."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I agree with that assertion that the current margin levels in excess of 20 % <b>might</b> be a hard one to hold due to the fluid nature of an industry that is seeing a four-way competition between IBM Corp. ( NYSE : IBM ) , Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , a <i>deeper</i> dive into the continual launches of high-value services around the core cloud offering tells me that <b>might</b> not be the case .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Investor-speak: Why Bumpy - Not Declining - Margins?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As you <b>might</b> know , AWS has already cut prices over 50 times .  (Uncertainty) </span>So, how do its margins continue to stay above the 20% level despite that?The answer is in those services I mentioned.A quick look at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's re : invent for the last two years will tell you how quickly its offerings are expanding in the cloud space . To put it simply, the company is trying to simplify the job of technology teams and turning it into income for itself.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Kinesis Firehose : To Stream data into the cloud <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Inspector : For Security and Compliance I understand these are services that many of us have never heard of before , but the point is that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> keeps adding to its features list - and every new introduction makes it that much <i>easier</i> to operate in a cloud environment . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That 's the main reason the company 's been able to sustain its margins despite the ongoing price war with the other cloud providers , and that 's why I 'm <b>confident</b> that as long as it keeps introducing value-added services to its cloud ecosystem , it will continue to see high margins for AWS .  (Uncertainty) </span>Yes, it will be bumpy as new revenues play catch-up with deep discounting practices, but I don't see the margins shrinking anytime soon.That 's going to be a big boost for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stock prices . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company will now show consistent profitability ; but <i>more</i> importantly , at least one segment has finally stepped up to fill the gap between reality and high valuation .  (Surprise) </span>From now on, the burden of EPS is squarely on AWS's shoulders, and retail has the breathing space it needs to become consistently and significantly profitable over time.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As I advised <i>earlier</i> today in my article about investing in Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) , a dollar-cost averaging approach would be the right one with AMZN as well .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>These are stocks where high valuation is gradually being justified through <i>greater</i> profitability ( <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ) and new revenue streams ( Facebook ) , so you should definitely look at owning your piece of these companies as they grow to maturity and grow into their current valuations .
