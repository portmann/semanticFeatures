class='textDiv'>WalMart Stifled By ECommerce And Global Factors WalMart Stores Inc NYSEWMT Seeking Alpha A lowly earnings report is setting the tone for the upcoming quarter The low digital footprint needs to be improved considering the size of the capital investment directed towards the segment Ecommerce giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is certainly taking away from the companys topline growth A now cheap base valuation and great dividend yield makes it more attractive than competitors but this is an incredibly risky environment to be buying into WalMart NYSE WMT is down on the year and has limited growth catalysts propelling it through the back half of Bogged down by ecommerce competition and global macro problems the companys downtrend is justified in my opinion Will it continue Based upon a lowly topline and problems with the bottomline particularly increased wages I say the downtrend should continue In this environment shorting would seem to complement the stocks current trend but is ballsy and should be done at your own risk Id advise to hold the stock through the current US equity downtrend Nearly every US equity is being adversely affected by the intense pressures of currency wars demands shifts underlying downtrends commodities energy and interest rate speculation WalMart is susceptible here really in terms of their international segment as this is the source of of their total revenue Brazil and Mexico account for large compositions which is bad for WalMart considering in the last month both have experienced notable downtrends in their currencies apart of a larger downtrend against the strengthening dollar WalMart has seen these regions slow to a growth rate of just per year since the end of Observe the currency pairs trending down in the last month below This is going to hurt assuredly as last quarter they lost billion on translation Being cognizant of these negative effects should point to lower net earnings next quarter The company is trading at a lower PE than direct competitor Costco NASDAQ COST at versus Both of these are dwarfed compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN who technically doesnt have a PE because of the negative EPS for the full year Forward PE estimates for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>from Reuters are coming in at Now this is great because we know that for the nearterm an entry could be justified considering its not nearly as expensive as other retail competitors however it is still just a basis That basis is even slightly faulty considering the company lowered the EPS guidance for the next year From a kicker perspective <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>also doesnt pay a dividend compared to Costco and WalMart who have a and yield respectively The latter is exceptional especially in this operating environment Revenues last quarter declined about million to settle at billion which is less than growth YOY Its flat over the LTM but up from Q COGS for WalMart are relatively flat in the LTM hovering at about billion Unfortunately were not seeing the positive diversion that wed like considering the heavy movement into ecommerce by the company The ecommerce business is assuredly the way to go but with it only accounting for of current operations its not going to be enough to dethrone some revenues from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Besides if you need to buy something online your first inclination is to go to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>not WalMart With more and more players entering the online retail market Jet being the most notable WalMart really needs to start seeing more efficacy from this segment and shift its customer base faster They sunk million capital investment for the platform in Q but needs to start creating a more attractive platform Competing with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>means competing with a million and growing user base a YOY sales increase for Q and sales that have increased x since Ecommerce sales for WalMart last quarter only had an impact of Thats pitiful Increasing wages every so often isnt a new story but WalMart likes to think it really creates a great environment for its employees to work in Wage growth is happening because of a stronger dollar and because of lobbying Now how hard is WalMart about to get hit because of this new expense Considering that the actual wage isnt part of the problem but rather the training programs and employee benefit package increases is really putting a dent in their bottom line They did raise the minimum wage to for employees but more importantly they just added billion to k programs Thats money that could be better spent considering the lagging ecommerce business SGA has increased billion since and after a increase from Q to Q this year in the amount of billion the company needs to cut back Trend towards ecommerce pay lower SGA costs and drive in higher operating revenues considering the operating margin has been stagnated at an average of since early last year Thats the direction the company needs to take before a reasonable growth rate can be achieved back to the high earlier this year Historically WalMart does exceptionally well during the holiday season Yes it is only the end of August but thinking about that January earnings call some five months out is a great idea if US retail equities continue to deteriorate Last year WalMart saw a jump in the revenue from billion in Q to billion in Q and net income of billion higher Could <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>further eat into this top and bottom line Assuredly but nonetheless its worth considering that sales and net income will pick up for the firm based upon shear volume Strong samestore sales despite the international setbacks grew in Q Management doesnt like it being this low and neither do I but you have to work with what you got in this market Its not hard to place your trust in CEO Doug McMillion when he does something as charitable as donating million on his own dime but maybe a bit better management of company cash flow would be vital to creating a stronger digital presence Holding the stock through this current market downtrend may be your best bet I personally am not going to advocate the cheap level as a time to pile on more shares because I think the US equity market is going to continue to sink but shorting the stock wouldnt give the necessary upside given the stocks low beta and general risk profile Wait and see what WalMart does and how they counteract increasing costs and lower revenues and if any betterment of the
