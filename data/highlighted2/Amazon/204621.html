E-commerce sales for Wal-Mart last quarter only had an impact of 0.3%.That's pitiful.Increasing wages every so often isn't a new story, but Wal-Mart likes to think it really creates a great environment for its employees to work in.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Wage growth is happening because of a <i>stronger</i> dollar and because of lobbying .  (Surprise) </span>Now, how hard is Wal-Mart about to get hit because of this new expense?Considering that the actual wage isn't part of the problem, but rather the training programs and employee benefit package increases is really putting a dent in their bottom line.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They did raise the minimum wage to $ 9.00 for 500,000 employees , but <i>more</i> importantly they just added $ 1.8 billion to 401 ( k ) programs .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>That 's money that <b>could</b> be <i>better</i> spent considering the lagging e-commerce business .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>SG&A has increased $12 billion since 2011 and after a 6.4% increase from Q1 to Q2 this year in the amount of $1.2 billion, the company needs to cut back.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Trend towards e-commerce , pay <i>lower</i> SG&A costs , and drive in <i>higher</i> operating revenues , considering the operating margin has been stagnated at an average of 5.6 % since early last year .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That 's the direction the company needs to take before a reasonable growth rate can be achieved back to the $ 90 high <i>earlier</i> this year .  (Surprise) </span>Historically, Wal-Mart does exceptionally well during the holiday season.Yes, it is only the end of August, but thinking about that January earnings call some five months out is a great idea if US retail equities continue to deteriorate.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Last year , Wal-Mart saw a jump in the revenue from $ 119 billion in Q3 to $ 131 billion in Q4 and net income of $ 1.6 billion <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Could</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <i>further</i> eat into this top and bottom line ? (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Assuredly, but nonetheless its worth considering that sales and net income will pick up for the firm based upon shear volume.Strong same-store sales , despite the international setbacks, grew 1.5% in Q2.Management doesn't like it being this low and neither do I, but you have to work with what you got in this market.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It 's not hard to place your trust in CEO Doug McMillion when he does something as charitable as donating $ 25 million on his own dime , but <b>maybe</b> a bit <i>better</i> management of company cash flow would be vital to creating a <i>stronger</i> digital presence .

(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I personally am not going to advocate the cheap level as a time to pile on <i>more</i> shares because I think the US equity market is going to continue to sink ; but , shorting the stock would n't give the necessary upside given the stock 's low beta and general <b>risk</b> profile .
