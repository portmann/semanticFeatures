next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Boeing production is of net benefit to Boeing A Boeing production cut will impact Boeing negatively for the next few years but may be offset by the turning profitable Img A Boeing under construction The announcement in the past week by Boeing NYSE BA that they will cut back Boeing production along with rumors the Boeing is next and low guidance on todays earnings by Boeing are sending its stock down There are a few things investors should be aware of going forward with regards to recent developments at Boeing Img A Boeing under construction in Everett WA Boeing is taking a million charge to cut Boeing production to per month from per month previously A slowing air cargo market which had previously been an area of strength for the Boeing forced the decision as well as little prospect for passenger version sales going forward Passenger sales were based on predictions that many airports around the world would reach capacity in coming years with Airbus in predicting Beijing and Hong Kong would have million and million passengers in when in reality they only had million and million in While there are certainly some airports that will face capacity constraints flying is shifting in ways to offset this with aircraft like the allowing airlines to economically fly long point to point and hub to point routes rather than hub to hub Marketing activity for the Boeing undoubtedly takes sales away from the Boeing Boeings most profitable aircraft so investors should see it as a net positive that the program has been cut back Unless the air cargo market makes an epic comeback in the next year or so Boeing may pick up a few orders from Air Bridge Cargo and Air China and Iran to fill production and end with production of the Air Force replacement for the US government It seems fitting that the last aircraft in that case could roll off the line September years exactly after the first roll out Another contender for a rate cut as recently reported by the Seattle Times is the Boeing There are a number of reasons for this Firstly an aircraft with a million price tag that is generally a year investment will have trouble selling when it is set to be outdated in under years as the Boeing X is launched British Airways has backed away from buying any new Boeing aircraft due to this despite its admiration of the aircraft and would rather lease them instead Secondly low interest rates over the past several years caused airlines to go on buying sprees and at this point it does not look like there are not too many potential new orders for an aircraft as large as the Boeing especially in a world undergoing an economic slowdown in many regions Finally the is one of Boeings most profitable aircraft and maintaining the current production rate will require steep discounts to fill delivery slots something that could reduce demand for the replacement X down the road Why make a sale now for next to no profit when Boeing can hold off a few years and make a much more profitable sale of the X The large widebody segment looks like at this point like it needs to digest its current capacity before large amounts of new capacity can come online especially with many regions of the world showing economic troubles Since this is one of Boeings most profitable aircraft it will undoubtedly have a negative impact on overall revenues and profits However in a few years time when the X launches Boeing will have a killer product that its largest competitor Airbus has no product to rival the upper range of the X This should lead to very strong margins for Boeing in the upper end of the Boeing X when it is launched Between now and the Boeing X launch however Boeing classics will need sold at a reduced rate to fill the production gap Something to consider is in when the world economy was in better shape and the outlook was more positive Boeing sold a mere aircraft Due to this Boeing may be forced to discount the significantly in the coming years to fill the production line until the X arrives Unfortunately for investors it will be a waiting game between now and the launch of the X for Boeing to once again realize the strength of this model on its balance sheet The Boeing has long been the cash cow of Boeing and that certainly looks set to continue The backlog of Boeing aircraft has never been higher and with the MAX entering production Boeing is set to increase production from aircraft a month currently to in in and in This was reaffirmed today and shows the strength of the division at a time when other programs are seeing production cuts The reengining project to create the Boeing MAX has cost a fraction of the cost of creating a clean sheet aircraft and has still delivered thousands of orders with Boeing executives recently suggesting the aircraft has at least a year production life ahead While years seems excessive considering possible competition from Brazil China India and Russia in the years ahead even will deliver massive returns for the program The Boeing MAX was launched with oil in mind so while oil remains at the levels it is at today it makes little sense for Boeing to develop any new aircraft for fuel efficiency benefits for the foreseeable future Instead Boeing can focus on increasing the scale of Boeing production and getting unit costs down further This will make the more competitive against Chinese and other emerging competitor aircraft that are being produced on a much smaller scale Despite the threat I see for the from high speed rail that I outlined here the increase in range for the MAX should offset lost opportunities for routes under miles where high speed rail in some cases will be a much large competitor Airlines are increasingly finding ways to use Boeing s on trans Atlantic flights to open new routes and the MAX with increased range and capabilities should take this usage even further something that should drive additional Boeing sales In addition low cost airline penetration in many large markets especially China and India is rather small and while alternatives like high speed rail may play larger roles in these markets than in developed markets there will certainly be a large market for the on longer routes where high speed rail does not make as much sense Boeing mentioned that out of over customers who operate the Boeing only have ordered the latest version leaving room for additional orders While the Boeing MAX will sell thousands of units the question will be how much market share can it hold against Airbus The ANEO is currently outselling the Boeing MAX around and the aircraft also features a geared turbofan engine something that the MAX does not have While the jury is still out on the success of the geared turbofan it could be a big edge for Airbus if it can meet its performance targets and maintain reliability This along with a more successful C from China than anticipated are the possible concerns I see ahead for the Boeing Img A Boeing rolls out of the paint shop The Boeing has seen somewhat of a second coming despite the launch of the Boeing Dreamliner with airlines looking at it favorably as a cargo aircraft The KC tanker program along with Fedex orders and interest from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and additional cargo companies suggest the aircraft will remain in production for years to come It recently saw its production raised from to aircraft per month a testament to its strong niche market The Boeing continues to do well and is opening up many niche routes for airlines worldwide Unlike the Boeing many airlines are still waiting for large numbers of s to be delivered while many more large airlines have yet to order the or A as replacements The launch of the in coming years and the large backlog and order strength should see the program at least maintain its current rate if not increase in the coming years Work on bringing the costs with the down should be beneficial in the coming years for Boeing shareholders as the plane will begin breaking even later in and profits should come from the program in the years ahead If you are looking to invest for the next year or so now is probably not a good time to get into Boeing However if you are looking for a long term investment Boeing is a excellent buy in my opinion This is simply a case of Boeing right sizing certain divisions of its commercial division to match the economic and market realities it is facing today Investors slowly add to any position as the stock is likely to see lower prices before bottoming The upcoming Boeing X the Boeing becoming profitable and continued success of the Boeing are all reasons to be bullish In addition Boeings largest customers the airlines are printing record profits like never before While they may not be buying certain categories of aircraft right now due to somewhat of an over supply economic uncertainty and interest rates increasing they will in the future When that time comes the airlines will be in better financial shape than ever before and should be able to take on much larger aircraft orders and expansion plans than they could in the past Tagged Investing Ideas Industrial Goods </div></body></html>
