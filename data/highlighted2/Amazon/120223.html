class='textDiv'>Netflix Eyeballs Arent Everything Netflix Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Netflix continually attracts more eyeballs but that isnt enough to guarantee future revenue Eyeballs will only stay sticky if Netflix keeps up the great original content That will be expensive and difficult to do consistently In Netflix NASDAQ NFLX the market continues to enthusiastically applaud member growth The more eyeballs the better it seems and NFLX has consistently attracted more eyeballs But while we remain impressed with member growth overall numbers actually came in a bit below our estimates this time around see chart below notably on the domestic front This makes us wonder what happens if NFLX sneezes and misses total international subscribers estimates And as the company gets more exposed to FX what happens when investors see a subscriber growth figure that seems uncorrelated with revenue Will more eyeballs always mean more revenue and viceversa or are eyeballs not really the beall and endall In a cult stock like NFLX we worry about skewed valuation and especially about the near to intermediateterm downside risk in the event of this type of miss or FXrelated confusion While we dont want to be downers the hype that surrounds NFLX heightens the worry and it keeps us away While subscriber growth buoys NFLXs price we want to get back to what we think is a matter of longerterm importance In our initiation we pointed out that what it really comes down to for NFLX is content Content is King Along these lines two quotes stood out to us from the press release We are making great progress shifting to exclusive content and expanding our original content which differentiates our service drives enjoyment for existing members and helps motivate consumers to join Netflix anticipate global content spend approaches B in on PL and over B in cash we will devote more investment to originals both in absolute dollars and percentage terms Management clearly knows what it is doing in this regard Netflix must have great content to be able to renew subscriptions and generate interest for new growth Quality shows typically last seasons so we think NFLXs allstars like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black will be the cornerstones that Netflix can grow on We remain somewhat unimpressed with the newest offerings however and believe that other people feel similarly which demonstrates that expectations are extremely high for continued successful releases This has good and bad sides but we still applaud Mr Hastings on continuing the focus on good content through this point Its been good enough to garner lots of Emmy nominations and thats saying something Theres an old adage that nicely fits Netflix and its performance of late Great company terrible stock Despite the simple math that a stocksplit does not create shareholder value shares were up heading into the quarter on this bit of news alone Two times more shares with half their former value is still equal to one Thus we believe the stock remains overvalued especially given the run Longterm longs congrats Otherwise its time to sell and heres why Expectations for new successful shows and now movies are extremely high Last time we checked there was no baseball player that ever batted a in their career nor any network or content provider that hit on every show Topline results net subscriber adds were relatively inline with our numbers but bookingsbillings change in deferred revenue recognized revenue came in well short of our B as FX had an ASP hit CC and still fell per user per month short of our estimate as the company searches for growth internationally On top of this expansion into China is questionable until and even then it may not happen taking a large market opportunity away Profitability will be purposefully be kept low to invest into the business until after where management expects to turn on the profitability button thereafter Bears will target this bulls will laud it Too much of a potential train wreck for us Below we show our estimates vs reported for Q for a quick reference and our estimates vs given guidance for Q as at the end of the day the numbers are what will really matter from a stock perspective We believe there is room for upside to net adds though revenue internationally will remain pressured Cash flow came in better than we had anticipated but as value choosers the companys lack of profitability keeps us on the sidelines Bulls valuations seem to be relying on some variety of EVEyeballs rather than EVSales which seems dangerous to us Eyeballs wont stick without something to stick to and thats where Content is King will always come back to roost So while subscriber growth which we look for as a healthy sign is fantastic we should always remember that content needs to be kept up This will require large investments that will weigh on profitability likely over the mediumtolong term Companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN have gotten away with this due to a mixture of FCF generation and pure market share dominance but NFLX already has competition and may face price wars On the latter we point to the famous Dollar Shave club battle going on commodity businesses of which razors are one lend themselves to price wars Were not saying that NFLX is facing a pricing war at this time as it maintains best of breed content original content is not a commodity see why its so important and the ability to stream anywhere anytime on any device However our riskreward numbers PT with riskreward and this larger mediumterm risk just keeps us away from the stock Good quarter but the narrow focus on eyeballs has run this stock into overvalued territory
