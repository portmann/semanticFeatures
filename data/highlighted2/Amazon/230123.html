(Uncertainty) </span>The full criterion behind this portfolio and the key stocks that it is comprised of are listed here .Ultimately, the aim of this portfolio is to be able to be able to generate a meaningful, defensible dividend stream to enable a comfortable retirement, and also generate sizeable capital appreciation.I also have the ambitious goal of being able to outperform the S&P 500 over the long term.It has occurred to me however that there are many high-quality, wide-moat stocks in the investing universe that do not pay dividends, or pay minimal dividends that have delivered consistent outperformance over a long period of time.Many of these have "tailwinds" which are propelling their businesses forward that my traditional dividend stocks don't have.Examples of such tailwinds include the shift from offline to online advertising (i.e. Baidu) and the shift from cash to credit (i.e. MasterCard).An investor who picked up these businesses at various points would have derived significant returns from such an investment.To this end, I've maintained a growth portfolio that has been focused on trying to attain some capital appreciation, and which has featured names like MasterCard (NYSE: MA ), Visa (NYSE: V ), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) and others.However I've never really had any goals or focus for this portfolio.It has just really coasted along.I happened to recently come across some comments from Jack Bogle the other day where he indicated that the next decade was likely to bring sub-par growth for index investors.His expectations were for 4-5% growth, or just 2% growth when netted for inflation.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Based on these things , I <b>believe</b> it is prudent for me to <i>more</i> seriously evaluate the existing set of growth holdings that I have , and look to structure something that has a good chance of outperforming what 's likely to be a fairly modest return from large indexes .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I also want to bring about a little bit of focus and direction to the portfolio.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To that end , I have set a target portfolio value of $ 1M , which I 'd like to attain in 11 years , starting from a base of <b>approximately</b> $ 217,500 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>My <b>hope</b> is to achieve an annual rate of return of just under 15 % each year over the next decade .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of course , it 's entirely <b>possible</b> that I do n't achieve this goal , but I wanted to give myself a stretch target to aim for .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I already own <b>almost</b> all the stocks in the portfolio , but I 'm giving myself some time to get the desired amounts and weightings that I 've outlined below .  (Uncertainty) </span>That time will also be used to lock down the final holdings.I want the portfolio to represent businesses that have strong barriers to entry and are also seeing rapid growth.These businesses should have the best chance of being bought and just held onto for at least 10 years, while seeing strong capital return.I don't envisage much if any active trading in this portfolio, once I've locked down on my core holdings.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Once finalized , I do n't <b>anticipate</b> adding additional capital to any of the businesses that have been included in Project $ 1M on a regular basis .  (Uncertainty) </span>Rather, I will only be adding to the holdings in the event that any of these stocks happen to be trading at values that get them a 5 star stock rating by either S&P or Morningstar (to the extent applicable).In addition to companies with wide moats and strong barriers to entry, I set a specific focus on companies with high returns on invested capital and that were generally achieving double-digit growth with respect to net income and earnings per share.My thinking here was that these types of companies would be likely be able to continue earning above double digit earnings while maintaining their market multiples, and thus generate strong rates of capital growth.I want to introduce the first set of names I've chosen for Project $1M.These companyies are MasterCard, Visa , Priceline (NASDAQ: PCLN ), Baidu, Mercadolibre (NASDAQ: MELI ) and Facebook.MasterCard and Visa - While the level of cash-based purchases has been steadily declining in developed economies, MasterCard cites a global credit card penetration of just 15%.There are likely years of growth to come in addressing the 85% of global transaction volume that is still cash-based.MasterCard and Visa are going to be the biggest winners, and biggest beneficiaries of this trend, in my view.Baidu - My central thesis behind my decision to include Baidu within my growth portfolio is that Baidu is the "Google of China".Typically search engines with the largest scale tend to dominate searches and ad revenue.This is the model that has played out in the U.S., and I expect the same to occur over time in China.Baidu controls close to 80% of the search market in China today.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The market for search grew <b>almost</b> 50 % in 2014 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Baidu will benefit from the continued move of China 's population online , and the ongoing trend for advertisers to shift offline advertising online , where people are spending <i>more</i> time .  (Surprise) </span>As disposable incomes in China accelerate, so too will online advertising spend.Baidu should be a net beneficiary of these trends.Baidu has also launched a number of new mobile services recently including a mobile cloud offering and mobile navigation, all of which should increase the stickiness of mobile search users, if not contribute to incremental revenues.Priceline provides one of the largest travel commerce portals globally.While online travel services seem like they have been around for quite some time, we are still in the early stages of a revolution in online travel.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Online travel agents still account for <i>less</i> than 40 % of global travel booking , although the trend is strongly accelerating towards online .  (Surprise) </span>Of the online travel agents, Priceline is the dominant player in this space, and has close to 30% of total market share.The global travel market is a very large, yet highly fragmented space, and is valued at over $1.3T in size.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So even though Priceline has a $ 60B valuation , my feeling is that the company can continue moving <i>higher</i> , particularly given recent growth has been in excess of 25 % annually .  (Surprise) </span>Facebook offers advertisers the ability to get cross device insights on a large user population with just one media buy.That should lead to compelling monetization for Facebook over a long period of time.Facebook is and will likely continue to be a highly relevant platform for advertisers well into the future.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>People spend <i>more</i> time on Facebook than any other platform .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Facebook has <b>roughly</b> 1.5 B monthly active users and over 1B daily active users , which make it relevant from the perspective of a regular and engaged user base .  (Uncertainty) </span>Worldwide major ad spend topped $520B in 2014, and online-based ad spend still only captured a relatively small 24% of this spend.Facebook will likely continue to be the advertisers' choice for engaging with users online.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Mercadolibre is emerging as the Ebay of Latin America , conducting a <i>greater</i> volume of ecommerce than Ebay or <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in the region . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>E-commerce is in its infancy in Latin America and accounts for just 5% of total commerce in the region, or a market of about $20B.In fact, internet penetration in Latin America runs at just 55%.However I expect internet penetration to steadily increase in the region over the next few years, as will the user propensity to purchase online.Increasing incomes per capita should also see steady growth in transaction size and total basket size of online commerce in the region.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Compounded 3 year revenue growth for Mercadolibre has been in excess of 20 % recently , with return on equity consistently in the mid-teens or <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise) </span>These are trends that I see continuing, With that said, here is how the portfolio currently looks.I will provide the rest of the trades and portfolio composition in a subsequent update.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
