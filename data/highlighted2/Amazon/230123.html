E-commerce is in its infancy in Latin America and accounts for just 5% of total commerce in the region, or a market of about $20B.In fact, internet penetration in Latin America runs at just 55%.However I expect internet penetration to steadily increase in the region over the next few years, as will the user propensity to purchase online.Increasing incomes per capita should also see steady growth in transaction size and total basket size of online commerce in the region.Compounded 3 year revenue growth for Mercadolibre has been in excess of 20% recently, with return on equity consistently in the mid-teens or higher.These are trends that I see continuing, With that said, here is how the portfolio currently looks.I will provide the rest of the trades and portfolio composition in a subsequent update.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
