collection regimes brick and mortar retailers have a customer data problem A new approach to solving this problem could be far more cost effective than existing attempts It could also represent a first step towards merging the online and instore shopping experiences thereby helping retailers close the gap We all know WalMart NYSE WMT dominates retail The company racks up more sales than then next four largest retailers combined Everybody also knows WalMart has a problem in ecommerce and that problem is named <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Actually its two problems the first of which is an anachronistic and manifestly unfair tax regime which continues to allow many online buyers to avoid paying sales tax This article will examine the second problem which is customer tracking and retention and how WalMart and other retailers can solve it possibly with the help of InvenSense NYSE INVN Despite the fact that Amazons ecommerce sales are almost x WalMarts the latters total retail sales are almost x that of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>In fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt even make the top ranking th on global the retail sales list Even though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>tops ecommerce sales of the other top companies are traditional brickandmortar stores It would be far more accurate to say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is dominating ecommerce than to say it is dominating retail The problem however is in changing shopper patterns as exemplified by relative growth rates According to Deutsche Bank NYSE DB <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>recently surpassed WalMart in consumer electronics sales and represents a whopping of the growth in that segment As technology plays a progressively bigger role in our lives that affects shopping decisions Someone may be happy to stop by the local WalMart when they know exactly what they want but when a shopper wants to research these days she does so online In the process ecommerce merchants learn not only what you bought but what else you looked at without buying and how long you lingered over each item This is known as dwell time and it allows retailers to market and even stock far more effectively Not having good dwell time information puts brickandmortar retailers at a severe disadvantage Attempts to gather such information at physical stores fall into three general categories Low Tech Retailers employee greeters at each store entrance with clickers that do simple head counts Deployment cost scales by number of entrances to the stores Wireless Beacons ShopperTrak would be an example of this approach which tracks mobile phone locations by triangulating connections This has the advantage of potentially tracking unique customers Deployment cost scales linearly with physical store volume By contrast InvenSenses Coursa Retail requires just one Bluetooth beacon at each entrance Specialized Cameras These are a more accurate means of tracking customer location but lack the uniqueness factor Facial recognition software has come a long way but is not deployed for these sorts of purposes as far as I know Prodco would be an example of this sort of operation and deployment cost should also scale by store area as opposed to volume InvenSense which Ive written about often in the past is offering a new way to collect dwelltime information called Coursa Retail Integrating InvenSenses indoor navigation software with stocking systems could also eventually provide stepbystep directions to products making a retailers smartphone app sticky with customers The benefits of that go well beyond no more having to ask Where can I find A branded application that shoppers actually use is the holy grail of modern retailing as it provides additional promotional opportunities both in store and out In of retail apps were used once and then deleted Some progress has been made since then but a December survey limited only to those who already shop on their phones says only shoppers have kept a merchant app installed for more than a year Thus I think providing an augmented realitystyle app that can actually enhance the instore experience beyond what would be available on web browser will be key for Big Box chains to crack this nut Course Retail will undoubtedly be cheaper than the latter two dwell time options above because unlike them it integrates directly into a retailers app with only one Bluetooth beacon per store entrance In fact my attempts to research the deployment costs of the technological competitors gave me the impression that they are already on the way out Coursa Retail is also better than the lowtech approach in almost every way as it gathers more than simple head counts so it could potentially charge much more than it would cost to deploy greeters Nonetheless given that I am unable to quantify highend pricing for the other solutions Ill simply do some calculations on the lowtech approach in order to take an educated guess at the minimum TAM total addressable market for Coursa Retail using stats from WalMarts US operations That example is chosen because WalMart not only dominates Big Box retail it also dominates IT spending and innovation in that industry Sadly to my mind the US still dominates retail as well WalMart pays its US employees a minimum of an hour Minimum wages elsewhere in the US may be cheaper but I think is a good figure when excluding the cost of benefits etc WalMart has over locations in the US and more than K worldwide but Ill only count the US supercenters of which there are My local store is open am to am days a week but lets say WalMart were only to employ a single greeter for the busiest hours of each day The very conservative annual cost for employing greeters would then be x x x WalMarts percentage of overall retail is in the low double digits However its locations are probably a much larger percentage of Coursa Retails target market If we generously estimate WalMart as of the Big Box retail chain opportunity that would mean the conservatively priced annual revenue opportunity for Coursa Retail in the US alone is approximately equal to all of InvenSense sales for all of The impact to the bottom line would be far higher as the product should have much lower costs which do NOT scale linearly like hardware does WalMart would of course be the acid test for Coursa Retail It was chosen as an example because the numbers also happen to approximate the opportunity represented by the entire rest of the industry All of these calculations are potentially material to InvenSense and they have been completely overlooked by other analysts who have focused on IoT and market sensor diversification Investors reading such analysis should consider the execution risks and time involved with such projections None of these calculations should be construed to represent my overall outlook for INVN stock which has much more pressing issues beginning with the Apple NASDAQ AAPL report on Tuesday evening InvenSense follows with its own report two nights later I would be very happy to hear news of smaller deployments first thereby proving the concept and enabling better terms with larger organizations later on Regardless of whether or not it provides a Coursa update in this report analysts who still regard InvenSense primarily as a motion sensor company are sorely lagging behind The companys nonlegacy opportunities are still speculative but clearly quite substantial This article is meant to offer thoughts on the future of retail and how it will eventually progress beyond its current awkward state Just as Pokemon GO has created a craze by introducing a rudimentary version of augmented reality to gamers traditional retailers will start to see a breakout when they can successfully begin to merge the online and instore shopping experiences WalMart has long spent over billion annually on IT and has inhouse development that can be expected to lead the way with or without help from InvenSense WalMart reports again in the midAugust Look for the IT spending trend to increase even as media marketing starts to decline Other outfits like Target NYSE TGT Home Depot NYSE HD and CostCo NASDAQ COST would probably need the help though Each of them will want to customize their approach to their specialties offering customers better service and unique functionality in the process For instance instore location might enable an app to offer advice or summon a representative based on the section you are in I think the base value proposition for doing this via the sensorassisted applications approach is clearly irresistible The adoption of this approach will eventually harm Amazons retail operations which is why Bezos is diversifying as fast as possible In the meantime the investment prospects for AMZN are still largely dependent on when the US government can regain some semblance of functionality particularly with regard to a long overdue remake of the tax code Competitiveness depends on evolution and that applies to societies as well as corporations I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business
