loan program for small sellers in the United Kingdom on Tuesday and is looking to launch it this year in seven more countries including China Until now the eretailer has offered the service only in the United States and Japan <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Lending founded in plans to offer shortterm working capital loans in other countries where it operates a thirdparty sellerrun marketplace business the head of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Marketplace Peter Faricy told Reuters The countries are Canada France Germany India Italy Spain and China where credit is becoming a key factor in competing for new vendors and grabbing market share The service is on an inviteonly basis and is not open to all sellers on Amazons platform Other large retailers including eBay Incs EBAYO PayPal and Alibaba Group BABAK which run thirdparty marketplaces are also turning to credit to boost their vendor base Some lending industry officials who help lenders assess credit risk say these retailers are taking on risky loans because they do not know the credit markets in which the sellers are operating Small businesses have high failure rates especially in China and India added William Black a former US banking regulator and professor at the University of Missouri <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>said it can safely offer loans based on internal data and because it takes loan payments out of the sales proceeds it pays sellers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>offers three to sixmonth loans of to to help merchants buy inventory It makes money on interest and takes a cut of all sales on its marketplace which now account for about percent of total <span style='background-color:

a repeat loan The company declined to provide specific figures and also did not say how much it plans to lend this year Amazons Faricy said the company has become better at understanding the inflection points in a small or medium business where capital can make a difference We know a lot about our sellers business and invite only those who we think are in the best position to take capital and grow he said In China where Alibaba lends to small businesses offering such loans is more of a business requirement analysts said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has very little share in China and they havent been able to break out of that so this is a very important necessary step for them to be able to grow said Gil Luria analyst with Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles In other countries including India where there is a scramble to expand the online shopping market small business loans could offer a distinct competitive advantage Luria said Online lending accounts form about percent of the roughly trillion of outstanding personal and small business loans in the United States The default rate for small businesses with credit under a million stood at percent in but is seen rising to percent in as new lenders with varying ability to assess risk increase lending according to small business credit ratings provider PayNet Retailers like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>do not have data from sellers about some markets in which they operate and relying on internal seller company data is not enough said William Phelan president of PayNet Sellers interviewed by Reuters and writing on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>forums cited interest rates on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>loans ranging from percent to percent in line with loans from banks and business credit cards Stephan Aarstol chief executive of Tower Paddle Boards an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>seller said he has taken four loans from the company starting in March because of the speed and simplicity of the process It took him five days to get his first loan The problem
