Amazons market cap could reach trillion Thats roughly times the companys current size making for a tough road ahead if its to get there <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>needs to maintain its sales pace of the last ten years and also see its valuation stay the same I dont think it will Will <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN be worth trillion some day Maybe but in the next ten years It seems doubtful but thats what Chamath Palihapitiya CEO of Social Capital said during the Sohn Conference earlier this week Currently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>trades with a market cap of roughly billion a figure that would need to increase tenfold in the next decade to hit that trillion mark If anything the gain only seems possible because the stock has already climbed more than over the last ten years Now Im obviously not a venture capitalist like Palihapitiya so his ability to look into the future has far more credibility than mine I dont disagree with him that Amazons Web Services business will create an unbelievable number of losers when it finally gets to scale Nor do I doubt the power of Amazons retail business or its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime service I have Prime and I love it If you believe in the Internet you have to believe in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>If you believe in buying things you have to believe in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>If you believe in consumer consumption you have to own <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Honestly I dont disagree with any of Palihapitiyas comments I do believe in all of those things <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>CEO Jeff Bezos has done an incredible job growing the company over the years The argument over its profitability or lack thereof is justified but shareholders have issued a vote of confidence letting Bezos reinvest for future growth He and the shareholders know how much bigger <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can still become Previously Apple NASDAQ AAPL was the favorite to reach trillion in market cap But given its sluggish growth and low valuation it may not be the first to reach the milestone despite having a billion market cap Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL with its billion market cap has a shot at being first too I dont doubt that any of these companies will eventually hit trillion or trillion or even trillion but my biggest issue with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>trillion call is the time frame <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has grown its revenue from through at a compound annual growth rate CAGR for short of almost Definitely impressive If the company maintains that growth rate sales will climb from billion in to trillion in Slapping a x sales valuation the current sales multiple on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>on the stock gets its market cap to trillion That wont be any easy ride though First <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has to continue growing sales at a robust sales rate With AWS thats possible for at least the next several years and I dont think anyone doubts the megashift happening between traditional retailers and the move to ecommerce But its hard to imagine a company growing its revenue by per year at the size that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is Look at Apple This is sort of an applestooranges comparison because the two are in different businesses but the point will be the same Apples revenues soared from billion in to roughly billion in posting a similar CAGR to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>at As Apples revenues soared however its valuation plummeted as pointed out in the chart below So not only does Amazons revenue growth have to keep the same pace for the next ten years that it has maintained over the previous decade but the stock also needs to maintain the same valuation I would say personal electronics has a lower upside than Amazons business model But even under that premise its hard to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>not hitting a max out point somewhere down the line where growth doesnt come so easy Hypothetically if its sales did hit trillion in but its PS multiple shrunk from x to x the market cap would only be about trillion So Amazons journey to a trillion market cap basically hinges on two outcomes Either the valuation goes higher while its sales pace slows or sales continue to grow and the valuation stays constant It seems like if any company can make it to trillion in ten years its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>I personally just dont believe the stock can get there in that little of time That doesnt mean the stock is a sell or should be avoided If you love the product and want to own it go for it Just be realistic in its upside Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the
