( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <i>Earlier</i> this week at the Sohn Conference , it was said that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's market cap <b>could</b> reach $ 3 trillion . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That 's <b>roughly</b> 10 times the company 's current size , making for a tough road ahead if it 's to get there .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> needs to maintain its sales pace of the last ten years , and also see its valuation stay the same . I don't think it will.Will <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) be worth $ 3 trillion some day ? <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> , but in the next ten years ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It seems <b>doubtful</b> , but that 's what Chamath Palihapitiya , CEO of Social Capital , said during the Sohn Conference <i>earlier</i> this week .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Currently , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> trades with a market cap of <b>roughly</b> $ 316 billion , a figure that would need to increase ten-fold in the next decade to hit that $ 3 trillion mark . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If anything , the 1,000 % gain only seems <b>possible</b> because the stock has already climbed <i>more</i> than 1,800 % over the last ten years .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Now , I 'm obviously not a venture capitalist like Palihapitiya , so his ability to look into the future has far <i>more</i> credibility than mine .  (Surprise) </span>I do n't disagree with him that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Web Services business will create `` an unbelievable number of losers '' when it finally gets to scale . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Nor do I <b>doubt</b> the power of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's retail business or its <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime service . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>I have Prime, and I love it.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>`` If you <b>believe</b> in the Internet , you have to <b>believe</b> in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you <b>believe</b> in buying things , you have to <b>believe</b> in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you <b>believe</b> in consumer consumption , you have to own <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . '' (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Honestly , I do n't disagree with any of Palihapitiya 's comments - I do <b>believe</b> in all of those things .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> CEO Jeff Bezos has done an incredible job growing the company over the years . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The argument over its profitability ( or lack thereof ) is justified , but shareholders have issued a vote of <b>confidence</b> , letting Bezos reinvest for future growth .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>He and the shareholders know how much <i>bigger</i> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can still become . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Previously, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) was the favorite to reach $1 trillion in market cap.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But given its sluggish growth and low valuation , it <b>may</b> not be the first to reach the milestone despite having a $ 510 billion market cap .  (Uncertainty) </span>Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), with its $485 billion market cap, has a shot at being first, too.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do n't <b>doubt</b> that any of these companies will eventually hit $ 1 trillion , or $ 2 trillion or even $ 3 trillion , but my biggest issue with the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> $ 3 trillion call is the time frame . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has grown its revenue from 2006 through 2015 at a compound annual growth rate - CAGR for short - of <b>almost</b> 26 % . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Definitely impressive.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the company maintains that growth rate , sales will climb from $ 107 billion in 2015 , to $ 1.07 trillion in 2025 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Slapping a 3x sales valuation - the current sales multiple on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> - on the stock gets its market cap to $ 3.2 trillion . That won't be any easy ride though.First , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has to continue growing sales at a robust sales rate . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With AWS , that 's possible for at least the next several years and I do n't think anyone <b>doubts</b> the mega-shift happening between traditional retailers and the move to e-commerce .  (Uncertainty) </span>But it 's hard to imagine a company growing its revenue by 26 % per year at the size that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is . Look at Apple.This is sort of an apples-to-oranges comparison because the two are in different businesses, but the point will be the same.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple 's revenues soared from $ 19.32 billion in 2006 to <b>roughly</b> $ 234 billion in 2015 , posting a similar CAGR to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> at 28.33 % . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>As Apple's revenues soared however, its valuation plummeted, as pointed out in the chart below.So not only does <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's revenue growth have to keep the same pace for the next ten years that it has maintained over the previous decade , but the stock also needs to maintain the same valuation . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I would say personal electronics has a <i>lower</i> upside than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's business model . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But even under that premise , it 's hard to see <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> not hitting a `` max out '' point <b>somewhere</b> down the line where growth does n't come so easy . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Hypothetically , if its sales did hit $ 1.07 trillion in 2025 , but its PS multiple shrunk from 3x to 2x , the market cap would `` only '' be about $ 2.1 trillion .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>So <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's journey to a $ 3 trillion market cap basically <b>hinges</b> on two outcomes : Either the valuation goes <i>higher</i> while its sales pace slows , or sales continue to grow and the valuation stays constant . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>seems</b> like if any company can make it to $ 3 trillion in ten years , it 's <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I personally just do n't <b>believe</b> the stock can get there in that little of time .  (Uncertainty) </span>That doesn't mean the stock is a sell or should be avoided.If you love the product and want to own it, go for it.Just be realistic in its upside.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology</div></body></html>
