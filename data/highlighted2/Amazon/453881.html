A counterfeiting problem amazon counterfeit products anticounterfeiting measures sales sellers fulfillment orders retail When you see a brandname handbag or laptop being sold on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for well below its retail price its hard to not hit the Buy button But is it a good deal or just a counterfeit in brandname clothing A new report from CNBC claims that a growing number of products sold by third parties on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>are fakes and that the etail giant is having a difficult time getting a handle on the problem As a result sellers of legitimate goods say their revenues are hurting as more and more companies copy their products and offer them at steep discounts while customers are complaining that their newly acquired items arent the real deal Heres what we learned about Amazons counterfeit problem and what the company is doing to make it right Opening the floodgates CNBC reports that counterfeiting on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has grown significantly in recent years as the company welcomed Chinese manufacturers into its operations Sales from Chinabased sellers more than doubled last year A mixed bag of products The increase in sales from Chinese companies on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been made possible in part because the company has made it easier for these manufacturers to get their products to customers quickly For example <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>registered with the Federal Maritime Commission to provide ocean freight for Chinese companies to ship goods directly to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>fulfillment centers cutting out costs and inefficiencies Commingling and false security The increase in products from Chinese merchants has led to commingling of products at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>fulfillment centers This allows the company to put together orders with products from different sellers making it difficult to know youre purchasing a counterfeit item These orders because they come from an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>fulfillment center often contain a FBA Fulfilled By <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>tag Critics say this gives customers a false sense that their products are legitimate CNBC suggests that a counterfeit jacket could be sent to an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>facility by one merchant and actually sold by another A lack of safeguards Critics say that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>hasnt done enough to prevent the influx of counterfeit items or prepare shoppers for the possibility that they might not be buying what they thing they are This is evidenced CNBC says in the number of sellers that offer highend products at deep discounts While these sales should raise a red flag for both customers and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>that simply doesnt appear to be occurring As long as the logo looks legit people assume you have that item a Canada Goose seller offering a jacket for on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>tells CNBC Trying to make it up CNBC reports that while counterfeiting is supposedly on the rise at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the company is trying to help customers after the fact If customers can verify that theyve bought counterfeit goods <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will push sellers to refund the purchase or they kick the sellers off the site Walter Price a portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors tells CNBC However some customers and sellers have run into issues with these policies Back in a man who purchased a pair of headphones from a thirdparty seller on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>told Consumerist that when he tried to resell them on the site they were flagged as counterfeit Additionally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does have an anticounterfeiting policy that works to respond to infringement notices submitted by sellers who feel their products are being ripped off CNBC reports that the fraudsters often make it difficult by changing the names of their stores and relaunching as quickly as they were removed from the site Theyve been reactive not proactive Chris McCabe a former <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>merchant account investigator
