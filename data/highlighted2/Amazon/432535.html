These guys were true visionaries by being early adopters.In contrast, Oculus Rift was initially funded only four years ago with $2.4 raised in a kick-starter campaign.Here's a partial list of some of Vuzix's accomplishments: · Created the first video eye wear to support stereoscopic 3D for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 · In 2011, Vuzix introduced the first production model augmented reality glasses, the STAR 1200 · M100 given the CES Innovations award in 2013 Vuzix has had products available for over a decade.Not only were their VR headphones the first to market, but they also offered one of the first pieces of AR eye wear, the M100, which they tout as "the world's first commercially available Smart Glasses."Yet, despite their accomplishments and early adopter status, Vuzix has failed to generate significant revenue and they have yet to bring a wildly successful product to market… at least as measured by commercial uptake.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> importantly , they did develop a good enough product to attract the attention of several large enterprise customers , including DHL and many others .  (Surprise) </span>Breaking into the enterprise market is never easy and Vuzix's ability to garner customer interest was a major accomplishment for the little company.And it was this success at bringing a product to market and successfully target enterprise customers that drove Intel to look at Vuzix.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , after looking at VUZI , in January 2015 , Intel invested <b>almost</b> $ 25 million for a 20 % stake in the company .  (Uncertainty) </span>The Intel investment, according to Ross Silver of Vista Partners, was "to accelerate the introduction of Vuzix next generation fashion-based wearable display products."This represents a redirection of strategy for Vuzix.Whereas, in the past, they were working on both VR and AR devices, the Intel investment was designed to focus them on the augmented reality aspect of their business.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Which makes a ton of sense - it 's the <i>larger</i> portion of the market and it fits well into Intel 's model of winning over large enterprise customers instead of targeting the end consumer .  (Surprise) </span>As we near the midpoint of 2016, Vuzix is rapidly approaching a key moment in their history.They have over a year's time and effort under their belt since Intel bankrolled the company's development efforts.They have been focused on the next version of their smart glasses, the M300 which launches in this quarter.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> that this focus on the M300 comes at the expense of the company 's VR efforts .  (Uncertainty) </span>When you have a development partner pushing for, and funding, one initiative, it makes sense to curtail efforts that distract from this vision.The company hints at this in their most recent conference call when they say, "as far as the 10,000 units go, yes that's our first batch we haven't - the company is not committed to a second batch at this stage."In the VR space, Vuzix has been hampered by production issues in the past.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They are now competing directly against <i>better</i> funded competitors , such as Oculus Rift .  (Surprise) </span>The company has inventory, sales of which will help their balance sheet tremendously.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Yet , unless they see some large , upbeat response from the consumer market ( and it does n't look like they are expecting this ) , I <b>believe</b> the sale of the 10,000 iWear VR devices will mark the end of the company 's efforts in virtual reality headgear .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Instead , they will become a much <i>more</i> focused AR firm , with their future riding on the success of the M300 and its successor the M3000 .  (Surprise) </span>How will the M300 be received by the market?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is the key question for Vuzix at this time as their future <b>seems</b> to rest squarely upon success of the product .  (Uncertainty) </span>Here's Paul Travers take on the M300, from the company's recent conference call: "We have developed the M100 at a time when Vuzix was not as well capitalized and still have sold thousands of M100s.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We feel this has helped to create a high level of pent-up demand for a new solution that would solve the many problems current smart glasses have and we are <b>confident</b> the M300 does just that .  (Uncertainty) </span>As a result, we expect the M300 will far outpace the M100 sales, both in units and speed of sales ramp.Over the coming months, the initial demand should be robust."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This quote was from <b>May</b> 13th , about two weeks ago .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Since the M300 rollout is this quarter , one would <b>hope</b> that the company 's take on sales and demand would be fairly in touch with the market .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> that 's the case , judging from his comments , the Intel investment has been put to great use in developing and delivering a quality product to market - the end result being `` pent-up demand '' and potentially `` robust '' sales .  (Uncertainty) </span>Those are great words for investors, but how does one quantify this opportunity?It's certainly not that easy.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As an example , DHL has indicated to Vuzix that over 200,000 employees <b>could</b> potentially be using AR devices down the road .  (Uncertainty) </span>Vuzix feels that this is the tip of the iceberg as they have, according to the company, 194 potential customers in their pipeline.They have been whittling that figure down a list of 50 V.I.P. customers, all of whom are large enterprise companies that, if converted to purchase orders, would each be buying many thousands of units.Now, admittedly, Vuzix is not the only player in the AR space.Google was here with their Google Glass; one can easily envision them returning to the space.Facebook and Oculus certainly have AR on their radar screen.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And a number of <i>smaller</i> players are producing competitive products to the M300 .  (Surprise) </span>It is therefore easy to see that Vuzix will have their work cut out for them in securing their niche in this space.However, with their headstart in bringing products to market and their relationship with a premier technology partner, one can imagine that VUZI has the potential to be one of the long-term winners in this arena.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Vuzix , like many small cap companies , <b>appears</b> to be a very binary opportunity .  (Uncertainty) </span>The future of the company, and an investment therein, is really centered around the uptake of their next product to hit market - the M300.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the M300 takes off , so will shares of Vuzix .  (Uncertainty) </span>Of this I'm certain.Meanwhile, since Intel invested last year, the shares have been relatively stagnant.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>There are , however , several mitigating factors that <i>lower</i> the risk profile of VUZI and make it <i>less</i> binary of a situation than it <b>appears</b> at first glance .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>For instance, the iWear product.Vuzix is sitting on an inventory of 10,000 devices.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If sales of this are robust ( which they <b>could</b> be due to the strength of the product in drone racing of all places ) , the company will get several millions of dollars in sales .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> importantly , it will get very positive PR in an industry that is <i>hotter</i> than hot .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Success of any degree with their virtual reality product would certainly drive the shares <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Secondly, Intel is a great partner for a small company like Vuzix.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A while back , a famous football coach said that he did n't like passing a football because there were three <b>possible</b> outcomes , two of which were bad .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Well , in my opinion , accepting an investment from a strategic , like Intel , has the opposite <b>risk</b> reward scenario .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>There are three <b>possible</b> outcomes ( buyout , increased investment , no <i>more</i> investment ) and two of the three are positive .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>More</i> exactly , if the company demonstrates any positive execution on their business plan , one would fully expect Intel to want to increase their <b>exposure</b> to AR through Vuzix .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Taking this one step <i>further</i> , buying VUZI stock now is a relative deal compared to where Intel invested .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Intel 's cost is $ 5 per share , only marginally <i>lower</i> than current trading prices .  (Surprise) </span>Yet, investors buying Vuzix today have the benefit of knowing that the M300 has had a successful pre-launch development and will be coming to market very soon.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Basically , the major <b>risk</b> Intel took in investing pre-product development is off the table , making the stock a relative bargain compared to when they invested .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Vuzix succeeds with the M300 , I think Intel will eventually buy them .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , buying VUZI strictly on <b>anticipation</b> of an Intel buyout would not be advisable .  (Uncertainty) </span>Intel's involvement and the potential success of iWear are simply two factors that give Vuzix an opportunity to create positive returns for investors.The main driver here, and the primary reason for owning the stock, is the M300.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If the M300 is a commercial success ... well , let 's let the CEO tell you in his words , '' ... it 's exciting right now , and over the summer I think it 's going to be even <i>more</i> fun .
