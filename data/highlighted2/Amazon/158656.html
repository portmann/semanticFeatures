( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can leverage its existing international consumer audience ( 1.6 billion monthly visits globally ) to build the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime sub base globally . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Including cost-savings from free shipping , we <b>believe</b> Netflix is <i>more</i> than 20 % <i>more</i> expensive on an annual basis than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can leverage IMDB 's size and international popularity to generate traffic to its Instant Video segment , as the feature becomes offered in <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> countries internationally . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>HDTV penetration is much <i>higher</i> in the US than other countries , and we <b>believe</b> this negates the HD advantage Netflix enjoys in the US .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime is creating the first Internet one-stop-shop , a central location where visitors can do all things Internet on one platform . We recently wrote an article detailing why <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) had a significant competitive advantage in Japan over streaming rival Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) . The two companies will make excursions into the Japanese market within the next month.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> the competitive advantage <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will benefit from in Japan is internationally transferable , and gives <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> significant leverage in international markets . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While we do not <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's significant leverage will dramatically hurt Netflix until <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Instant Video 's library can reasonably compete with Netflix 's streaming content , we <b>believe</b> it does position <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime as an international juggernaut . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>According to Similar Web analytics , Amazon.com gets <b>roughly</b> 1 billion unique visits globally per month . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>This makes Amazon.com the 14th most visited website in the world , and the most visited shopping website in the world . Visitors to the website also visit with a purpose, and are among some of the most engaged audiences on the web.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Visitors spend an average of 8 minutes and 30 seconds per visit and scroll through <b>roughly</b> 11 pages per visit .  (Uncertainty) </span>A low 27.71% bounce rate means that users are engaging with a high number of the pages they visit.It is important to note here that these are visits to simply Amazon.com . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> operates under several different domains specific to countries of operation . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Amazon.de , the company 's German-specific website , generates <b>roughly</b> 180 million visits per month and is the third most visited shopping website in the world and the fifth most visited overall website in Germany . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's UK domain receives <b>roughly</b> 140 million visits per month and is the sixth most visited shopping website in the world and the eighth most visited overall website in the UK . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Japan domain receives <b>roughly</b> 140 million visits per month and is the seventh most visited shopping website in the world and seventh most visited overall website in Japan . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>All told , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> generates traffic upwards of 1.6 billion global visits per month to its online platforms . The US accounts for 74 % of Amazon.com 's 1 billion monthly visits , and a rough average of 5 % ( rough average of US traffic share on foreign domains ) of the remaining 600 million of the traffic through other <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> domains . That equates to the US accounting for just around 770 million of the 1.6 billion global visits per month, or 48%.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The US accounts for <i>less</i> than 50 % of the online traffic to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This means that 52 % , or <b>roughly</b> 830 million visits per month , of the online traffic to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is from foreign countries . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can leverage these 830 million international monthly visits to generate mass market adoption of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime in international markets . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>As <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continues to bundle features into it 's $ 99 annual Prime subscription , market adoption of Prime should be even further strengthened . In Japan, for example, Prime will cost only $32 per year, versus Netflix's subscription price of $65 to $144 per year, and these rates do not account for the money saved through Free Shipping offered in the Prime subscription.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>On prices , we <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime is much <i>more</i> favorably priced than Netflix , even in the US . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In the US, Prime is offered for $99 per year while Netflix will cost users $108 per year.To understand the magnitude of cost-savings via free shipping , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> reported $ 849 million in shipping revenues in Q1 2014 . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Roughly</b> 60 % of sales were from North America , so transferring that 60 % North America mix to net shipping revenues , we arrive at a rough estimate of $ 509 million in US shipping revenue in Q1 .  (Uncertainty) </span>In the same quarter, 198 million US consumers bought something online.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If we <b>assume</b> every single one of those people bought something from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , that equates to an annualized rate of around $ 10 in shipping per online shopper . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In reality , not all US online shoppers in the quarter shopped at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , but we believe this assumption is offset by the fact that not all North American revenues are from the US , so we believe the $ 10 shipping revenue per shopper is as good an estimate as <b>possible</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>For <i>more</i> comparable services of streaming content , then , the price difference in the US can be seen as <b>roughly</b> $ 89 per year for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> versus $ 108 per year for Netflix , meaning Netflix is <i>more</i> than 20 % <i>more</i> expensive on a comparable , annual basis . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Prime also includes music and photo content that Netflix does not include , so the true comparable prices are actually <i>more</i> skewed in favor of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's cheapness ( streaming video content vs. streaming video content ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>A lesser-known but nonetheless poignant advantage of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Instant Video over Netflix is IMDB . The International Movie Database , or IMDB , was acquired by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in 1998 . It is a place where individuals can browse, rate, comment on, view show times and release dates of, and discuss movies and television shows.Most importantly for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Instant Video , though , IMDB provides links to watching streaming movies online . Seeing as IMDB is owned by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , the only links provided are <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Instant Video links . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Each movie 's page will tell the browser if that movie is or is not available on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Instant Video , and provides a link to watching the movie on <b>Amazing</b> Instant Video if it is available . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The same goes for TV shows.There exist significant synergies here.Amazon.com is the top destination site for those visiting IMDB.com , and IMDB.com is among the top referring sites for Amazon.com . This means a significant amount of IMDB 's traffic flows through to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Instant Video . IMDB is no small website either.The website generates 380 million global monthly visits, making it the 32nd most popular website in the United States and 57th most popular overall website in the world.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> importantly , though , IMDB is the number one movie website in the world .  (Surprise) </span>This is because IMDB has a huge international presence.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , <i>less</i> than 50 % of is internet traffic comes from the US . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Only 37% of IMDB's internet traffic is from the US.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>By comparison , rival movie website Rotten Tomatoes , which features links to all streaming content providers including both <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Netflix , generates <i>less</i> than 10 % of the traffic of IMDB and is much <i>more</i> centralized in the US . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can leverage IMDB 's size and international popularity to generate traffic to its Instant Video segment , as the feature becomes offered in <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> countries internationally . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> this is a significant competitive advantage that will generate substantial traffic .  (Uncertainty) </span>We see users being attracted to this model in the same-way consumers prefer to shop at one-stop-shops.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In many ways , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and its online platform are becoming the Internet 's first one-stop-shop through diverse shopping categories , video streaming services , video recommendation and rating services , music content , photo storage , and <i>more</i> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Netflix Advantage - HD and Exclusive Content While <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has a <i>larger</i> content library than Netflix , Netflix has <i>more</i> HD offerings . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>HDTV penetration reached 81% of US homes in 2015.That number has grown since 2014, according to Ofcom Consumer Research ,who found that 66% of US homes had an HDTV in 2014.HDTV is clearly ingrained in American society and has become the standard.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Accordingly , non-HD streaming is an issue for a majority of Americans , and Netflix 's <i>larger</i> HD portfolio is considerably <i>more</i> attractive than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's <i>smaller</i> HD portfolio in the US . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>This is not the case in other countries.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Outside of Spain ( 61 % ) , Austria ( 67 % ) , and the United Kingdom ( 63 % ) , other nations have a considerably <i>lower</i> HDTV household penetration rate than the US .  (Surprise) </span>Italy only has 56% HDTV penetration, while Germany, France, and China have 48%, 40%, and 37%, respectively.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Japan comes in at a <b>startlingly</b> low 27 % .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> this lower-than-US HDTV household penetration will buy <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> some valuable time to increase its HD portfolio . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We do not forecast a <i>smaller</i> HD portfolio as a hindrance to Prime subs in countries outside of the UK , Spain , and Austria given low HDTV household penetration .  (Surprise) </span>We also affirm , however , that HDTV is growing in popularity globally and that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> must increase its HD portfolio in the long-term to retain Prime subs . Netflix does have a distinct advantage in terms of exclusive content.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is attempting to expand its exclusive content portfolio , but the popularity of Netflix-exclusive shows like `` House of Cards '' and `` Orange is the New Black '' makes it difficult for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to compete on exclusive content . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is estimated that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime has <b>roughly</b> 41 million subs in the US . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Those 41 million members spend on average <i>more</i> than 2x the non-Prime <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> customer on Amazon.com . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Timothy Stenovec at The Huffington Post had this to say about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime users : Prime is `` creating all of these loyal <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> customers that increasingly look to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> before they go anywhere else , '' Michael Levin , a partner at CIRP , told The Huffington Post . "People aren't even going to the retail outlets.They 're starting at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . '' <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As we said <i>earlier</i> , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime is creating the first Internet one-stop-shop : a location where visitors can do all things Internet on one platform . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We see this next-gen Internet one-stop-shop as having huge upside , and <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime may a <i>bigger</i> juggernaut than most currently <b>believe</b> .
