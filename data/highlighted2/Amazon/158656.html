leverage its existing international consumer audience billion monthly visits globally to build the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime sub base globally Including costsavings from free shipping we believe Netflix is more than more expensive on an annual basis than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can leverage IMDBs size and international popularity to generate traffic to its Instant Video segment as the feature becomes offered in more and more countries internationally HDTV penetration is much higher in the US than other countries and we believe this negates the HD advantage Netflix enjoys in the US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime is creating the first Internet onestopshop a central location where visitors can do all things Internet on one platform We recently wrote an article detailing why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN had a significant competitive advantage in Japan over streaming rival Netflix NASDAQ NFLX The two companies will make excursions into the Japanese market within the next month We believe the competitive advantage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will benefit from in Japan is internationally transferable and gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>significant leverage in international markets While we do not believe Amazons significant leverage will dramatically hurt Netflix until <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Instant Videos library can reasonably compete with Netflixs streaming content we believe it does position <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime as an international juggernaut According to Similar Web analytics Amazoncom gets roughly billion unique visits globally per month This makes Amazoncom the th most visited website in the world and the most visited shopping website in the world Visitors to the website also visit with a purpose and are among some of the most engaged audiences on the web Visitors spend an average of minutes and seconds per visit and scroll through roughly pages per visit A low bounce rate means that users are engaging with a high number of the pages they visit It is important to note here that these are visits to simply Amazoncom <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>operates under several different domains specific to countries of operation Amazonde the companys Germanspecific website generates roughly million visits per month and is the third most visited shopping website in the world and the fifth most visited overall website in Germany Amazons UK domain receives roughly million visits per month and is the sixth most visited shopping website in the world and the eighth most visited overall website in the UK Amazons Japan domain receives roughly million visits per month and is the seventh most visited shopping website in the world and seventh most visited overall website in Japan All told <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>generates traffic upwards of billion global visits per month to its online platforms The US accounts for of Amazoncoms billion monthly visits and a rough average of rough average of US traffic share on foreign domains of the remaining million of the traffic through other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>domains That equates to the US accounting for just around million of the billion global visits per month or The US accounts for less than of the online traffic to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>This means that or roughly million visits per month of the online traffic to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is from foreign countries We believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can leverage these million international monthly visits to generate mass market adoption of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime in international markets As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>continues to bundle features into its annual Prime subscription market adoption of Prime should be even further strengthened In Japan for example Prime will cost only per year versus Netflixs subscription price of to per year and these rates do not account for the money saved through Free Shipping offered in the Prime subscription On prices we believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime is much more favorably priced than Netflix even in the US In the US Prime is offered for per year while Netflix will cost users per year To understand the magnitude of costsavings via free shipping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>reported million in shipping revenues in Q Roughly of sales were from North America so transferring that North America mix to net shipping revenues we arrive at a rough estimate of million in US shipping revenue in Q In the same quarter million US consumers bought something online If we assume every single one of those people bought something from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>that equates to an annualized rate of around in shipping per online shopper In reality not all US online shoppers in the quarter shopped at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but we believe this assumption is offset by the fact that not all North American revenues are from the US so we believe the shipping revenue per shopper is as good an estimate as possible For more comparable services of streaming content then the price difference in the US can be seen as roughly per year for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>versus per year for Netflix meaning Netflix is more than more expensive on a comparable annual basis Prime also includes music and photo content that Netflix does not include so the true comparable prices are actually more skewed in favor of Amazons cheapness streaming video content vs streaming video content A lesserknown but nonetheless poignant advantage of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Instant Video over Netflix is IMDB The International Movie Database or IMDB was acquired by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in It is a place where individuals can browse rate comment on view show times and release dates of and discuss movies and television shows Most importantly for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Instant Video though IMDB provides links to watching streaming movies online Seeing as IMDB is owned by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the only links provided are <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Instant Video links Each movies page will tell the browser if that movie is or is not available on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Instant Video and provides a link to watching the movie on Amazing Instant Video if it is available The same goes for TV shows There exist significant synergies here Amazoncom is the top destination site for those visiting IMDBcom and IMDBcom is among the top referring sites for Amazoncom This means a significant amount of IMDBs traffic flows through to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Instant Video IMDB is no small website either The website generates million global monthly visits making it the nd most popular website in the United States and th most popular overall website in the world More importantly though IMDB is the number one movie website in the world This is because IMDB has a huge international presence Like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>less than of is internet traffic comes from the US Only of IMDBs internet traffic is from the US By comparison rival movie website Rotten Tomatoes which features links to all streaming content providers including both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Netflix generates less than of the traffic of IMDB and is much more centralized in the US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can leverage IMDBs size and international popularity to generate traffic to its Instant Video segment as the feature becomes offered in more and more countries internationally We believe this is a significant competitive advantage that will generate substantial traffic We see users being attracted to this model in the sameway consumers prefer to shop at onestopshops In many ways <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and its online platform are becoming the Internets first onestopshop through diverse shopping categories video streaming services video recommendation and rating services music content photo storage and more The Netflix Advantage HD and Exclusive Content While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a larger content library than Netflix Netflix has more HD offerings HDTV penetration reached of US homes in That number has grown since according to Ofcom Consumer Research who found that of US homes had an HDTV in HDTV is clearly ingrained in American society and has become the standard Accordingly nonHD streaming is an issue for a majority of Americans and Netflixs larger HD portfolio is considerably more attractive than Amazons smaller HD portfolio in the US This is not the case in other countries Outside of Spain Austria and the United Kingdom other nations have a considerably lower HDTV household penetration rate than the US Italy only has HDTV penetration while Germany France and China have and respectively Japan comes in at a startlingly low We believe this lowerthanUS HDTV household penetration will buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>some valuable time to increase its HD portfolio We do not forecast a smaller HD portfolio as a hindrance to Prime subs in countries outside of the UK Spain and Austria given low HDTV household penetration We also affirm however that HDTV is growing in popularity globally and that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>must increase its HD portfolio in the longterm to retain Prime subs Netflix does have a distinct advantage in terms of exclusive content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is attempting to expand its exclusive content portfolio but the popularity of Netflixexclusive shows like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black makes it difficult for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to compete on exclusive content It is estimated that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime has roughly million subs in the US Those million members spend on average more than x the nonPrime <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>customer on Amazoncom Timothy Stenovec at The Huffington Post had this to say about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime users Prime is creating all of these loyal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>customers that increasingly look to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>before they go anywhere else Michael Levin a partner at CIRP told The Huffington Post People arent even going to the retail outlets Theyre starting at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>As we said earlier <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime is creating the first Internet onestopshop a location where visitors can do all things Internet on one platform We see this nextgen Internet onestopshop as having huge upside and believe <span
