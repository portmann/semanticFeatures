class='textDiv'>What Happened <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Removes Half Of The Streaming Video I Bought Consumerist Whoops It looks like portions of our site are being blocked Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator whered it go amazon streaming video amazon video drm By now most of us are aware that videos come and go from Amazons streaming offerings that a movie available on Prime this month may be gone the next There are even caveats in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>terms of service that videos you purchase from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may vanish from your online library and theres nothing you can do about it What you dont expect is for half of a video you buy to suddenly disappear without explanation For months Consumerist reader Rick and his yearold enjoyed the digital double feature of How the Grinch Stole Christmas and Horton Hears a Who When watched online the two classic animated Dr Seuss tales were part of the same single stream Grinch comes first immediately followed by Horton and some bonus features for a total running time of about minutes Then last week they went to watch the video only to have it end abruptly after the Grinch credits rolled Additionally as you might notice in the looped GIF above the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>screen that shows up after the video ends is only for the Grinch not for the double feature that had actually been purchased Rick likened it to buying a full CD off iTunes only to have Apple decide at some later date to remove half the songs Or if you bought a short story collection on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Kindle and half of the stories were removed His attempts to get a solution from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>were frustrating On Twitter the companys response bots told him to call customer service where no one could explain what was going on He says that it could be a technicality or that its possible that the content may have changed but that it should not have changed for me since I already purchased it writes Rick Customer service first promised to have someone call him back within a few hours That subsequently changed to within a couple of days We were finally able to get someone at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>HQ to look into Ricks case and were happy to report that his video has been restored and Rick got a credit from the site Horton and the bonus features are back and the video is back to the hour minutes that it should be he tells Consumerist The toddler will be thrilled This is the big mystery In emails to Consumerist a rep for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would only say that the problem was something that needed to be corrected on our end for that specific title Weve asked if it was a technical issue or a licensing mixup of some sort but have yet to hear a response A technical glitch is possible but seems unlikely given that the title of the video also reverted to just the Grinch As for the possibility of a licensing issue there is some confusion at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>The company rep tells Consumerist that once a video is purchased it will remain forever in that users digital library but thats not what the fine print says The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>video terms of service says that while purchased video content will generally continue to be available to you there is the potential it might become unavailable for content provider licensing restrictions In such a case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will not be liable to you if Purchased Digital Content becomes unavailable for further download or streaming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does allow users to download purchased videos but not onto computers only onto compatible phones and tablets Downloading onto your phone may result in just getting the standard definition version of the video so if you later want to watch it on your TV be prepared for blurry ugliness Additionally that downloaded content is still protected by Amazons rights management software meaning the only way to watch it would be through the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>apps on those devices So downloading is a way to make sure you always have access to the video you purchase but its also incredibly limited Are Amazons
