Ultimately, all cloud services revolve around server side programming in various forms.Think of this as apps that run on the cloud server rather than the user's device.Typically, these cloud side apps interact with the user's device through a browser or special purpose app.These cloud side apps power everything from Netflix to Google search.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple probably <b>could</b> never hope to compete with the big cloud providers , but it <b>could</b> provide server side programming to its sizable developer base who would undoubtedly find useful ways to incorporate this capability into their apps .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Ultimately , this would make iOS apps <i>more</i> useful by allowing developers to offload <i>more</i> tasks to cloud-based computation .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Apple enabled developers to build apps that would run as a service on Apple cloud servers , it would create a recurring revenue stream for Apple based on enterprise ( developer ) customers .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And Apple <b>could</b> even get some <i>more</i> mileage out of Swift by using it as the basis for the server side programming language .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I'm not overly concerned about Peak iPhone, but I acknowledge that the day will come, and Apple needs to be ready for it.Beyond diversifying its hardware product line, Apple needs to diversify its revenue sources.I'm convinced that enterprise cloud services of the type I describe above are a huge opportunity for Apple.Apple has tremendous infrastructure and expertise that it can bring to bear on the cloud services problem.Apple just needs to put that capability at the service of developers so that they can develop server-side programs to augment their client side apps.Many of Apple's existing cloud services such as iCloud drive and Siri already play that role of augmenting apps at the device level.Providing developers with a way to create server-side apps and services that go beyond what Apple provides would be a boon to Apple's developers and to Apple itself.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think the opportunity is so large that Apple is <b>probably</b> already moving in that direction .  (Uncertainty) </span>The introduction of CloudKit was just laying the groundwork for the future.The bottom line is that Apple still has many potential revenue streams left to exploit in the cloud services area.I remain long Apple and consider it a buy for those with a long-term (several year) investment horizon.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Technology</div></body></html>
