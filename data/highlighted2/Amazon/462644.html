( NASDAQ : NFLX ) | Seeking Alpha Watch for institutional selling as they collectively owned 84 % of the float prior to earnings .  (Uncertainty) </span>Avoid buying Netflix as “amateur hour�?plays out.Wait and see if any rallies are sustained first.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you were unfortunate enough to be long on Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) shares through earnings , it is crucial to re-assess your position from a risk standpoint and determine if you are able to stomach the possibility of a further price decline , which <b>may</b> be significant due to the makeup of the current ownership float .  (Uncertainty) </span>Prior to earnings, only 16% of Netflix's shares were owned by retail investors.The other 84% were owned by institutions.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This creates a dangerous situation for new bullish <b>speculators</b> , as most of the float is already owned by `` big money . ''  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If institutions decide in the coming weeks and months that they want to unload their positions , it will likely cause prices to sink further from current levels .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Furthermore , the <i>more</i> prudent buyers who are interested in initiating a long-term position in Netflix are unlikely to buy during `` amateur hour '' and are instead looking to scoop up shares well below $ 80 , with <i>earlier</i> `` smart buyers '' looking to buy in the $ 70 range , and bargain bin `` deal makers '' looking to accumulate in the $ 60 range and <b>possibly</b> even $ 50 although that is likely to be a stretch .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The biggest issue that makes Netflix currently uninvestable from the long side is not necessarily the lower-than-expected subscriber count , hamster-wheel business model ( takes a lot of effort and time to create an original show , and only a single sitting for binge-watchers to digest it , coupled with the entertainment adage that `` you 're only as good as your last project '' ) or cutthroat competition from a myriad of competitors such as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , YouTube , cable providers , etc. , but simply the price that the market has paid for Netflix shares as a whole over the past year and a half . For the record, Netflix is still a solid company.It is profitable and still growing, and I personally have a subscription which I enjoy using and have no plans of canceling.However, it is simply impossible for the company to grow as quickly as its stock has over the past year and a half.If Netflix shares were not so obscenely expensive, share prices would have likely remained stable post-earnings.Even after a 15% correction, Netflix as a whole is still priced at a colossal $37 billion market cap.Compare that to its book value of $2.4 billion, or yesterday's quarterly earnings of $41 million (rounded up to nearest million) multiplied by 4, which is a measly $164 million.Even if earnings are further rounded up to $200 million per year, we are still looking at an oversized PE ratio of 185.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For this reason , I 'm of the opinion that current buyers of NFLX are <b>speculators</b> , and that the sellers are actually the `` investors '' in this case , because only extremely high sentiment on a broad market basis can prop up such an expensive stock price .
