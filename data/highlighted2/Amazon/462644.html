For the record, Netflix is still a solid company.It is profitable and still growing, and I personally have a subscription which I enjoy using and have no plans of canceling.However, it is simply impossible for the company to grow as quickly as its stock has over the past year and a half.If Netflix shares were not so obscenely expensive, share prices would have likely remained stable post-earnings.Even after a 15% correction, Netflix as a whole is still priced at a colossal $37 billion market cap.Compare that to its book value of $2.4 billion, or yesterday's quarterly earnings of $41 million (rounded up to nearest million) multiplied by 4, which is a measly $164 million.Even if earnings are further rounded up to $200 million per year, we are still looking at an oversized PE ratio of 185.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For this reason , I 'm of the opinion that current buyers of NFLX are <b>speculators</b> , and that the sellers are actually the `` investors '' in this case , because only extremely high sentiment on a broad market basis can prop up such an expensive stock price .
