(Surprise) </span>IBM's capital allocation is questionable as the company has continued to demonstrate that it's not forward-looking with its investment dollars.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>IBM <b>could</b> become a value trap as Microsoft and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> are poaching IT customers from <i>more</i> traditional IT providers at an accelerated pace . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I'm bearish on IBM's business model while bullish on the valuation leading to a $179 price target and a "hold" rating.For the most part, I agree with what Warren Buffett preaches about investing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>His focus on value and high quality businesses is treated like religion among private equity guys and is shrugged off by the average mutual fund manager ( mutual fund managers tend to optimize the portfolio for risks and <b>probabilities</b> over valuation ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I do n't imagine myself a pseudo Buffett wannabe , because quite frankly my approach <b>could</b> n't be <i>more</i> different with what he preaches about value investing .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I <b>believe</b> heavily in investing into growth businesses , despite a <i>pricier</i> valuation .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In some cases free-lunch opportunities exist, but there's an attached caveat to many of them, which many refer to as "special situations."<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>My point of contention is with one of Buffett 's <i>more</i> notable stock investments that belong in what he terms , `` the big four . ''  (Surprise) </span>The big four are inclusive of American Express (NYSE: AXP ), Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) and IBM (NYSE: IBM ).Now, anyone with a long enough of an investment track record knows that not every investment pans out."I made a mistake," is a pretty common theme in the investment world.John Pierpont Morgan lost chunks of cash on Edison Electric (as competition from Westinghouse power stations proved DC to be inferior to AC), George Soros lost chunks of cash in the dot com bust (prompting him to change his investment strategy), and Peter Lynch had years of under performance back when he was a Fidelity asset manager (Black Monday, circa.1987).Goldman analysts and traders blow it in the equities, mortgage, commodities, foreign exchange and fixed income markets all the time.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While the average analyst and professional manager are able to infer the qualities of a business , and make rational decisions on <b>anticipated</b> outcomes , invariably they will lose some money by making bad decisions at some point in their respective careers .  (Uncertainty) </span>When looking at the peer group, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) exhibited the highest rate of sales growth in the trailing five-year period, and also was able to outperform among pure-play IT providers.IBM reported declining revenue in a period where Microsoft grew by 50%.These trends have supported Microsoft's outperformance against other blue chip tech names, and is why I continue to reiterate my buy rating on Microsoft in other articles.Capital flows into the equity markets have been good.Treasuries yield negative real returns, which reduce the viability of bonds in comparison to stocks.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In an environment like this , blue chip stocks have outperformed as the appetite for risk <b>seems</b> concentrated in low beta high market cap names .  (Uncertainty) </span>US large-cap growth stocks have outperformed every other asset category in the trailing-twelve-month period.This indicates that investors are searching for stocks that grow at a reasonable price, versus contrarian plays that rely on a quick turn around in the underlying fundamentals.As you can already tell, large cap growth has outperformed large cap value by a factor of three since the inception of the year.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Stocks like IBM should be moving <i>higher</i> on technical factors , but because the market <b>anticipates</b> a decline in the business ' fundamentals , the valuation has shrunk , as various sell-side analysts have modeled negative sales growth in the current and next fiscal year .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>To address these issues, management has resorted to cost discipline as a means to improving operating performance.This is a decent response to falling revenues, but the drop-off in revenues shouldn't have happened in the first place, which is why managers and analysts should continue to question the potential returns from investing into the company.Typically, you pay for what you get, and while there are few exceptions to the rule.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The rule <b>seems</b> to apply here .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Low quality businesses attach a <i>lower</i> multiple because a premium is <b>contingent</b> on non-quantifiable factors that are <i>more</i> instinctual in nature .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Anyone who had invested in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) over the past 10 years would have outperformed , whereas anyone invested in IBM would not have outperformed the market . Either everyone is acting irrationally or everyone is being extremely rational.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>IBM has further room to drop when based on the recent commentary from the JPMorgan Technology Conference : I also think that there is a lot of <b>confusion</b> over revenue pools versus profit pools .  (Uncertainty) </span>And revenue is one of the easiest things to find in the tech industry and profit is one of the hardest.And so you see a lot of interesting dynamics.Now you know, if you are one of those companies that is given extraordinary market valuations without necessarily having to deliver profit, I suppose I am not part of one of those companies, but if I was I am sure I would be sitting there smiling.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I am just going to plow back , plow back , plow back and <b>maybe</b> the day will come when the investors will demand that I deliver a different type of business model but in the short-term if you let me , I will just keep plowing back .  (Uncertainty) </span>- Steve Mills (EVP of Software and Systems) In the past five years, IBM has had an awful tendency of competing in highly competitive markets.Instead of competing in nascent revenue pools, where the market size is small and potential to dominate is large, the company tends to wait until the business opportunity exceeds a billion dollars.What's strange is that the management team pats itself on the back for not investing capital in nascent business opportunities where the projected return on invested capital isn't as clear.IBM throws its resources into arenas where competitors have established an early lead.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For obvious reasons , I <b>doubt</b> IBM will gain back some of the enterprise customers it has lost to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Microsoft . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was one of the first IaaS providers , and quite frankly the nascent opportunity won support from the CEO of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Jeff Bezos himself , in the <i>earlier</i> stages . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The same <b>could</b> be said for Azure , over at Microsoft , which resulted in Microsoft 's overwhelming capabilities in private cloud , platform cloud and infrastructure cloud .  (Uncertainty) </span>Clearly, ramping revenue came first and then profitability came second.It also earned Satya Nadella his promotion to CEO of Microsoft as he has positioned the commercial side of Microsoft for long-term success.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>IBM 's management team is <i>more</i> focused on the day-to-day metrics and functionality of the business , which leads to short-term investments , and shortsighted divestitures .  (Surprise) </span>You can't attach a market premium to a business that's run like that because the management team will be reactionary to its business environment and won't establish a business in categories that have yet to be developed into profitable pools.Eventually IBM will take interest when everyone else is already moving onto the "next big thing" in technology.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>IBM provides infrastructure to various firms and various companies <b>may</b> not want to move away from IBM-branded middleware and cloud services .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But if IBM is going to operate like that , we <b>might</b> as well label the company a niche operator of IT services because that 's what it is becoming .  (Uncertainty) </span>IBM's various software and services are now integrated into other ecosystems.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This has diminished its durable competitive advantage because if IBM software and services can be sold to AWS and Azure customers , customers <b>might</b> as well move their hybrid cloud and public cloud to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> or various other IT services firms and buy the software from IBM . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This reduces the revenue that IBM can realistically <b>anticipate</b> from each IT customer as cross-sell opportunities will diminish .  (Uncertainty) </span>Needless to say, Microsoft has been able to increase its profitability and revenue in commercial cloud.Poaching customers from IBM and various other IT providers has been a cakewalk.The new stalwart in IT Services will be Microsoft and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( based on the growth trajectory ) as being a platform provider tends to both differentiate and solidify a competitive advantage over time . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>IBM <b>could</b> prove to be a value trap as it is not positioned to thrive in a changing technology environment where commoditization of hardware and software will diminish the moat in which IBM has built its hardware and software model around .  (Uncertainty) </span>Large-scale data analytics can be run through Excel, so as long as there's enough computing power available.Not to mention, various software services from IBM have proven redundant in comparison to the Windows Office Suite.Warren Buffett's investment track record is unquestionably good.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> that this specific stock out of Buffett 's big four will continue to underperform and investment into Microsoft would be forward-looking , without the aggressive overvaluation that leads Berkshire to steer clear from tech names in general .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At present , I have a price target of $ 179.95 ( 11.61 P/E ) , which implies that the stock <b>could</b> exhibit some modest appreciation for 2015 , but outsized gains are extremely unlikely .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In Wall Street lingo , I 'm initiating a hold rating , i.e. market perform , as there are <i>more</i> compelling investment opportunities elsewhere in big tech .
