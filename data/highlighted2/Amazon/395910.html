catalysts for the retail sector Consumers are instead buying smarter as is evident from Amazons recent earnings report The consumer discretionary ETF inappropriately includes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>stock allowing for an epic pair trade While the stock market might still have room to run the fundamental data seems to be telling us to avoid certain sectors One such sector is retail especially discretionary retail The numbers on the surface such as record high amounts of credit card usage might look good but the overall fundamental data shows the US to be heading for a retail decline The first issue relates to credit card use and debt in general Debt is increasing to where most Americans are living paychecktopaycheck paying off debt instead of saving and this is in addition to the first days of an Americans salary being siphoned into tax payments Auto loans in particular are damaging the average Americans ability to spend his paycheck auto loans are now at decade highs And this is all in the context of falling wages In fact real household income inflation adjusted has not grown at all in the past years Instead of buying more the sign of a healthy economy consumers are buying smarter They are taking advantages of taxfree purchases through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN which only taxes half of the US on purchases They are using WalMart NYSE WMT as their grocery stores to save money The general retail sector will either innovate finding ways to subsidize the losses or die Earnings season has already shown us the problems with the traditional retail sector while showing us what innovators can do As I predicted in Exposing Earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>reported a large earnings surprise sending the stock shooting upward past all of its peers that were falling during Q earnings reports But the temporary bump in AMZN is a sign of things to come Spenders are increasingly looking for ways to save money While estimates pointed to a growth in retail sales in March spenders in fact kept their wallets closed This is perhaps most evident in the statistics on auto spending which some pundits are touting as mixed by cherrypicking certain stocks When you look at overall spending however you see a clear downward trend in auto sales exgasoline the inclusion of auto sales growth drops the statistic to below that of exgasoline exauto for the first time in recent history Combining these facts with the possibility of a market crash and the seasonality of the stock market ie sell in May we are bearish on consumer discretionary stocks Unfortunately <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is typically included in consumer discretionary ETFs despite the fact that many <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>customers are looking to save money whether via increased competition thereby lowering prices or by avoiding taxes Mistakes such as this much like the ignorance that WalMart is primarily a grocery store lead to opportunities for investors My idea is to run a pair trade on the discretionary retail sector In light of the economic news and the fact that this is usually when this sector begins to fall we have timing on our side Look at the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF NYSEARCA XLY From May to October we have a significant dropoff in performance However this is not true of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>which underperforms only in February With of XLY being dedicated to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>we have an interesting pair trade This puts you long on AMZN and short all the main consumer discretionary stocks As a pair trade you are hedged on the retail market risk However XLY pays a dividend meaning that when we short it we must pay that dividend to the lender Thus I would take things one step further removing that dividend risk and limiting the downside on this leg of this trade This strategy allows us to mimic shorting shares of XLY without the infinite risk associated with shorting stock The bought call protects us if we are proved wrong The entire position only costs with somewhere around worth of margin ask your broker Yet we can expect roughly worth of gain for every move downward in XLY Volatility increases which typically come in tandem with XLY falling will further boost this positions value by roughly for each increase in implied volatility This option strategy mixed with a long position on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>preferably also via a synthetic position as above will allow you to profit from the changing retail market and struggling middle class
