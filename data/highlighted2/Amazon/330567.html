CommentshttpAFFdealbreakercomFFFsearsceoeddielampertangryattechnologyFSearsCEOWouldReallyLikeForEveryoneToShutUpAboutAmazonAndTeslaAlreadyAAThorntonMcEneryhttpAFFdealbreakercomFFpD Its been three years since Eddie Lampert decided it was time for Eddie Lampert to take the reins at Sears Holdings splitting his time between the world of hedge funds andgetting elbows deep in the retail game And in that time Eddie has been reasonably quiet save for the awkward moments when running his hedge fund put him in almost direct conflict with running Sears while learning how to be CEO of your grandads favorite superstore Lampert offered some macromusings in a very entertaining Chairmans Letter published today For instance Eddie knows that the millennials are all about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but hes got some bad news for all you pesky kids who loveBezos monster baby so much Companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>were able to grow rapidly without having to collect sales tax while traditional retail companies had the dual disadvantages of having to report profits and to collect sales tax from their customers While it is true that Amazons customers by law were required to calculate and pay sales tax in states that required it many commentators conveniently ignored these laws in their coverage of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and the state and local authorities did little to enforce the existing laws The consequence We are now seeing more and more retail stores shut down and the tax base of many municipalities eroding due to the hollowing out of the sales tax base as the Wall Street Journal recently reported Even the largest and most successful retailers like Walmart are shuttering stores all over the world You think its cool that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can drone you over some organic carpet cleaner when you hit a button Well that is making it a lot harder for people to buy washing machines and we assume polyester Nehru jackets at their local Sears retailer And dont even get Eddie started on Tesla Some innovative companies like Tesla are heavily subsidized by government policy either directly or through purchases made by their customers while existing car companies are forced to comply with mandates to produce cars that people may not want at enormous costThese companies rely heavily on continued financing Tesla raised over billion in equity and over billion in debt over the past four years and favorable capital market conditions and valuations while companies viewed through a more traditional lens like Sears Holdings are met with skepticism even though we have an enormous asset base and a proven history of monetizing these assets and raising additional capital to fund our obligations and transformation If Eddie Lampert hears one more fcking hipster fawn over those subsidized electric cars hes going to run them over with a Dodge Dart that he bought at Sears because they still have them in stock Speaking of losing money Eddies letter accompaniesSears Q results for Sears revenue dropped by billion in
