(Uncertainty) </span>We are looking at initiating a position soon, preferably at the 3% yield mark.In a series of articles, we've been profiling some well-known technology companies to find the second tech stock for our portfolio.We've also used this series to introduce many readers to selling puts to buy shares at prices they like.Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) was profiled here .In that article, we outlined a MSFT options strategy and highlighted the company's cloud platform, Azure, as one of the reasons we are leaning towards this stock over value names such as Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ).While browsing recent news on Microsoft, we landed on a few articles and statistics about Azure's growth.In particular, the sketch shown below caught our attention.Make no mistake about it , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) AWS ( <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services ) is still the industry leader by a wide margin , but Microsoft showed the highest year-over-year growth in 2015 , at 124 % . Keep in mind that most of the early movers to the cloud are from the private space.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As we covered in the above-linked Microsoft article , this company 's huge presence in the public sector makes it a heavy favorite to win the lion 's share as <i>more</i> state , county and federal agencies move to the cloud .  (Surprise) </span>To combat <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's `` GovCloud , '' which is specifically for government agencies , Microsoft 's Office 365 is speeding things up as well with recent expansion of business meetings and voice services . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The country is also looking to conquer the `` global cloud , '' and what <i>better</i> way to start than by targeting CEO Satya Nadella 's country of birth , India .  (Surprise) </span>Microsoft held meetings with the Indian IT minister a few weeks ago, and the seeds have been laid to foray into this $2 trillion opportunity.Yes, $2 trillion, according to the CEO.While AWS is still the leader by market share, Azure has many advantages that will help it gain market share: When it comes to programming and testing tools, support and their integration, nobody beats Microsoft.The fact that many of its programming languages and tools (think of Microsoft .Net, MS SQL Server database and the like) are used widely adds to Azure's appeal with native compatibility.Irrespective of programming languages and tools, most private and public entities operate and host on the Windows platform.This again falls right into Azure's lap with native compatibility.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Dedicated instances in general <b>appear</b> <i>costlier</i> with AWS compared to Azure .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Azure also provides minute-wise billing details, compared to AWS's hourly billing details.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This gives users <i>more</i> control and monitoring capabilities to scale up or down , <b>depending</b> on their needs .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Eventually, cloud is going to become a commodity- and volume-based business.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When <i>more</i> companies show up , margins erode and volume becomes the name of the game .  (Surprise) </span>Should anyone teach Microsoft how to run a volume-based business at a reasonable margin?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Probably</b> not , after decades of operating that way with its Windows and Office products .  (Uncertainty) </span>With a solid balance sheet and cash flow, Microsoft has always been seen as a reliable income and dividend growth stock.Its foray into the cloud has created a unique combination we love: current income, income growth and capital appreciation.After the lost decade, the company is springing back to life, and we are eager to initiate a position in this stock at the right time.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Application Software</div></body></html>
