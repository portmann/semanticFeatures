The country is also looking to conquer the "global cloud," and what better way to start than by targeting CEO Satya Nadella's country of birth, India.Microsoft held meetings with the Indian IT minister a few weeks ago, and the seeds have been laid to foray into this $2 trillion opportunity.Yes, $2 trillion, according to the CEO.While AWS is still the leader by market share, Azure has many advantages that will help it gain market share: When it comes to programming and testing tools, support and their integration, nobody beats Microsoft.The fact that many of its programming languages and tools (think of Microsoft .Net, MS SQL Server database and the like) are used widely adds to Azure's appeal with native compatibility.Irrespective of programming languages and tools, most private and public entities operate and host on the Windows platform.This again falls right into Azure's lap with native compatibility.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Dedicated instances in general <b>appear</b> costlier with AWS compared to Azure .
