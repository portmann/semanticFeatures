(Surprise) </span>Microsoft's guidance was a modest raise that was not particularly exciting.The company's cloud revenue component reached to $12 billion on an annualized run rate basis and that is now 13% of revenue.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Cloud revenues <b>could</b> increase another 40 % this year .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company has <i>more</i> cloud revenue potential than is acknowledged by many observers and hence its consensus top line growth - and EPS growth as well is likely to be exceeded .  (Surprise) </span>Who needs Windows, or even LinkedIn when you have a beautiful view of azure waters and a blue sky speckled with puffy white clouds from your terrace?The other day Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) reported its year-end earnings for FY16 .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The results were , to a <i>greater</i> extent , considered the mirror image of the prior quarter .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Back then , the shares fell about 11 % in the week following a <b>disappointing</b> earnings report .  (Surprise) </span>In this case, the shares, in the midst of a strong rally in tech stocks have gained 5% since the earnings call.The shares now are essentially where they were 3 months ago.The IGV software index in that same time scale has risen 6% .MSFT shares have lost some alpha since the last earnings report and since the start of the year, while the IGV has appreciated by about 4%, MSFT shares are up 2%.Much of the share price change recently has come in the wake of the announced LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) purchase.There have been many articles published on the outlook for that purchase by this author amongst others.In the wake of the revelation that Salesforce (NYSE: CRM ) was a bidder for the LinkedIn assets, many contributors felt that MSFT and its CEO, Satya Nadella had been hoodwinked and that the merger would prove to be destructive of shareholder value.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Not to be cavalier , but there are subjects beyond the LinkedIn acquisition that are going to have a <i>more</i> significant influence on the future of MSFT 's share price .  (Surprise) </span>Out of the many questions on the conference call, only one mentions LinkedIn , and did so in a peripheral fashion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Discussing LinkedIn <b>might</b> be an interesting debate , but the fact is that despite its $ 26 billion cost , it is unlikely to be dispositive in terms of forecasting the future for this company .  (Uncertainty) </span>The purpose of this article, as the title implies, is to discuss the results of the quarter just reported and the outlook going forward.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I think under the circumstances , <b>speculating</b> any <i>more</i> about the LinkedIn merger would produce <i>more</i> heat - certainly not a commodity in short supply in metro New York - and very little light .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think it is reasonable to focus attention on the $ 12 billion revenue segment of this company that has grown 50 % + this past 12 months and <b>seems</b> likely to continue on that trajectory .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I think the question on which to focus is whether MSFT can beat current consensus expectations and at some point resume double-digit top line growth as its cloud strategy evolves and becomes a <i>larger</i> component of revenues for the company .  (Surprise) </span>So, that is what most of this article will cover.The results were a beat against prior expectations.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Cash flow in particular showed strong growth and is <b>probably</b> the most objective metric issued by a software company .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The company did well in a number of key revenue buckets and did <i>less</i> poorly in other buckets than had been <b>feared</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>A significant component of the company 's EPS beat was its low tax rate accrual as revenue outside of the US grew <i>more</i> rapidly than forecast which had the impact of moving earnings to areas of the world ( <b>almost</b> all of it these days ) with <i>lower</i> corporate taxes than is the case in the US .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Within the results as a whole, there were some notable successes and a few clinkers as well.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Obviously , the company 's revenues from phones <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> collapsed , and it had a difficult quarter in selling gaming devices .  (Surprise) </span>Those items count, but they are so small as to not be worth too much time in detailing.As mentioned in the past, this company is in the midst of multiple transitions and inevitably they do not all go well simultaneously.And MSFT management takes its cue from the weather in Puget Sound - well winter weather, anyway, in terms of its transparency.There is plenty of fog in these numbers that permit many people to draw conflicting conclusions from the same data.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>My take is that the growth components of this business are doing a bit <i>better</i> than the legacy businesses are declining , and there have been a few <b>surprises</b> in terms of <i>greener</i> shoots within legacy businesses than <b>might</b> have been expected .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Microsoft these days has a reporting structure that makes it infeasible to comment about all of its business segments with any <b>hope</b> that an author can say something useful across the board .  (Uncertainty) </span>I will confine my comments to what I think are important.Overall, I think the company's shares will be able to generate significant amounts of positive alpha, particularly for a large cap tech name.MSFT has been able to make some significant market share gains in a few key areas.The ability MSFT has had to sell premium services within Azure, i.e. data base and most lately security, is one of those growth drivers that is dimly recognized that will keep giving for years to come.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And <b>perhaps</b> little recognized by some , Dynamics , which is the company 's suite of integrated applications , is also enjoying some visible market share gains as users migrate from on-prem to the cloud .  (Uncertainty) </span>The transition to what this company (and others) calls annuity models for desktop applications should be moving into its later innings.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Some of its <i>newer</i> growth initiatives are reaching scale that should allow for improved margins - although not in Q1-FY 2017 if one accepts guidance .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That is history , which at this point does n't tell us much about the outlook for the next 6 months or 2 years or whatever the relevant time period <b>may</b> be for readers .  (Uncertainty) </span>And frankly, neither do Microsoft's headline results.As I have commented in past articles, MSFT has many unorthodox ways of presenting its earnings.Unorthodox in the sense that other companies do not choose to make similar presentations, and unorthodox in the sense that the presentation doesn't always display the company's progress or at times its regression.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>To take two of the <i>more</i> glaring reporting <b>anomalies</b> , most companies do not choose to call their revenue losses from a transition to a subscription revenue model a deferral and add it back to non-GAAP revenues and earnings .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft reported EPS for the quarter of $.69.But included in that $.69 is $.19 derived from adding back the impact of Windows 10 revenue deferrals to both revenues and profits.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>$ .69 is the number the company highlights and it is the number used by <b>almost</b> all analysts in their modeling and valuation work .  (Uncertainty) </span>It is the metric the company reports and by which it is judged.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So despite my own issues with using it as a comparison point - that is the number I have to use since it has been accepted without demur by most observers , regardless of its <b>unusual</b> derivation .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I am , to be sure , a bit <b>surprised</b> that most people accept that <b>unusual</b> bit of financial legerdemain without comment .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is no <i>more</i> and no <i>less</i> than the kinds of adjustments that most SaaS companies try to make for which they are often roundly pilloried .  (Surprise) </span>But no matter, the fact is that MSFT will eventually collect the amount of revenue that has been deferred.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The most impressive headline that Microsoft reported was that Azure revenues grew 108 % this past quarter - a not insignificant cohort of that growth was no better or <i>worse</i> than spin , but the kind of spin that is all too common in the software world these days .  (Surprise) </span>Dynamics is MSFT's application staff, and its revenues grew 7%.Many contracts that Microsoft signs these days include both Dynamics and Azure.Indeed, one of the most significant competitive strengths of Microsoft is the integration Azure and Dynamics.But it can give a distorted picture of reality when the company chooses to report inflated revenue growth for Azure that is partially built on revenues that are really from the applications area.Stakeholders in Microsoft are simply going to have to accept that not all of the numbers it prints mean the same thing as the numbers many of its peers use.It was Archimedes who said 2300 years ago, "Give me a place to stand, and I shall move the world."Microsoft isn't trying to move the world, just to enhance its reported numbers and the source of its growth, but the principle isn't far different.All in, MSFT's cloud revenues are growing by 50% +/- and have reached a $12 billion/year run rate which is about 13% of reported revenues this year.That is the foundation from which to do further analysis.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As well , as will be discussed further below in this article , the company 's cash flow growth presents a far <i>more</i> realistic - and a <i>better</i> achievement - than does the reported EPS enhanced as it is with a far from normal addition .  (Surprise) </span>No, this isn't some children's fairy tale of some bold and moral knight rescuing his damsel from the wrath of an evil dragon.Gartner chose the other day to release another research about the cloud and how it is turning the IT world upside down.There is a reason why Microsoft chooses to embellish the success of Azure, even though doing so actually takes away from an understanding how Microsoft is using Azure + Dynamics to enhance its market share in the IT space.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Gartner report out today says that $ 111 billion of IT spending will have shifted from on-prem to the cloud this year and that by 2020 , the shift will be no <i>less</i> than $ 216 billion a year .  (Surprise) </span>It is going to be increasingly difficult to be a credible IT vendor without getting the preponderance of revenues from the cloud.Much has been written about the cloud by a great many analysts and contributors on this site.I try to remind myself that the only relevance here is how to evaluate stocks.No one ought to rely on this site as a guide for designing a new cloud-based infrastructure.There are going to be winners and losers in terms of investment world from the cloud.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> that MSFT will be a winner .  (Uncertainty) </span>Surely not an unalloyed winner, but enough of a winner such that it pays to own the name.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This discussion would be much <i>simpler</i> if all the elements of MSFT 's revenue mix were quantified in a simplistic fashion .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It would be much <i>easier</i> to see what <b>appears</b> to be happening if the revenue buckets were straightforward and consistent .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It would be nice, but it simply isn't the case at this point.Then there are other issues.This article is written on Office 365 that lives in the cloud.How much of that revenue is counted in Azure, and how much is personnel productivity or even what Microsoft calls commercial Office 365.On the last conference call, Microsoft said that its Commercial Cloud revenues have reached $12 billion as an annual run and would reach $20 billion by 2020.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Last year 's growth rate was <i>more</i> than 50 % or $ 4 billion .  (Surprise) </span>As revenues were flat last year, the growth in commercial cloud had to overcome weakness in other areas, particularly in sales of phones which declined sharply as the company exited parts of that business.I think the use of 50% growth and of $12 billion ought to be the numbers to base most analysis since they are both straightforward and unambiguous.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Microsoft 's currently expected revenue growth is between 5 % -6 % , and so the forecast for the growth of the commercial cloud is at least two-thirds of the growth <b>anticipated</b> by the analyst consensus for the entire company .  (Uncertainty) </span>83% of the overall commercial business that is subscription and continuing to rise.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Given the dynamics of MSFT 's revenue categories , it would <b>appear</b> that the company 's overall revenue growth rate will be steadily rising as the high growth cloud revenues become a <i>greater</i> proportion of the total .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> that the biggest opportunity in terms of revenue dollars that MSFT is going to realize from the cloud is through selling its data base and security solutions to buyers of Azure .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For many years , MSFT has quietly developed data base offerings and it has grown <i>faster</i> than the stagnant market as a whole .  (Surprise) </span>But for the most part, it has been locked out of the data base market by Oracle's (NYSE: ORCL ) suite of database solutions.Oracle has, and continues to have, a competitive data base.It just cost a lot, and these days, Oracle expects users to pay for all the database seats that they have.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Quelle <b>horreur</b> !  (Uncertainty) </span>There are a number of trends in the data base world that are outside the ambit of this article.No SQL, open source, Hadoop etc.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But one trend that <b>seems</b> to be both durable and of some significance is that Microsoft 's data base brands are going to have a <i>higher</i> share of the world post cloud than was the case prior to the tsunami .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It is not an opportunity that is easy to tie down or to quantify, but is one that is hard to ignore.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Oracle does have cloud-based data base products and will have <i>more</i> and <i>better</i> ones over time - but within the segment that Oracle describes as IaaS even management has acknowledged that its offering can be and is being enhanced .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As users switch <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> workloads to the public cloud , they need a database solution to support that transformation .  (Surprise) </span>And very often, users will acquire Azure and will acquire a Microsoft database along with it.( Of course , lots of users go with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Aurora as well , but I want to focus on MSFT and its opportunities rather than try to write about the whole cloud database market . ) <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft also sells security solutions as part of the Azure suite of solutions and that too has become <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> successful .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is a huge opportunity said to be worth $ 14 billion in annual revenue by 2019 with a CAGR estimated to be no <i>less</i> than 67 % .  (Surprise) </span>How does MSFT stack up in terms of share and trend in the space?We really don't know precisely.There are many other offerings in this space which some describe as Database as a Service (DBaaS).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As mentioned <i>earlier</i> , Microsoft is expected to grow revenues by 2 % next year to just shy of $ 94 billion based on the consensus of 23 analysts posting their estimates - one way of meeting or exceeding growth targets .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is my belief that a significant amount of the <b>anticipated</b> growth is going to come from the company 's rising share of the overall database market and most importantly from the growth it is likely to enjoy in the DBaaS market .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Lacking a base , trying to forecast any specific number is pointless , but it <b>seems</b> like to reach at least $ 1 billion in that business .  (Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft also sells a product that it calls... well Cloud App Security.I don't think that Cloud App Security is going to replace the current generation of firewalls any time in the near future but it is another value added offering that Microsoft sells with its cloud.And the company sells what it describes as Enterprise Mobility Services.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The cloud has given Microsoft far <i>more</i> solutions to sell than has been the case for many years and should start driving revenue growth noticeably in future years .  (Surprise) </span>Public cloud services themselves continue their spectacular march upward.IDC says that public cloud spending will reach $141 billion by 2019.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> than two-thirds of that amount will be revenues derived from SaaS applications , but that still leads <i>more</i> than $ 40 billion of revenue that will be coming from cloud infrastructure products such as Azure .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Again , given the size of MSFT and its expected growth , it certainly <b>seems</b> that its public cloud offerings are going to be enough to give it a chance at beating current growth rate estimates .  (Uncertainty) </span>And finally there is Dynamics.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Much of Dynamics for the cloud is very new , and really it is too early to draw conclusions regarding just how large revenues will reach with high <b>confidence</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>In fact, the latest incarnation of the product which is a bundle containing both CRM and ERP and is called Dynamics 365 cloud bundle was announced just a couple of weeks ago and will go into general availability this fall.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>CRM Dynamics has been growing at a significant pace for a few years now , and it <b>appears</b> to be taking share from both Oracle and SAP ( NYSE : SAP ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> matching the percentage revenue gains that Salesforce is achieving , but given that the overall space itself is a subset of a subset , the growth of revenue dollars , while noticeable , is in itself not sufficient to significantly move a target of $ 6 billion .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Based on consensus forecasts from consultants , it appears that CRM Dynamics product category <b>might</b> contribute 10-15 % the $ 2 billion + of top-line growth expected for MSFT in FY ' 17 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>One of the overall issues for MSFT and frankly for all of the <i>larger</i> companies who are transitioning their offerings to the cloud is to what extent there is cannibalization of the existing workloads and of course the existing revenue streams .  (Surprise) </span>I do not think anyone would imagine that when a large company moves workloads to the cloud, there isn't some kind of substitution in terms of replacing current workloads that are on-premise with those that will now be in the cloud.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But for MSFT , which never had been a supplier to the largest users of a total enterprise solution , the opportunities are far <i>greater</i> than the cannibalization .  (Surprise) </span>And of course, MSFT has never enjoyed the massive maintenance streams that make up much of the revenue of its rivals in enterprise applications.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When analysts and readers try to compare the record of MSFT to the record of Oracle , SAP and even <i>more</i> so to the record of IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) , that is a very significant difference .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Oracle and SAP will transition many , if not most of their users to the cloud , and the same is true for IBM .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But what is n't going to happen is for those transitioning users to buy a <i>greater</i> percentage of their compute requirements from their legacy vendors .  (Surprise) </span>In the case of MSFT, just taking a look at the two high profile wins that were discussed on the conference call, the exact opposite is the case.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>GE ( NYSE : GE ) , in particular , has been an erstwhile Oracle poster child and <b>probably</b> will remain an Oracle customer at scale - but it is now using many MSFT cloud solutions as well .  (Uncertainty) </span>That is the real difference, and frankly, at the end of the day, it is one of the longer-term reasons why MSFT is a winner in this transition which will ultimately lead to rising growth rates, rising margins and support a rising share valuation.Microsoft is reporting that Dynamics overall is growing at 7% or there about these days, and that is nothing about which to get very excited.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But as Dynamics shifts <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> to the cloud , my guess is that its growth and its market share will start to rise visibly , although this is hardly embodied in the 2 % growth expectation that is currently the 2017 top line consensus or the 6 % + growth expected in fiscal '18 either .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>ERP and the associated financial apps are <b>perhaps</b> the single most boring topic about which to write in enterprise IT .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When I was young , depending on where one went to school , punishments for misconduct <b>might</b> consist of writing a catechism 100 times on the blackboard or at a different kind of school one 's creativity <b>might</b> be stifled in some equally creative fashion .  (Uncertainty) </span>ERP software is not much different than that.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It was old when I was young and we have both grown <i>older</i> together .  (Surprise) </span>But it is a huge revenue opportunity for Microsoft along with NetSuite (NYSE: N ), or Ultimate (NASDAQ: ULTI ) or Workday (NYSE: WDAY ), and I think it is one of the opportunities that MSFT has to exceed 2% top line growth this year.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Basically , the numbers that Microsoft has provided <b>suggest</b> that the cloud has provided something <i>greater</i> than $ 4 billion of overall revenue growth in 2016 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It is hard to imagine that number not growing, and not growing significantly in 2017.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I think that overall , the cloud space , and the ancillary products and services that make up the segment , can readily contribute $ 6 billion to the MSFT 's growth in the current year and <i>more</i> beyond that .  (Surprise) </span>The worldwide ERP market is supposed to reach $41 billion by 2020 and it is forecast to enjoy a 7% CAGR from now till then with the growth of cloud-based ERP significantly above that level of CAGR.At the moment, MSFT is said to have a market share in ERP of 9%.It has the most to gain at least in dollar terms of any vendor as the transition to the cloud continues and indeed accelerates.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Last quarter , overall Dynamics booking grew by <i>more</i> than 20 % , while Dynamics CRM seat-adds doubled year on year , and paid seats have increased 20 % year on year .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And finally , the growth in Office 365 Commercial is <b>perhaps</b> quite <b>surprising</b> to some observers .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Last quarter , seats grew 45 % year on year and revenue grew 59 % in constant currency , which is a function of the E3 bundles that the company has sold and which <b>presumably</b> will be enhanced by the new E5 bundle which is just starting its ramp .  (Uncertainty) </span>There are obviously going to be takes in looking at revenue growth.The transaction based, on-prem server revenue will decline - it is simply a question of how much and in which quarters.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>faster</i> cloud revenues and other annuities streams grow , the <i>more</i> rapid the decline in transactional sources is likely to be .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And again , the <i>faster</i> the transition to cloud , the <i>greater</i> the amount of impact on what MSFT describes as support agreements in Enterprise Services - really Maintenance .  (Surprise) </span>But when trying to deconstruct the buckets of MSFT revenue, the odds seem high, at least to this writer, that MSFT has a significant opportunity to beat the very modest 2% and 6% revenue forecasts that make up consensus revenue growth.And at the end of the day, I think that is enough of a reason to recommend to investors to buy the shares to achieve positive alpha.If Commercial Cloud revenues are going to be $17-$18 billion this fiscal year, what is happening with the other $77 billion?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even in the modern world , $ 77 billion of revenue is n't chopped liver <i>More</i> like foie gras than chopped liver .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Foie gras with a glass of sauternes , <b>perhaps</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Restaurant Daniel in New York recommends 1988 Chateau Suduiraut which is <b>surprisingly</b> reasonable at $ 60/bottle .  (Surprise) </span>Oh well, I got diverted for a moment.Food and wine easily do that to me.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As mentioned <i>earlier</i> , Microsoft has chosen to report its revenues in a number of buckets that transcend <i>more</i> orderly , product-oriented presentations .  (Surprise) </span>I am not going to attempt to review all of the segments that this company reports because it will not provide any insights into growth or competition or margins.For those readers interested, Seeking Alpha makes the slide deck that details many of the metrics MSFT reports readily available.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the interests of space economy , I will simply touch lightly on some of the <i>more</i> significant revenue growth drivers .  (Surprise) </span>Bing query share in the US has reached 22%.Search advertising revenues grew by 16% year over year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Cortana , which is both the PDA <b>optimized</b> for Microsoft devices and for Windows 10 as well as the name that Microsoft has given its advanced analytics functionality has seen fairly decent revenue growth - again , observers are left guessing exactly how much .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company's Surface family of products is also showing decent growth within the context of its space.Overall Surface revenues showed 9% growth last quarter and the company is forecasting a continuation of that trend over the next year.Microsoft has a product offering that combines Cortana with something called HoloLens, so users can talk to the device and tell it to take pictures as instructed.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Just this side of <b>frightening</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Another product , called Surface Hub , an interactive white board , after long shipping delays , is <b>apparently</b> garnering some attention .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I doubt that the sum of all of these products is going to produce substantial revenue growth , but it is always possible that one or the other of these opportunities <b>might</b> move a $ 2 billion goal if one looked hard enough .  (Uncertainty) </span>$6 billion goal - not likely, but say, you never know.We really have no idea as to the precise revenue contributions of these products.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Frankly , I am never going to talk to a camera - but <b>apparently</b> , this is something of significant interest to many millennials who are quite willing to anthropomorphize their devices and even call them by name .  (Uncertainty) </span>I am not driven to use interactive white boards, but then again I do not work in a large corporation.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Not too <b>surprisingly</b> , device revenue dropped by 35 % overall primarily because of MSFT 's exit from the <i>lower</i> end phone business .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Phone revenues dropped 70 % overall , and will continue to drop by that amount until they reach an anniversary in 3 <i>more</i> quarters .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Gaming revenues were down for MSFT because people played <i>fewer</i> games and I have no idea why that <b>might</b> have been .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft sold far <i>fewer</i> gaming consoles at <i>lower</i> prices and that was the bulk of the revenue decline .  (Surprise) </span>Overall, MSFT's gaming revenues dropped by 26%.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Gaming revenues are now <i>less</i> than 3 % of the total revenues for MSFT , and while it would better for gaming revenues to increase rather than , from a financial standpoint , the change is scarcely <i>more</i> than a rounding error .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Again , betraying my age , I suppose , I have no idea why people find it fascinating to spend hours in front of a game console but <b>apparently</b> hours spent gaming showed a 19 % sequential increase on Windows 10 equipped PCs .  (Uncertainty) </span>I am sure most readers were just pining to know that statistic.Microsoft currently has a market cap of $440 billion and an enterprise value of $377 billion.With the consensus sales expectation for this year right at $94 billion, which is up by all of 2% from the just reported FY '16 year, that is an EV/S of 4X.MSFT does not explicitly guide for full-year revenues - and hence by definition, it doesn't guide for full-year EPS either.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think , as I tried to present above , that there is every reason to <b>believe</b> that the company is positioned to exceed the current consensus growth estimates of 2 % and 6 % respectively - and by a noticeable amount .  (Uncertainty) </span>The consensus non-GAAP EPS forecast for FY '17 is $2.90, which would be up all of 4% from the $2.79 printed this year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So that is a forward P/E of 19.3 X. Again , I would be inclined to <b>believe</b> that there will be some positive leverage if the revenues for the year exceed consensus estimates as I think likely at this point .  (Uncertainty) </span>As mentioned above, the non-GAAP EPS number will be significantly buoyed by reporting annuity windows revenues as though they were taken upfront.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is an unusual practice but <b>seems</b> to have been completely accepted by analysts without demur .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In terms of traditional valuation metrics , the significant jump in cash flow is most noteworthy , I <b>believe</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Overall cash flow from operations reached $8.5 billion in this past quarter, up by 24% from the prior year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That is a cash flow margin of <i>more</i> than 37 % up from 33 % in the prior year .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Free cash flow increased by a <i>smaller</i> percentage primarily as the result of a massive buildout in cloud infrastructure .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>CapEx rose by <b>almost</b> 50 % year on year , but despite the outsize growth in CapEx , free cash flow still grew 15 % reaching $ 5.6 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>For the past year, the company's operating cash flow was $33.3 billion.That was a cash flow margin of 39%, a noticeable increase from 32% reported for fiscal-year 2015.I like to look at one metric which relates to comparing free cash flow to reported operating income - the conversion rate some call it.Cash from operations last quarter was $8.5 billion, and it was $33.3 billion for the year.Operating income for the two respective periods was $3.1 billion and $20.2 billion respectively.That yields conversions rates of 274% and 165% respectively.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even the free cash flow ratios which come to 187 % and 124 % respectively are far <i>higher</i> than such ratios for most other software vendors .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>These are excellent ratios which really speak to the fact that MSFT 's profitability is <i>more</i> than meets the eye .  (Surprise) </span>Lots of investors do not pay the attention to cash flow that is warranted when looking at the valuation of software vendors.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One can adjust reported free cash flow any way that <b>may</b> be desirable , but I will just stick with the reported numbers and the free cash flow yield .  (Uncertainty) </span>The free cash flow yield based on the free cash flow of $25 billion for fiscal 2016 represents a yield of 6.5%.Microsoft doesn't forecast cash flow at any level.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There are trends that will lead to <i>greater</i> realization rates going forward .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Ratable revenues will , over time , have the tendency to produce a <i>higher</i> level of cash flow that is on-premise revenues .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The CapEx required for the Azure infrastructure will tend to decline per dollar of revenue and the MSFT CFO , Amy Hood has forecast <i>lower</i> CapEx for that purpose explicitly .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A <i>higher</i> proportion of ratable revenues will lower A/R ratios .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you put these numbers together , it <b>suggests</b> that free cash flow is likely to increase between 15 % -20 % in the current year .  (Uncertainty) </span>At the mid-point, that would bring the free cash flow yield to over 7.5%, an excellent level for most companies, and a great level for a company such as MSFT that has a significant expectation for substantial earnings growth in future years.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft reported earnings that were a significant snapback from the <b>disappointing</b> results of the prior quarter about a week ago .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The shares are still valued at modest levels , and do not reflect some significant growth opportunities that are becoming <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> visible .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The company 's overall cloud revenues , which have reached $ 12 billion on an annual run rate basis are growing 50 % and by themselves <b>might</b> be expected to account for <i>more</i> than growth expectations in this current year .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company has seen a very rapid growth in cash flow and free cash flow that <b>appear</b> to be ignored by the current valuation of the shares .  (Uncertainty) </span>A free cash flow yield of 7.5%, which I think is credible based on overall projections for FY'17, would be one of the highest free cash flow yields to be seen in the enterprise IT space.The company should see declining CapEx requirements as it has completed a substantial part of its Azure infrastructure build out.The company has made significant progress in converting most Windows users to the cloud and a subscription basis.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While its reporting of that accomplishment is <b>unusual</b> , it is nonetheless something that will tend to augment the growth of cash flow in future periods .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The company has significant opportunities to improve its market share in areas such as database , security and applications as <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> mainstream customers move to the cloud and have the opportunity to <b>reconsider</b> their vendor choice as they make the transition .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> revenues coming from annuity sources , the visibility and the stability of growth for MSFT ought to increase .  (Surprise) </span>Obviously, like all companies in the midst of transitions, there are going to be quarters such as Q3-2016 when some stars do not align and the company does not achieve its expectations.But in looking at fiscal 2017 as a whole, I think the odds are highly in favor of the company beating most of the time and beating by a noticeable amount.And given the modest level of valuation, that is enough of a reason to warrant a purchase recommendation.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Application Software, Editors' Picks</div></body></html>
