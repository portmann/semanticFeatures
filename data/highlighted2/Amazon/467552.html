(Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is a huge opportunity said to be worth $ 14 billion in annual revenue by 2019 with a CAGR estimated to be no <i>less</i> than 67 % .  (Surprise) </span>How does MSFT stack up in terms of share and trend in the space?We really don't know precisely.There are many other offerings in this space which some describe as Database as a Service (DBaaS).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As mentioned <i>earlier</i> , Microsoft is expected to grow revenues by 2 % next year to just shy of $ 94 billion based on the consensus of 23 analysts posting their estimates - one way of meeting or exceeding growth targets .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is my belief that a significant amount of the <b>anticipated</b> growth is going to come from the company 's rising share of the overall database market and most importantly from the growth it is likely to enjoy in the DBaaS market .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Lacking a base , trying to forecast any specific number is pointless , but it <b>seems</b> like to reach at least $ 1 billion in that business .  (Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft also sells a product that it calls... well Cloud App Security.I don't think that Cloud App Security is going to replace the current generation of firewalls any time in the near future but it is another value added offering that Microsoft sells with its cloud.And the company sells what it describes as Enterprise Mobility Services.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The cloud has given Microsoft far <i>more</i> solutions to sell than has been the case for many years and should start driving revenue growth noticeably in future years .  (Surprise) </span>Public cloud services themselves continue their spectacular march upward.IDC says that public cloud spending will reach $141 billion by 2019.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> than two-thirds of that amount will be revenues derived from SaaS applications , but that still leads <i>more</i> than $ 40 billion of revenue that will be coming from cloud infrastructure products such as Azure .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Again , given the size of MSFT and its expected growth , it certainly <b>seems</b> that its public cloud offerings are going to be enough to give it a chance at beating current growth rate estimates .  (Uncertainty) </span>And finally there is Dynamics.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Much of Dynamics for the cloud is very new , and really it is too early to draw conclusions regarding just how large revenues will reach with high <b>confidence</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>In fact, the latest incarnation of the product which is a bundle containing both CRM and ERP and is called Dynamics 365 cloud bundle was announced just a couple of weeks ago and will go into general availability this fall.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>CRM Dynamics has been growing at a significant pace for a few years now , and it <b>appears</b> to be taking share from both Oracle and SAP ( NYSE : SAP ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> matching the percentage revenue gains that Salesforce is achieving , but given that the overall space itself is a subset of a subset , the growth of revenue dollars , while noticeable , is in itself not sufficient to significantly move a target of $ 6 billion .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Based on consensus forecasts from consultants , it appears that CRM Dynamics product category <b>might</b> contribute 10-15 % the $ 2 billion + of top-line growth expected for MSFT in FY ' 17 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>One of the overall issues for MSFT and frankly for all of the <i>larger</i> companies who are transitioning their offerings to the cloud is to what extent there is cannibalization of the existing workloads and of course the existing revenue streams .  (Surprise) </span>I do not think anyone would imagine that when a large company moves workloads to the cloud, there isn't some kind of substitution in terms of replacing current workloads that are on-premise with those that will now be in the cloud.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But for MSFT , which never had been a supplier to the largest users of a total enterprise solution , the opportunities are far <i>greater</i> than the cannibalization .  (Surprise) </span>And of course, MSFT has never enjoyed the massive maintenance streams that make up much of the revenue of its rivals in enterprise applications.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When analysts and readers try to compare the record of MSFT to the record of Oracle , SAP and even <i>more</i> so to the record of IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) , that is a very significant difference .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Oracle and SAP will transition many , if not most of their users to the cloud , and the same is true for IBM .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But what is n't going to happen is for those transitioning users to buy a <i>greater</i> percentage of their compute requirements from their legacy vendors .  (Surprise) </span>In the case of MSFT, just taking a look at the two high profile wins that were discussed on the conference call, the exact opposite is the case.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>GE ( NYSE : GE ) , in particular , has been an erstwhile Oracle poster child and <b>probably</b> will remain an Oracle customer at scale - but it is now using many MSFT cloud solutions as well .  (Uncertainty) </span>That is the real difference, and frankly, at the end of the day, it is one of the longer-term reasons why MSFT is a winner in this transition which will ultimately lead to rising growth rates, rising margins and support a rising share valuation.Microsoft is reporting that Dynamics overall is growing at 7% or there about these days, and that is nothing about which to get very excited.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But as Dynamics shifts <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> to the cloud , my guess is that its growth and its market share will start to rise visibly , although this is hardly embodied in the 2 % growth expectation that is currently the 2017 top line consensus or the 6 % + growth expected in fiscal '18 either .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>ERP and the associated financial apps are <b>perhaps</b> the single most boring topic about which to write in enterprise IT .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When I was young , depending on where one went to school , punishments for misconduct <b>might</b> consist of writing a catechism 100 times on the blackboard or at a different kind of school one 's creativity <b>might</b> be stifled in some equally creative fashion .  (Uncertainty) </span>ERP software is not much different than that.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It was old when I was young and we have both grown <i>older</i> together .  (Surprise) </span>But it is a huge revenue opportunity for Microsoft along with NetSuite (NYSE: N ), or Ultimate (NASDAQ: ULTI ) or Workday (NYSE: WDAY ), and I think it is one of the opportunities that MSFT has to exceed 2% top line growth this year.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Basically , the numbers that Microsoft has provided <b>suggest</b> that the cloud has provided something <i>greater</i> than $ 4 billion of overall revenue growth in 2016 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It is hard to imagine that number not growing, and not growing significantly in 2017.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I think that overall , the cloud space , and the ancillary products and services that make up the segment , can readily contribute $ 6 billion to the MSFT 's growth in the current year and <i>more</i> beyond that .  (Surprise) </span>The worldwide ERP market is supposed to reach $41 billion by 2020 and it is forecast to enjoy a 7% CAGR from now till then with the growth of cloud-based ERP significantly above that level of CAGR.At the moment, MSFT is said to have a market share in ERP of 9%.It has the most to gain at least in dollar terms of any vendor as the transition to the cloud continues and indeed accelerates.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Last quarter , overall Dynamics booking grew by <i>more</i> than 20 % , while Dynamics CRM seat-adds doubled year on year , and paid seats have increased 20 % year on year .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And finally , the growth in Office 365 Commercial is <b>perhaps</b> quite <b>surprising</b> to some observers .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Last quarter , seats grew 45 % year on year and revenue grew 59 % in constant currency , which is a function of the E3 bundles that the company has sold and which <b>presumably</b> will be enhanced by the new E5 bundle which is just starting its ramp .  (Uncertainty) </span>There are obviously going to be takes in looking at revenue growth.The transaction based, on-prem server revenue will decline - it is simply a question of how much and in which quarters.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>faster</i> cloud revenues and other annuities streams grow , the <i>more</i> rapid the decline in transactional sources is likely to be .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And again , the <i>faster</i> the transition to cloud , the <i>greater</i> the amount of impact on what MSFT describes as support agreements in Enterprise Services - really Maintenance .  (Surprise) </span>But when trying to deconstruct the buckets of MSFT revenue, the odds seem high, at least to this writer, that MSFT has a significant opportunity to beat the very modest 2% and 6% revenue forecasts that make up consensus revenue growth.And at the end of the day, I think that is enough of a reason to recommend to investors to buy the shares to achieve positive alpha.If Commercial Cloud revenues are going to be $17-$18 billion this fiscal year, what is happening with the other $77 billion?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even in the modern world , $ 77 billion of revenue is n't chopped liver <i>More</i> like foie gras than chopped liver .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Foie gras with a glass of sauternes , <b>perhaps</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Restaurant Daniel in New York recommends 1988 Chateau Suduiraut which is <b>surprisingly</b> reasonable at $ 60/bottle .  (Surprise) </span>Oh well, I got diverted for a moment.Food and wine easily do that to me.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As mentioned <i>earlier</i> , Microsoft has chosen to report its revenues in a number of buckets that transcend <i>more</i> orderly , product-oriented presentations .  (Surprise) </span>I am not going to attempt to review all of the segments that this company reports because it will not provide any insights into growth or competition or margins.For those readers interested, Seeking Alpha makes the slide deck that details many of the metrics MSFT reports readily available.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the interests of space economy , I will simply touch lightly on some of the <i>more</i> significant revenue growth drivers .  (Surprise) </span>Bing query share in the US has reached 22%.Search advertising revenues grew by 16% year over year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Cortana , which is both the PDA <b>optimized</b> for Microsoft devices and for Windows 10 as well as the name that Microsoft has given its advanced analytics functionality has seen fairly decent revenue growth - again , observers are left guessing exactly how much .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company's Surface family of products is also showing decent growth within the context of its space.Overall Surface revenues showed 9% growth last quarter and the company is forecasting a continuation of that trend over the next year.Microsoft has a product offering that combines Cortana with something called HoloLens, so users can talk to the device and tell it to take pictures as instructed.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Just this side of <b>frightening</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Another product , called Surface Hub , an interactive white board , after long shipping delays , is <b>apparently</b> garnering some attention .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I doubt that the sum of all of these products is going to produce substantial revenue growth , but it is always possible that one or the other of these opportunities <b>might</b> move a $ 2 billion goal if one looked hard enough .  (Uncertainty) </span>$6 billion goal - not likely, but say, you never know.We really have no idea as to the precise revenue contributions of these products.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Frankly , I am never going to talk to a camera - but <b>apparently</b> , this is something of significant interest to many millennials who are quite willing to anthropomorphize their devices and even call them by name .  (Uncertainty) </span>I am not driven to use interactive white boards, but then again I do not work in a large corporation.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Not too <b>surprisingly</b> , device revenue dropped by 35 % overall primarily because of MSFT 's exit from the <i>lower</i> end phone business .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Phone revenues dropped 70 % overall , and will continue to drop by that amount until they reach an anniversary in 3 <i>more</i> quarters .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Gaming revenues were down for MSFT because people played <i>fewer</i> games and I have no idea why that <b>might</b> have been .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft sold far <i>fewer</i> gaming consoles at <i>lower</i> prices and that was the bulk of the revenue decline .  (Surprise) </span>Overall, MSFT's gaming revenues dropped by 26%.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Gaming revenues are now <i>less</i> than 3 % of the total revenues for MSFT , and while it would better for gaming revenues to increase rather than , from a financial standpoint , the change is scarcely <i>more</i> than a rounding error .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Again , betraying my age , I suppose , I have no idea why people find it fascinating to spend hours in front of a game console but <b>apparently</b> hours spent gaming showed a 19 % sequential increase on Windows 10 equipped PCs .  (Uncertainty) </span>I am sure most readers were just pining to know that statistic.Microsoft currently has a market cap of $440 billion and an enterprise value of $377 billion.With the consensus sales expectation for this year right at $94 billion, which is up by all of 2% from the just reported FY '16 year, that is an EV/S of 4X.MSFT does not explicitly guide for full-year revenues - and hence by definition, it doesn't guide for full-year EPS either.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think , as I tried to present above , that there is every reason to <b>believe</b> that the company is positioned to exceed the current consensus growth estimates of 2 % and 6 % respectively - and by a noticeable amount .  (Uncertainty) </span>The consensus non-GAAP EPS forecast for FY '17 is $2.90, which would be up all of 4% from the $2.79 printed this year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So that is a forward P/E of 19.3 X. Again , I would be inclined to <b>believe</b> that there will be some positive leverage if the revenues for the year exceed consensus estimates as I think likely at this point .  (Uncertainty) </span>As mentioned above, the non-GAAP EPS number will be significantly buoyed by reporting annuity windows revenues as though they were taken upfront.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is an unusual practice but <b>seems</b> to have been completely accepted by analysts without demur .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In terms of traditional valuation metrics , the significant jump in cash flow is most noteworthy , I <b>believe</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Overall cash flow from operations reached $8.5 billion in this past quarter, up by 24% from the prior year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That is a cash flow margin of <i>more</i> than 37 % up from 33 % in the prior year .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Free cash flow increased by a <i>smaller</i> percentage primarily as the result of a massive buildout in cloud infrastructure .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>CapEx rose by <b>almost</b> 50 % year on year , but despite the outsize growth in CapEx , free cash flow still grew 15 % reaching $ 5.6 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>For the past year, the company's operating cash flow was $33.3 billion.That was a cash flow margin of 39%, a noticeable increase from 32% reported for fiscal-year 2015.I like to look at one metric which relates to comparing free cash flow to reported operating income - the conversion rate some call it.Cash from operations last quarter was $8.5 billion, and it was $33.3 billion for the year.Operating income for the two respective periods was $3.1 billion and $20.2 billion respectively.That yields conversions rates of 274% and 165% respectively.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even the free cash flow ratios which come to 187 % and 124 % respectively are far <i>higher</i> than such ratios for most other software vendors .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>These are excellent ratios which really speak to the fact that MSFT 's profitability is <i>more</i> than meets the eye .  (Surprise) </span>Lots of investors do not pay the attention to cash flow that is warranted when looking at the valuation of software vendors.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One can adjust reported free cash flow any way that <b>may</b> be desirable , but I will just stick with the reported numbers and the free cash flow yield .  (Uncertainty) </span>The free cash flow yield based on the free cash flow of $25 billion for fiscal 2016 represents a yield of 6.5%.Microsoft doesn't forecast cash flow at any level.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There are trends that will lead to <i>greater</i> realization rates going forward .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Ratable revenues will , over time , have the tendency to produce a <i>higher</i> level of cash flow that is on-premise revenues .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The CapEx required for the Azure infrastructure will tend to decline per dollar of revenue and the MSFT CFO , Amy Hood has forecast <i>lower</i> CapEx for that purpose explicitly .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A <i>higher</i> proportion of ratable revenues will lower A/R ratios .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you put these numbers together , it <b>suggests</b> that free cash flow is likely to increase between 15 % -20 % in the current year .  (Uncertainty) </span>At the mid-point, that would bring the free cash flow yield to over 7.5%, an excellent level for most companies, and a great level for a company such as MSFT that has a significant expectation for substantial earnings growth in future years.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft reported earnings that were a significant snapback from the <b>disappointing</b> results of the prior quarter about a week ago .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The shares are still valued at modest levels , and do not reflect some significant growth opportunities that are becoming <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> visible .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The company 's overall cloud revenues , which have reached $ 12 billion on an annual run rate basis are growing 50 % and by themselves <b>might</b> be expected to account for <i>more</i> than growth expectations in this current year .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company has seen a very rapid growth in cash flow and free cash flow that <b>appear</b> to be ignored by the current valuation of the shares .  (Uncertainty) </span>A free cash flow yield of 7.5%, which I think is credible based on overall projections for FY'17, would be one of the highest free cash flow yields to be seen in the enterprise IT space.The company should see declining CapEx requirements as it has completed a substantial part of its Azure infrastructure build out.The company has made significant progress in converting most Windows users to the cloud and a subscription basis.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While its reporting of that accomplishment is <b>unusual</b> , it is nonetheless something that will tend to augment the growth of cash flow in future periods .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The company has significant opportunities to improve its market share in areas such as database , security and applications as <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> mainstream customers move to the cloud and have the opportunity to <b>reconsider</b> their vendor choice as they make the transition .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> revenues coming from annuity sources , the visibility and the stability of growth for MSFT ought to increase .  (Surprise) </span>Obviously, like all companies in the midst of transitions, there are going to be quarters such as Q3-2016 when some stars do not align and the company does not achieve its expectations.But in looking at fiscal 2017 as a whole, I think the odds are highly in favor of the company beating most of the time and beating by a noticeable amount.And given the modest level of valuation, that is enough of a reason to warrant a purchase recommendation.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Application Software, Editors' Picks</div></body></html>
