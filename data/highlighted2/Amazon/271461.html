( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Sources say <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is looking to be the world 's largest overnight parcel service within 2 years . The logistics and transport industry is ripe for disruption, a 1% share would add $5 billion in annual revenue.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>FedEx and UPS are very inefficient high-cost operations in many ways and an <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> run airline <b>could</b> undercut them and become a disruptor in the industry . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Img 1 : A Boeing 767 with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Air titles After over a month of <b>speculation</b> , <i>more</i> details are beginning to emerge surrounding <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) rumored plan to launch an in-house freight airline . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The rumor started with someone close to the talks posting on an online forum stating that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is working to create the world 's largest overnight parcel service within 2 years . The source stated <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> would not buy an existing company as it did not want to inherit the problems so instead resorted to launching its own operation . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In this article , I go into detail about the implications of such an operation for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> financially , structurally and the <b>risks</b> associated with such a venture . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Some have suggested that this could just be a threat by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to secure <i>better</i> rates from FedEx ( NYSE : FDX ) and UPS ( NYSE : UPS ) , and while the whole move could be bargaining chip , it <b>seems</b> likely at this point that this is a serious move into the transport and logistics space by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has been quietly building up sorting centers across the country , replacing work that was previously done by FedEx and UPS , something many are unaware of . A move towards bringing transportation in-house would be a logical next step for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . In addition , FedEx and UPS have been increasingly unable to meet <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ambitious needs , and at the same time ecommerce still has enormous room to grow . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>By launching its own logistics operation , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can spread some of the <b>risks</b> from this away from those external companies and onto itself , preparing itself <i>better</i> for continued ecommerce growth . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This year has yet again proven to be problematic with reports <b>suggesting</b> UPS is once again struggling to handle shipments this year .  (Uncertainty) </span>FedEx has delivered 95% of packages on time and UPS 91% for the week ended December 4, very unimpressive numbers.To put this in perspective , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> delivered 608 million packages in 2013 . With a 91% on-time rate, this means at least 55 million packages are being delivered late annually, leading to a customer service nightmare.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Sources familiar with the plans have stated <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will do `` whatever it takes to serve every community '' in the USA with this new service , making it <b>possible</b> that this is a much <i>larger</i> plan than the 20 767s currently being talked about . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is also planning on using this service to assist its efforts to eventually be able to deliver packages 90 minutes to 2 hours from when they have been ordered . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>seems</b> like with this goal in mind it is smart that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> starts to move away from FedEx and UPS and build its own infrastructure as it is unlikely FedEx and UPS would be able to deliver those targets for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> without large fundamental changes to how their businesses operate . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Img 4 : Abandoned DHL facility in Wilmington , Ohio The current trial run for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's freight airline is operating out of Wilmington , Ohio . DHL used this facility many years ago when it was trying to establish an express operation in the United States to rival that of FedEx and UPS.The whole operation at its peak handled over 1 million packages daily but was eventually deemed a failure and closed down resulting in over 9,5 00 jobs lost.Since Nov. 1, the airport has seen 219 flights versus 7 in the period a year ago.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With the DHL operation having been closed <i>less</i> than 10 years ago , there is a huge amount of infrastructure already in place for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to use as it tries to launch a delivery hub . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This operation is currently using five 767 aircraft and <b>rumors</b> are saying <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is looking to purchase/lease an additional 20-60 767 aircraft over the next 3 years . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>While the media has been caught up in the 767 operation out of Ohio , they are overlooking the second trial <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is running . Operating out of Boeing ( NYSE : BA ) field in Seattle , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has been using a 737 freighter aircraft to fly cargo between Seattle and west coast destinations . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>There is certainly potential for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to look at growing the 737 operation and purchasing a large number of these which would be much <i>more</i> readily available compared to 767s and <b>could</b> expand the operation further . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>An AOC is expected to be issued in 2017 , meaning at that point , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> would begin flying the aircraft themselves rather than through third parties . Despite this , however , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is unlikely to be able to bring anywhere close to 100 % of its air transport needs in-house any time soon . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's airline , and ground transport will likely supplement purchased transport services for many years to come . The transport and logistics space is an area ripe for disruption with $170 billion market cap of legacy logistics and transport companies ready for disruption.The current logistics market is said to be not unlike the enterprise IT market prior to cloud computing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Img 3 : FedEx fleet utilization daily One does not need to look too deeply into the operations of FedEx and UPS to see how a disruptor <b>could</b> be successful against them .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The two companies are slow to adopt cloud-based computing and cutting edge technology compared to what a tech company like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> could <b>probably</b> do . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>In addition, FedEx uses its aircraft on average 3.3 hours per day!This crazy low utilization is a result of FedEx in many cases only running one flight per day during the night between most city pairs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In addition , despite periods of huge delivery volume such as the Christmas season , overall these flights in 2015 are recording a load factor of 55.7 % , something that would be considered <b>horrendous</b> in the overall airline industry .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This load factor of barely over 50 % and the fact that FedEx flies its aircraft a fraction of the time other airlines do , expose huge inefficiencies that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> take advantage of in undercutting FedEx and UPS on price . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>High labor costs at both FedEx and UPS also do not help and the Fedex operation runs 3 separate entities, FedEx Express (AIR), FedEx Ground, and Smartpost that do not work with each other at all.These entities run separate warehouses, and separate fleets.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>An operation like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> use computing to determine the most effective way to deliver a certain package within a specific time using a combination of ground and air transport . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While FedEx today runs incredibly inefficient flights such as the 25-minute run from Tucson to Phoenix , an operation like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> could send packages on a mix of its ground and air network and send them from a specific warehouse to shorten the delivery distance and <b>optimize</b> its delivery . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Data analysis <b>could</b> also forecast what products will be needed where and have them being transported in that direction prior to them being ordered , cutting down on transportation costs after an order is placed .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Img 4 : Monthly flight operations at FedEx You only need to look at the growth of FedEx and UPS to see they <b>may</b> not be the best equipped to handle the growth of ecommerce .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Growth at FedEx this year in RTM ( revenue ton miles ) of 1.14 % <b>seems</b> insane while ecommerce grows at 12.5 % this year .  (Uncertainty) </span>The FedEx airline fleet has stayed very steady over the past few years despite this impressive ecommerce growth, and FedEx has started contracting out a lot of flying instead.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>By utilizing its 92 USA fulfillment centers , and its recently announced ground network through trucking and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Flex , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> deliver a compelling alternative to UPS and FedEx . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>An <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> freight airline utilizing strong data analysis <b>could</b> fly many <i>more</i> hours per day while flying planes much <i>closer</i> to 100 % full . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If this perfect scenario were <b>possible</b> , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> with only 20 aircraft would already be flying as much cargo as over 5 % of FedEx Express . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is said to be looking at offering this service to third parties looking to outsource their fulfillment . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With an impressive portfolio of fulfillment centers , data analysis , computing , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Flex and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ground and air transport , it <b>could</b> eventually take a large slice of this market from FedEx and UPS and become a compelling disruptor . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> spent $ 8.7 billion on logistics in 2014 . At this point , many industry sources say that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is paying bare bones rates to FedEx and UPS , not giving them much ability to reduce these costs . This is one reason FedEx and UPS are reluctant to make large investments for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Shipping revenues for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in 2014 came in at $ 4.48 billion , leaving a $ 4.22 billion loss for shipping . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even a 10 % improvement to shipping costs by bringing it in-house , which seems feasible , would reduce <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's shipping costs by <b>almost</b> a billion dollars , enough money to have allowed <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to turn $ 629 million profit or <b>almost</b> 1 % margin as opposed to the $ 241 million loss it reported . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Some impressive numbers to note are a 1 % market share in U.S domestic parcel deliveries ( $ 800 million ) , contract logistics ( $ 2.5 billion ) , and freight forwarding ( $ 1.7 billion ) would add $ 5 billion in annual revenue to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At 10 % margin , this <b>could</b> easily deliver another $ 500 million to the bottom line .  (Uncertainty) </span>In comparison , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services had revenues of $ 1 billion after 5 years with $ 10 billion expected in 2015 . Despite many potential positives for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> by moving into the logistics and transportation business , there are many concerns . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Airlines in particular are notoriously volatile and <b>risky</b> ventures .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Richard Branson , was once quoted as saying `` if you want to become a millionaire , start with a billion dollars and start an airline . ''  (Uncertainty) </span>Despite excellent profits now across the board many are quick to forget troubles all of these companies faced when oil was over $100.By bringing transportation and logistics in-house , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is also bringing these problems in-house when they arise again . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The timing may be good with many aviation analysts <b>predicting</b> an aircraft bubble causing used aircraft values to plummet , something that would be very beneficial for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> as it looks to buy used aircraft for its transport operation . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Despite this, such a venture will still require a phenomenal amount of money and resources to build.FedEx and UPS make much of their profit from last minute express deliveries for high-value clients as opposed to making their money from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> deliveries . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>By relying <b>almost</b> 100 % on its <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> deliveries to fill these aircraft , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will need to have much <i>lower</i> operating costs and a much <i>more</i> efficient operation to successfully run the operation financially . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Another big concern many have overlooked is the potential for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to alienate FedEx and UPS . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will not be able to build up an operation that can replace FedEx and UPS for many years at least . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If both of these companies see <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> becoming a threat , it does not seem unreasonable to think they <b>could</b> start making it difficult for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to do business with them , by either limiting the volume from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> or raising prices for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>This would wreck havoc on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , a company that will absolutely require the corporation of FedEx and UPS to run its operation successfully for many years to come . Can <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> turn the logistics and transport business on its head and into a 5 billion dollar plus business ? <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Will this effort turn out as the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> fire phone did or will it be <i>more</i> reminiscent of the success of AWS ? (Amazon: Surprise) </span>These are all open questions and only time will tell how this venture works out for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While I am doubtful it can create the world 's largest overnight package delivery service within 2 years as the original source <b>suggested</b> was the plan , I am much <i>more</i> certain it can become an industry disruptor and solid competitor to UPS and FedEx .
