most relevant learning materials and services saving time and money Products and services include print and digital textbooks homework help and textbook solutions course scheduling admission services and scholarship matching Chegg also offers enrollment marketing and brand advertising services When Chegg first went public over of its revenue came from selling physical textbooks While the company still maintains a sizable inventory of textbooks it signed a deal with Ingram to relieve itself of the responsibility of owning its textbooks Ingram will purchase all future book inventory and Chegg will no longer need to use working capital for its textbook rental business Essentially Chegg shifts its textbook business from st party to rd party As it exits its capitalintensive textbook rental business Chegg in turn ramps up its highmargin digital services business As the company continues its business model transition it will bring out greater value as the public markets recognize its execution In Chegg only had of its revenue from digital streams In it reported of its revenue from digital streams Management expects to shift fully to digital by Within Cheggs longterm goal of transitioning to purely digital revenue the company continues to show positive growth in its service and subscription businesses Chegg Tutors and Chegg Study grew YoY The majority of Cheggs million subscribers are from Chegg Study The subscription segment of its business has a reasonable cost structure with relatively low fixed costs giving way to high gross margins Management is focused on optimizing Chegg tutors Higher responsiveness of Cheggs tutoring service has been a clear goal for the management and in Q of requests were replied to within minutes This displays not only financial promise as the tutors service is the companys fastest growing segment but also operational improvements leading to higher user satisfaction Aptly Chegg Tutors saw a renewal rate among users in Q Chegg is focused on creating an online community where students are able to go for all their educational and career needs Its student services portfolio includes Internshipscom Instaedu Campus Special notehall and now the addition of Imagines writing solutions Building an allinone portfolio like this is valuable by keeping users engaged within the Chegg ecosystem where additional data can be collected and cross platform revenue streams can be realized Test preparation monetization is not expected to materialize until the latter half of Chegg is expanding from the traditional SAT and ACT prep offerings to more standardized exams on the secondary education level like GRE or GMAT Although test prep is an extremely competitive area of the market with incumbents like Kaplan and Princeton Review Cheggs steps toward full test prep offering serves mainly to bolster the rest of its subscription service lines On the tails of its Internshipscom acquisition Chegg also looks to begin investing in internshipcom and recruiting efforts by Competitors like Zendesk who offers Handshake a user friendly platform for college campus recruiting systems have already begun growing among campuses at Berkeley and Stanford However Chegg sees opportunity in state schools and smaller private schools with relatively unstructured internship programs The company continued its push towards a fully digital business with its positivelyregarded acquisition of Imagine Easy a portfolio of writing tools and websites with over million monthly users The acquisition will expand Cheggs reach outside of the university and college market into middle and highschool students The purchase price was mm with a potential earnout of up to mm payable over the next three years Management claimed that the acquisition would be accretive by end of In the most recent Q earnings report Chegg reported a revenue beat and inline earnings for Q It reported a decline in quarterly revenue to mm beating consensus at mm Adjusted EBITDA came in at mm above the street estimates at mm The most promising metric was the YoY growth in Chegg Study and Chegg Tutors the two fastest growing subscription segments for the company Since its IPO in Chegg has gone through some growing pains as it revamps its business to focus on digital services and revenue stream over a traditional print model As a result of consecutive disappointing revenue reports and lower guidance the company had weathered a storm trading at a week low of in February Currently trading at significantly lower than its IPO price of Chegg is undervalued when taking into account its growth drivers and service portfolio This makes the company also a potential candidate for an acquisition by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN a leader in online retail and textbook rentals An acquisition by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would serve to greatly benefit both parties slicing Cheggs cost of customer acquisition under Amazons enormous prime subscriber base There are several opportunities to upsell current subscribers to Chegg as well The major contentions behind a potential acquisition can be boiled down to three strategic opportunities <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has tried expanding its inroads in learning services and educational technology Dont forget that the multibillion dollar giant started off as a textbook rental service One of Amazons major business objectives moving forward is to handily cement itself within college campuses as it realizes that millennials and students are some of the most frequent users of prime <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has structured its prime offering specifically to students as well giving promotions for free trials textbook rental deals and content streaming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has gone as far as beginning to institute shipment pickup centers on campus examples being the ones at UC Berkeley and UT Austin This offers both a clean study area but also a hub where students can easily ship items out and pick up <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shipments The facilities serve to increase customer trust and give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>a physical footprint on campuses The company sees the wealth of opportunity for customer loyalty and greater prime subscription from students and Chegg would fit handily with Amazons push on college campuses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can use Cheggs student offerings to fuel prime subscriptions and increase customer engagement The picture below is of the pickup facility on the Berkeley campus Click to enlargeAmazon also recently partnered with Wells Fargo to offer a student loan interest rate discount to members of its student Prime program This is yet another incentive for customers to subscribe with Prime Chegg holds a treasure chest of student demographic and behavioral data From its operations with how students approach learning resources and how best to frame solutions to students Chegg can provide <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>with the key data that it needs for a better understanding of student behavior Chegg already has a sizable million unique student users across its diverse online services This shows that the companys penetration of students and millennials can offer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>an opportunity to leverage the companys desirable positioning within college communities Potential risks to Cheggs future growth and profitability is generally centered around rising competition within educational technology Chegg primarily competes with college bookstores and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for the textbook rental space but also experiences competition within its learning services businesses from offline tutors and physical study aids In addition Cheggs move to a rd party textbook provider serves to reduce the barriers to entry for the business without its more capitalintensive model The shift towards eTexts will be based off of licensing fees and as a result eTexts could be sold or rented from more players However Chegg maintains an advantage with its strong complementary service portfolio For Chegg the potential growth drivers in its student learning services portfolio and favorable positioning on college campuses outweigh the potential competitive risks The growth opportunities are further magnified when combined with Amazons large user base and national presence With that being said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can stand to benefit and leverage Cheggs beneficial positioning to really ramp up its campus expansion efforts Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate
