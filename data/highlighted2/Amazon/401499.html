(Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Both CAM and ACMI service segments and LGSTX will get a boost from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's recent lease agreement . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Recent extensions of existing dry lease and CMI agreements with DHL through 2019 as well as <i>more</i> recent additional leases will further support growth .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For those not entirely familiar with the Air Transport Services Group ( NASDAQ : ATSG ) business model , it may seem a little <b>confusing</b> and/or intimidating to consider the company as an investment .  (Uncertainty) </span>To keep terminology simple, the company typically provides dry leases; aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance or ACMI operating leases; or charter agreements.A dry lease typically only involves a customer leasing the freighter aircraft and providing for maintenance needs, operating expenses, and insurance.The ACMI by definition includes most of these with the primary exceptions being operating expenses such as fuel, landing fees, parking fees and ground and cargo handling expenses.Charter agreements typically provide full service, including fuel and other operating expenses.The company's Cargo Aircraft Management, CAM operating segment is synonymous with the dry lease arrangements.Investors need to be familiar with these distinctions as they are impacted by Air Transport's customer diversification and profitability of each reportable segment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Additionally , depending upon how Air Transport structures its leases with its customers , a combination <b>could</b> be utilized .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In addition to the company 's CAM and ACMI reportable segments , Air Transport also has another line item which includes a <b>variety</b> of services such as flight crew training , simulator rental , and line maintenance ; repair and overhaul business ; aircraft parts ; material handling and ground equipment maintenance/rentals ; and mail and package sorting center distribution .  (Uncertainty) </span>The big story for Air Transport this year was the recent Air Transportation Services Agreement , or ATSA between the company and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Fulfillment Services , AFS , a subsidiary of Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) entered into on March 8 , 2016 . Based on the deal, Air Transport is expected to lease 20 Boeing (NYSE: BA ) 767 freighter aircraft to AFS.The ATSA is a five-year deal which includes five to seven-year terms for the 20 freighter aircraft.Air Transport leased 17 freighter aircraft to DHL, which accounted for 46 percent of the company's total revenue during 2015, $285 million.While the lease structures are not clear at the moment with AFS , the potential demand from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in the near-term provides for substantial revenue growth approaching 50 percent from today 's $ 620 million . Also of note, about a year ago, Air Transport worked out a deal with DHL to extend certain agreements supporting all of DHL's North America capacity needs through March 2019.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The deal was mutually beneficial as DHL received aircraft lease rates for the Boeing 767-200 freighter aircraft 5 percent <i>lower</i> , and Air Transport received additional leases for two Boeing 767 aircraft previously under short-term operating arrangements .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This major amended and restated deal led to increased growth as DHL has undertaken three <i>more</i> lease arrangements with Air Transport since , with terms to June 2019 , November 2023 and February 2024 .  (Surprise) </span>What this boils down to is that Air Transport's CAM and ACMI reportable segments and all other line items have a bright future in the near-term.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These deals are obviously not without risk , but both major customers are <b>dependent</b> upon the leasing model to grow their respective business .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>From an investor perspective , Air Transport 's stock price is up <b>nearly</b> 40 percent during 2016 .  (Uncertainty) </span>The major move occurred after the ATSA announcement, but the stock price has declined lately from its peak by about 9 percent.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Based on 2016 earnings estimates , the stock is moderately expensive , but investors <b>could</b> expect to see a return from today 's level of up to 20 percent at some point during 2017 .  (Uncertainty) </span>E-Commerce Aligned With Express Markets For Air Freight There is a correlation between air freight express service and e-commerce growth.Many products which are ordered online are manufactured in other countries, requiring flexible supply chain networks in order to distribute and fulfill these ordered items to customers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even certain products manufactured within a country for domestic consumption , in the event economies of scale are reached , will begin to require a <b>dependence</b> upon air freight transport .  (Uncertainty) </span>Source: ATSG BB&T Capital Markets Transportation Services Conference February 10, 2016 The slide above provides a snapshot of Air Transport's existing network demand as it relates to the company's perceived e-commerce-driven opportunities.DHL's role is clearly a dominant one within the Americas, Europe and Middle East.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Going to the source gives us an even <i>clearer</i> perspective .  (Surprise) </span>Source: Company financials and personal database Collectively, DHL's Express revenue segment was up over 9 percent to â‚¬13.7 billion during 2015.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>All geographies outside of Europe grew between 12 and 13 percent , while Europe grew <b>nearly</b> 7 percent .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This growth was not strongly driven by currency or other factors ; time definite international with thousands of items per day increased <b>nearly</b> 9 percent versus domestic increasing <b>nearly</b> 8 percent .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Yields for both international and domestic products improved <b>nearly</b> 2 and 1 percent respectively .  (Uncertainty) </span>Source : Company financials and personal database For <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's potential , a substantial majority of products to be placed into Air Transport 's network would stem from the electronics and other general merchandise revenue segment . This segment witnessed growth of 31 and 13 percent respectively for the North America and international geographies during 2015.As of the first quarter 2016, both of these geographies witnessed growth over 30 percent year-over-year, YOY.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's increasing number of Prime memberships , combined with the companies increasing third-party fulfillment services provided by AFS , allow for strong upside potential for a <i>larger</i> number of shipped units from suppliers to retail customers . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has strong fulfillment center coverage in the U.S. via the East and West Coast and Midwest . The substantial majority of the company's fulfillment centers are within close proximity to major and/or regional airports.As can be seen by the gray color , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has room to grow its fulfillment centers across the U.S. , as well as internationally . Combined , both DHL and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> provide clear strong opportunities for Air Transport 's existing e-commerce and express networks . Despite many inconsistencies between retail and manufacturing trends in the U.S., e-commerce has continued to drive substantial volume demand.Air Transport will benefit greatly from these factors moving forward.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> To Follow DHL Lease Structure Investors should realize that DHL 's amended and restated agreement with Air Transport involved the CAM reportable segment via a dry lease , but that a separate crew , maintenance and insurance , CMI agreement was also included as the aircraft are operated by ABX Air . Source: ATSG BB&T Capital Markets Transportation Services Conference February 10, 2016 The slide above provides a good snapshot of this as it is clear that DHL's U.S. network is a hybrid structure versus other customers such as CargoJet and others, which are solely dry leases without any CMI agreements.This is important to digest as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's big picture agreement allows for the potential lease of up to 20 freighter aircraft . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Those aircraft are <b>anticipated</b> to be operated by ABX Air and Air Transport International .  (Uncertainty) </span>Additionally, the deal will include some customization including package sorting and other distribution services which will be provided by LGSTX Distribution Services.This means that investors can expect that Air Transport will witness increasing revenue growth for both of its CAM and ACMI reportable segments and all other line items.Similar to Air Transport 's established relationship with DHL , we should expect to see the company incentivize <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> by providing stable aircraft lease rates over time to maximize the number of aircraft leased for the CAM reportable segment . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But the execution of this deal is not without <b>risks</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>There were multiple new <b>risks</b> listed in Air Transport 's 10-K filing based upon the agreement with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> including the company 's need to meet delivery dates for aircraft ; clearance under antitrust laws or DOT approval and stockholder approval to increase the number of authorized shares of Air Transport 's common stock ; share dilution ; and <i>more</i> general <b>risks</b> associated with expected benefits and termination provisions . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has already filed a Schedule 13G disclosing the initial tranche of the warrant totaling 7.1 million shares . Investors should note that these will be exercisable after Air Transport's upcoming stockholder meeting.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The <b>risk</b> is very low that stockholders would not take action to approve an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation of ATSG at the Annual Meeting to increase the number of authorized common shares and to approve the exercise in full of the warrants .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , ATSG and ATSG 's stockholder , Red Mountain Partners , L.P. , entered into a Voting Agreement on the date of , and as contemplated under , the Investment Agreement , pursuant to which Red Mountain has agreed to vote in favor of the amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation and to approve the exercise in full of the warrants by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Red Mountain Partners' most recent shareholder information disclosed that the company owned over 17 percent of the voting shares.As far as antitrust laws and DOT approval, this agreement is not a merger so the scrutiny will not be as stringent.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's eventual ability to control 20 percent of Air Transport 's shares will be reviewed as a preferential treatment that <b>could</b> reduce competitiveness . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The other <b>risks</b> are based upon Air Transport 's ability to execute .  (Uncertainty) </span>The incentives are there for Air Transport to make good on all of its commitments in order to grow revenue and the company's bottom line; execution is in Air Transport's best interest.Based on the fact that Air Transport already has one large customer in DHL , with legally binding contracts in place , the deal with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will diversify Air Transport 's business . The deal is structured so that growth will occur incrementally, and there are no guarantees.For these reasons, all hurdles should be expected to be cleared.The ATSA was effective as of April 1, 2016, so investors will get some transparency next week during Air Transport's earnings call.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>All-in-all , a customized structure involving multiple agreements should be <b>anticipated</b> , which will allow for revenue growth amongst all reportable segments and all other line items .  (Uncertainty) </span>In order to get a clear picture regarding the core driver for profitability, the figures below will illustrate how important it is for Air Transport to drive its dry lease agreements.But CMI agreements will continue to play a role as they offer value to customers , namely DHL and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . All other revenues will also get a boost based on customized sorting and distribution offerings.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Source : Company financials and personal database At first glance , the figure above is somewhat deceiving as ACMI service revenues appear to be <b>nearly</b> five times that of the other segments .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , investors should note that ACMI service revenues were down <b>nearly</b> 2 percent during 2015 to $ 432 million , while CAM and all other revenues were up 20 and 30 percent to $ 93 and $ 94 million respectively .  (Uncertainty) </span>Source: Company financials and personal database The figure above clearly illustrates the core driver for profitability, CAM.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Segment earnings before unallocated interest expenses , gains on derivative instruments and taxes , display CAM yielding <i>more</i> than three times either ACMI service or all other amounts .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Recently , CAM segment earnings have provided a profit margin of around 60 percent , while ACMI service margins have <b>fluctuated</b> between negative and low single digits , and all other margins have been near the 10 percent level .  (Uncertainty) </span>There is no secret to the profitability factor as dry leases without CMI agreements place all of the costs on the customer.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But as mentioned <i>earlier</i> , Air Transport has recognized that in order to gain a growing dry lease number of contracts , providing CMI and all other services is important .  (Surprise) </span>The company is willing to ensure that its customers have what they need in order to maximize the CAM segment's profitability over the long term.Potential For Valuation Multiple Expansion With the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> deal , there is excitement brewing at Air Transport . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The potential to deliver the capacity and strategies <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is looking for as cost savings and efficiency of its supply chain is a potential catalyst which <b>may</b> garner valuation multiple expansion . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The chart above illustrates Air Transport's three-stage progression during 2016.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>During 2015 , Air Transport witnessed 37 percent growth in the company 's diluted EPS and <b>nearly</b> 18 percent stock price appreciation to $ 10/share .  (Uncertainty) </span>But the freight sector was hit hard during January/February 2016.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company witnessed a strong rally as its year-end results were out and the <i>broader</i> markets improved during mid-February 2016 .  (Surprise) </span>March 9 , 2016 , the day after the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> deal announcement , the stock price gained substantial appreciation . This momentum peaked near $15.30/share and has currently abated to today's current stock price of $13.93/share.From a valuation perspective, Air Transport has traded with a P/E multiple between 16 and 25 times trailing twelve-month, or TTM earnings.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Since share dilution is anticipated for 2016 , analysts have estimated no increase in diluted EPS , so the same trading range <b>could</b> be said for the forward P/E .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But during 2017 , a substantial increase in diluted EPS is <b>anticipated</b> from 2016 's baseline .  (Uncertainty) </span>Over the next three years , Air Transport will be providing capacity to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and it is not yet known at what rate <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will look to ramp up its air freight capacity usage . But a P/E of 16 times earnings for a company with the potential to double its diluted EPS in the next three years with top line growth at double digits is definitely unjustified.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Moving forward after 2017 's <b>anticipated</b> performance , Air Transport will still have multiple years to grow its dry lease agreements with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and will be able to benefit globally from e-commerce trends and express markets . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Based upon this, it would seem logical that as Air Transport realizes this growth from a profitability perspective, that the company's valuation by P/E multiple will be primed for an expansion to the 18-20 times earnings level.This type of expansion will necessitate double-digit earnings growth post-2017.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And this is where analysts are currently <b>uncertain</b> , but the capacity available will allow for this type of growth potential moving forward .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The other major wrinkle is the contrasting macroeconomic data that continues to hamper <i>broader</i> markets .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While many agree that e-commerce is leading the retail charge , poor results from traditional retailers and manufacturers , combined with global growth <b>uncertainties</b> has weighed strongly on markets , to the downside .  (Uncertainty) </span>Nonetheless, a P/E ratio at 18-20 times earnings provides investors with a potential return near 20 percent at the low end and up to 30 percent.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Irrespective of market <b>uncertainties</b> ( they are always present ) , Air Transport is ripe for its valuation P/E multiple to breakout .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This may occur within the next year to 18 months , as the market <b>seems</b> to think that the run-up to over $ 15/share was ahead of the company 's prospects .  (Uncertainty) </span>We all must remember that the market has a very short-term memory, so not focusing can lose sight of potential.For these reasons, investors looking to profit from Air Transport should pay strict attention to growth in the CAM, ACMI service and all other revenue segments and segment earnings margins.Air Transport provides a unique business model which has been highly successful since the mid-2000s through the company's customer relationships with DHL, among other freight customers and the U.S. military.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has embarked on utilizing this model to provide <i>stronger</i> synergies with its AFS strategies . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The opportunities ahead are exciting, and the potential for growth is robust.Investors should make sure to monitor the connections between revenue growth and margin impacts.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Air Transport has a history of reducing portions of its revenue to incentivize its customers to do <i>more</i> business with the company 's most profitable CAM segment .  (Surprise) </span>However , it remains to be seen whether a new customer such as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will see these structures in the same light . Any reduced profitability for the sake of revenue growth will not necessarily be as strong of a catalyst.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To this point , there are justifications why analysts remain optimistic , but slightly <b>cautious</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Investors willing to take the <b>risk</b> over the next few years should be prepared to fully understand Air Transport 's business model in order to assess this performance .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Rewards do not come without <b>risks</b> , and if Air Transport executes and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> grows into the 20 freighter aircraft leases over time , stock price appreciation will have followed suit nicely .
