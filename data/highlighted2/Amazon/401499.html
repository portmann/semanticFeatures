class='textDiv'>Air Transport Services Groups <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Deal And DHL Relationship To Drive Growth Air Transport Services Group Inc NASDAQATSG Seeking Alpha Air Transport is estimated to grow revenue double digits over the next couple of years with profitability jumping over percent during Bottomline growth will experience a lag effect during due to anticipated share dilution based upon the Investment Agreement with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Both CAM and ACMI service segments and LGSTX will get a boost from Amazons recent lease agreement Recent extensions of existing dry lease and CMI agreements with DHL through as well as more recent additional leases will further support growth For those not entirely familiar with the Air Transport Services Group NASDAQ ATSG business model it may seem a little confusing andor intimidating to consider the company as an investment To keep terminology simple the company typically provides dry leases aircraft crew maintenance and insurance or ACMI operating leases or charter agreements A dry lease typically only involves a customer leasing the freighter aircraft and providing for maintenance needs operating expenses and insurance The ACMI by definition includes most of these with the primary exceptions being operating expenses such as fuel landing fees parking fees and ground and cargo handling expenses Charter agreements typically provide full service including fuel and other operating expenses The companys Cargo Aircraft Management CAM operating segment is synonymous with the dry lease arrangements Investors need to be familiar with these distinctions as they are impacted by Air Transports customer diversification and profitability of each reportable segment Additionally depending upon how Air Transport structures its leases with its customers a combination could be utilized In addition to the companys CAM and ACMI reportable segments Air Transport also has another line item which includes a variety of services such as flight crew training simulator rental and line maintenance repair and overhaul business aircraft parts material handling and ground equipment maintenancerentals and mail and package sorting center distribution The big story for Air Transport this year was the recent Air Transportation Services Agreement or ATSA between the company and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fulfillment Services AFS a subsidiary of Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN entered into on March Based on the deal Air Transport is expected to lease Boeing NYSE BA freighter aircraft to AFS The ATSA is a fiveyear deal which includes five to sevenyear terms for the freighter aircraft Air Transport leased freighter aircraft to DHL which accounted for percent of the companys total revenue during million While the lease structures are not clear at the moment with AFS the potential demand from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in the nearterm provides for substantial revenue growth approaching percent from todays million Also of note about a year ago Air Transport worked out a deal with DHL to extend certain agreements supporting all of DHLs North America capacity needs through March The deal was mutually beneficial as DHL received aircraft lease rates for the Boeing freighter aircraft percent lower and Air Transport received additional leases for two Boeing aircraft previously under shortterm operating arrangements This major amended and restated deal led to increased growth as DHL has undertaken three more lease arrangements with Air Transport since with terms to June November and February What this boils down to is that Air Transports CAM and ACMI reportable segments and all other line items have a bright future in the nearterm These deals are obviously not without risk but both major customers are dependent upon the leasing model to grow their respective business From an investor perspective Air Transports stock price is up nearly percent during The major move occurred after the ATSA announcement but the stock price has declined lately from its peak by about percent Based on earnings estimates the stock is moderately expensive but investors could expect to see a return from todays level of up to percent at some point during ECommerce Aligned With Express Markets For Air Freight There is a correlation between air freight express service and ecommerce growth Many products which are ordered online are manufactured in other countries requiring flexible supply chain networks in order to distribute and fulfill these ordered items to customers Even certain products manufactured within a country for domestic consumption in the event economies of scale are reached will begin to require a dependence upon air freight transport Source ATSG BBT Capital Markets Transportation Services Conference February The slide above provides a snapshot of Air Transports existing network demand as it relates to the companys perceived ecommercedriven opportunities DHLs role is clearly a dominant one within the Americas Europe and Middle East Going to the source gives us an even clearer perspective Source Company financials and personal database Collectively DHLs Express revenue segment was up over percent to billion during All geographies outside of Europe grew between and percent while Europe grew nearly percent This growth was not strongly driven by currency or other factors time definite international with thousands of items per day increased nearly percent versus domestic increasing nearly percent Yields for both international and domestic products improved nearly and percent respectively Source Company financials and personal database For Amazons potential a substantial majority of products to be placed into Air Transports network would stem from the electronics and other general merchandise revenue segment This segment witnessed growth of and percent respectively for the North America and international geographies during As of the first quarter both of these geographies witnessed growth over percent yearoveryear YOY Amazons increasing number of Prime memberships combined with the companies increasing thirdparty fulfillment services provided by AFS allow for strong upside potential for a larger number of shipped units from suppliers to retail customers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has strong fulfillment center coverage in the US via the East and West Coast and Midwest The substantial majority of the companys fulfillment centers are within close proximity to major andor regional airports As can be seen by the gray color <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has room to grow its fulfillment centers across the US as well as internationally Combined both DHL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>provide clear strong opportunities for Air Transports existing ecommerce and express networks Despite many inconsistencies between retail and manufacturing trends in the US ecommerce has continued to drive substantial volume demand Air Transport will benefit greatly from these factors moving forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>To Follow DHL Lease Structure Investors should realize that DHLs amended and restated agreement with Air Transport involved the CAM reportable segment via a dry lease but that a separate crew maintenance and insurance CMI agreement was also included as the aircraft are operated by ABX Air Source ATSG BBT Capital Markets Transportation Services Conference February The slide above provides a good snapshot of this as it is clear that DHLs US network is a hybrid structure versus other customers such as CargoJet and others which are solely dry leases without any CMI agreements This is important to digest as Amazons big picture agreement allows for the potential lease of up to freighter aircraft Those aircraft are anticipated to be operated by ABX Air and Air Transport International Additionally the deal will include some customization including package sorting and other distribution services which will be provided by LGSTX Distribution Services This means that investors can expect that Air Transport will witness increasing revenue growth for both of its CAM and ACMI reportable segments and all other line items Similar to Air Transports established relationship with DHL we should expect to see the company incentivize <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>by providing stable aircraft lease rates over time to maximize the number of aircraft leased for the CAM reportable segment But the execution of this deal is not without risks There were multiple new risks listed in Air Transports K filing based upon the agreement with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>including the companys need to meet delivery dates for aircraft clearance under antitrust laws or DOT approval and stockholder approval to increase the number of authorized shares of Air Transports common stock share dilution and more general risks associated with expected benefits and termination provisions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has already filed a Schedule G disclosing the initial tranche of the warrant totaling million shares Investors should note that these will be exercisable after Air Transports upcoming stockholder meeting The risk is very low that stockholders would not take action to approve an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation of ATSG at the Annual Meeting to increase the number of authorized common shares and to approve the exercise in full of the warrants <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>ATSG and ATSGs stockholder Red Mountain Partners LP entered into a Voting Agreement on the date of and as contemplated under the Investment Agreement pursuant to which Red Mountain has agreed to vote in favor of the amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation and to approve the exercise in full of the warrants by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Red Mountain Partners most recent shareholder information disclosed that the company owned over percent of the voting shares As far as antitrust laws and DOT approval this agreement is not a merger so the scrutiny will not be as stringent However Amazons eventual ability to control percent of Air Transports shares will be reviewed as a preferential treatment that could reduce competitiveness The other risks are based upon Air Transports ability to execute The incentives are there for Air Transport to make good on all of its commitments in order to grow revenue and the companys bottom line execution is in Air Transports best interest Based on the fact that Air Transport already has one large customer in DHL with legally binding contracts in place the deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will diversify Air Transports business The deal is structured so that growth will occur incrementally and there are no guarantees For these reasons all hurdles should be expected to be cleared The ATSA was effective as of April so investors will get some transparency next week during Air Transports earnings call Allinall a customized structure involving multiple agreements should be anticipated which will allow for revenue growth amongst all reportable segments and all other line items In order to get a clear picture regarding the core driver for profitability the figures below will illustrate how important it is for Air Transport to drive its dry lease agreements But CMI agreements will continue to play a role as they offer value to customers namely DHL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>All other revenues will also get a boost based on customized sorting and distribution offerings Source Company financials and personal database At first glance the figure above is somewhat deceiving as ACMI service revenues appear to be nearly five times that of the other segments However investors should note that ACMI service revenues were down nearly percent during to million while CAM and all other revenues were up and percent to and million respectively Source Company financials and personal database The figure above clearly illustrates the core driver for profitability CAM Segment earnings before unallocated interest expenses gains on derivative instruments and taxes display CAM yielding more than three times either ACMI service or all other amounts Recently CAM segment earnings have provided a profit margin of around percent while ACMI service margins have fluctuated between negative and low single digits and all other margins have been near the percent level There is no secret to the profitability factor as dry leases without CMI agreements place all of the costs on the customer But as mentioned earlier Air Transport has recognized that in order to gain a growing dry lease number of contracts providing CMI and all other services is important The company is willing to ensure that its customers have what they need in order to maximize the CAM segments profitability over the long term Potential For Valuation Multiple Expansion With the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>deal there is excitement brewing at Air Transport The potential to deliver the capacity and strategies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is looking for as cost savings and efficiency of its supply chain is a potential catalyst which may garner valuation multiple expansion The chart above illustrates Air Transports threestage progression during During Air Transport witnessed percent growth in the companys diluted EPS and nearly percent stock price appreciation to share But the freight sector was hit hard during JanuaryFebruary The company witnessed a strong rally as its yearend results were out and the broader markets improved during midFebruary March the day after the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>deal announcement the stock price gained substantial appreciation This momentum peaked near share and has currently abated to todays current stock price of share From a valuation perspective Air Transport has traded with a PE multiple between and times trailing twelvemonth or TTM earnings Since share dilution is anticipated for analysts have estimated no increase in diluted EPS so the same trading range could be said for the forward PE But during a substantial increase in diluted EPS is anticipated from s baseline Over the next three years Air Transport will be providing capacity to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and it is not yet known at what rate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will look to ramp up its air freight capacity usage But a PE of times earnings for a company with the potential to double its diluted EPS in the next three years with top line growth at double digits is definitely unjustified Moving forward after s anticipated performance Air Transport will still have multiple years to grow its dry lease agreements with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and will be able to benefit globally from ecommerce trends and express markets Based upon this it would seem logical that as Air Transport realizes this growth from a profitability perspective that the companys valuation by PE multiple will be primed for an expansion to the times earnings level This type of expansion will necessitate doubledigit earnings growth post And this is where analysts are currently uncertain but the capacity available will allow for this type of growth potential moving forward The other major wrinkle is the contrasting macroeconomic data that continues to hamper broader markets While many agree that ecommerce is leading the retail charge poor results from traditional retailers and manufacturers combined with global growth uncertainties has weighed strongly on markets to the downside Nonetheless a PE ratio at times earnings provides investors with a potential return near percent at the low end and up to percent Irrespective of market uncertainties they are always present Air Transport is ripe for its valuation PE multiple to breakout This may occur within the next year to months as the market seems to think that the runup to over share was ahead of the companys prospects We all must remember that the market has a very shortterm memory so not focusing can lose sight of potential For these reasons investors looking to profit from Air Transport should pay strict attention to growth in the CAM ACMI service and all other revenue segments and segment earnings margins Air Transport provides a unique business model which has been highly successful since the mids through the companys customer relationships with DHL among other freight customers and the US military <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has embarked on utilizing this model to provide stronger synergies with its AFS strategies The opportunities ahead are exciting and the potential for growth is robust Investors should make sure to monitor the connections between revenue growth and margin impacts Air Transport has a history of reducing portions of its revenue to incentivize its customers to do more business with the companys most profitable CAM segment However it remains to be seen whether a new customer such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will see these structures in the same light Any reduced profitability for the sake of revenue growth will not necessarily be as strong of a catalyst To this point there are justifications why analysts remain optimistic but slightly cautious Investors willing to take the risk over the next few years should be prepared to fully understand Air Transports business model in order to assess this performance Rewards do not come without risks and if Air Transport executes and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>grows into the freighter aircraft leases over time stock price appreciation will have followed suit nicely This is the focus for investors as this weeks
