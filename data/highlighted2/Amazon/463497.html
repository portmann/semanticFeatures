class='textDiv'>Have Investors Missed Their Chance On <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Amazons huge run up in price questions whether Wall Street overlooked this one or if it is now in overvalued territory At the current valuation I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is trading at a slight premium and expect and plateau andor correction While I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a longterm winner in the year investor span those looking months ahead may want to wait for a correction on this one As you can see from the chart below <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN has been on a huge run up with total returns of over the last years The company has proven to be a dominant force consistently increasing their sheer size through huge revenue growth However as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has seen triple digit growth in their valuation investors may not be so motivated any more to jump on the bandwagon that feels like it has already passed them I think this is the hardest part for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>bulls and bears to wrap their heads around The bulls are focused on topline valuation multiples and the bears are focused on bottom line valuation multiples Across the topline <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is trading at a price to sales ratio of and across the bottom line they are trading at a price to earnings of The problem is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a large industry leader and yet still a large growth stock which makes valuing their equity troublesome A X revenue multiple is actually not high given the companys growth rate however a PE of seems high for the investors seeking value in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>I think the truth lies somewhere in the middle of the bulls and the bears Below Ive outlined a quick year DCF which uses a discount rate and terminal growth rate As you can see I have Amazons equity valued at about billion This is model is far from perfect rather I created it to get an idea of where I would feel comfortable investing in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>This would imply a downside However we pay premium prices for premium companies and I do believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>falls into that category With that said I do feel like is a premium I probably wouldnt feel comfortable paying today A double digit premium like that would add too much risk to this type of investment in my opinion If a company grows at a significant rate or produces big cash flow on their assets then most investors dont really place much importance on their balance sheet However while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has shown strong growth they havent shown us great ROA or ROE As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>stock is up since stockholders equity has increased Fortunately <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>carries a small amount of debt of only billion in longterm debt which places their debtequity ratio at only Right now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is moving along with sufficient capital to meet their short term financing needs however I would imagine a need to increase their debt position within the next year or for capital expenditures and in order to keep a strong liquidity position Their current ratio sits at which is not traditionally a good ratio but is good enough for a thinned margin company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Overall Amazons balance sheet has a lot of strength however not from a valuation standpoint When the market values their equity at billion it makes the price to book ratio of seem a bit worrisome Typically its easy for investors to wrap their heads around paying that kind of money for a wellestablished company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>if they still maintain strong growth and have a good track record of strong ROA and operating margins Unfortunately <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has only shined along their topline which could result in a weakening balance sheet in the future However Amazons current market cap is valued by their future earnings potential Most investors see big ROA and ROE in the future which explains the high valuation multiple to their book value but nevertheless it is an added risk to this specific investment Amazons valuation has been consistently outgrowing their actual growth by leaps I think most people would agree that at a certain point the stock would have to either hit a plateau or a correction I would imagine that phase would come sooner than later for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Wall Streets estimates will not be easy hurdles for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to outshine and push their stock price that much further up EPS estimates for are and for up to with some estimates over Hitting these bottom line estimates and keeping large growth along their topline wont be an easy task and given Amazons PE and PB ratios I would imagine a poor earnings report could result in decent amount of volatility on the downside <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has had an incredible run up in price and there is no way for me to say whether or not it will stop but it should certainly slowdown from here I see this stock trading at a premium today but I also see huge growth on the horizon for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>which can justify the small premium to many investors Investors looking for a stock over a or year span will probably find <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as an attractive investment as I believe this is a longterm winner However if investors are looking at a month timeline I would wait for a correction on this one Disclosure Iwe have no
