( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's huge run up in price questions whether Wall Street overlooked this one , or if it is now in overvalued territory . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At the current valuation , I <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is trading at a slight premium and expect and plateau and/or correction . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While I believe <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a long-term winner in the 5-10 year investor span , those looking 12 months ahead <b>may</b> want to wait for a correction on this one . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>As you can see from the chart below , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) has been on a huge run up , with total returns of 245 % over the last 5 years . The company has proven to be a dominant force consistently increasing their sheer size through huge revenue growth.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has seen triple digit growth in their valuation , investors <b>may</b> not be so motivated any <i>more</i> to jump on the bandwagon that feels like it has already passed them . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I think this is the hardest part for the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> bulls and bears to wrap their heads around . The bulls are focused on topline valuation multiples and the bears are focused on bottom line valuation multiples.Across the topline , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is trading at a price to sales ratio of 3.1 and across the bottom line they are trading at a price to earnings of 304 . The problem is that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a large industry leader and yet still a large growth stock , which makes valuing their equity troublesome . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A 3.1 X revenue multiple is actually not high given the company 's growth rate , however a PE of 304 <b>seems</b> high for the investors seeking value in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think the truth lies <b>somewhere</b> in the middle of the bulls and the bears .  (Uncertainty) </span>Below I've outlined a quick 10 year DCF, which uses a 10% discount rate and 5% terminal growth rate.As you can see , I have <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's equity valued at about $ 300 billion . This is model is far from perfect , rather I created it to get an idea of where I would feel comfortable investing in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . This would imply a 13-14% downside.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , we pay premium prices for premium companies , and I do <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> falls into that category . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With that said , I do feel like 13-14 % is a premium I <b>probably</b> would n't feel comfortable paying today .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A double digit premium like that would add too much <b>risk</b> to this type of investment in my opinion .  (Uncertainty) </span>If a company grows at a significant rate or produces big cash flow on their assets, then most investors don't really place much importance on their balance sheet.However , while <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has shown strong growth , they have n't shown us great ROA or ROE . As <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stock is up 325 % since 2012 , stockholders ' equity has increased 90 % . Fortunately , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> carries a small amount of debt of only $ 8.2 billion in long-term debt , which places their debt/equity ratio at only 0.6 . Right now <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is moving along with sufficient capital to meet their short term financing needs , however I would imagine a need to increase their debt position within the next year or 2 for capital expenditures and in order to keep a strong liquidity position . Their current ratio sits at 1.08 , which is not traditionally a good ratio , but is good enough for a thinned margin company like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Overall , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's balance sheet has a lot of strength , however not from a valuation standpoint . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When the market values their equity at $ 347 billion , it makes the price to book ratio of 23.7 seem a bit <b>worrisome</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Typically , it 's easy for investors to wrap their heads around paying that kind of money for a well-established company like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> if they still maintain strong growth and have a good track record of strong ROA and operating margins . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Unfortunately , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has only shined along their topline , which <b>could</b> result in a weakening balance sheet in the future . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>However , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's current market cap is valued by their future earnings potential . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Most investors see big ROA and ROE in the future , which explains the high valuation multiple to their book value , but nevertheless , it is an added <b>risk</b> to this specific investment .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's valuation has been consistently outgrowing their actual growth by leaps . I think most people would agree that at a certain point the stock would have to either hit a plateau or a correction.I would imagine that phase would come sooner than later for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Wall Street 's estimates will not be easy hurdles for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to outshine and push their stock price that much <i>further</i> up . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>EPS estimates for 2016 are 5.37 and for 2018 up to 17.61, with some estimates over 21.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Hitting these bottom line estimates and keeping large growth along their topline wo n't be an easy task , and given <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's PE and PB ratios , I would imagine a poor earnings report could result in decent amount of <b>volatility</b> on the downside . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has had an incredible run up in price and there is no way for me to say whether or not it will stop , but it should certainly slowdown from here . I see this stock trading at a premium today , but I also see huge growth on the horizon for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , which can justify the small premium to many investors . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Investors looking for a stock over a 5 or 10-year span will probably find <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> as an attractive investment , as I <b>believe</b> this is a long-term winner . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , if investors are looking at a 12-month timeline , I would wait for a correction on this one .
