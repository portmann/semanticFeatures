You can easily imagine a situation where customers have several subscriptions (I have Netflix, HBO and Fox), so it is not necessarily the case that customers will choose one over the other.But the key is if Netflix will continue to produce quality content that will make customers renew their subscription, there are no guarantees there.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do <b>believe</b> , however , that Netflix carries a bit of an advantage currently as it has the best software and apps for most smart TVs , something HBO and Fox Play is lagging behind .  (Uncertainty) </span>I think that Netflix is a great company, but it is very highly priced.Netflix valuation right now is a house of cards since small changes in growth numbers will have the perceived effect of nudging down future earnings significantly.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The valuation shows a very <b>optimistic</b> bias that will only be valid if current linear extrapolations do come true and Netflix is able to produce superior content for a long time compared to its competitors .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Raising subscription prices heavily <b>seems</b> like a dangerous game because competitors are setting their prices in the same range .  (Uncertainty) </span>Answering or estimating correctly the questions posed in episode 1 is the key to give a correct valuation for Netflix.Small changes in the growth outlook will have dramatic consequences for the share price.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It seems like a stock mostly suited for short-term <b>speculative</b> plays .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , consolidation in the streaming business might be a game changer that <b>could</b> increase pricing power .
