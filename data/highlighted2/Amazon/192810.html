As we can see, Netflix's net income is nothing to write home about.As they constantly have to invest in new content, whether that be in the form of licensed or original, the income statement is lumpy and a C+ report card.Netflix's cash flow statement is a joke and, as we can see, they don't generate free cash flow, even with 65 million users.The U.S. streaming and DVD businesses are nice gross margin contributors.However, the International business isn't compelling from a financial standpoint, as Netflix hasn't been able to gain the same economies of scale compared to the U.S. and each country is nuanced and presents different challenges.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> , rightly so , Netflix is guarded with providing granular international performance .  (Uncertainty) </span>Mr. Hastings said that backing out currency and new VAT tax headwinds, Netflix's pricing competitiveness is similar to its low-price model in the U.S.At $111 per share, I wouldn't touch Netflix with a ten-foot pole on the long side.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given the persistent threats of expensive content , the company does n't own the broadband networks ( but are data hogs even more so with HD and premium services ) , and increased competition from the likes of AMZN , Hulu , HBO Now , and cable , buying share at $ 111 is super <b>risky</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix's $47 billion enterprise value for a company that doesn't generate any free cash flow is a classic 'greater fool' theory.If investors are comfortable gambling their hard-earned money pretending that the only thing that matters is subscriber growth, then good luck.I will be watching from the sidelines.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
