(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Despite its 65 million subscribers and 5-6 million yearly net subscriber adds, Netflix doesn't generate free cash flow.Expensive content, competition, and the fact that Netflix is a data hog are major structural issues.I was asked by a reader to evaluate Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ).Given my own intrigue about Netflix and its valuation, this was the catalyst for me to research the company.Similar to my recent Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) piece, the aim of this article is to help readers understand the bet they are making owning shares at $111.I have no horse in the race and will not participate on the long or short side.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If effective , this piece will synthesize and present the key drivers , so investors are fully aware of the <b>risks</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Wall Street is captivated by monthly subscriber revenue streams, especially when they are growing nicely.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As long as Netflix can continue to grow its user base , which is 65 million as of June 30 , 2015 ( 42 million U.S. and 23 million International ) , then momentum crowd will <b>probably</b> continue to own shares .  (Uncertainty) </span>Despite Netflix's lack of free cash flow and nose-bleed valuation, again Wall Street is myopically geared towards growth.On the Q2 2015 conference call, sell-side analysts continued to discuss Netflix's stated goal of achieving 90 million global subscribers ( here is the transcript ).Mr. Hastings repeatedly reiterated the goal of targeting 5 to 6 million new net subscribers per year.It is well known that Netflix's affordable monthly pricing is one of the key reasons it has so many subscribers.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>ASP growth is 5 % YoY , but this was driven by a <i>higher</i> mix of premium subscribers .  (Surprise) </span>Mr. Hastings said the company will not get greedy and raise prices.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Clearly , he knows that the lynchpin to Netflix 's stock <b>buoyancy</b> is subscriber growth , so he is n't going to gamble .  (Uncertainty) </span>On the call he also said that the VAT tax and currency were headwinds.Interestingly, he talking about Hulu's flop in Japan and how it was led by overly aggressive pricing, leading to lack of traction.These comments and competition limit Netflix's ability to raise prices.This is definitely a negative and hurts the bull's longer-term thesis.The key driver of Netflix's future success is really its ability to generate compelling original content.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Although this model is <i>more</i> capital intensive initially , it is Netflix 's most-important longer-term competitive advantage .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix has done a much <i>better</i> job in this area , and House of Cards was the key catalyst that helped Carl Icahn make 10X his money buying shares before the successful launch .  (Surprise) </span>This new business model fundamentally shifted the way analysts viewed Netflix, and it is clearly a barrier to entry if the company can continue to execute well on this front.Mr. Hastings indicated that the company is investing heavily and casting a wide net trying to appeal to all demographic, ages, by targeting different genres.The Achilles heel to the Netflix story is two-fold: they don't own the broadband pipelines that stream their services (the last mile is owned by the cable companies).As we can see in the chart below, Netflix is a broadband hog.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even <i>more</i> so with its premium HD services , which required 15 mb per second to stream .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Although the consolidation by the likes of AT&T ( NYSE : T ) and DirectTV ( NASDAQ : DTV ) as well as the proposed Time Warner Cable ( NYSE : TWC ) and Charter ( NASDAQ : CHTR ) deal offer the prospect of <i>lower</i> interconnection fees ( as concessions to winning the FCC approval ) , if Netflix is using 36 % of internet bandwidth , then there is always the <b>risk</b> that the Comcasts ( NASDAQ : CMCSA ) of the world will want to get paid fairly for Netflix 's high utilization of other company 's broadband bandwidth capacity .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>And secondly, Netflix's content is very expensive.Unlike other businesses that require massive upfront amounts of capital (acting as a huge barrier to entry) and know-how, with the long-term goal of then transforming into cash cows after build-out, Netflix is constantly running on a never-ending treadmill.Besides its original content, the company has to pay licensing fees for the content.As discussed on the call, other content owners are no longer interested in limiting themselves to multiple-year exclusives.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , Hulu , the threat of cable <i>more</i> so in other countries , and HBO Now , content will become <i>more</i> expensive as there are <i>more</i> bidders . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>As we can see, Netflix's net income is nothing to write home about.As they constantly have to invest in new content, whether that be in the form of licensed or original, the income statement is lumpy and a C+ report card.Netflix's cash flow statement is a joke and, as we can see, they don't generate free cash flow, even with 65 million users.The U.S. streaming and DVD businesses are nice gross margin contributors.However, the International business isn't compelling from a financial standpoint, as Netflix hasn't been able to gain the same economies of scale compared to the U.S. and each country is nuanced and presents different challenges.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> , rightly so , Netflix is guarded with providing granular international performance .  (Uncertainty) </span>Mr. Hastings said that backing out currency and new VAT tax headwinds, Netflix's pricing competitiveness is similar to its low-price model in the U.S.At $111 per share, I wouldn't touch Netflix with a ten-foot pole on the long side.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Given the persistent threats of expensive content , the company does n't own the broadband networks ( but are data hogs even <i>more</i> so with HD and premium services ) , and increased competition from the likes of AMZN , Hulu , HBO Now , and cable , buying share at $ 111 is super <b>risky</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix 's $ 47 billion enterprise value for a company that does n't generate any free cash flow is a classic ` <i>greater</i> fool ' theory .  (Surprise) </span>If investors are comfortable gambling their hard-earned money pretending that the only thing that matters is subscriber growth, then good luck.I will be watching from the sidelines.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
