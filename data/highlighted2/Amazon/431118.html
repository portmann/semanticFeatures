Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Yahoo is currently the subject of a swirling debate over its value.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I will attempt to provide a <i>clearer</i> picture of what the company is actually worth over the next few segments .  (Surprise) </span>I will be unpacking the true worth of Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) as we delve deep into the depths of a very complicated situation.In the first part, I will be taking an overarching view of it, and trying to come up with a 5 mile high perspective of it.In the second, I will be coming up with a valuation of the core Yahoo business, the point of contention for most Yahoo investors right now.In the third, I will be talking about the tax implications of Yahoo's attempts to unlock its value without paying any taxes.Yahoo as we know it today is not the great internet giant of old, with its ubiquitous Yahoo! Landing page and search engine and mail service.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Today it 's <i>more</i> of a hodgepodge of <b>random</b> stakes and odd things that its CEOs have thrown together over the years mixed with its core internet business .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>And that is where is the problem with Yahoo today, that it is such a massive thing made up of disparate parts.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Different investors want <b>exposure</b> to different parts of Yahoo .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A person who might want to buy the core Yahoo business might not want exposure to Alibaba , since they <b>may</b> think Alibaba is overvalued .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A person who <b>might</b> want to buy the Alibaba stake <b>might</b> not want to buy the core Yahoo business because they think it 's basically a zombie at this point .  (Uncertainty) </span>And all of those viewpoints are valid!The market is a weight mechanism in the long run, and companies have to bend to the will of the market.So we'll come up with a full accounting of what Yahoo's true worth is here with a sum of the parts valuation.Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ): Yahoo has a 15% stake in the Chinese e-commerce and e-verything giant, and at current market prices, this is worth $28.2 billion.We can debate this further at another time, as I am sure some think Alibaba is overvalued, as there are some who think it is undervalued, but the point of this exercise is to see what the market would value Yahoo in a rational way.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is not adjusting for taxes , because currently , with the way that the sale of Yahoo is being structured , there <b>probably</b> wo n't be any taxes involved .  (Uncertainty) </span>Yahoo Japan: Yahoo has a 35.5% stake in Yahoo Japan.Yahoo Japan is not the Yahoo we know in the West.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Yahoo Japan has been a lot <i>more</i> successful , and is a conglomerate in its own right , with a sort of Japanese eBay , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and other assorted ventures under it . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>It was originally a joint venture with Softbank, a Japanese telecommunications conglomerate, and has grown to a $30 billion company today.At current market prices, this is worth about $10 billion.Essentially by adding up these two stakes, not even including the cash and other assorted things, Yahoo is worth $38 billion.Yahoo also has $5 billion in net cash, after subtracting for debt and added to the net worth pile, Yahoo is worth $43 billion.As seen here, there is very clear upside, and we get to this valuation without even tangling with the complicated valuation of Yahoo's core business in Part 2.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Stay tuned for <i>more</i> info .
