(Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Demand <b>seems</b> robust as demanding use cases have cropped up over the years .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The market has expanded in response to <i>more</i> powerful parts , which is counter intuitive .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Intel 's ( NASDAQ : INTC ) Data Center Group <b>seems</b> to be on the right track .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In fact , it 's the only division that seems to be getting it right these days as the various other segments have under performed due to competitive issues or market <b>dependent</b> issues .  (Uncertainty) </span>The stock has already responded to the weakness in PC fundamentals, and should eventually find some support on the back of reassuring comments from management on DCG and ongoing developments in the data storage space.I reviewed the Q&A session of Jason Waxman (DCG Group Vice President), which can be accessed on Intel's Investor Relations website.The conference got through a lot of pertinent information, which helped me to further understand the durability of earnings going forward.I can't cover everything, but I'm going to cover the three most pertinent points that surfaced throughout the conference call.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Intel 's DCG <b>may</b> run on a tick tock cycle whereas PCCG will run on tick tock tock .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This makes sense , because server chips have <i>higher</i> margins , and the initial ramp of a new process node tends to compress gross margins due to less-than-optimal yields .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So , pushing the server chips into a <i>more</i> advanced node will sustain Intel 's competitive advantage without impacting margins as significantly .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This gives Intel time to <b>optimize</b> for 10nm on the server side , and develop <i>more</i> advanced architecture on the consumer side .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>By the time consumer chips reach 10 nm Intel will be able to maximize wafer production , and conversion of 14nm capacity to 10 nm will be <i>less</i> cost intensive .  (Surprise) </span>The acquisition of Altera will give Intel the ability to create a truly comprehensive platform for co-processors and GPGPUs.For algorithms that are repetitive in nature, i.e. file compressions, crypto currency mining and various other compute heavy tasks that are heavily repetitive, FPGAs fill in the hole.Furthermore, the energy efficiency, and the ability to scale the FPGAs is a huge selling point for top cloud vendors.The companies looking to implement FPGAs are at the cutting edge , so think in terms of Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) , Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) , IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) , Hewlett-Packard ( NYSE : HPQ ) , Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . The performance advantage of a fully integrated platform has left alternative server ecosystems dead in the water i.e. ARM based servers.Intel doesn't see meaningful deceleration in chip volumes even as reports indicate that the top cloud vendors are expected to reduce capex growth pertaining to data centers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> , demand is coming from alternative sources ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The growth rate in DCG <b>seems</b> to have held up pretty well , which speaks volumes about the demanding computing needs that are being offloaded onto servers rather than being run on PCs .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Ideally Intel should have had a robust PCCG and DCG business , but at least mobile growth comes accompanied with <i>more</i> demanding data center usage on the back-end .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>To conclude , Intel is in a position of strength in the data center space , and I do n't <b>anticipate</b> competitors to encroach upon those <i>higher</i> power envelopes .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Intel has <b>optimized</b> its server CPU architecture over the years .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The simplicity of a cloud build out using Xeon CPUs and the <i>better</i> total cost of ownership has mitigated much of the hype presented by alternative platforms .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Therefore , the high growth nature of the business and the mix-shift to higher-margin SKUs across server class-CPUs keeps me <b>optimistic</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, I didn't see any shift in prior financial guidance throughout the conference call, therefore, I continue to reiterate my $31.10 price target.I'm also reiterating my hold rating.Source: Intel's Saving Grace: The Data Center Group Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .
