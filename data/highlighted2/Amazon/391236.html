AMZN's decision to unbundle the Prime annual service is a clear move to drive the adoption of its two-day unlimited free shipping service.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As for Prime Video , the platform has certainly improved significantly over the past years and some could argue <b>may</b> be comparable to Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>Unbundling these services allows AMZN to gain broader penetration among the consumers so that its presence is not limited by the adoption of its annual Prime membership.Similarly for Apple, iPhone and its other hardware limit the adoption of AAPL service and its ecosystem, and therefore needs to be unbundled if the company seeks long-term preservation of its ecosystem.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Short Ideas, Technology , Personal Computers</div></body></html>
