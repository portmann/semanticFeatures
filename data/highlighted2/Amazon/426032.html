The other six were all children series and that shouldn't go unnoticed.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Although for now , I want to focus on Netflix because its additions to its kids slate have made <i>more</i> of a substantial impact ( for the moment ) .  (Surprise) </span>For example, last week, Netflix revealed it had signed a deal for Julie's Greenroom, a new series starring film legend Julie Andrews and produced by the iconic Jim Henson Company.The show follows Andrews as she guides her "greenies" (aka puppet kids) through the process of creating a show.Each episode looks at a different form of theater, while featuring an original song and a guest spot by a fellow top-tier celeb.In addition to it being a clever concept, Greenroom also has aspects that appeals to both kids and their parents.This is taking that need for kids programming and thinking outside the box.Again, it's all about the overall added value but it doesn't have to just come from in-house ideas.For some strange reason, that Paramount (NYSE: VIA ) still hasn't really explained, the studio decided not to release its animated update of the classic The Little Prince.What makes it odd was that the decision was made just weeks before it was scheduled to hit theaters.It is rare (even unheard of) for that to happen so late in the game.Although that freed up Netflix to then swoop in and rescue the film, which will start to stream in August.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While this is not the first time Netflix has acquired content , it <b>may</b> be the first time Netflix has done so under these circumstances .  (Uncertainty) </span>The last time a move close to this happened was when Netflix saved Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt from NBC's midseason roster.The difference is that was a TV series and it was never in danger of not airing.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It was just determined the show would be <i>better</i> off on the streamer .  (Surprise) </span>Here, this is a film that was tossed away and rescued from the scrap heap.Of course, Netflix didn't do this just because of the headlines (though those helped), it did it because it saw a good deal.For a small sum, Netflix got to pick up an internationally successful film aimed at an important demo with a voice cast of big name actors and debut it in the States.Both Greenhouse and Prince also have crossover appeal and that played a large role in the decision-making process, but regardless, you don't see other mainstream outlets making this much of an effort to cater to this demo.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix also has that bridge area covered with Full House spin-off Fuller House , but while appealing to tweens is also imperative to success , the reason for Fuller 's importance goes <i>deeper</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Fuller House and the Ashton Kutcher/Danny Masterson sitcom The Ranch represent the first multi-camera series for the network.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For those <b>unfamiliar</b> , multi-camera series are taped in front of a studio audience and usually come with a built-in laugh track .  (Uncertainty) </span>Think Seinfeld, Friends, The Big Bang Theory, etc.To date Netflix had been focused on, and had great success with, single-camera projects such as Kimmy Schmidt, Grace and Frankie and (to some extent) Orange Is The New Black, but the network recognized it needed to expand out.For Netflix to remain competitive it needed series of all types, just like ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, etc.Now the network has proven it can succeed in both ventures, with Fuller House and The Ranch both getting second season pickups.These renewals also come despite some amazingly bad reviews, but Netflix series are essentially critic-proof.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Speaking of critics the other area that Netflix has ventured into is the world of talk shows ; for <i>better</i> or <i>worse</i> .  (Surprise) </span>The addition of Chelsea Handler to the roster gives the streamer its own version of a late-night talker.While Chelsea is still finding its way creatively, you have to give Netflix credit for it existing in the space in the first place.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Handler is a big name and <i>more</i> importantly a smart name for Netflix to be in business with for its first entry into this crowded market space .  (Surprise) </span>Despite its showrunner shipping off just three weeks into its run, investors shouldn't be circling the wagons.Netflix is trying something new and as its executive team has shown in the past, it will give a project every chance to find its place.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Some shows need <i>more</i> time to succeed and given Handler likes to play by her own rules , it stands to reason Chelsea would need some time to get on its feet .  (Surprise) </span>The overall point I'm trying to make here is that all of the above has happened in the last five months.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That 's an insane amount of ground to cover in such a small period of time but Netflix 's large spends on content makes it <b>possible</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Critics <b>may</b> fault the giant for that approach , but remember Netflix has essentially been playing catch-up from the beginning .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It had to start off with the <i>bigger</i> and <i>more</i> costly draws like Arrested Development and House of Cards in order to lure subscribers .  (Surprise) </span>Now that they have them, they have to keep them.Kids programming, multi-camera shows and late night/talk shows are all areas normal networks have to pay attention to in order to succeed.Netflix knew that but was able to take its time to roll them out at a pace that suits them.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix has always been about the long-term <i>bigger</i> picture , and so far this year , you can see that is clearly still the goal .
