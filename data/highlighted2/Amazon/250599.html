class='textDiv'>Happy Workers are Productive Workers GDP is the measure of productivity that determines the overall health of the economy A Nobel laureate economist once said Productivity isnt everything but in the long run it is almost everything A countrys ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker At the individual company level productivity determines which companies succeed and which ones fail In todays ultracompetitive business environment every single business that hopes to survive and thrive seeks to improve the productivity of its workforce Assuming all else technology resources etc is equal what differentiates one competing company from the next Productivity Given that productivity is the holy grail for businesses more of it is always in demand But there seems to be two dramatically divergent philosophies and practices in corporate America on how to manufacture that productivity growth And they can be distilled down to this The examples on the fear side are plenty Amazons employee practices have recently received a lot of negative publicity because they prescribe to the fear dogma At <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>if you dont give your entire life to the company you wont survive Employees at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>are expected to work hour weeks never take real unplugged vacations respond to emails at all hours of the night work weekends and sabotage the careers of their coworkers in order to save their own job <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is on the far left of the managing by fear or happiness spectrum but fear is the way a majority of companies lead their workforce If youre looking for evidence look no further than the reasons why Americans dont take of the paid vacation days they are given and are working while on vacation Only of those reasons are not based in fear And even the three that arent complete dedication to company want a promotion want a pay raise probably have a deeper root cause that is based in fear ie fear of not having enough money status perception or fear of getting fired Americans are overworked and stressed out the most shared article Ive ever written by no coincidence and much of the reason is because we work in constant fear Employermanufactured fear is killing us Maybe this is why over of Americans want to be selfemployed What about fears alternative happiness What is the impact of happiness on productivity Well I think if you asked employees of companies that frequently make best companies to work for lists youll find very few corporate cultures driven by fear And these are some of the most successful and productive companies on the planet Anecdotally speaking Ive worked in both environments sometimes even within the same company and I can unequivocally say I have been dramatically more productive under teams and managers that have led by focusing on happiness than those that have led by fear Ask yourself which environment has made you more productive A new worker happiness and productivity study found a huge impact on productivity when workers are happy The study found that Workers that were given perks that led to happiness productivity increased by an average of and reached as high as above the control group Lower happiness is systematically associated with lower productivity Dr Daniel Sgroi the author of the report noted that in regards to GDP and economic growth Having scientific support for generating happinessproductivity cycles within the workforce should help managers to justify workpractices aimed at boosting happiness on productivity grounds But lets take this exercise step further VWs dieselgate Amazons expose Comcasts awful customer service commonly rated the worst in America and well publicized travesties such as Enron BP Countrywide Financial Toyota software GM ignition switch Bear Sterns Lehman Brothers and Tyco led to broke unhappy and in extreme cases even dead employees shareholders and customers In every example had management led with anything other than a culture of fear each tragic outcome could have been greatly reduced or avoided altogether In Amazons case I think its fair to question whether Amazons success is because they lead by fear or in spite of it Maybe just maybe having a massive firstmover advantage in online retail that started with the advent of the internet and not a fearful workplace is the ultimate driver of their success Employers need to consider that the best employees arent going to put up with being led by fear They can and will go elsewhere leaving you with nothing but inexperienced fearful underperformers with limited mobility prospects Nothing kills productivity like high turnover Leading by fear can occasionally lead to positive shortterm productivity gains Over the longterm it almost never does and can completely gut a company from the inside out If you are part of a management team that leads by fear you need to realize that there are better more effective kinder ways to get the same or better results When youre laying on your deathbed are you going to look back at your career and legacy and think You know I wish I had really installed more fear in my employees Its time to take a stand I am
