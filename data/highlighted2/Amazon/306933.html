'' <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>( note that our potential return for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has come down <b>somewhat</b> since that article , but is still well above the potential return shown for NFLX ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Let's look now at how our Netflix hedge has held up during the stock's recent slide.Below, we show the original January 15th NFLX hedge and how it has cushioned the blow for hedged NFLX shareholders since.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>A <i>Closer</i> Look At The January 15th NFLX Hedge The <b>optimal</b> collar below , calculated using the Portfolio Armor iOS app , was designed to limit an investor 's downside to a drawdown of no <i>more</i> than 7 % by mid-June , while capping his potential upside at 5 % .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As we noted in our previous Netflix article , the potential return we had for it at the time was 3.5 % , but since we could raise the cap to 5 % without increasing the cost of the <b>optimal</b> collar , we used a 5 % cap .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Note that the cost of the <b>optimal</b> collar above was negative , meaning the investor would have received <i>more</i> income from selling the call leg of his collar than he spent to buy the put leg .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>How That Hedge Has Responded To NFLX's Drop Here is an updated quote on the put leg of the collar as of 1/29.And here is an updated quote on the call leg: How That Hedge Protected Against NFLX's Drop NFLX closed at $104.04 on Friday, January 15th.A shareholder who owned 1000 shares of it and opened the collar above then had $104,040 in the stock plus $10,550 in puts, and if he wanted to buy-to-close his short call position, he would have needed to pay $12,500 to do that.So, his net position value for NFLX on January 15th was ($104,040 + $10,550) - $12,500 = $102,090.NFLX closed at $91.84 on Friday, January 29th, down 11.7% from its closing price on January 15th.The investor's shares were worth $91,840 as of 1/29 and his put options were worth $13,120, and if he wanted to close out the short call leg of his collar, it would have cost him $5,000.So: ($91,840 + $13,120) - $5,000 = $99,960.This represents a 2% drop from $102,090.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Although NFLX had dropped by 11.7 % at the time of the calculations above , and the investor 's hedge was designed to limit him to a loss of no <i>more</i> than 7 % , he was actually down only 2 % on his combined hedge plus underlying stock position by this point .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Courses Of Action For Hedged Netflix Investors As of Friday , an NFLX investor hedged with the collar above had several <b>possible</b> courses of action available to him , among them these : If bearish , exit his position ( stock + hedge ) with a 2 % loss .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If <i>more</i> bearish , do the same as the above , except hold on to the put leg of the collar , as a bet against the stock .  (Surprise) </span>If neutral to bullish, stay the course.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If <i>more</i> bullish , buy-to-close the call leg of the collar to eliminate the upside cap .  (Surprise) </span>The one course of action there we would hold off on for now is 4.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Even if you are a longer-term bull on NFLX , given its recent price action , we would n't be <b>surprised</b> to see it trade <i>lower</i> in the <i>shorter</i> term .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And if that happens , you 'll likely be able to buy-to-close the call leg for <i>less</i> then .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We 'd <b>probably</b> lean toward option 3 .  (Uncertainty) </span>At this point, not because we're bullish on NFLX (we're not, given the potential return estimate shown above), but because this is a tight hedge (downside limited to 7% from the stock's January 15th price), and it won't expire until well after Netflix's next earnings release.Tagged: ETFs & Portfolio Strategy , Services</div></body></html>
