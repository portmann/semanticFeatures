MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Before Netflixs Q earnings release we posted an optimal collar hedge for it The stock is down since but an investor hedged with that collar would be down We consider a case that compares Netflix unfavorably to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and note that the wisdom of crowds aligns with it Before Netflix NASDAQ NFLX released its fourth quarter earnings we presented a way that shareholders could hedge their downside risk Netflix And Chill Netflix ended up beating Wall Streets consensus earnings estimate handily posting profits of cents per share versus Wall Streets estimate of cents while posting a slight miss on revenue billion for the quarter versus Wall Streets estimate of billion The market had something of a bipolar reaction to Netflixs earnings driving the stock up sharply after hours when the company released its numbers after the close on January th only to take back all those gains in the following days session The stock has slid since down nearly from when we wrote our previous article though an NFLX shareholder hedged with the optimal collar we presented would have only been down by Friday January ths close In this article we consider the stocks prospects going forward update the status of the hedge and discuss possible courses of action for hedged Netflix shareholders A couple of days after Netflix posted its earnings Seeking Alpha contributor Dana Blankenhorn posted his bearish case for the stock Netflix My Short Of The Year In it Blankenhorn referred to the socalled SCurve used to describe the adoption of new technologies A version of it is pictured below image via Mastering the art of Business Planning After noting Netflixs strong fourthquarter results and praising CEO Reed Hastings job of growing the company from a DVD rental operation to a leading TV studio Blankenhorn offered this unfavorable comparison of Netflix to one of its streaming video competitors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN You will ask how can I remain bullish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>yet say short Netflix Its because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a lot more going for it than just the video service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>still doesnt get a huge share of the American retail market the cloud has just begun to hit the numbers and there are service revenues that have just begun to grow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is at the front of the S Netflix is closer to the back end Different analysts can come to different conclusions looking at the same financial results and that was the case with Netflix While Dana Blankenhorn presented the bearish case for the stock on the same day Seeking Alpha contributor Bill Maurer offered a more sanguine take Chill Over Netflix Things Arent That Bad When individual analysts disagree it can be instructive to consider the collective view of a large number of analysts In a previous article Screens To Avoid Bad Investments we referred to what New Yorker columnist James Surowiecki termed the wisdom of crowds Large groups of people are smarter than an elite few no matter how brilliant better at solving problems fostering innovation coming to wise decisions even predicting the future As we noted in that article the wisdom of crowds is what Portfolio Armor taps into when it analyzes securities It listens to the stock market crowd when considering a securitys price action and it listens to the option market crowd when it gauges option sentiment Currently the wisdom of the stock and option crowds as measured by Portfolio Armor supports Blankenhorns take on Netflix versus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the site shows a potential return of for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>versus for Netflix Potential return is our term for a bullish estimate of how a stock or ETF will perform over the next months for an explanation of how we calculate it see our recent article on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Advantage Einhorn note that our potential return for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has come down somewhat since that article but is still well above the potential return shown for NFLX Lets look now at how our Netflix hedge has held up during the stocks recent slide Below we show the original January th NFLX hedge and how it has cushioned the blow for hedged NFLX shareholders since A Closer Look At The January th NFLX Hedge The optimal collar below calculated using the Portfolio Armor iOS app was designed to limit an investors downside to a drawdown of no more than by midJune while capping his potential upside at As we noted in our previous Netflix article the potential return we had for it at the time was but since we could raise the cap to without increasing the cost of the optimal collar we used a cap Note that the cost of the optimal collar above was negative meaning the investor would have received more income from selling the call leg of his collar than he spent to buy the put leg How That Hedge Has Responded To NFLXs Drop Here is an updated quote on the put leg of the collar as of And here is an updated quote on the call leg How That Hedge Protected Against NFLXs Drop NFLX closed at on Friday January th A shareholder who owned shares of it and opened the collar above then had in the stock plus in puts and if he wanted to buytoclose his short call position he would have needed to pay to do that So his net position value for NFLX on January th was NFLX closed at on Friday January th down from its closing price on January th The investors shares were worth as of and his put options were worth and if he wanted to close out the short call leg of his collar it would have cost him So This represents a drop from Although NFLX had dropped by at the time of the calculations above and the investors hedge was designed to limit him to a loss of no more than he was actually down only on his combined hedge plus underlying stock position by this point Courses Of Action For Hedged Netflix Investors As of Friday an NFLX investor hedged with the collar above had several possible courses of action available to him among them these If bearish exit his position stock hedge with a loss If more bearish do the same as the above except hold on to the put leg of the collar as a bet against the stock If neutral to bullish stay the course If more bullish buytoclose the call leg of the collar to eliminate the upside cap The one course of action there we would hold off on for now is Even if you are a longerterm bull on NFLX given its recent price action we wouldnt be surprised to see it trade lower in the shorter term And if that happens youll likely be able to buytoclose the call leg for less then Wed probably lean toward option At this point not because were bullish on NFLX were not given the potential return estimate shown above but because this is a tight hedge downside limited to from the stocks January th price and it wont expire until well after Netflixs next earnings release Tagged ETFs Portfolio Strategy Services </div></body></html>
