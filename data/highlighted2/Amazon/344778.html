Apple now finds itself stuck in the same rut that hit PCs 15 years ago.Remember when Compaq and Dell were highflying stocks?Yes, there was a time when people were thrilled to buy new PCs and closely watched new product launches in the space.Windows XP was released in 2001.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Despite its age , the archaic operating system remained the number two most installed computer operating system as of mid-2015 , with <i>more</i> than 250 million active users .  (Surprise) </span>For a product that stopped being standard in 2006, that's simply breathtaking.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>At that point , <i>less</i> than one year ago , XP still had <i>more</i> users than Windows 8 and 8.1 combined .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And it had <i>more</i> than four times as many users as the top-installed Mac operating system .  (Surprise) </span>Once products stop being innovative, people only upgrade when their prior version stops powering up entirely.Hardly any regular consumers care when Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) updates Windows anymore, except in cases such as 8 where the new version was a fiasco at launch.Apple will likely still dominate the upper-end smartphone market in five years.They still run the MP3 player market now.Unfortunately, the MP3 player has collapsed to the point of virtual irrelevance.The tablet is quickly heading there as well.What happens to Apple when Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and Xiaomi offer sub-$200 smartphones that do everything today's phones can do?Since Jobs' passing, Apple has stopped making products that are cultural touchstones.Commoditization and Moore's Law will do the rest of the work in returning Apple from its pedestal to becoming just another tech company.Now sure, Apple still generates a gargantuan amount of cash.Its smartphone business will erode over time, rather than dropping off a cliff.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company <b>may</b> become a master innovator again ( though it 's looking increasingly questionable ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are ways where an Apple investment <b>could</b> work .  (Uncertainty) </span>But you have a very high bar for the world's largest company to outperform the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's difficult for very large firms to put up respectable revenue growth rates due to their <b>startling</b> size .  (Surprise) </span>Apple is showing that it is struggling to find the next big thing.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Without that next big thing , it 's a solid bet to underperform the <i>broader</i> stock market going forward .  (Surprise) </span>When I hear people saying it's a no-brainer long for conservative retirement portfolios, I get ugly flashbacks to Kinder Morgan and Gilead.Japanese bonds have long been viewed as a perfect short.Very smart people have been made to look foolish for many years now touting short Japan as a bulletproof concept.So I think many of us have become inoculated to the short Japanese debt trade.It's one of those wonky ideas that sounds good, but simply doesn't work, based on the last 8+ years of evidence.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That said , the situation is rapidly transforming into something even <i>more</i> bonkers in recent weeks .  (Surprise) </span>Please take a moment to reflect on this chart of Japanese 40-year bond yields: As you can see, the 40-year bond traded between 1.2% and 2.2% for the past 4 years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is a very low interest rate , and there was a good deal of <b>volatility</b> in there .  (Uncertainty) </span>Still, keep in mind the change in price required to generate a move.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Over that span , the yield never fell by <i>more</i> than half .  (Surprise) </span>However, since December '15, the yield has fallen by two-thirds!The former 1.5% rate has gotten cut to a truly paltry 0.5%.I'm hesitant to use the word "bubble" as it comes to treasury bonds.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>People have been discussing a potential bond bubble in the US since I was in middle school and no pop has come yet ; it 's one of those concepts that <b>seems</b> prone to hype .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That said , we <b>may</b> actually have a bubble here , as far as Japan goes .  (Uncertainty) </span>A bubble, broadly defined, is when people pay rapidly escalating prices for assets that have zero or an infinitesimal chance of providing reasonable returns.This 40-year Japanese paper pays a 0.5% yield.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> you do n't reinvest interest , your starting $ 10,000 would throw off $ 50 a year in interest , adding up to a princely $ 2,000 at maturity in 2056 .  (Uncertainty) </span>The 10-year yield is into the negative, you lose money holding it.Now, let's ask ourselves, is there any rational outcome where you'd want to own Japanese government bonds that yield 0.5% for a commitment of 40 years?<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>( <b>Assume</b> you ca n't sell early , otherwise your investment thesis is '' <i>greater</i> fool '' which is a mainstay of bubble thinking ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In a Japan goes into and then stays submerged in a ( <i>deeper</i> ) recession scenario , the bonds likely eventually default .  (Surprise) </span>Yes, the debt is owed to itself, mostly, as people love to say.But there would be massive societal repercussions if the Japanese government robs its savers to fund the debt.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the Japanese ca n't get the economy turned around over the next 40-year span , it 's quite unlikely the government will still be solvent by year 2056 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Before you write this off as far-fetched, the current Japanese economic downturn has been running for 25 years now.And the same unrelentingly negative demographic situation continues to weigh heavily today.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the upside , let 's suppose a technological breakthrough , <b>sudden</b> permissive attitude toward immigration or other such fortunate event gets the economy solidly back toward economic growth .  (Uncertainty) </span>In this case, inflation should also pick up.Even if it gets back to just 2%, your 0.5%-yielding bond is a gigantic loser.Once you get as far as 40 years out, it's hard to see a scenario where Japan doesn't either go into a deflationary default spiral, or things start to perk up, triggering inflation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The government <b>could</b> also try monetizing the debt with money printing , which would cause your 0.5 % bonds to get crushed by inflation without necessarily even helping the economy .  (Uncertainty) </span>I get that bonds are insurance.But at a certain price, you have to ask, what am I insured against?Compared to cash, it's really hard to make a rational or logical argument for owning this 40-year paper.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The 0.5 % yield provides the thinnest of reward in return for taking large <b>risk</b> of both default and inflationary shocks .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I suspect most buyers are technical or swing traders that are in fact buying because they imagine they can sell it at a <i>higher</i> price in the near future .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If so , there will be great pain when the music stops .  (Uncertainty) </span>If you want to short Japanese government bonds, there is a leveraged inverse ETF (NYSEARCA: JGBD ), though as always, the usual caveats apply for that fund structure.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.</div></body></html>
