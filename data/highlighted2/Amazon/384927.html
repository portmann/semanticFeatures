class='textDiv'>Netflix Vs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Video A Market Of Value Proposition Netflix Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Amazons welltimed video streaming standalone service announcement created questions regarding its effects on Netflixs subscriber growth prospects These questions emerged because Amazons standalone service can decelerate Netflixs growth rate by creating pricing pressure amidst Netflixs catalogue shrinkage However redefining the definition of content with respect to Netflix its clear that streaming is a market of value proportion with room for multiple players <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN announced a standalone plan that costs month below Netflixs NASDAQ NFLX standard plan of month Netflixs basic plan of month does not include access to highdefinition content Amazons standalone offering is an attempt for the ecommerce juggernaut to stepup its competition against Netflix Amazons move represents a significant negative development for Netflix says Mark Mahaney analyst with RBC Capital Markets Along with a lower price point <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will offer access to K content while Netflix offers Ultra HD programming through its Premium plan Mahaney says both factors could place pressure on Netflix to convert subscribers to pricier plans <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>certainly has the brand name the customer relationships and the focus on highquality consumer experiences to impact the growth in Netflixs US subscriber base and perhaps eventually its global subscriber base he says USA Today This announcement has been widely interpreted as a huge threat to Netflix partly because of the pricing pressure it can create for Netflix This is so because it coincides with Netflixs planned price increases Netflix announced in October of last year that its new rate was going to take effect by May But the company said it will now roll out the price hike gradually over the course of A strategy Netflix is calling ungrandfathering As a result the new price increase makes Amazons Prime Video competitive to Netflix because it is cheaper In addition to pricing pressure Netflix is also facing a catalog shrinkage issue According to a report on AllFlicks a website that lists and categorizes Netflix content the streaming services library for American subscribers has shrunk by a third since The statistics are simple and remarkable in January of Netflix offered its USbased users a selection of movies and TV shows for a total of titles As of March they offer just movies and TV shows titles in total Thats fewer titles In other words Netflixs catalog has shrunk in less than two and a half years AllFlicks This shrinkage implies that Netflixs competitors might have a chance to decelerate Netflixs subscriber growth rate This ties back to the pricing pressure mentioned earlier because it creates another threat that Netflixs subscribers will deflect from Netflix after the price hike given that its US catalog has shrunk by more than titles in less than years Meaning that Netflixs customers have few choices of movies to choose from This is crucial for Netflix because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Video Prime is not the only competitor in town Other rivals like Hulu are also backed by highly capitalized owners Hulu LLC is a joint venture of The Walt Disney Company NYSE DIS st Century Fox NASDAQ FOX and Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA This increases acquisition costs for great content because producers suddenly have a growing number of wellcapitalized bidders who want great highquality content The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Video might not be as serious a threat to Netflix because the market has room for more than one competitor But besides having room for multiple dominant players the video streaming market is essentially a battle of good value proposition Value proposition is critical for success in the streaming business People do not go to Netflix because it is the biggest player in town but because there is content that is engaging educational or entertaining for them This is where Netflix becomes a crucial player Netflix is aggressively creating compelling value for customers by investing an insane amount of money on content creation For instance Netflix is planning to have hours of original programming in and Netflixs chief content officer was quoted saying Were going to spend in about billion on content on a PL basis which means about billion in cash Putting that into perspective if you slept for hours and watched the hours of Netflixs programming for alone you would spend more than years to finish it Is there too much TV Sarandos asked then coyly added Ill pause for a second knowing reporters would want to get this next part We dont think theres too much TV And if there is too much TV someone else is going to have to slow down because we have big plans for and beyond Ted Sarandos Netflixs Chief Content Officer during the Television Critics Associations press tour in Pasadena Taken from the article Netflix to spend billion on content this year Six Billion by James Hibberd hours is a lot Considering that Netflixs competitors are also investing heavily on original content it is natural to ask the question is there such a thing as too much TV The question is there too much TV was in response to FX Chief John Landgraf who said that there is too much TV with more than scripted shows in and that or will represent peak TV in America and then we will see a decline This question is acute because it makes us reexamine our perception of what content is Take pharmaceuticals companies for example they invest in RD or acquisitions to create or buy products that will create FCF Netflixs investments in content is like that Content is an asset for Netflix that will enable the company to create value now and in the future Content is the product Netflix sells Great content is good for customer retention penetrating into new markets and for revenue growth implying that the number of players in the video streaming business is irrelevant what is relevant is the number of companies creating great compelling content that people love The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>or Hulu competition is not new Skinny bundles have a connotation of choice Giving consumers the freedom to choose which content they want to pay for Streaming services are part of the choices people can choose from Hence there is a market for multiples players It is a market that can sustain multiple players because whoever creates highquality and valuable content that resonates with a mass market will dominate the market This is why the effect of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>standalone service should not be blown out of proportion Therefore investing in a portfolio of highquality original content ensures that there is something for everyone As long as Netflix continues to create and acquire highquality content that consumers love new entrants to the video streaming market will have less effect on the company Content creation and content acquisition enables Netflix to resonate with a diverse range of users retain old customers and keep acquiring new
