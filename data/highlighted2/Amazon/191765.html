With retail investing being increasingly more common, and investors having more access to information, I argue that this effect is more pronounced than ever before.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is an illusion of safety when investing in a company such as Netflix , that I think we can all agree will not likely be going bankrupt any time soon ; <b>almost</b> anyone can agree there is huge growth potential in earnings .  (Uncertainty) </span>This leads to people to become careless when it comes to looking at valuation, which can, and has countless times in the past, lead to dramatic corrections in price.In contrast, companies that are going through a very difficult time can have much less downside potential as the poor projections are already valued in.The time to buy Netflix was essentially any time up until around a year ago.Ask yourself what was happening with Netflix last year when the price was around half of its current value?Why didn't you buy then?What has occurred, over the last year, that makes it worth twice what it seemed worth last year?When you start asking these questions, the valuation becomes less clear.If there is any one company that is likely to become the world leader in streaming online content, it will be Netflix.To say otherwise at this point would seem unwise, as they have demonstrated a growing moat, as well as a very loyal user-base.Overall, regardless of market-capitalization, Netflix has some of the best earnings growth prospects out there right now.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite Netflix being a fantastic company , it seems plausible that Netflix could grow earnings over the next few years to become fairly valued with their current priced ; it is even theoretically <b>possible</b> for Netflix to grow so much that it is actually under-priced right now .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What needs to be considered is the relative <b>risk</b> to reward .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What I wanted to demonstrate in this article , is that the current Netflix valuation leaves almost no room for growth ; there is just far too many ambitious growth expectations already cooked into the market capitalization , which has resulted in a <b>somewhat</b> scary P/E ratio .  (Uncertainty) </span>Using P/E ratio for a growth company is of little use, however, I question if it is reasonable to project these growth expectations onto Netflix.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Netflix explodes in popularity , grows their margins , eliminates competition , deals with illegal content access , and keeps their marketing and administrative costs in check , then Netflix is likely <b>somewhat</b> fairly valued ; if any of these expectations are not met , or if there is any major correction in the market , Netflix has some fairly significant downside .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think that it is too <b>speculative</b> to come up with an accurate value for Netflix right now , but I would be looking at buying Netflix if it fell below $ 60 , and I would be seriously researching it if it ever fell below $ 50 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , Netflix is a <b>speculative</b> stock , and we are living in an extremely <b>speculative</b> time period ; there is nothing to say that investors wo n't bid Netflix up to $ 200 next month , but it will just be that much more overvalued .  (Uncertainty) </span>I would recommend considering Netflix for long term put options as a form of insurance in today's overheated markets.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In conclusion , Netflix is an <b>amazing</b> company with it 's greatest flaw at this point in time being the market-capitalization .
