(Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Lets talk about the many positives of Netflix, but first, I want to mention that I have not gone into as much detail in this section as the positives for Netflix have been exhausted in previous articles; this is merely a brief review.First, Netflix has already created a large database of information based on user preferences, which it uses to help select content for its viewers based on their previous interests.Also, Netflix has actually used this data to determine what shows they will try and obtain in the future, as well as ideas for future Netflix original series.This is a truly unique advantage that even the great data miners Facebook and Google would not be able to replicate with the same accuracy.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Currently Netflix is the largest player in their market , which has given them an advantage of having the largest library of content ; this will naturally allow them to grow at a <i>quicker</i> rate than their competitors .  (Surprise) </span>In addition to this, Netflix's original content can be scaled which would significantly improve margins as their user-base grows.Netflix has the advantage of being there first, and this continual advantage with growing market share will spread with time.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I personally believe that the majority of <i>smaller</i> online streaming companies will eventually be contracted out by Netflix , although this <b>could</b> take many years .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Netflix has created some very high quality television content according to the opinions of viewers, which has added to their loyal following.Netflix is frankly just really trendy.It's hard to value something that is considered trendy, but it certainly must be considered.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix is not only fashionable , but has developed an <b>almost</b> cult like following .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Many users swear by Netflix , and would n't dare touch anything else ; this can be compared to the fans of companies such as Apple , although <b>perhaps</b> much <i>less</i> extreme .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This loyalty must be valued into the company as we can expect a <i>lower</i> cancellation rate .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix management stated that they estimate future revenue , and then use this to determine what they will spend on content ; they also stated that they plan to grow revenue <i>more</i> than content over the next few years so that their margins will improve to 40 % .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do n't find this to be unreasonable at all , but it <b>may</b> prove to be too ambitious of a goal .  (Uncertainty) </span>Management stated that they wish to grow their US base from 60 to 90 million by 2020, which is a pretty big range in my opinion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As of last quarter they had 41.06 million paid US memberships , and it <b>seems</b> very likely that will can achieve 60 million by 2020 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , lets look a little <i>closer</i> at what would have to occur to get to 90 million , to get an idea of managements ambitions .  (Surprise) </span>There are just under 320 million people in the United States as of 2014, and there are 123,229 households .Then there are the group quarters which are not included, which as of 2009 was 8,277.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Subtracting the prisons from this number , that would be 6,124 group homes , or 129,353 total households and group quarters excluding prisoners ( I 'm assuming prisoners do n't get Netflix , I wo n't be <b>surprised</b> if this is wrong ) ; lets keep the numbers simple and <b>assume</b> the number of group homes have increased over the last few years to bring the total to 130 million .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In order for Netflix to get 90 million viewers, they would need to have 69.2% of US households purchasing Netflix.As of 2012, There are 49.5% of Americans that are receiving some form of social assistance (including veterans benefits and medicaid).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are 27.4 % of households that are currently receiving means-tested non-cash benefits ; I find it reasonable to say that the majority of these households would be able to afford a luxury such as Netflix , but perhaps I <b>could</b> be wrong .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Removing this chunk entirely from the population would require almost 100 % of US households that are not <b>dependent</b> on these programs to purchase Netflix .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It also <b>seems</b> reasonable that the majority of the ` working poor ' , ( no social-assistance , but living below the poverty line ) which represent around 10 million Americans ( around 3-4 million households ) , would also not be purchasing Netflix .  (Uncertainty) </span>There are also the large number of people that are just unlikely to switch over to Netflix because they like watching TV the way that they have always watched it.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I imagine the senior population would be much <i>less</i> likely to convert to Netflix , especially since the retirement lifestyle is much <i>more</i> conducive to watching TV shows around a schedule , and they are <i>less</i> likely to have a timetable conflict from lifestyle .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Therefore the 40.3 million Americans aged 65 or <i>older</i> are another major problem for Netflix to achieve their <b>almost</b> 70 % market-share .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Another major consideration is the huge number of people that share their Netflix accounts , and are essentially impossible to stop ; Netflix would be much <i>less</i> user-friendly if it <b>could</b> only be accessed from one location , so this trend is likely to continue .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of course there is no data for this , but it <b>seems</b> to be pretty common occurrence in my anecdotal experience .  (Uncertainty) </span>Finally, there are the people that just for whatever reason don't want to watch Netflix.There is still an enormous amount of high quality content that is unavailable on Netflix, so many people would be unlikely to jump ship yet.Some people use TV mostly for news or sporting events.Then there are the odd household that just doesn't watch television at all.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I just wanted to use Netflix 's example of their US growth targets as a highlight as to why investors <b>may</b> be misled by management 's expectations .  (Uncertainty) </span>Of course many of the aforementioned arguments in this section would be applied to other countries, however I wanted to discuss just the US as they specifically made growth targets for the US.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In conclusion , I will not be <b>surprised</b> if Netflix hits 60 million US subscriptions by 2020 , but I <b>doubt</b> it will be much <i>higher</i> than that .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Now to the fun part: the math!I like to determine what sort of expectations investors have for the future by determining what theoretical future revenues would need to be to achieve a reasonable valuation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Lets start with an <b>almost</b> impossible scenario : 1 billion Netflix subscriptions by 2020 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given the prediction for the number of households with televisions to hit 1.72 billion by 2020 , it seems <b>possible</b> that over a billion households would have internet , television , and the ability to afford Netflix and a medium to connect Netflix to the television .  (Uncertainty) </span>As of their last quarter, Netflix reported 65 million subscriptions ; they also reported net income of $26.34 million.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With 1 billion customers they would therefore increase net income by around 15.4 times the Q2 net income , which would <b>assume</b> profit of around $ 405.6 million per quarter , or $ 1.62 billion per year ( $ 3.80 EPS ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>With a current price of $106.11, this would mean a P/E of 27.92; still very expensive.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Just to put this in perspective , some estimates <b>suggest</b> that streaming content revenue will double by 2020 , but this is still a massive gap in Netflix 's earnings expectations .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix plans on growing their margins to 40 % ( 33.1 % last quarter ) by 2020 as they expect their content costs to decline relative to their subscription revenue due to growth ; I find this to be a realistic goal , and this would increase earnings <i>further</i> .  (Surprise) </span>In addition, certain administrative costs will not necessarily grow at the same rate of their content costs and revenue, which will further increase their net income.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Lets assume that both of those <b>variables</b> combined increase net income by an additional 40 % , which is very generous , this would bring EPS to $ 5.32 , or a P/E of 19.945 ; STILL expensive .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It is also important to consider that the general and administrative and marketing expense will grow significantly as they expand into <i>more</i> countries , so we can not assume that this expansion will not increase costs ; looking at previous statements , it <b>seems</b> that they have been growing somewhat proportionately to the revenue , although management <b>seems</b> to think this will change soon ( which would make sense as they have expanded so much recently ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Now lets consider this scenario even <i>further</i> , if Netflix actually had 1 billion subscriptions , there would be very little growth left at all , so a much <i>lower</i> P/E ratio would be expected .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Just for fun, lets say they increase their subscription rates by 25% without increasing any costs at all.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This would bring the P/E down to just below 15 , which would be quite fairly priced for a company with reasonable growth expectations ; however , if all of the practically impossible criteria were fulfilled , the growth expectations would have to come from improving margins even <i>further</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I have read previous analysis that <b>suggested</b> declining cash flow is a concern for Netflix , and I do n't entirely agree ; I think that this is purely a function of how they are aggressively growing the company , and nothing <i>more</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Taking a quick look at the balance sheet, Netflix has 9.6 billion in assets and 7.6 billion in liabilities, leaving only just over 2 billion in equity (with the majority being in common stock).On the other hand, Netflix has 2.3 billion in cash, and very health working capital.The Psychology of Investing In Netflix My favorite part about investing is trying to determine which information sources investors use, how they use them, and how this affects their investment decisions.There are not too many examples that are as perfect as Netflix in displaying how cognitive biases impact our judgment.Netflix is something that the vast majority of Americans and Canadians hear about on a daily basis; we hear about it in the news, we are always talking about it with our friends, and we frequently see the 'Netflix' logo on the background of our computers or televisions.We have associated Netflix with an innovative company of the future, that will likely continue to revolutionize the way that we live our lives.So many of us have witnessed Netflix turn from a rarely used website into an increasingly standard household item in the USA and Canada; logically, we are aware that this trend will continue to occur throughout the rest of the world.Any reasonable person can see the obvious growth potential in Netflix, and we all want a piece of the pie (especially when we missed the likes of Apple and Microsoft in the past).In short, we are constantly thinking about Netflix, and these thoughts are usually very positive.The association of a reward with Netflix, leads to it being associated with other rewarding things, such as generating future cash.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>There is a growing body of evidence that <b>suggests</b> that we value companies <i>higher</i> when they are <i>more</i> often discussed in the media ; this effect has become much <i>stronger</i> with the growth of the investing media and the internet ( and the overwhelming amount of information ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The absolute best examples of this can be seen during the dot-com bubble , and if there is one global message from this article , it is that there is no <i>better</i> time than now to study this time period .  (Surprise) </span>Netflix is a great example of this.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Think from your own anecdotal evidence of people you know who are ` casual investors ' and hold a few shares in a few companies , but do n't really dedicate that much time to them ; it 's been my experience that these portfolios are filled with the most publicized names in the world ( Facebook , Netflix , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Tesla , Google , etc ) , and rarely with <i>less</i> famous companies . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With retail investing being increasingly <i>more</i> common , and investors having <i>more</i> access to information , I argue that this effect is <i>more</i> pronounced than ever before .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is an illusion of safety when investing in a company such as Netflix , that I think we can all agree will not likely be going bankrupt any time soon ; <b>almost</b> anyone can agree there is huge growth potential in earnings .  (Uncertainty) </span>This leads to people to become careless when it comes to looking at valuation, which can, and has countless times in the past, lead to dramatic corrections in price.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In contrast , companies that are going through a very difficult time can have much <i>less</i> downside potential as the poor projections are already valued in .  (Surprise) </span>The time to buy Netflix was essentially any time up until around a year ago.Ask yourself what was happening with Netflix last year when the price was around half of its current value?Why didn't you buy then?What has occurred, over the last year, that makes it worth twice what it seemed worth last year?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When you start asking these questions , the valuation becomes <i>less</i> clear .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If there is any one company that is likely to become the world leader in streaming online content , it will be Netflix .  (Uncertainty) </span>To say otherwise at this point would seem unwise, as they have demonstrated a growing moat, as well as a very loyal user-base.Overall, regardless of market-capitalization, Netflix has some of the best earnings growth prospects out there right now.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite Netflix being a fantastic company , it seems plausible that Netflix could grow earnings over the next few years to become fairly valued with their current priced ; it is even theoretically <b>possible</b> for Netflix to grow so much that it is actually under-priced right now .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What needs to be considered is the relative <b>risk</b> to reward .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What I wanted to demonstrate in this article , is that the current Netflix valuation leaves almost no room for growth ; there is just far too many ambitious growth expectations already cooked into the market capitalization , which has resulted in a <b>somewhat</b> scary P/E ratio .  (Uncertainty) </span>Using P/E ratio for a growth company is of little use, however, I question if it is reasonable to project these growth expectations onto Netflix.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Netflix explodes in popularity , grows their margins , eliminates competition , deals with illegal content access , and keeps their marketing and administrative costs in check , then Netflix is likely <b>somewhat</b> fairly valued ; if any of these expectations are not met , or if there is any major correction in the market , Netflix has some fairly significant downside .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think that it is too <b>speculative</b> to come up with an accurate value for Netflix right now , but I would be looking at buying Netflix if it fell below $ 60 , and I would be seriously researching it if it ever fell below $ 50 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , Netflix is a <b>speculative</b> stock , and we are living in an extremely <b>speculative</b> time period ; there is nothing to say that investors wo n't bid Netflix up to $ 200 next month , but it will just be that much <i>more</i> overvalued .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I would recommend considering Netflix for long term put options as a form of insurance in today's overheated markets.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In conclusion , Netflix is an <b>amazing</b> company with it 's greatest flaw at this point in time being the market-capitalization .
