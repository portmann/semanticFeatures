style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could pass WalMarts earnings power in less than a decade <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN is now worth more than WalMart NYSE WMT The two companies market caps are below WalMart has a market cap of billion At first glance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>being more valuable than WalMart doesnt seem that unusual After all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is the future and WalMart is the past right Looking a little closer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>being more valuable than WalMart starts to seem strange Both companies sales over the last months are below <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has annual sales of billion WalMart generates x as many sales as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Thats not a minor spread Its a HUGE difference WalMart had more sales adjusted for inflation in than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has today Despite generating x as much sales as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>WalMart is worth less than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Of course sales are not everything In business and investing the bottom line matters The net profit over the last months of both companies is below <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has net profits of negative million WalMart has net profits of billion Clearly one of these companies is more lucrative than the other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is still not profitable He company last million dollars over the last months While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is not profitable on a GAAP basis there is more to the story here than meets the eye which will be discussed a little later on in this article WalMart on the other hand is extremely profitable WalMart made enough money over the last months to buy the entire Whole Foods NASDAQ WFM company based on its billion market cap Im not saying WalMart should buy Whole Foods they are very very different businesses This example just shows the massive earnings power of WalMart When given the choice between a highly profitable company and an unprofitable company I would much rather choose the one that makes money over the one that does not Businesses are in business primarily to make money WalMart is a money making machine <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is not In addition WalMart is very shareholder friendly The company is a Dividend Aristocrat thanks to its years of consecutive dividend increases Click here to download a list of all Dividend Aristocrats <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>on the other hand does not pay dividends and actually regularly issues shares diluting current shareholder ownership Has the investing world collectively lost its mind in regard to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Why is the company so valuable No the investing world has not lost its mind although I believe it is far too optimistic about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is so valuable because it is growing rapidly Over the last decade <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has compounded revenuespershare at annually For comparison WalMart has grown revenuespershare at a year Amazons growth has not slowed substantially in recent years Over the last years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has grown revenuespershare at a year versus just a year for WalMart Of the two companies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is clearly the winner in growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is growing rapidly while WalMart is growing like the established bluechip company it is A Deeper Dive Into Amazons Profitability While Amazons growth is impressive the company is losing money on a GAAP basis A rapidly growing business that will always be unprofitable is not worth anything With a market cap approaching billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is certainly valuable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is profitable if one strips away depreciation costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has to depreciate its technology assets on the books at a rate that is likely much higher than the realworld expense This results in underreported profits for the company Fortunately <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is transparent enough to give shareholders a good look at the companies true earnings power if it werent investing so heavily in growth All the numbers below are for the trailing twelve months and from Amazons most recent quarterly report Principal repayments of capital leases of million Before going any further it is important to note that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>buysinvests in building machinery hardware and software in ways It will either use longterm leases or it will buy outright Over the last quarters <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has billion in capital expenditures using normal purchases and billion in capital expenditures using longterm leases About of capital expenditures are normal purchases and are done through leases for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Principal repayments of capital leases are an excellent way to gauge real world depreciation Seeing that of the companys capital expenditures are capital leases we can find the real depreciation by seeing what principal repayments on capital leases would be if of the companys capital expenditures were done through leases This comes to around billion annually Amazons real earnings power before taxes is operating income plus depreciation less the billion in estimated true depreciation calculated above This comes to million annually Using a tax rate gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>real earnings power of million a year Amazons Profitability Versus WalMarts Profitability WalMarts profit is much easier to calculate It is million a year Remember earlier when we saw that WalMart generates x as much sales as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>The company does even better on a net profit comparison WalMart generates x as much sales as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Over the last decade WalMart has grown earningspershare at a year If we assume that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>continues growing at a year and WalMart doesnt grow at all this is very unlikely over the longrun it will take <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>full years to pass WalMarts net profits I dont think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will be able to keep up a growth rate for more years and I also strongly disagree that WalMart wont grow at all for years Even if these two events do occur only then will <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>have the earnings power of WalMart Keep in mind these companies are already worth the same amount based on market cap Investors who prefer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>over WalMart are assuming that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will continue with rapid growth These investors also assume that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will maintain its lofty valuations If the company falters at all what if it falls to growth heaven forbid it will see its pricetoearnings multiple fall substantially resulting in very real losses for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>investors WalMart generates about billion a year in ecommerce sales this is about x less than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Still WalMart is one of the largest players in ecommerce Despite this the company trades for a pricetoearnings ratio of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>trades for an adjusted pricetoearnings ratio of Stocks with high pricetoearnings ratios have significantly underperformed low pricetoearnings stocks over the longrun The exception to this is during manias like the tech stock boom <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is one of the stocks to be stuck in investors will pay absurd multiples to take part in its growth Maybe Im old fashioned but Id much rather invest in a business with years of dividend growth a long history of share repurchases and a fair valuation than a business with a pricetoearnings ratio near and a history of share issuance rather than repurchases Dont get me wrong <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is an amazing business I purchase regularly from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and WalMart It must execute flawlessly to warrant its current valuation while WalMart has room to fumble and still give investors attractive total returns WalMart stocks total returns will likely be well in excess of Amazons over the next decade Source Why You Should Dump <span
