( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> now has a <i>higher</i> market cap than Wal-Mart . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Wal-Mart has over 5x as many sales and 6x as many profits as compared to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> pass Wal-Mart 's earnings power in <i>less</i> than a decade . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) is now worth <i>more</i> than Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The two companies ' market caps are below : Wal-Mart has a market cap of $ 233 billion At first glance , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> being <i>more</i> valuable than Wal-Mart does n't seem that <b>unusual</b> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>After all , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is the future , and Wal-Mart is the past , right ? <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Looking a little <i>closer</i> , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> being <i>more</i> valuable than Wal-Mart starts to seem strange . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Both companies ' sales over the last 12 months are below : <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has annual sales of $ 95.8 billion Wal-Mart generates 5.1 x as many sales as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . That's not a minor spreadï¿½ It's a HUGE difference.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Wal-Mart had <i>more</i> sales ( adjusted for inflation ) in 1994 than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has today . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Despite generating 5.1 x as much sales as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Wal-Mart is worth <i>less</i> than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Of course, sales are not everything.In business and investing, the bottom line matters.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The net profit over the last 12 months of both companies is below : <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has net profits of negative $ 188 million Wal-Mart has net profits of $ 15.84 billion Clearly , one of these companies is <i>more</i> lucrative than the other . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is still not profitable . He company last $188 million dollars over the last 12 months.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is not profitable on a GAAP basis , there is <i>more</i> to the story here than meets the eye - which will be discussed a little later on in this article . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Wal-Mart, on the other hand, is extremely profitable.Wal-Mart made enough money over the last 12 months to buy the entire Whole Foods (NASDAQ: WFM ) company (based on its $14.6 billion market cap).I'm not saying Wal-Mart should buy Whole Foods - they are very, very different businesses.This example just shows the massive earnings power of Wal-Mart.When given the choice between a highly profitable company and an unprofitable company, I would much rather choose the one that makes money over the one that does not.Businesses are in business primarily to make money.Wal-Mart is a money making machine.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is not . In addition, Wal-Mart is very shareholder friendly.The company is a Dividend Aristocrat thanks to its 40+ years of consecutive dividend increases.Click here to download a list of all 50+ Dividend Aristocrats .<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , on the other hand , does not pay dividends and actually regularly issues shares , diluting current shareholder ownership . Has the investing world collectively lost its mind in regard to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ? Why is the company so valuable?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>No , the investing world has not lost its mind - although I believe it is far too <b>optimistic</b> about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is so valuable because it is growing rapidly . Over the last decade , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has compounded revenues-per-share at 28.3 % annually . For comparison, Wal-Mart has grown revenues-per-share at 7.9% a year.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's growth has not slowed substantially in recent years . Over the last 5 years , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has grown revenues-per-share at 26.1 % a year versus just 5.8 % a year for Wal-Mart . Of the two companies , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is clearly the winner in growth . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is growing rapidly , while Wal-Mart is growing like the established blue-chip company it is . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A <i>Deeper</i> Dive Into <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Profitability While <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's growth is impressive , the company is losing money on a GAAP basis . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>A rapidly growing business that will always be unprofitable is not worth anything.With a market cap approaching $ 250 billion , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is certainly valuable . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is profitable if one strips away depreciation costs . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has to depreciate its technology assets ` on the books ' at a rate that is likely much <i>higher</i> than the real-world expense . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>This results in underreported profits for the company.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Fortunately , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is transparent enough to give shareholders a good look at the companies true earnings power , if it were n't investing so heavily in growth . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>All the numbers below are for the trailing twelve months and from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's most recent quarterly report : Principal repayments of capital leases of $ 1,987 million Before going any <i>further</i> , it is important to note that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> buys/invests in building , machinery , hardware , and software in 2 ways . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>It will either use long-term leases, or it will buy outright.Over the last 5 quarters , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has $ 23.1 billion in capital expenditures using ` normal ' purchases , and $ 19.0 billion in capital expenditures using long-term leases . About 55 % of capital expenditures are normal purchases and 45 % are done through leases for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Principal repayments of capital leases are an excellent way to gauge 'real world' depreciation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Seeing that 45 % of the company 's capital expenditures are capital leases , we can find the ` real ' depreciation by seeing what principal repayments on capital leases would be if 100 % of the company 's capital expenditures were done through leases .  (Uncertainty) </span>This comes to around $4.4 billion annually.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's real earnings power ( before taxes ) is operating income plus depreciation <i>less</i> the $ 4.4 billion in estimated ` true ' depreciation calculated above . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>This comes to $3,839 million annually.Using a 33 % tax rate gives <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> real earnings power of $ 2,572 million a year . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Profitability Versus Wal-Mart 's Profitability Wal-Mart 's profit is much <i>easier</i> to calculate . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>It is $15,840 million a year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Remember <i>earlier</i> when we saw that Wal-Mart generates 5.1 x as much sales as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ? (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company does even <i>better</i> on a net profit comparison .  (Surprise) </span>Wal-Mart generates 6.2 x as much sales as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Over the last decade, Wal-Mart has grown earnings-per-share at 7.6% a year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If we <b>assume</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continues growing at 26 % a year and Wal-Mart does n't grow at all ( this is very unlikely over the long-run ) , it will take <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 8 full years to pass Wal-Mart 's net profits . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I do n't think <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will be able to keep up a 26 % growth rate for 8 <i>more</i> years , and I also strongly disagree that Wal-Mart wo n't grow at all for 8 years . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Even if these two events do occur , only then will <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> have the earnings power of Wal-Mart . Keep in mind, these companies are already worth the same amount based on market cap.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Investors who prefer <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> over Wal-Mart are <b>assuming</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will continue with rapid growth . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These investors also <b>assume</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will maintain its lofty valuations . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the company falters at all ( what if it falls to 10 % growth - heaven forbid ) , it will see its price-to-earnings multiple fall substantially , resulting in very real losses for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> investors . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Wal-Mart generates about $ 12 billion a year in e-commerce sales - this is about 8x <i>less</i> than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Still, Wal-Mart is one of the largest players in e-commerce.Despite this, the company trades for a price-to-earnings ratio of 14.8.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> trades for an adjusted price-to-earnings ratio of 95.8 . Stocks with high price-to-earnings ratios have significantly underperformed low price-to-earnings stocks over the long-run.The exception to this is during manias - like the 1999 tech stock boom.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is one of the stocks to be ` stuck in 1999 ' ; investors will pay absurd multiples to take part in its growth . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> I 'm old fashioned , but I 'd much rather invest in a business with 40 + years of dividend growth , a long history of share repurchases , and a fair valuation than a business with a price-to-earnings ratio near 100 and a history of share issuance rather than repurchases .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Do n't get me wrong - <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is an <b>amazing</b> business . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>I purchase regularly from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( and Wal-Mart ) . It must execute flawlessly to warrant its current valuation, while Wal-Mart has room to fumble and still give investors attractive total returns.Wal-Mart stock 's total returns will likely be well in excess of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's over the next decade .
