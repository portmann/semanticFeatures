(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Short interest dropped another 9.8 million shares.Apple now one of least shorted large-cap tech names.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A couple of weeks ago , I detailed how the sentiment around shares of Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) was not what you <b>might</b> think .  (Uncertainty) </span>Despite all of the bearishness regarding iPhone sales and falling fiscal Q2 revenues, short interest was at a multi-year low.Recently, the end of February update on short interest came in, and the trend of short sellers covering has continued in a large way.In fact, Apple is now one of the least shorted tech giants in the market today.In my previous article, I mentioned how short interest for Apple was near its lowest point that I've seen since I started tracking this item in April 2012.Well, another 9.8 million shares were covered by the end of February.With short interest now under 50 million shares, I had to adjust the y-axis of the short interest chart, seen below.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The latest short interest number marks a new low , the least amount of shares short in <b>roughly</b> 4 years ( split-adjusted ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>Source: NASDAQ Apple short interest page The number of shares short is a single data point, so there are many ways to look at it.One primary way I do is in terms of the stock's float, the number of shares actually available for trading.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>According to Yahoo! Finance , Apple 's float is 5.54 billion shares , meaning about 0.86 % of Apple 's float is short , <i>less</i> than 1 in every 100 shares .  (Surprise) </span>In the overall market, this number is relatively low.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When you look at some high-growth areas , the 3D printing sector or stocks such as GoPro ( NASDAQ : GPRO ) and Tesla Motors ( NASDAQ : TSLA ) , you can see times when 20 % , 30 % or <i>more</i> of the float is short .  (Surprise) </span>But to do a realistic comparison for Apple, we really should look at some other major technology names.In the chart below , I did just that , comparing Apple against Alphabet ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) , Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) , IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) , Intel ( NASDAQ : INTC ) , Qualcomm ( NASDAQ : QCOM ) , Cisco Systems ( NASDAQ : CSCO ) , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) and Oracle ( NYSE : ORCL ) . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>( Note : Settlement date for short interest of names above is either 2/29 or 3/1 , <b>depending</b> on NASDAQ reporting date . )  (Uncertainty) </span>For the ten stocks above, the straight average comes to 1.38% of float shorted.If we take out Apple which is well below that, the nine-stock peer group average comes to 1.44%.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This means Apple is about 40 % <i>less</i> shorted than average , which is a considerable amount .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Only Microsoft is <i>less</i> shorted than Apple , and those are the only two stocks below 1.00 % .  (Surprise) </span>Of the group above, Apple is one of four stocks estimated to show both revenue and earnings declines in its current fiscal period .Oracle is in a similar revenue situation to Apple, although Apple isn't expected to see as much of an EPS decline.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>IBM and Qualcomm are forecast to see even <i>greater</i> top and bottom line declines .  (Surprise) </span>Of these four, Apple has the best buyback program at the moment, while IBM and Qualcomm have the highest dividend yields.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft , the only stock <i>less</i> shorted than Apple , is expected to see a revenue decline in its current fiscal year , but EPS are forecast to jump .  (Surprise) </span>In the second half of February, there was a bit of news regarding Apple other than the FBI phone saga.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Apple launched another bond offering , probably for helping the buyback plan , although the coupon rates were a bit <i>higher</i> than normally <b>hoped</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the negative side , recent Apple bull Carl Icahn trimmed his position in the stock , selling <b>nearly</b> seven million shares .  (Uncertainty) </span>Additionally, SMBC Nikko cut its iPhone demand forecast by 30 million units after another reported round of production cutbacks .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given mostly negative news , you <b>might</b> have expected short interest to increase for Apple , but it went the other way .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Apple shares traded <i>higher</i> as the month ended , and have regained the $ 100 mark here in March .  (Surprise) </span>So, I ask the key question again in regards to Apple: where are all of the short sellers?I continue to hear iPhone sales are struggling, revenues and earnings are going to decline in the period, etc.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , short interest in the stock is actually declining , showing that investors do n't <b>believe</b> the stock is headed <i>lower</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The number of shares short is at its lowest point in the <b>nearly</b> four years I 've tracked for Apple .  (Uncertainty) </span>The stock is also the second least shorted of ten major large cap tech names.If things at Apple are really that bad, why are short sellers covering in large quantities?Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: Investors are always reminded that before making any investment, you should do your own proper due diligence on any name directly or indirectly mentioned in this article.Investors should also consider seeking advice from a broker or financial adviser before making any investment decisions.Any material in this article should be considered general information, and not relied on as a formal investment recommendation.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Personal Computers</div></body></html>
