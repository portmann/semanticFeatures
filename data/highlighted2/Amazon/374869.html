ago I detailed how the sentiment around shares of Apple NASDAQ AAPL was not what you might think Despite all of the bearishness regarding iPhone sales and falling fiscal Q revenues short interest was at a multiyear low Recently the end of February update on short interest came in and the trend of short sellers covering has continued in a large way In fact Apple is now one of the least shorted tech giants in the market today In my previous article I mentioned how short interest for Apple was near its lowest point that Ive seen since I started tracking this item in April Well another million shares were covered by the end of February With short interest now under million shares I had to adjust the yaxis of the short interest chart seen below The latest short interest number marks a new low the least amount of shares short in roughly years splitadjusted Source NASDAQ Apple short interest page The number of shares short is a single data point so there are many ways to look at it One primary way I do is in terms of the stocks float the number of shares actually available for trading According to Yahoo Finance Apples float is billion shares meaning about of Apples float is short less than in every shares In the overall market this number is relatively low When you look at some highgrowth areas the D printing sector or stocks such as GoPro NASDAQ GPRO and Tesla Motors NASDAQ TSLA you can see times when or more of the float is short But to do a realistic comparison for Apple we really should look at some other major technology names In the chart below I did just that comparing Apple against Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT IBM NYSE IBM Intel NASDAQ INTC Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Cisco Systems NASDAQ CSCO <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Facebook NASDAQ FB and Oracle NYSE ORCL Note Settlement date for short interest of names above is either or depending on NASDAQ reporting date For the ten stocks above the straight average comes to of float shorted If we take out Apple which is well below that the ninestock peer group average comes to This means Apple is about less shorted than average which is a considerable amount Only Microsoft is less shorted than Apple and those are the only two stocks below Of the group above Apple is one of four stocks estimated to show both revenue and earnings declines in its current fiscal period Oracle is in a similar revenue situation to Apple although Apple isnt expected to see as much of an EPS decline IBM and Qualcomm are forecast to see even greater top and bottom line declines Of these four Apple has the best buyback program at the moment while IBM and Qualcomm have the highest dividend yields Microsoft the only stock less shorted than Apple is expected to see a revenue decline in its current fiscal year but EPS are forecast to jump In the second half of February there was a bit of news regarding Apple other than the FBI phone saga Apple launched another bond offering probably for helping the buyback plan although the coupon rates were a bit higher than normally hoped On the negative side recent Apple bull Carl Icahn trimmed his position in the stock selling nearly seven million shares Additionally SMBC Nikko cut its iPhone demand forecast by million units after another reported round of production cutbacks Given mostly negative news you might have expected short interest to increase for Apple but it went the other way Apple shares traded higher as the month ended and have regained the mark here in March So I ask the key question again in regards to Apple where are all of the short sellers I continue to hear iPhone sales are struggling revenues and earnings are going to decline in the period etc However short interest in the stock is actually declining showing that investors dont believe the stock is headed lower The number of shares short is at its lowest point in the nearly four years Ive tracked for Apple The stock is also the second least shorted of ten major large cap tech names If things at Apple are really that bad why are short sellers covering in large quantities Disclosure Iwe have no
