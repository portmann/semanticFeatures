announced that Rob Walton who had served as Chairman of the Board since was stepping down he will stay on as a director and would be replaced with viceChairman Greg Penner grandson of founder Sam and son in law of Rob who started his career at Goldman Sachs before joining WMT as a management trainee This transition demonstrates Walmarts commitment to longterm succession planning and keeping high caliber capable leaders at the head of our company said Walton Gregs service to Walmart spans more than years and during that time he has had a significant impact both as an associate and as a Board member the past seven years Greg has done an outstanding job as our Vice Chairman over the past year and he has provided strong leadership and guidance as the Chairman of our Technology and eCommerce Committee since it was formed in He brings an ideal blend of finance technology and international business expertise as well as a deep knowledge and love of Walmart to this role It would be impossible to overstate Rob Waltons impact on Walmart and how personally committed he has been over the years said Penner Im deeply honored to follow in his footsteps and recognize the deep responsibility I have to our associates all shareholders and the Board Ive admired this company since my first Saturday morning meeting more than two decades ago I believe in its mission and the positive role it plays throughout the world I am excited about continuing to work with our outstanding senior management team and talented Walmart associates at all levels of the company Penner began his career at Goldman Sachs Co as an analyst specializing in corporate finance He then joined Walmart as a management trainee and held a number of positions throughout the company including Senior Vice President of Finance and Strategy for Walmartcom and Senior Vice President and CFO Japan Since he has been a general partner of investment management firm Madrone Capital Partners Penner joined the Walmart Board of Directors in He has served as chair of the Technology and eCommerce Committee and held positions on the Global Compensation and Strategic Planning and Finance Committees He is the soninlaw of Rob Walton A surprising transition although one which may make more sense when one compares the market caps of Walmart and its biggest challenger <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>which despite its far shorter history has nearly caught up to WMT Then again a quick look at the comparative fundamentals shows that perhaps any fears of AMZNs imminent dethroning of Americas retail king are premature Fri Orwell was right Fri Temporalist At least the vampire squids wont have to search for bottled babys blood anymore once there is a chief squid in charge Fri Dindu Nuffins Hes an inspiration to all of us working his way up from management trainee without any help A real upbyyourownbootstraps tale Fri NoDebt Freaking <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>market cap supported by sillystupid stock valuation God forbid <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>ever stops being run as a nonprofit and actually tries to make money Guess what They instantly lose market share because they wont have a price advantage any more Fri CrazyCooter I must admit I dont get <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>yet at the same time I spend tons of money with them because I get a very wide selection and can often get what I want with zero shipping And being as I live in the middle of no where with limited local selection at significant mark up I will continue to spend a ton of money with them That said I still dont get why they cant make a fucking profit All they have to do is charge a bit more but it seems zero profit is almost like a goal for their management team Fri NoDebt The story goes once they are big enough theyll flip the profit switch and start turning big chunks of those revenues into PROFIT Just not yet They need to eat WalMart first The problem comes when they decide to flip the profit switch Their prices wont be as competitive as they were before the revenues will start to drag and there just wont be as much profit as everyone thinks there will be Fri Robert Well if Wal Mart is forced to raise its wages may give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>a chance to start to raise prices while still beating them Wal Mart has a huge amount of stores very close to each to other I bet they start to close a lot of stores in the near future and may try to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>online in a much bigger way Fri NoDebt Thats true to a certain extent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt have or need nearly as many employees as WalMart per dollar sold WalMart has bigger buying leverage than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>right now which offsets that argument so some extent Thats why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is running sans profit until they can get big enough to reach that level of pricing leverage But as you say WalMart isnt going to sit there and just keep being beaten endlessly over the head without taking their own swings at the online world Go check out WalMarts online site if you have a minute Its definitely not to Amazons level but its a lot better than it used to be Fri TheMeatTrapper I often use WalMarts online store with the ship to store option You can order pretty much anything you want and have it shipped to the store free of charge You then drive to the store and pick it up when they email you and tell you its been delivered Its one way to not pay shipping when even <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>charges shipping on an item Fri jerry_theking_lawler Walmart is just a crappy grocery storethe dollar stores have nearly the same inventory as WM in a smaller more local box What WM does do is cater to the lower of the population But the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>model will only work in its current form If it eats WM and becomes the king and raises its margins then the next guy will step in with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>model and will eat AmazonIm certain it will be overly valued on future earnings also and never really make a return to justify its stock price which is about the same as of all stocks in the market now It is all just financial engineering based on the fed Fri Robert The other thing they have as well is they can pick up and move As states take action on the minium wage Wal Mart will get hurt due to not being able to just leave Wal Marts online isnt terrible I bet in the future one of the ways they help to lower labour needs is to move more to a model of a just having people order then be told when they can come pick it up If they could just become large grocery stores with a shipping department that can get any item at Wal Marts low prices I bet they could cut labour by a very large amount Fri NoDebt If youve ever seen an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>warehouseshipping center you know it would cost them a million times more to move one of them than it does for WalMart to shutter and move one of their stores But your point is well taken Fri Midas I buy stuff from them now and again but I have started to use them as a research tool I go there and use the ratings to find the product I want and then I usually find it for less on ebay The one thing I have been waiting for is for the manufacturers to just ship directly to my house What are they waiting for The shit could roll off the production line and get labelled with my name and address and dumped in the outgoing pile rather than stacked in a warehouse Fri Miffed Microbio I do the same Cooter I buy almost everything I can through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>primarily because of inventory issues at Walmart or other stores I used to make a monthly stop a Walmart for a long list of basic sundries but a few years ago it became a waste of time when I could find only part of what I needed It because far easier to order it all on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and with free shipping very similar in price <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is Aladdins Cave however Their sophisticated analysis of your shopping habits makes our local casino look penny ante Mindless impulsive clicking on things purposefully shown to attract you can destroy your budget I fight back by leaving my impulse selections in my shopping cart for months to taunt their algorithms Fri CrazyCooter If you set your browser to delete cookies or delete them manually they generally dont know who you are until you login I usually build a list of links or specific product names over a period of time until I get around to buying averages once a month The wife buys specific foods there now such as raw cashews or sticky rice due to pricequality which is crazy because the stuff isnt light For example with raw cashews she makes Rosemary roasted Cashshews yum Ingredients lb raw cashews Tbsp rosemary tsp cayenne tsp ground black or white pepper Tbsp honey Tbsp butter tsp salt Instructions Preheat oven to F In mixing bowl add honeybuttersalt and mix Add nuts and mix Add spices while mixing you want the spices to stick to the nuts Place nuts on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper Bake for minutes until cashews look light brown Pull cashews out of the oven and let it stand in room temperature for minutes to cool down before putting it into quart jars They come out soft like cookies and get hard again when they cool Just awesome out of the oven I learned about this style from Indian coworkers in years past they have many styles of spice blends extremely varied and often times you just cant find stuff like this locally Anyway back on topic I have noticed prices change sometimes though so you have to watch them I dont think they are as agressive with price changesetc as before but there has been many times I got to the shopping cart and was like WTF I am not paying for that LOL Would nto be surprised if Walmart came under the direct control of FEMADHS Just like GM is a gov corp pretending to be Americas carmaker The oilgarchs own the Fed It is the banks that run the system Money is real the doelar is not real Gold is the rey of light that bestows wealth hence it is real Fri Oh regional Indian Walmart with its multimillion daily guranteed footfalls is too juicy a target for everything from subliminals to bad food to toxic chinese shit Fri NoDebt WalMart is one of those publicprivate partnerships that all the cool kids in Washington DC are slobbering is the way to fix everything Fri sleigher Fri Oh regional Indian Fri Elliott Eldrich Ive seen those underground tunnel maps before supposedly theres a coasttocoast network of these tunnels I dont think thats even possible and heres why Check out the Seattle tunnel project thats going on right now with stateoftheart technology in They cant even get a machine to reliably cut two miles of tunnel without massive breakdowns and incredible cost overruns Fri Seasmoke This is how lost and I guess no longer give a fuck I care about this shit any more I was SURE today would be a thousand posts regarding Greece and Euro and instead one quick blurb post and the rest of these made up employment numbers rule the day If June cant even at least stick to the script than its all made up news anyway I hate blaming the messenger but we are all just wasting our time here Fri NoDebt Fri qx Shut down Goldman Sachs Arrest Lloyd Blankfein and the Walton Family for treason Redistribute their stolen wealth into a publicly owned and operated open source financial system Fri Bill of Rights Fri Yen Cross I was in a WMT a while back and the place looked like a dump I asked a kid where their USB sticks were and he had a headset on He just pointed the direction and kept on playing around with a display he was working on The shelves were empty and the prices were nothing to write home about Ive yet to see any real pricing advantage that WMT has I went over to Best Buy and got them cheaper and the service was better Fri Skip Sam Walton was a true American His children are the OPPOSITE They gave HUGE to get TPP passed they gave millions to Obongos and campaign They hired a Mexican national to run WM a few years back They are SWINE no insult to pigs meant Fri Skip I went to the local WalMart the other day after not visiting it in some time I noticed empty shelves in fact even the homes for products that are highsellers turns out they have a Mexican woman as the new manager I had inadvertently spoken with her when I called to inquire about a product The phone was answered by someone jabbering on in Spanish I said pardon me I only speak English she then said Sorry and HUNG UP ON ME Also there is a plethora of new Mexican hires it seems that ALL new hires there are Mexican Well WalMart used to sell MADE IN USA anyone remember that ad campaign Now it is a rd world toilet Fri jerry_theking_lawler And all of the displaced American workers are on SNAP EBT and SSI Disabilitythe American way why work when you can sit at home pop pills and get a free check Fri Mike Honcho I doubt Greg was a hour a week GS employee Some doors to corner offices magically open when born into corporate royalty If he is the gransdon of Sam and son in law of Robyuck Fri messystateofaffairs Ive seen China factory prices and Walmart retail prices on some of their stuff and itsvagood bet to say that Walmart transfer prices a whole lot if profit offshore Fri lasvegaspersona Neither Amzon nor WMT can compete with ebay I get items for shipped from China Economically that simply cannot be possible There is a glitch in postal regs As long as that continues though WMT and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will tread water Fri ConfederateH Really the only question you have to ask is is he
