investing in itself Its investments are hurting current earnings but the payoff will bring higher earnings One thing about investors I never understand is their disdain for a company investing in itself They seemingly hate when a company actually looks beyond the next quarter and spends some money to make itself more competitive down the road They often seem to prefer the company hoard money or even sell parts of it hindering future growth in order to give money to shareholders Is that an effective use of money CBS Corp NYSE CBS recently heeded calls to unlock value It spun off its outdoor billboard advertising company and used that money to buy back stocks Not a real shock here selling that part of the company cost it revenue and thus earnings and CBS just ended up buying the stock back at a high price That sort of return to shareholders I can do without thanks As it turns out WalMart NYSE WMT is now in the position of attempting to invest in itself and is being punished by shareholders for the upfront costs involved However if you have the wherewithal to look beyond the current expenses you will likely be handsomely rewarded when these investments pay off For such a steady and slowgrowth company thats a lot of volatility So why the big drop It has to do with a few things Higherthanexpected shrink a quarter ago a feeling that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN and online retailers are stealing WalMarts business and finally as alluded the decisions by WalMart to spend more money on its employees and digital infrastructure But theres more to this story in my opinion and this goes back to typical shortsightedness What set this up was the decision by former CEO of US operations Bill Simon to get away from the whole reason WalMart exists low prices He wanted more rational pricing and started instituting price hikes I remember it well because I thought it was a big mistake I was a fan of the previous head of US Operations Eduardo CastroWright who wanted to push WalMarts rockbottom prices even lower in order to absolutely strangle all competition Of course his strategy would have taken time to take effect and with typical investor impatience he was forced out in favor of Bill Simon who as you can read in my link started jacking up prices faster than Black Friday deals flying off shelves This all seemed like a great plan as the stock price soared with higher sales numbers but hidden were the seeds of problems to come as WalMart lost its lowcost leadership I saw this coming as did Kramer by the way because without low cost theres no reason to shop at WalMart now is there This finally started showing up in sales and after five quarters of negative US sales Bill Simon headed for the greener pastures of his old compadre Jeb Bushs campaign With that being said what can we expect from the new CEO of US operations Greg Foran Low prices thank God This guy gets it seemingly that value is the raison detre for the company This is one of my keys to value investing when management gets it They finally know there are problems have identified said issues and are taking steps to address them What else is management addressing as snags In addition to low prices WalMarts infamously low wages agreeing first to raise workers wages to then dollars an hour I think this is an outstanding idea for several reasons Lets turn to another chart Costco NASDAQ COST especially under Jim Sinegal has been known as one of the more lucrative retailer employers For this sector Costco actually has traditionally paid good wages This of course costs the company money upfront Looking at that chart does that seem to have hurt the company Not really Quite the opposite There is plenty of research showing that higherpaid retail associates actually increase sales The theory is that they are happier and more loyal to the company work harder and care about the companys success Additionally employee turnover is much lower and new hires are not cheap often costing about for each one at box retailers Its no coincidence Costco has the lowest turnover rate in retail Its costing WalMart about cents a share right now but it will most likely pay off with less shrink better service and higher sales Its also a nice public relations move as WalMart has always been dogged by the reputation as a company that doesnt care about its employees Better workers a better image likely higher sales and less mistakes and turnover Whats not to like The best thing here is that what WalMart does the others have to do It sets the standard in retail and I know this having a background working in retail If the company raises wages you better believe Home Depot NYSE HD Target NYSE TGT and everyone else will too When it cuts prices the others have to follow However rivals often cannot absorb the costs like WalMart can By cutting prices and raising wages the company is actually improving its competitive position I am sure of it as this puts pressure on all its competitors to do the same Not only is WalMart investing in its employees but the company is also spending money to ramp up its online business about cents a share Its an area of potentially huge growth and one that needs attention <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and others have become a growing threat for years to specialty brickandmortar stores like Best Buy NYSE BBY but they are even creeping in on staples like WalMart and WalMart an early innovator with Site to Store has really ignored its web business To stem this the company is all about improving the online experience and like its online rival <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is testing drones for faster delivery WalMart has a service similar to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime now And it is finding success in online grocery pickup Dont think that WalMart is on the losing end of a onesided match against its online rivals The company has an intrinsic advantage over the strictly online sellers in that it can leverage that huge store and delivery base as well as its scale for pricing While I think its unlikely it will overtake <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in online sales WalMart can still sell a lot As a matter of fact it already does at over billion last year it is the third biggest online retailer behind <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Apple NASDAQ AAPL Another cause of concern the last few quarters has been shrink which means goods lost but not accounted for These losses can be through employees mistakes or through theft and its a huge consideration for any retail outfit I have personally noticed WalMart addressing this Ive seen more warning signs more surveillance and more arrests of shoplifters yes I shop at WalMart frequently Its paying off to quote the quarterly report we are pleased with our efforts thus far on addressing shrink which has been a significant headwind for us this year Now that we understand what is causing some of the current share price drop lets look at WalMart in other ways This company is historically cheap valued at under X earnings Over the last decade it has usually been over X The yield is around and is very safe Get this revenue has increased every year for the last ten including the Great Recession Thats quite a statement and also brings up a good point about this company of all the Dow Jones corporations WalMart was the only one to actually have its stock price go up during the last recession Eventually there will be another downturn and WalMart and its value leadership will shine during that time You want to know something else funny Contrary to popular opinion WalMart is actually a company you can feel good about owning In addition to the raised wages it has actually committed to complete renewable power eventually The company does a lot to reduce waste and be efficient it feels this is smart business as well as good for the environment What you are seeing in WalMart now is the spread in its investment cycle it are spending the money to improve the company but hasnt seen the rewards yet This is impacting its earnings but reasonably this money spent should pay off in some fashion Ever look at Amazons earnings It doesnt actually make any money it spends most of it expanding the business I dont think anyone can argue this has been a successful strategy Most importantly WalMarts management understands what is wrong They realize their app is awful They know they have too much shrink They see that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a threat They finally realize that paying garbage wages gets you garbage work And best of all they get the most important fact WalMart is about low prices first and foremost These reasons make this a great time to buy the retail Goliath before its investments pay off We only use your contact
