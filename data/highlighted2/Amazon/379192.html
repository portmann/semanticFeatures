even of overall sales Apple however is optimistic about India and expects it to remain one of its fastestgrowing markets Theres no doubt the iPhone is Apples NASDAQ AAPL most important product and we cant deny that India is among the fastest growing smartphone markets in the world The good news for Apple investors is the company has cracked the Indian market successfully but will Apple continue to grow at elevated rates in India Before trying to answer the question let us try and understand where the iPhone stands in the scheme of things in India iPhone makes up more than twothird of Apples total worldwide sales by revenue Apples last reported quarter in India was its best ever in the country In the fiscal year that ended in September Apple shipped million iPhones in India In the first quarter of itself Apple shipped nearly iPhones which is close to half of what it shipped in four quarters of the preceding fiscal year In fact iPhone sales were up in India for the quarter compared to around in Korea the MiddleEast and Africa and just in China This is in complete contrast with the iPhones global sales growth of Now Indias revenue contribution to Apple can be gauged from the fact that Apple sold a total of million iPhones worldwide in just the last quarter while it shipped only units to India in the same period Also revenue from India hit billion in the Indian fiscal year that ended on March That was less than even of the billion in revenue Apple earned in its fiscal Moreover iPhones market share in India is only But this small market share is the reason why Apple is growing at such a terrific pace in India even though the companys revenue from the country is low Apple will find it challenging to continue growing at such an exceptional pace in India India hasnt been as successful as China for Apple India is a challenging market for Apple mainly because people in the country have weaker spending power than in China The iPhone is perceived to be an unnecessarily expensive product by most Indians even among those who can easily afford one In fact the government itself levies substantial import duties on the product as it is on the list of nonessentialsluxury items and Apple has been forced into price cuts to move units in the country For instance an iPhone s Plus GB retails for INR approx on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN India while the Samsung OTCSSNLF Galaxy S Edge with a bigger GB memory retails for INR approx Considering the fact that Indias per capita income over was just this is too much money to pay for a phone and the results can be clearly seen In India people are brand conscious but they do have slightly economical options such as Samsung which deliver more than what an average Indian expects out of a mobile phone Apple belongs to a different class And that class is in much smaller numbers than what Apple needs to get exorbitant growth numbers in India which is why it has to resort to discounts to sell units For instance Apples iPhone s saw weak sales when the device was launched in as distributors found it difficult to move inventories due to high prices Only after the company addressed the pricing challenge by providing more flexibility to retailers and distributors the inventory began to move Similarly the previous generation iPhone s also had to be sold on the cheap by Apple to increase the numbers This is because the average Indian simply drops the idea of buying an iPhone due to high price irrespective of his purchasing power The tendency to save money and buy more in the same amount stops him to buy the expensive Apple iPhone a trait that can be easily judged from the fact that Indians save the most money in the world and rather go for investments in appreciating assets In such a scenario an expensive iPhone does not make sense especially considering that Indias per capita income is so low Apple is trying to adapt to the Indian consumers behavior as there is huge opportunity over here In fact just of the phone market in India is made up of by smartphones while in China smartphones account for sales However Apple needs to understand that it needs more first time buyers in India right now Once they get locked into its ecosystem Apple can keep upgrading them to whatever it launches in the future Apple will benefit in this regard from growing wealth in the Indian middle class where an individuals wealth ranges between and annually meaning that prospective Apple customers are growing at a fast pace In fact the Indian middle class has grown by in the past years outpacing other regions such as the AsiaPacific Africa and Latin America But to get more first time buyers in India Apple needs to get its pricing strategy right and work its way up the income chain and capitalize on this growing middle class Moreover with a constraint on the pricing of its devices Apple will need to find other revenue streams Whatever small user base Apple has been able to garner in India it is building the ecosystem around it Moreover of late Apple has been bolstering its distribution network in India The company now has five distributors all across the country with three added recently By doing so Apple will be able to tap the fastgrowing market for premium smartphones in India By it is estimated that the market for premium smartphones in India will be worth million units which is significantly higher as compared to just million units last year Now on the back of its increasing distribution base the increasing spending power of the Indian middle class and Apples moves to make its services more economical it is expected the company will be able to tap half of this demand for premium smartphones The Apple brand is as coveted a status symbol in India as it is in China or the US But in the latter two markets Apple is entering the saturation zone On the other hand Apple hasnt seen much of India yet Hence India remains to be exploited by the company for its future growth especially as it is going to surpass the US as the secondlargest smartphone market in the world But investors should not forget Apple is making a number of smart moves in India such as improving the distribution base and reducing prices As a result the company should be able to capitalize on the fastgrowing premium smartphone market
