(Uncertainty) </span>And that class is in much smaller numbers than what Apple needs to get exorbitant growth numbers in India, which is why it has to resort to discounts to sell units.For instance, Apple's iPhone 6s saw weak sales when the device was launched in 2015 as distributors found it difficult to move inventories due to high prices.Only after the company addressed the pricing challenge by providing more flexibility to retailers and distributors, the inventory began to move.Similarly, the previous generation iPhone 5s also had to be sold on the cheap by Apple to increase the numbers.This is because the average Indian simply drops the idea of buying an iPhone due to high price irrespective of his purchasing power.The tendency to save money and buy more in the same amount stops him to buy the expensive Apple iPhone, a trait that can be easily judged from the fact that Indians save the most money in the world and rather go for investments in appreciating assets.In such a scenario, an expensive iPhone does not make sense, especially considering that India's per capita income is so low.Apple is trying to adapt to the Indian consumer's behavior as there is huge opportunity over here.In fact, just 40% of the phone market in India is made up of by smartphones, while in China, smartphones account for 90% sales.However, Apple needs to understand that it needs more first time buyers in India right now.Once they get locked into its ecosystem, Apple can keep upgrading them to whatever it launches in the future.Apple will benefit in this regard from growing wealth in the Indian middle class, where an individual's wealth ranges between $50,000 and $500,000 annually, meaning that prospective Apple customers are growing at a fast pace.In fact, the Indian middle class has grown by 150% in the past 15 years, outpacing other regions such as the Asia-Pacific, Africa and Latin America.But, to get more first time buyers in India, Apple needs to get its pricing strategy right and work its way up the income chain and capitalize on this growing middle class.Moreover, with a constraint on the pricing of its devices, Apple will need to find other revenue streams.Whatever small user base Apple has been able to garner in India, it is building the ecosystem around it.Moreover, of late, Apple has been bolstering its distribution network in India.The company now has five distributors all across the country, with three added recently.By doing so, Apple will be able to tap the fast-growing market for premium smartphones in India.By 2018, it is estimated that the market for premium smartphones in India will be worth 35 million units, which is significantly higher as compared to just 15 million units last year.Now, on the back of its increasing distribution base, the increasing spending power of the Indian middle class, and Apple's moves to make its services more economical, it is expected the company will be able to tap half of this demand for premium smartphones.The Apple brand is as coveted a status symbol in India as it is in China or the U.S. But, in the latter two markets, Apple is entering the saturation zone.On the other hand, Apple hasn't seen much of India yet.Hence, India remains to be exploited by the company for its future growth, especially as it is going to surpass the U.S. as the second-largest smartphone market in the world.But, investors should not forget Apple is making a number of smart moves in India, such as improving the distribution base and reducing prices.As a result, the company should be able to capitalize on the fast-growing premium smartphone market in the country going forward.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Personal Computers</div></body></html>
