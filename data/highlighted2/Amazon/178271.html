In the Q2 earnings release, Box mentioned that 52% of Fortune 500 companies and 28% of Global 2000 companies use Box's solutions.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Box presents a gradual increase in these two factors as well as <i>more</i> registered users and <i>larger</i> partnership networks .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As I mentioned above , I <b>believe</b> the consumer cloud services market is going through an accelerated process of commoditization where Apple , Google , Microsoft and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> offer very attractive pricing . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Box cannot get into pricing wars with these giants in the slowing consumer market.To win in the long term, Box should strive to become a leader in the consumer segment while transforming to a follower in the consumer market.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the enterprise/business segment , Box should become <i>more</i> competitive , increase its network and ecosystem , as it did lately with the IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) partnership , and rebuild the company as an enterprise-focused service .  (Surprise) </span>At the same time, while consumer prices drop rapidly, Box should remain competitive, so it will not become obsolete, and match its prices to its competitors.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the event that Box becomes a leader in the enterprise segment in a few years ' time , it <b>could</b> then invest in the consumer segment once again .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For investors interested in benefiting from the expected surge in cloud storage , Box , at its current price , <b>might</b> be an attractive long-term alternative .
