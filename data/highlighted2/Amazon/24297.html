<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has allowed users to review products the company is taking legal action against businesses it claims sells fake reviews to thirdparty sellers The Seattle Times reports that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>filed a lawsuit Wednesday in a Washington state court against four websites BuyAmazonReviewscom BayReviewsnet BuyReviewsNowcom and BuyAzonReviewscom and their operators accusing the companies of an array of illegal business practices that undermine customer trust and the integrity of the online retailer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>says in the lawsuit that it actively monitors its website for false misleading and inauthentic reviews However in certain instances that practice hasnt been sufficient leading the company to determine legal action was necessary Despite substantial efforts to stamp out the practice an unhealthy ecosystem is developing outside of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to supply inauthentic reviews the suit states Defendants businesses consist entirely of selling such reviews The lawsuit details a variety of allegedly illegal practices including trademark infringement false advertising and violations of the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act and the Washington Consumer Protection Act used by the defendant businesses in order to facilitate the creation of positive paid reviews For example <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>claims that buyazonreviewscom promises that for to per review it will provide fivestar writeups in a slowdrip manner as to avoid detection by the retailer The site also allegedly tells potential customers to simply ship empty packages in an effort to fool <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>into believing the reviewer was a verified purchaser GeekWire reports that in one instance buyazonreviewscom chastised a reviewer for complaining that they had not received a product telling the company paying for the review All our reviewers know of the process and I am not sure as to why she sent this to you but I will ensure it does not happen in the future Similarly named buyamazonreviewscom allegedly promised that customers can have unlimited and star reviews this week while Bayreviewsnet used Amazons logo to advertise a unique system that generates high quality rating reviews to your Kindle eBook the suit states Defendants are misleading Amazons customers and tarnishing Amazons brand for their own profit and the profit of a handful of dishonest sellers and manufacturers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>claims in the lawsuit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is bringing this action to protect its customers from this misconduct by stopping defendants and disrupting the marketplace in which they participate However the owner of buyamazonreviewscom objects to Amazons characterization of the companys business practices He tells The Seattle Times that his company simply helps Amazons thirdparty sellers get reviews by connecting them to consumers willing to write those reviews We are not selling fake reviews he said noting that in many cases reviewable products are offered at a discount However we do provide Unbiased and Honest reviews on all the products And this is not illegal at all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is seeking unspecified damages and requests that the sites cease and desist activities related to the retailer provide information on each fake review created and the accounts of the people who paid for them <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sues to block fake reviews on its site The Seattle Times Click to print Opens
