been some negative comments regarding the current PE of X for Amazons shares There continues amongst some investors to be a severe underappreciation of the prospects for AWS In particular the margin opportunities for AWS when considered in a holistic fashion may surprise some readers The valuation of the many unique offerings of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in its retail sector can prove daunting to analyze That being said I used a growth and terminal operating margins which seems a reasonable set of assumptions There have recently been articles on this site and from other analysts regarding Amazons NASDAQ AMZN headlinegrabbing valuation at X EPS on trailing earnings Contributor Michael Boyd recently wrote an interesting piece regarding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and its valuation He wrote that he has no dog in the race I do I buy a little every quarter Michaels approach is quite a reasonable one but much of my career has been spent analyzing businesses as much as stocks I am more comfortable looking at the pieces of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>rather than trying to look at its financial metrics as a whole There really is no one right way I think in building a valuation model for this company One thing I will point out regardless of how anyone wants to approach the task of valuing AMZN start with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services I think its potential is still underestimated It is to an extent hidden within the metrics of a retailer although its financial metrics are completely different At some point and I have no idea when it will make sense for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to sell some fraction of AWS to the public It would command a much higher valuation than it does today and would help investors understand its business trends far better than is possible these days The keys to evaluating a growth company any growth company are going to be how long it can sustain growth well above the mean and how much will be so called steady state operating margins That may be selfevident to be sure but it is amazing how seldom people try to address those issues I have tried an approach that some might label reductio ad absurdum I did this to illustrate the point that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>even at these levels is a strong buy for me I chose to illustrate the point by turning off the growth engine but also the expense engine after five years Of course it wont happen that way I suspect that while growth percentages will decline over time they will be far above the mean in both for AWS and what I call everything else But I think the approach outlines the real value in investing in the shares when there is so much FUD regarding its socalled excessive valuation I recently wrote a piece on AWS and its prospects and its valuation I didnt try to go much beyond what I thought were the prospects for AWS because I thought and think that the investment case for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can be made exclusively by looking at the prospects and valuation of AWS In this article I will try to look at the other parts of Amazons business as well I will also go through a fiveyear scenario for AWS that tries to explore what happens to a large subscription company whose growth rate regresses to just above the mean The results may surprise you I chose five years for several reasons One is that it is hard to find market analysis that goes out more than five years If they cant do it why do I think that I can Another major issue is that this is really the technology business we are discussing and black swans have an increasingly greater probability of emerging the further out in time that one goes And finally the further out in time one goes the issues of market share and secular growth become harder and harder to evaluate on any other basis than a guess Just to put that comment in context if you go back six years how many readers if told that AWS would be the principal driving force in terms of Amazons valuation and growth how many would have agreed with that premise Not many I will bet and certainly not this writer Very few market research firms try making projections beyond five years because the methodology that they use primarily surveys has little relevance beyond that point One of the big issues with using a fiveyear methodology is just how different a company like AWS might look if it didnt need to invest for growth at the rate that it now does At the moment AWS is a voracious consumer of capital expenditures as it tries to keep pace with usage growth new features and new availability zones The company said it added no fewer than new features to the AWS offering in just this past quarter and that is up from new features in the year earlier period AWS plans to add new zones this year to the it already has When the zones are opened it will incur most of the expenses and little of the revenue of existing availability zones Reduce the growth from to a singledigit number and much of that expense goes away These days AWS cuts some prices for some services every quarter Usage is rising faster than revenue Usage rising faster than revenues is a sure prescription to limit margin expansion Last fall <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>said that the company had reached the billion dollar run rate in database revenue Of course in this call the CFO said he wouldnt give out that kind of number anymore As a substitute he talked about the companys new Aurora data base service which has he said been the fastest growing product in the companys history Of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>claims that Aurora has X the performance at th the price of MySQL which is an Oracle NYSE ORCL product I think readers just might want to take a look at the reference to see what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has developed The reference is from an independent evaluation and speaks to the kind of innovation that the company seems to be able to develop But it costs a huge amount of money to build and support new data base facilities and at this writing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is supporting five database options If you envision a world with midsingledigit growth then a profit maximizing company will start to limit user choice The classic way to do this kind of analysis is to select a terminal point in my case and then assume a terminal growth rate and discount back to present value In fact if you look at some of the published brokerage research reports on the company that is the way they derive their price targets The problem with that approach if you are trying to write a balanced article is that you have to defend the discount rate you use and the risk of your estimates being offbase So I have used a different approach that more or less simulates the results one would get in trying to discount the future returns to present value Given just how high analysts can get their oneyear price target I believe that the approach in the balance of the note is a bit more balanced and produces fewer anomalous conclusions But of course some readers will disagree Usually the biggest factor in this approach is to figure out what the terminal multiple ought to be at the end of the analysis ie the PE or the cash flow multiple which is really the traditional and most accurate way to try to establish a fair value I thought about doing it just that way but the mechanics of trying to display the calculations and the assumptions are tedious So I decided I would use a far simpler approach and simply assign terminal PEs to the terminal earnings based on current comps To do so I am going to break up <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>into two pieces as one really has little to do with the other And I will look at comps in order to establish a terminal PE If it isnt quite accurate well nothing really is perfect in this regard That is going to lead to two different terminal PEs but it is very uncomfortable to hitch a thoroughbred and a dray horse to the same buggy Companies can have radically different experiences in old age or even middle age Largecap growth names such as EMC NYSE EMC HPE NYSE HPE IBM NYSE IBM Oracle and Cisco NASDAQ CSCO have little or no growth in prospect Any of them would kill these days just to have a few years of topline growth And for the most part they are valued that way HPE has recently been split and is to split again so its current valuations are not usable EMC is about to be bought by Dell so its metrics are without use in this analysis Given the travails in the enterprise storage space I assume its multiple would be even lower as it continues to shrink without much hope for a turnaround IBM has a PE of X based on trailing GAAP earnings ORCL has a PE of X on that basis and CSCO has a PE of about X Companies such as those are probably not worth X GAAP profit because they arent growing at all or are shrinking And then there are companies such as Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT that is in the middle stages of its transition and has a valuation befitting that position with a GAAP based PE of X That valuation excludes a special onetime charge that is really onetime And finally there are companies such as Adobe NASDAQ ADBE whose transition is in its late stages and which has much higher valuations despite its size At the moment ADBE has a GAAP PE of X When looking at the above analysis it isnt going to be all that straightforward to assign a terminal PE to AWS There isnt a company on that list that is a good analog with where I imagine <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services is going to be in unless it might be Adobe I think as I will explain below that earnings growth for AWS is likely to be far greater than it is for any of these companies other than Adobe Trying to forecast revenue growth forward from is more than a fraught exercise it is a bit foolish when almost certainly there will be new and unknown technologies to consider So what multiple of terminal earnings should I use The biggest trend and one that has been going on for the past decade or so in the IT world has been the desire of all IT companies to develop revenue streams that are recurring and are not subject to the vagaries of quarterly sales performance Investors are going to pay more for companies whose earnings have great visibility and avoid the inherent seasonality and lumpiness of traditional business models in the IT world As it happens there is a happy confluence between a new emerging technology and a new business model that allows vendors if they manage the transition a happy ending We can see that at work in Adobe I believe that there are signs that Microsoft as well is on the cusp of making that transition The most interesting things about these new models call them subscription or SaaS or Cloud is that they are all very similar financially if not from a technology point of view The other interesting thing is that no one has any experience with how profitable these businesses might be Adobe began its transition five to six years and ago and it really has just been visible in the topline headline numbers in the past year or so I wrote about the transition at Microsoft a few weeks ago and visibility as to what its model will be when it is finished is quite murky to say the least Obviously I am not going to use a terminal multiple for AWS of X it would yield foolish results But I think a terminal multiple greater than X makes sense I think a very conservative multiple of X might be adequate for this exercise But X is really very conservative Not because I know what the growth rate is to be for AWS at that point but using the assumptions I have laid out whatever earnings are for AWS those earnings will be highly visible far into the future The churn for AWS is likely very low at this point and will almost certainly be lower by as there is likely to have been some significant industry consolidation between then and now Now lets try to apply a fiveyear model to AWS and see what we get The last quarterly results for AWS showed a revenue run rate of just over billion a yearoveryear growth of and operating margins of That comes to billion Stockbased comp for AWS is running at million as reported <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>actually reported AWSs operating income of million last quarter net of stockbased comp So the current run rate of AWSs nonGAAP operating income is about billion It isnt all that easy to estimate what a tax rate for AWS might be And we dont really know how much of Amazons million of net interest expense ought to be charged to AWS Just to make this simple I will charge AWS with all of the interest expense and accrue a tax rate Those are clearly conservative assumptions I could try making some other assumptions on the capital intensity of the business in a low growth state but I have no way to validate those assumptions I do believe that it is evident that in a low growth state AWS will be generating so much cash that the issue is going to be a capital return program for the shareholders of that time and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will not be paying any net interest That statement is likely to bring howls of derision from some readers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has most recently been spending about billion to build out its data centers just to keep up with demand and it continues to enter into capital lease commitments to support the new AWS data centers And it has been doing so in an environment in which the cost of the equipment necessary to build the data centers has been falling dramatically The very nature of the infrastructureasaservice space is capital intensive That is one reason why barriers to entry are so high But when growth regresses close to the mean the capital investment necessary for data centers will disappear as well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services was launched about a decade ago and it was a long time before it became a platform for more than thirdparty developers and for Amazons internal usage If you had suggested a decade ago that AWS would be driving of Amazons operating profits these days most industry analysts would have wanted you institutionalized So I think it is only prudent to discuss what already exists at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and not attempt to conjure things that might or might not become significant It is hard enough just dealing with that There are about as many forecasts as to the future growth of spending in the infrastructureasaservice market as there are people to write them Gartner uses as its growth estimate for the space over the next five years ending in That yields about a billion run rate in for AWS in if it doesnt start to gain share by consolidating the space Another firm called the Next Data Platform uses a forecast with five potential growth scenarios The central tendency of its forecast would yield AWS revenues of billion again without considering market share gains by MKM Partners has a report whose terminal year is and it forecasts AWS revenues of billion in that year I think to keep the analysis simple the use of billion in annual revenues in is reasonably conservative and will not involve debates as to whether or not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will take more market share or on the success of public vs hybrid and private clouds Now what is the operating margin likely to be in that terminal year Forecasting terminal revenue is far simpler than forecasting terminal margins The problem in forecasting operating margins is something called the waterfall effect By that I do not mean the cataracts at either Niagara or Iguazu but the fact that there will be different levels of operating margins for each of the years in which AWS is sold Many readers perhaps do not appreciate just how sticky AWS installations will be for most customers especially as more and more standard workloads are transferred to the cloud The costs of migration to someone elses cloud are high and will be higher still the more standard workloads migrate to the cloud Changing cloud vendors is nothing at all like changing cellphone vendors Users do and will continue to have multiple cloud vendors in an effort to reduce reliance on a single service supplier but over time the impetus to standardize on a single vendor is more rather than less likely to prove irresistible Some users merge of course and some use cases change or become obsolete which is why there is appreciable churn but for the most part renewal revenues simply keep piling up year after year We dont precisely know what the expense items might be for AWS at this point But we can take some reasonable guesses Most cloud software companies have a cost of goods of about A lot of that will be accounting for the expense of running redundant data centers and in ensuring that any customer issues are promptly remediated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>at this point has scale but not a huge scale when compared to other cloud vendors so I will guess that it has a comparable but slightly lower cost of goods The major outsized expense items for most cloud vendors are sales and marketing and RD Since AWS is already achieving nonGAAP operating margins those items are going to be significantly less as a percentage of revenues than would be typical in looking at most other cloud vendors Just as a starting point lets imagine that SM spend is already down to of revenues That is still billionyear in spending RD is likely to be high but how high Maybe of revenues That is billionyear Which leaves or millionyear for GA spend That all works out to billion of what is traditionally called operating expense leaving AWS with a nonGAAP margin of actually a bit below the operating margin reported last quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>reports that it spends million of operating spend on technology and content Obviously that isnt all AWS The company also reports marketing spend of billion and GA spend of million It has no RD expense category at all but it does report fulfillment costs of billion and that is up year on year I doubt that AWS sells itself The operation has salesmen quotas and loads of people who do marketing things such as write product literature and ensure that every analyst living writes reviews of their services <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>really reports more like the retailer that it has been rather than the technology company it is becoming and that makes trying to put a proforma PL together very difficult But even if I have gotten some of the buckets wrong as I am sure is the case the conclusions that I draw arent going to be all that much effected Now take these numbers and speculate what they are going to be for a company that is no longer trying to grow at more than Obviously in such a world gross margins are going to increase <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has to hire ahead and build ahead so it has new capacity to sell And over time the costs of running data centers will decline both because of scale economies and because more and more tasks in a data center become automated and the costs of what goes into a data center continue to fall <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has cut prices more than times over the years for AWS offerings It knows the game and part of the game is that keeping low prices ensures its market share But in a world in which there are few new customers to be had and in which there are substantial user expenses involved with attempting to migrate that pattern is likely to change significantly Because of its scale <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is always likely to be the lowcost service provider which is a massive deterrent to competitors launching price wars They the competitors can only lose Some competitors such as Azure have their own builtin advantages when it comes to the current Microsoft users migrating to a Microsoft cloud Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL has its own unique strategy But for competitors that are competing for new workloads trying to undercut <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is not the course that would seem to maximize profit How high can gross margins go It certainly seems that forecasting a jump of percentage points in a lowgrowth world is pretty conservative How much should a company that is no longer fighting to capture new customers need to spend on sales and marketing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will no doubt still be trying to sell its installed base additional features and capabilities It will be trying to get hybrid cloud users to migrate more of their daytoday applications to the cloud and to give up on their own data centers And it will still have to negotiate very large renewals and master agreements with its customers There will be work to do But nothing like the work of trying to find and close massive new name accounts As I wrote quantifying these kinds of changes is really difficult But I imagine that AWS could do lots of sales and marketing for billion That is still double the dollar amount I have assumed that it is spending now and this is a world with few new name customers We all know that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has proven to be a ceaseless innovator in terms of its business Most of the publicity surrounds its efforts in logistics but it has and will continue to spend massive amounts to innovate features in its cloud There are readers who doubtless know of the features that AWS lacks today that are offered by other competitors in the space <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will certainly do what it takes to retain its leading position in terms of the rankings given out by market research consultants It will continue to innovate at substantial rates But in dollars what does that mean Could an RD budget of billion be adequate to support all of the tasks needed to be done in a world in without much growth and by extension a world in which innovation is slowing dramatically I think forecasting that RD spending doubles in dollars makes sense for the world as it might be in And obviously the company will do all in its power to reduce the size of its GA expense category I will forecast million of GA spending by So gross margins of and overall operating expense of just less than billion That really works out to operating profits of billion or I will pare that number by in the interest of conservatism which is consistent to operating margins of about and round down to billion of operating profits I am sure that there is going to be push back from readers about my projections for operating margins But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is not a traditional software company although even Oracle at one time before its misadventures with Sun had operating margins that were surpassing It is just the math of what happens when the vast preponderance of revenues is recurring You can still glimpse a bit of that effect if you look at Oracles current PL and look at the incredible profits it makes on its own installed base Oracle only gets around half of its revenues from maintenance and those revenues generate all of the companys profits more or less In the case of AWS all of the revenues will be coming from recurring sources and just as Oracles maintenance customers are quite stick so are the customers of AWS both now and in the future Earlier in this article I mentioned taxes and stockbased comp and interest costs Lets for the moment assume that stockbased comp and interest costs lower profits to billion and that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>pays a blended tax rate of So that is billionyear in aftertax profits that are highly visible and easy to forecast X that and one gets a value of billion for AWS based on a reasonable set of assumptions for Do I imagine that all readers will accept my assumptions Of course not There will be readers who will challenge my assumptions on growth and profit potential and all manner of other things And just for the record there is no way that the growth of AWS in terms of either revenues or profits will be a straight line was a much less good year for AWS on a percentage growth basis than was The real world would be so much simpler if it were a straight line than if it were not an unsightly series of bumps and curves But at the end of the day there is this relationship between growth assumptions expenses and terminal PEs Readers may not like to hear about operating margins Thats fine but the alternative would be much faster growth and a significantly higher terminal PE So what about the rest of the company Of course there is the other of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>The part that sells billion of things and content and which has never made all that much money doing so It is interesting to look at the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>press release for Q One would have to go through business highlights including such seminal events including the leasing of new planes or that Prime is now available in Belgium before the first mention of AWS Indeed without trying to rate the significance of all business highlights listed before the first mention of AWS it is surely evident just from reading the list that this company is involved in a massive exercise to prove that it has a bright future in selling things other than web services To an extent the earnings release is all about denying and obscuring the extent to which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has become an IT company that happens to sell other products There is much that has been written about the rest of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>And there are many many issues in terms of assessing its growth and profitability I doubt that anything I write is going to end the debate about the inherent profitability of the companys retail operations I have done a few things to make the analysis simpler I have attributed all of the interest cost generated by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to AWS I have attributed the lions share of the stockbased comp to AWS So far at least people who work in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>fulfillment do not seem to require stock options in order to come to work I could no doubt offer some profound witty and insightful comments regarding the rollout of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Next or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fresh I think if you are less than a certain age it is important to write LOL after that And no doubt my opinion on the value of Amazons content or the course of its thirdparty seller business is equally valuable And as to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Echo well I have yet to see a forecast with much quantification that makes sense The Gartner view of the billion market opportunity is nice but what that actually means for Echo revenues is a different story It is an amazing product no doubt but I really am no more an expert on it or the other items that animate much discussion than any other reasonably informed observer I know that the debates as to the ultimate success of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in the grocery business or its effort to deliver packages in two hours are very serious subjects and many electrons have been used to dissect what these issues all mean to AMZNs shareholders and potential shareholders It is just that I do not think anyone alive can have that much value add on such a wide range of subjects As an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>consumer over many years I have had a very favorable set of experiences with the company perhaps that colors my opinion and likely other readers have not had such favorable experiences Being a Prime member I use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for just about everything I can On the other hand I do not consume streaming media so I can offer no opinions about that segment of the companys business which is said to have the potential to disrupt Netflix NASDAQ NFLX And having a home assistant such as Echo is a bit outside the ambit of my consumer preferences Writing about all of those issues would be tedious and would not increase the probability of anyone making a better investment decision with regards to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>I have chosen to simplify and to simplify dramatically in order to come up with some operating assumptions I will start by pulling out the AWS piece of Amazons AWS revenues are reasonably projected to do about billion in and the current consensus for fullyear <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>revenue estimate is billion So everything else at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>starts at billion Those revenues are simply not going to grow as fast as revenues including the growth engine of AWS By when my analysis ends billion has to come off the revenue line to account for my estimate of AWS revenues That leaves billion of everything else revenues for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>That is still growth through the period which I think is a reasonable expectation Gross margins in everything else are inevitably going to be significantly less than they will be for AWS in a lowgrowth environment AWS sells a service and for the most part the rest of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sells products I am going to estimate that gross margins in the everything else category are going to rise to in And what of other operating expenses I made some assumptions guesses if you prefer regarding the actual operating expenses for AWS Those came to an annual run rate of billion this current year That leaves everything else with other expenses of about billion Overall I have forecast revenue growth for everything else for the fiveyear span at The growth of other expense for the other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in a slowing growth environment ought to be less than the growth rate of revenues The rapid growth in fulfillment and marketing costs ought to abate GA is clearly going to be a source of operating leverage In any event if I have forecast fiveyear revenue growth of I will forecast fiveyear other expense growth of I think the leverage will likely be greater but I want to be conservative as well That takes the other expense category to just short of billion Now we can put together some kind of estimate for the everything else piece of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Revenues of billion gross margins of billion and operating expenses of billion yield an operating profit of billion That is a operating margin which seems to be a reasonable assumption With an assumed tax rate and all of the expenses for interest and most stockbased comp expense borne by AWS that leaves a net profit of billion If I use an X multiple on that amount it yields a valuation of billion There are lots of numbers and lots of assumptions I have to wonder seriously how it might be that a company such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would go to the lengths and effort it has gone to achieve a retail business that by that time will be half the size of WalMart so that it could earn a margin I doubt that is the managements plan or expectation On the other hand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>hasnt really ever made a significant margin on its retail business in years Maybe operating margin would be a fantastic accomplishment There are writers on this site who suggest that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is not and will not be competitive with popular priced apparel chains or with very lowpriced discount chains I do not have enough knowledge to want to dispute those assertions but I do find them a bit glib I read part of an interview with the CEO of one of the lowercost discount chains who said that because of the very low average sale in his stores that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could not compete These days if you want you can get free shipping at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for month and it will deliver a set of dishtowels for free A company that spends quite as much money as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does on what I would normally think of as RD is eventually going to develop a lower cost structure than even the lowest cost structure of the discount operators Not that I am a big fashion consumer personally but with all of the thirdparty sellers on the site it is simply hard to imagine that there is any popular priced retailer that can offer more choices in their store than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>offers online Technology properly applied can change lots of well thought through expectations and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has disrupted space after space over the years It means to me that investors can use some reasonably conservative estimates based on a regression to the mean methodology investors can reach a fair <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>valuation of billion which is greater than the current enterprise value of the company Readers can and I am sure they will dispute different parts of the analysis There will be some who wont believe that AWS will quadruple sales in five years I personally think that AWS will do better than that There are others who think that forecasting operating margins is absurd As I have tried to point out Oracle really did have operating margins of not that long ago before it embarked on some foolish misadventures I used a very modest PE on terminal earnings for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>because I used a terminal growth rate far more modest than is likely Change the growth rate assumption and lower the margin Then you need to assume a higher terminal PE Or assume reversion to the mean When AWS becomes a highsingledigit grower its margins will soar But it isnt quite logical to assume both sides of the same coin at the same time The PE and the lack of significant free cash flow it was billion last year and that excludes capital lease commitments which were significant are not the end all and be all of investing in hypergrowth technology names and AWS with a growth rate at some level of scale is as much a hypergrowth name as anything I know in the IT space <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>growth will inevitably slow And its PE will inevitably decline But the E component can explode beyond levels imagined by many Buying AMZNs shares is a great choice to achieve positive alpha Many investors deride Amazons valuation of PE as absurd I set out to prove that not only is the PE reasonable but that it also represents a rational entry point for growthoriented investors I used some of the methodology that contributor Michael Boyd used in his recent article on Amazons valuation I chose to separate the two pieces of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as they have little to do with each other from a business perspective I looked at some different growth rate scenarios for AWS Then I tried to use a holistic approach to forecast margins Growth and margins are really inextricably interconnected for AWS I developed margins that some readers may find incredible but I think that using a holistic approach often yields some conclusions that people may find incredible I conducted something of the same exercise for everything else at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>That valuation doesnt seem to be much of an outlier All told the assumptions I used produced an expected valuation of billion by almost above current quotations So yes I do think that rational investors have it right in taking positions in Amazons shares at this point It will produce significant positive alpha particularly for longterm investors I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article
