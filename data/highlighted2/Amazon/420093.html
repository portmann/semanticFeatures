( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha There have recently been some negative comments regarding the current P/E of 294X for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's shares . There continues, amongst some investors, to be a severe under-appreciation of the prospects for AWS.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In particular , the margin opportunities for AWS , when considered in a holistic fashion , <b>may</b> <b>surprise</b> some readers .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The valuation of the many unique offerings of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in its retail sector can prove daunting to analyze . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That being said , I used a 16 % growth and 5 % terminal operating margins , which seems a reasonable set of <b>assumptions</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>There have recently been articles on this site and from other analysts regarding <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) headline-grabbing valuation at 294X EPS on trailing earnings . Contributor Michael Boyd recently wrote an interesting piece regarding <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and its valuation . He wrote that he has no dog in the race.I do.I buy a little every quarter.Michael's approach is quite a reasonable one, but much of my career has been spent analyzing businesses as much as stocks.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I am <i>more</i> comfortable looking at the pieces of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> rather than trying to look at its financial metrics as a whole . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>There really is no one right way I think in building a valuation model for this company.One thing I will point out regardless of how anyone wants to approach the task of valuing AMZN , start with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services . I think its potential is still underestimated.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is , to an extent , <b>hidden</b> within the metrics of a retailer although its financial metrics are completely different .  (Uncertainty) </span>At some point , and I have no idea when , it will make sense for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to sell some fraction of AWS to the public . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It would command a much <i>higher</i> valuation than it does today and would help investors understand its business trends far <i>better</i> than is <b>possible</b> these days .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The keys to evaluating a growth company, any growth company, are going to be how long it can sustain growth well above the mean and how much will be so called "steady state" operating margins.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>That may be self-evident to be sure , but it is <b>amazing</b> how <b>seldom</b> people try to address those issues .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I have tried an approach that some <b>might</b> label `` reductio ad absurdum . ''  (Uncertainty) </span>I did this to illustrate the point that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , even at these levels , is a strong buy for me . I chose to illustrate the point by turning off the growth engine - but also the expense engine after five years.Of course, it won't happen that way.I suspect that while growth percentages will decline over time, they will be far above the mean in 2021, both for AWS and what I call "everything else."But I think the approach outlines the real value in investing in the shares when there is so much FUD regarding its so-called excessive valuation.I recently wrote a piece on AWS and its prospects and its valuation.I did n't try to go much beyond what I thought were the prospects for AWS because I thought and think that the investment case for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can be made exclusively by looking at the prospects and valuation of AWS . In this article , I will try to look at the other parts of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's business as well . I will also go through a five-year scenario for AWS that tries to explore what happens to a large subscription company whose growth rate regresses to just above the mean.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The results <b>may</b> <b>surprise</b> you .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I chose five years for several reasons.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>One is that it is hard to find market analysis that goes out <i>more</i> than five years .  (Surprise) </span>If they can't do it, why do I think that I can?<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Another major issue is that this is really the technology business we are discussing , and black swans have an increasingly <i>greater</i> <b>probability</b> of emerging the <i>further</i> out in time that one goes .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And finally , the <i>further</i> out in time one goes , the issues of market share and secular growth become <i>harder</i> and <i>harder</i> to evaluate on any other basis than a guess .  (Surprise) </span>Just to put that comment in context , if you go back six years , how many readers , if told that AWS would be the principal driving force in terms of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's valuation and growth , how many would have agreed with that premise ? Not many I will bet, and certainly, not this writer.Very few market research firms try making projections beyond five years because the methodology that they use - primarily surveys - has little relevance beyond that point.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One of the big issues with using a five-year methodology is just how different a company like AWS <b>might</b> look if it did n't need to invest for growth at the rate that it now does .  (Uncertainty) </span>At the moment, AWS is a voracious consumer of capital expenditures as it tries to keep pace with usage growth, new features and new availability zones.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company said it added no <i>fewer</i> than 210 new features to the AWS offering in just this past quarter and that is up from 170 new features in the year <i>earlier</i> period .  (Surprise) </span>AWS plans to add 11 new zones this year to the 33 it already has.When the zones are opened, it will incur most of the expenses and little of the revenue of existing availability zones.Reduce the growth from 64% to a single-digit number and much of that expense goes away.These days, AWS cuts some prices for some services every quarter.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Usage is rising <i>faster</i> than revenue .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Usage rising <i>faster</i> than revenues is a sure prescription to limit margin expansion .  (Surprise) </span>Last fall , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> said that the company had reached the billion dollar run rate in database revenue . Of course, in this call, the CFO said he wouldn't give out that kind of number anymore.As a substitute he talked about the company's new Aurora data base service , which has, he said, been the fastest growing product in the company's history.Of course , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> claims that Aurora has 5X the performance at 1/10th the price of MySQL , which is an Oracle ( NYSE : ORCL ) product . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think readers just <b>might</b> want to take a look at the reference to see what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has developed . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The reference is from an independent evaluation and speaks to the kind of innovation that the company <b>seems</b> to be able to develop .  (Uncertainty) </span>But it costs a huge amount of money to build and support new data base facilities , and at this writing , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is supporting five database options . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you envision a world with mid-single-digit growth , then a profit maximizing company will start to limit user choice .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The classic way to do this kind of analysis is to select a terminal point - in my case 2021 - and then <b>assume</b> a terminal growth rate and discount back to present value .  (Uncertainty) </span>In fact, if you look at some of the published brokerage research reports on the company, that is the way they derive their price targets.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The problem with that approach if you are trying to write a balanced article is that you have to defend the discount rate you use and the <b>risk</b> of your estimates being off-base .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So , I have used a different approach that <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> simulates the results one would get in trying to discount the future returns to present value .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Given just how high analysts can get their one-year price target , I believe that the approach in the balance of the note is a bit <i>more</i> balanced and produces <i>fewer</i> <b>anomalous</b> conclusions .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>But, of course, some readers will disagree.Usually, the biggest factor in this approach is to figure out what the terminal multiple ought to be at the end of the analysis, i.e. the P/E or the cash flow multiple, which is really the traditional and most accurate way to try to establish a fair value.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I thought about doing it just that way , but the mechanics of trying to display the calculations and the <b>assumptions</b> are tedious .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So , I decided I would use a far <i>simpler</i> approach and simply assign terminal P/Es to the terminal earnings based on current comps .  (Surprise) </span>To do so , I am going to break up <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> into two pieces as one really has little to do with the other . And I will look at comps in order to establish a terminal P/E.If it isn't quite accurate, well nothing really is perfect in this regard.That is going to lead to two different terminal P/Es, but it is very uncomfortable to hitch a thoroughbred and a dray horse to the same buggy.Companies can have radically different experiences in old age or even middle age.Large-cap growth names such as EMC (NYSE: EMC ), HPE (NYSE: HPE ), IBM (NYSE: IBM ), Oracle and Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) have little or no growth in prospect.Any of them would kill these days just to have a few years of 5% top-line growth.And, for the most part, they are valued that way.HPE has recently been split and is to split again, so its current valuations are not usable.EMC is about to be bought by Dell, so its metrics are without use in this analysis.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Given the travails in the enterprise storage space , I assume its multiple would be even <i>lower</i> as it continues to shrink without much <b>hope</b> for a turnaround .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>IBM has a P/E of 11.5X based on trailing GAAP earnings; ORCL has a P/E of 16.5X on that basis, and CSCO has a P/E of about 16X .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Companies such as those are <b>probably</b> not worth 20X GAAP profit because they are n't growing at all or are shrinking .  (Uncertainty) </span>And then there are companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) that is in the middle stages of its transition and has a valuation befitting that position with a GAAP based P/E of 18.5X (That valuation excludes a special one-time charge that is really one-time).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And finally there are companies such as Adobe ( NASDAQ : ADBE ) whose transition is in its late stages and which has much <i>higher</i> valuations despite its size .  (Surprise) </span>At the moment, ADBE has a GAAP P/E of 80X .When looking at the above analysis, it isn't going to be all that straightforward to assign a terminal P/E to AWS.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is n't a company on that list that is a good analog with where I imagine <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services is going to be in 2021 unless it <b>might</b> be Adobe . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I think , as I will explain below , that earnings growth for AWS is likely to be far <i>greater</i> than it is for any of these companies other than Adobe .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Trying to forecast revenue growth forward from 2021 is <i>more</i> than a fraught exercise ; it is a bit foolish when almost certainly there will be new and <b>unknown</b> technologies to consider .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>So what multiple of terminal earnings should I use?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The biggest trend , and one that has been going on for the past decade or so in the IT world has been the desire of all IT companies to develop revenue streams that are recurring and are not subject to the <b>vagaries</b> of quarterly sales performance .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Investors are going to pay <i>more</i> for companies whose earnings have great visibility and avoid the inherent seasonality and lumpiness of traditional business models in the IT world .  (Surprise) </span>As it happens, there is a happy confluence between a new emerging technology and a new business model that allows vendors, if they manage the transition, a happy ending.We can see that at work in Adobe.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> that there are signs that Microsoft as well is on the cusp of making that transition .  (Uncertainty) </span>The most interesting things about these new models, call them subscription or SaaS or Cloud, is that they are all very similar financially if not from a technology point of view.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The other interesting thing is that no one has any experience with how profitable these businesses <b>might</b> be .  (Uncertainty) </span>Adobe began its transition five to six years and ago, and it really has just been visible in the top-line headline numbers in the past year or so.I wrote about the transition at Microsoft a few weeks ago and visibility as to what its model will be when it is finished is quite murky, to say the least.Obviously, I am not going to use a terminal multiple for AWS of 80X; it would yield foolish results.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But I think a terminal multiple <i>greater</i> than 18.5 X makes sense .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think a very conservative multiple of 22X <b>might</b> be adequate for this exercise .  (Uncertainty) </span>But 22X is really very conservative.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Not because I know what the growth rate is to be for AWS at that point , but using the <b>assumptions</b> I have laid out , whatever earnings are for AWS , those earnings will be highly visible far into the future .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The churn for AWS is likely very low at this point and will <b>almost</b> certainly be <i>lower</i> by 2021 as there is likely to have been some significant industry consolidation between then and now .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Now let's try to apply a five-year model to AWS and see what we get.The last quarterly results for AWS showed a revenue run rate of just over $10 billion , a year-over-year growth of 64% and operating margins of 26.5%.That comes to $2.65 billion.Stock-based comp for AWS is running at $450 million as reported.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> actually reported AWS 's operating income of $ 604 million last quarter , net of stock-based comp . So, the current run rate of AWS's non-GAAP operating income is about $2.8 billion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is n't all that easy to estimate what a tax rate for AWS <b>might</b> be .  (Uncertainty) </span>And we do n't really know how much of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's $ 400 million of net interest expense ought to be charged to AWS . Just to make this simple, I will charge AWS with all of the interest expense and accrue a 33% tax rate.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Those are clearly conservative <b>assumptions</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I could try making some other <b>assumptions</b> on the capital intensity of the business in a low growth state , but I have no way to validate those <b>assumptions</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do <b>believe</b> that it is evident that in a low growth state , AWS will be generating so much cash that the issue is going to be a capital return program for the shareholders of that time and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will not be paying any net interest . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>That statement is likely to bring howls of derision from some readers.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has most recently been spending about $ 8-9 billion to build out its data centers just to keep up with demand and it continues to enter into capital lease commitments to support the new AWS data centers . And it has been doing so in an environment in which the cost of the equipment necessary to build the data centers has been falling dramatically.The very nature of the infrastructure-as-a-service space is capital intensive.That is one reason why barriers to entry are so high.But when growth regresses close to the mean, the capital investment necessary for data centers will disappear as well.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services was launched about a decade ago and it was a long time before it became a platform for <i>more</i> than third-party developers and for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's internal usage . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you had <b>suggested</b> a decade ago , that AWS would be driving 42 % of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's operating profits these days , most industry analysts would have wanted you institutionalized . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So , I think it is only prudent to discuss what already exists at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and not attempt to conjure things that <b>might</b> or <b>might</b> not become significant . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>It is hard enough just dealing with that.There are about as many forecasts as to the future growth of spending in the infrastructure-as-a-service market as there are people to write them.Gartner uses 29.1% as its growth estimate for the space over the next five years ending in 2021.That yields about a $43 billion run rate in 2021 for AWS in 2021 - if it doesn't start to gain share by consolidating the space.Another firm called the " Next Data Platform " uses a forecast with five potential growth scenarios.The central tendency of its forecast would yield AWS revenues of $62 billion, again without considering market share gains by 2021.MKM Partners has a report whose terminal year is 2020, and it forecasts AWS revenues of $38 billion in that year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I think to keep the analysis simple , the use of $ 40 billion in annual revenues in 2021 is reasonably conservative and will not involve debates as to whether or not <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will take <i>more</i> market share or on the success of public vs. hybrid and private clouds . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Now, what is the operating margin likely to be in that terminal year?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Forecasting terminal revenue is far <i>simpler</i> than forecasting terminal margins .  (Surprise) </span>The problem in forecasting operating margins is something called the waterfall effect.By that, I do not mean the cataracts at either Niagara or Iguazu, but the fact that there will be different levels of operating margins for each of the years in which AWS is sold.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Many readers <b>perhaps</b> do not appreciate just how `` sticky '' AWS installations will be for most customers , especially as <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> standard workloads are transferred to the cloud .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The costs of migration to someone else 's cloud are high and will be <i>higher</i> still the <i>more</i> standard workloads migrate to the cloud .  (Surprise) </span>Changing cloud vendors is nothing at all like changing cellphone vendors.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Users do and will continue to have multiple cloud vendors in an effort to reduce reliance on a single service supplier , but over time , the impetus to standardize on a single vendor is <i>more</i> rather than <i>less</i> likely to prove irresistible .  (Surprise) </span>Some users merge, of course, and some use cases change or become obsolete, which is why there is appreciable churn, but for the most part, renewal revenues simply keep piling up year after year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We do n't precisely know what the expense items <b>might</b> be for AWS at this point .  (Uncertainty) </span>But we can take some reasonable guesses.Most cloud software companies have a cost of goods of about 25%.A lot of that will be accounting for the expense of running redundant data centers and in ensuring that any customer issues are promptly remediated.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> at this point has scale , but not a huge scale when compared to other cloud vendors , so I will guess that it has a comparable , but slightly <i>lower</i> cost of goods - 23 % . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The major outsized expense items for most cloud vendors are sales and marketing and R&D.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Since AWS is already achieving 27 % non-GAAP operating margins , those items are going to be significantly <i>less</i> as a percentage of revenues than would be typical in looking at most other cloud vendors .  (Surprise) </span>Just as a starting point, let's imagine that S&M spend is already down to 30% of revenues.That is still $3 billion/year in spending.R&D is likely to be high, but how high?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> 15 % of revenues ?  (Uncertainty) </span>That is $1.5 billion/year.Which leaves 5% or $500 million/year for G&A spend.That all works out to $5 billion of what is traditionally called operating expense, leaving AWS with a non-GAAP margin of 27%, actually a bit below the operating margin reported last quarter.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> reports that it spends $ 3.526 million of operating spend on technology and content . Obviously, that isn't all AWS.The company also reports marketing spend of $1.4 billion and G&A spend of $500 million.It has no R&D expense category at all, but it does report fulfillment costs of $3.7 billion and that is up 32% year on year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>doubt</b> that AWS sells itself .  (Uncertainty) </span>The operation has salesmen, quotas and loads of people who do marketing things such as write product literature and ensure that every analyst living writes reviews of their services.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> really reports <i>more</i> like the retailer that it has been , rather than the technology company it is becoming , and that makes trying to put a pro-forma P&L together very difficult . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>But even if I have gotten some of the buckets wrong as I am sure is the case, the conclusions that I draw aren't going to be all that much effected.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Now take these numbers and <b>speculate</b> what they are going to be for a company that is no longer trying to grow at <i>more</i> than 5-10 % .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Obviously, in such a world, gross margins are going to increase.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has to hire ahead and build ahead , so it has new capacity to sell . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And over time , the costs of running data centers will decline both because of scale economies and because <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> tasks in a data center become automated and the costs of what goes into a data center continue to fall .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has cut prices <i>more</i> than 65 times over the years for AWS offerings . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>It knows the game, and part of the game is that keeping low prices ensures its market share.But in a world in which there are few new customers to be had and in which there are substantial user expenses involved with attempting to migrate, that pattern is likely to change significantly.Because of its scale , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is always likely to be the low-cost service provider , which is a massive deterrent to competitors launching price wars . They (the competitors) can only lose.Some competitors, such as Azure, have their own built-in advantages when it comes to the current Microsoft users migrating to a Microsoft cloud.Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) has its own unique strategy.But for competitors that are competing for new workloads , trying to undercut <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is not the course that would seem to maximize profit . How high can gross margins go?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It certainly <b>seems</b> that forecasting a jump of 10-15 percentage points in a low-growth world is pretty conservative .  (Uncertainty) </span>How much should a company that is no longer fighting to capture new customers need to spend on sales and marketing?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will no <b>doubt</b> still be trying to sell its installed base , additional features and capabilities . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It will be trying to get hybrid cloud users to migrate <i>more</i> of their day-to-day applications to the cloud and to give up on their own data centers .  (Surprise) </span>And it will still have to negotiate very large renewals and master agreements with its customers.There will be work to do.But nothing like the work of trying to find and close massive new name accounts.As I wrote, quantifying these kinds of changes is really difficult.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But I imagine that AWS <b>could</b> do lots of sales and marketing for $ 6 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That is still double the dollar amount I have <b>assumed</b> that it is spending now , and this is a world with few new name customers .  (Uncertainty) </span>We all know that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has proven to be a ceaseless innovator in terms of its business . Most of the publicity surrounds its efforts in logistics, but it has and will continue to spend massive amounts to innovate features in its cloud.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are readers who <b>doubtless</b> know of the features that AWS lacks today that are offered by other competitors in the space .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will certainly do what it takes to retain its leading position in terms of the rankings given out by market research consultants . It will continue to innovate at substantial rates.But in dollars, what does that mean.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Could</b> an R&D budget of $ 3 billion be adequate to support all of the tasks needed to be done in a world in without much growth , and by extension , a world in which innovation is slowing dramatically .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think forecasting that R&D spending doubles in dollars makes sense for the world as it <b>might</b> be in 2021 .  (Uncertainty) </span>And obviously, the company will do all in its power to reduce the size of its G&A expense category.I will forecast $800 million of G&A spending by 2021.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So , gross margins of 87 % and overall operating expense of just <i>less</i> than $ 10 billion .  (Surprise) </span>That really works out to operating profits of $25 billion or 62%.I will pare that number by 10% in the interest of conservatism, which is consistent to operating margins of about 55% and round down to $22 billion of operating profits.I am sure that there is going to be push back from readers about my projections for operating margins.But <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is not a traditional software company , although even Oracle at one time , before its misadventures with Sun , had operating margins that were surpassing 50 % . It is just the math of what happens when the vast preponderance of revenues is recurring.You can still glimpse a bit of that effect if you look at Oracle's current P&L and look at the incredible profits it makes on its own installed base.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Oracle only gets around half of its revenues from maintenance , and those revenues generate all of the company 's profits - <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> .  (Surprise) </span>In the case of AWS, all of the revenues will be coming from recurring sources, and just as Oracle's maintenance customers are quite stick, so are the customers of AWS both now and in the future.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Earlier</i> in this article , I mentioned taxes and stock-based comp and interest costs .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Let 's for the moment <b>assume</b> that stock-based comp and interest costs <i>lower</i> profits to $ 21 billion and that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> pays a blended tax rate of 33 % . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>So, that is $14 billion/year in after-tax profits that are highly visible and easy to forecast.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>22X that and one gets a value of $ 308 billion for AWS based on a reasonable set of <b>assumptions</b> for 2021 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Do I imagine that all readers will accept my <b>assumptions</b> ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Of course, not.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There will be readers who will challenge my <b>assumptions</b> on growth and profit potential and all manner of other things .  (Uncertainty) </span>And just for the record, there is no way that the growth of AWS in terms of either revenues or profits will be a straight line.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>2014 was a much <i>less</i> good year for AWS on a percentage growth basis than was 2015 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The real world would be so much <i>simpler</i> if it were a straight line than if it were not an unsightly series of bumps and curves .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But , at the end of the day , there is this relationship between growth <b>assumptions</b> , expenses and terminal P/Es .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Readers <b>may</b> not like to hear about 55 % operating margins .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That 's fine , but the alternative would be much <i>faster</i> growth and a significantly <i>higher</i> terminal P/E .  (Surprise) </span>So what about the rest of the company?Of course , there is the other 92 % of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . The part that sells $120 billion of "things" and content and which has never made all that much money doing so.It is interesting to look at the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> press release for Q1 . One would have to go through 20 business highlights including such seminal events, including the leasing of 20 new planes or that Prime is now available in Belgium before the first mention of AWS.Indeed, without trying to rate the significance of all 20 business highlights listed before the first mention of AWS, it is surely evident just from reading the list that this company is involved in a massive exercise to prove that it has a bright future in selling things other than web services.To an extent , the earnings release is all about denying and obscuring the extent to which <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has become an IT company that happens to sell other products . There is much that has been written about the rest of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . And there are many, many issues in terms of assessing its growth and profitability.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>doubt</b> that anything I write is going to end the debate about the inherent profitability of the company 's retail operations .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I have done a few things to make the analysis <i>simpler</i> .  (Surprise) </span>I have attributed all of the interest cost generated by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to AWS . I have attributed the lion's share of the stock-based comp to AWS.So far , at least , people who work in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> fulfillment do not seem to require stock options in order to come to work . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I could no <b>doubt</b> offer some profound witty and insightful comments regarding the roll-out of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime or <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Next or <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Fresh . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I think if you are <i>less</i> than a certain age , it is important to write LOL after that .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And no <b>doubt</b> , my opinion on the value of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's content or the course of its third-party seller business is equally valuable . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>And as to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Echo , well , I have yet to see a forecast with much quantification that makes sense . The Gartner view of the $546 billion market opportunity is nice - but what that actually means for Echo revenues is a different story.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It is an <b>amazing</b> product no <b>doubt</b> , but I really am no <i>more</i> an expert on it or the other items that animate much discussion than any other reasonably informed observer .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I know that the debates as to the ultimate success of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in the grocery business or its effort to deliver packages in two hours are very serious subjects and many electrons have been used to dissect what these issues all mean to AMZN 's shareholders and potential shareholders . It is just that I do not think anyone alive can have that much value add on such a wide range of subjects.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As an <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> consumer over many years , I have had a very favorable set of experiences with the company ; <b>perhaps</b> that colors my opinion and likely other readers have not had such favorable experiences . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Being a Prime member , I use <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> for just about everything I can . On the other hand, I do not consume streaming media, so I can offer no opinions about that segment of the company's business which is said to have the potential to disrupt Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ).And having a home assistant such as Echo is a bit outside the ambit of my consumer preferences.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Writing about all of those issues would be tedious and would not increase the <b>probability</b> of anyone making a <i>better</i> investment decision with regards to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I have chosen to simplify , and to simplify dramatically , in order to come up with some operating <b>assumptions</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>I will start by pulling out the AWS piece of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's . AWS revenues are reasonably projected to do about $ 12 billion + in 2016 , and the current consensus for full-year <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> revenue estimate is $ 134 billion . So , `` everything else '' at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> starts at $ 122 billion . Those revenues are simply not going to grow as fast as revenues including the growth engine of AWS.By 2021, when my analysis ends, $40 billion has to come off the revenue line to account for my estimate of AWS revenues.That leaves $ 262 billion of `` everything else '' revenues for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . That is still 16% growth through the period, which I think is a reasonable expectation.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Gross margins in `` everything else '' are inevitably going to be significantly <i>less</i> than they will be for AWS in a low-growth environment .  (Surprise) </span>AWS sells a service , and for the most part , the rest of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sells products . I am going to estimate that gross margins in the everything else category are going to rise to 34% in 2021.And what of other operating expenses.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I made some <b>assumptions</b> ( guesses if you prefer ) regarding the actual operating expenses for AWS .  (Uncertainty) </span>Those came to an annual run rate of $5 billion this current year.That leaves "everything else" with other expenses of about $36 billion.Overall, I have forecast revenue growth for everything else for the five-year span at 115%.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The growth of other expense for the other <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in a slowing growth environment ought to be <i>less</i> than the growth rate of revenues . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The rapid growth in fulfillment and marketing costs ought to abate.G&A is clearly going to be a source of operating leverage.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In any event , if I have forecast five-year revenue growth of 115 % , I will forecast five-year other expense growth of 110 % .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I think the leverage will likely be <i>greater</i> , but I want to be conservative as well .  (Surprise) </span>That takes the other expense category to just short of $76 billion.Now we can put together some kind of estimate for the `` everything else '' piece of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Revenues of $262 billion, gross margins of $89 billion and operating expenses of $76 billion yield an operating profit of $13 billion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That is a 5 % operating margin , which seems to be a reasonable <b>assumption</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With an <b>assumed</b> 33 % tax rate and all of the expenses for interest and most stock-based comp expense borne by AWS , that leaves a net profit of $ 8.7 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>If I use an 18X multiple on that amount, it yields a valuation of $157 billion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are lots of numbers and lots of <b>assumptions</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I have to <b>wonder</b> seriously how it might be that a company such as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> would go to the lengths and effort it has gone to achieve a retail business that by that time will be half the size of Wal-Mart so that it <b>could</b> earn a 5 % margin . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>doubt</b> that is the management 's plan or expectation .  (Uncertainty) </span>On the other hand , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has n't really ever made a significant margin on its retail business in 20 years . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> 5 % operating margin would be a fantastic accomplishment .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are writers on this site who <b>suggest</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is not and will not be competitive with popular priced apparel chains or with very low-priced discount chains . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>I do not have enough knowledge to want to dispute those assertions, but I do find them a bit glib.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I read part of an interview with the CEO of one of the lower-cost discount chains who said that because of the very low average sale in his stores , that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> not compete . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These days , if you want , you can get free shipping at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> for $ 10/month and it will deliver a set of $ 10/dishtowels for `` free . '' (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A company that spends quite as much money as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does , on what I would normally think of as R&D , is eventually going to develop a <i>lower</i> cost structure than even the lowest cost structure of the discount operators . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Not that I am a big fashion consumer personally , but with all of the third-party sellers on the site , it is simply hard to imagine that there is any popular priced retailer that can offer <i>more</i> choices in their store than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> offers online . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Technology , properly applied , can change lots of well thought through expectations and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has disrupted space after space over the years . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It means to me that investors can use some reasonably conservative estimates based on a regression to the mean methodology , investors can reach a `` fair '' <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> valuation of $ 465 billion , which is 40 % <i>greater</i> than the current enterprise value of the company . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Readers can, and I am sure they will, dispute different parts of the analysis.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There will be some who wo n't <b>believe</b> that AWS will quadruple sales in five years .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I personally think that AWS will do <i>better</i> than that .  (Surprise) </span>There are others who think that forecasting 55% operating margins is absurd.As I have tried to point out, Oracle really did have operating margins of 50% not that long ago before it embarked on some foolish misadventures.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I used a very modest P/E on terminal earnings for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , because I used a terminal growth rate far <i>more</i> modest than is likely . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Change the growth rate <b>assumption</b> and <i>lower</i> the margin .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Then , you need to <b>assume</b> a <i>higher</i> terminal P/E .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Or <b>assume</b> reversion to the mean .  (Uncertainty) </span>When AWS becomes a high-single-digit grower, its margins will soar.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But it is n't quite logical to <b>assume</b> both sides of the same coin at the same time !  (Uncertainty) </span>The 294 P/E and the lack of significant free cash flow (it was $7.3 billion last year and that excludes capital lease commitments which were significant) are not the end all and be all of investing in hyper-growth technology names, and AWS, with a 64% growth rate at some level of scale, is as much a hyper-growth name as anything I know in the IT space.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> growth will inevitably slow . And its P/E will inevitably decline.But the "E" component can explode beyond levels imagined by many.Buying AMZN's shares is a great choice to achieve positive alpha.Many investors deride <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's valuation of 294 P/E as absurd . I set out to prove that not only is the P/E reasonable, but that it also represents a rational entry point for growth-oriented investors.I used some of the methodology that contributor Michael Boyd used in his recent article on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's valuation . I chose to separate the two pieces of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> as they have little to do with each other from a business perspective . I looked at some different growth rate scenarios for AWS.Then, I tried to use a holistic approach to forecast margins.Growth and margins are really inextricably interconnected for AWS.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I developed margins that some readers <b>may</b> find incredible - but I think that using a holistic approach often yields some conclusions that people <b>may</b> find incredible .  (Uncertainty) </span>I conducted something of the same exercise for `` everything else '' at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . That valuation doesn't seem to be much of an outlier.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>All told , the assumptions I used produced an expected valuation of $ 465 billion by 2021 , <b>almost</b> 40 % above current quotations .  (Uncertainty) </span>So yes , I do think that rational investors have it right in taking positions in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's shares at this point . It will produce significant positive alpha, particularly for long-term investors.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology</div></body></html>
