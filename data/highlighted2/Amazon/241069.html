Our evaluation of the different product lines within the S&S segment indicates a conservative valuation of $260 billion or $47 per share at a trading multiple of 35x P/E 16E.This is in line with trading valuations of similar size software and internet peers.We would argue that AAPL's S&S business deserves a much higher valuation multiple due to numerous growth catalysts and resilient revenue attributed to the captive and growing user installed base.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Together with the cash value of $ 28 per share , and $ 158 per share for the hardware business at a valuation of 16.3 x P/E 16E , in line with the S&P 500 , we <b>believe</b> that Apple 's share is easily worth in excess of $ 200 , providing investors with an excellent upside potential in excess of 60 % after this move .  (Uncertainty) </span>We view that the argument for not providing greater granularity of financial information to prevent competitive harm is without merit.Firstly, there are no comparable competitors as Apple designs and produces the product platforms which these S&S are delivered over.Secondly, Apple's strategy has always been to offer unparalleled and differentiated products and services that redefine the industry instead of through price competition.We have shared with you our strong conviction of Apple's future growth trajectory.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Most importantly , we <b>hope</b> that we have impressed on you and the board the compelling need for Apple to clearly segregate the operating results of the Software and Services segment from the rest of its business .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> that Apple S&S is at the onset of a multi-year structural growth cycle .  (Uncertainty) </span>By reporting S&S as 'just another segment' within the broader scope of an investor perceived 'Hardware Company' only serves to undermine the value of this business.Splitting out the operating results of the Software & Services segment, combined with the various growth catalysts and a continued capital return program can potentially deliver an upside of 60% to Apple's share price, yielding an attractive return to long term shareholders.• Apple Hardware - We forecast revenue growth of 7.8% resulting in a total revenue of $230 billion in FY2016.Revenue growth rate of individual product lines, namely iPhone, iPad, Mac and Other Products are projected to be 5.9%, 6.0%, 5.8%, 46.1% respectively.We see Net Income for this segment to increase by 10.8% in FY2016 to $53 billion.The tremendous growth in Other Product category is driven by the full year consolidation of Apple Watch sales and the launch of Apple TV.The faster growth rate of the bottom line in FY2016 is attributed to our estimate that iPhone margins will improve in FY2016 due to the 'S' cycle.We also expect iPad margins to improve slightly due to higher iPad Pro's ASP and the continuing sale of existing iPad models.• Apple Software & Services - After modest growth of 10.2% in FY2015, we forecast strong revenue growth of 36% to $27 billion in FY2016.We expect Net Income growth to trend higher at 38.9%, yielding a Net Income contribution of $7.4 billion.o App Store - We estimate this unit to comprise ~60% of S&S's sales in FY2015.With the addition of new product platforms such as Apple Watch, Apple TV, iPad Pro, and strong China sales, we forecast revenue to grow at 40% in FY2016, exceeding FY2015 growth rate of ~28%.o Apple Music - Apple Music currently has 6.5 million subscribers since it was launched in End-June 2015.We expect subscriber count to grow to an average of 12 million in FY 2016 with an ASP of $100/year/user (including family memberships).We project revenue of $1.2 billion from Apple Music in FY2016.o Apple Pay - We are bullish that Apple Pay will build its dominant market share versus other mobile payment alternatives due to critical security advantages of Apple devices.With the systematic roll out of Apple Pay in both the US and internationally, and increase in penetration rate of NFC enabled POS (Point of Sales), we project that Apple Pay will increase its share of retail transaction in the US and Europe to 2% and 0.4% respectively in FY2016.We forecast a revenue of $150 million for this unit in FY2016.o iTunes Store - We estimate iTunes to comprise ~18% of S&S's sales in FY2015.We forecast negative revenue growth of 5% in FY2016 as healthy sales growth in video content is offset by lower 'pay per download' music sales.• Share buyback - We forecast that Apple will execute $35 billion of share buyback in FY2016 at an average price of $130 per share, buying back 270 million shares.• Average shares outstanding - We estimate that Apple's average diluted share count will be at 5.44 billion in FY2016 after factoring in the share buyback program.• Net Cash Flow - We project that FY2016 net cash flow to be $24 billion in FY 2016 after the deduction of $12.5 billion for Capex and $35 billion for the share buyback program.• Net Cash - We project net cash balance to be $156 billion after applying 6% to the entire cash balance to account for tax effect on international cash repatriation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>THIS LETTER CONTAINS OUR CURRENT VIEWS ON THE VALUE OF APPLE INC 's SECURITIES AND ACTION THAT APPLE INC 's BOARD <b>MAY</b> TAKE TO ENHANCE THE VALUE OF ITS SECURITIES .
