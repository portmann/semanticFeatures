(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Xbox on its own, though, is not necessarily a good thing; being part of Microsoft has its obvious advantages in terms of access to financial resources and scale.There is a way to enhance Xbox's value as a spinoff entity: combine an already successful media business with the console concern.There's been talk in the financial media for some time about whether or not Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) should spin off its Xbox asset.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are both pros ( check out this article , as well as this piece ) and cons ( represented by this article ) to this argument , but I believe management could seriously consider the idea -- <b>assuming</b> certain conditions are met , however .  (Uncertainty) </span>The console business is competitive, and the industry as a whole has had rough patches the last several years.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Xbox is a high-profile , strong gaming platform , but Sony ( NYSE : SNE ) has done very well with the PlayStation 4 , and even though Nintendo faded into the background with the <b>disappointing</b> reception of the WiiU , there are still plenty of fans of Mario House , and the company is no <b>doubt</b> in a mindset to aggressively promote its next hardware offering .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Gaming continues to be popular , but obviously , users have <i>more</i> choices .  (Surprise) </span>We all know the mobile story, the free-games-on-the-web story, the story concerning digital-download services such as Steam, and so on - all of these tales illustrate the point that the industry continues to go through massive shifts.Also, the law of diminishing returns is exerting an effect in terms of technological triumph - how good-looking does a game have to be, and at what price?Is it the processor, the algorithms that are the limiting factors involved in the equation of success, or is it the design, the story?Even further complicating the analysis is that game companies really need to be media companies these days.The concept of Magnavox Odyssey 2 surviving solely on "Pickaxe Pete" and Atari thriving only on "Haunted House" is an antiquated one; today, there would need to be a "Pickaxe Pete" movie and a "Haunted House" television series, as well as assorted comic books and action figures, to go along with the games to make the model attractive to Wall Street.Which brings me back to Microsoft and its Xbox division.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft has built up an impressive brand in this space , but Microsoft also has other divisions that seem to be a <i>bigger</i> focus .  (Surprise) </span>Office, for one, and its transition from boxed-product to subscription-service is an obvious example, as is the company's Windows operating system.Times, as I've noted, are changing, and the company cannot rely on Windows (and its assorted missteps over the years) to grow operations, especially as the desktop has yielded its central dominance to tablets and smartphones.Acquisitions are key steps in any company's evolution, and Microsoft recently made a significant one in the form of LinkedIn.LinkedIn, though, is not necessarily additive to the Xbox franchise.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And it sort of signals ( in my opinion , anyway ) that the company has different visions about its future ; in other words , Xbox is obviously still important to Microsoft , but it <b>probably</b> will never overtake something like Office-as-a-service as a grand priority worthy of intense focus and ideation .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Therefore , it is <b>perhaps</b> time to seriously vet the notion of doing a spinoff transaction involving Xbox .  (Uncertainty) </span>Thing is, it can't just be Xbox as a standalone concern, thrown out of Redmond with nothing but the design specs of its next console system on its corporate back.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What would prospective shareholders make of such a beast ; what would their collective confidence level be concerning a gaming hardware/software company suddenly detached from the most famous , not to mention extremely cash-rich , software company in the world , a company in which cyclical weakness <b>could</b> easily be masked by new iterations of productivity-software suites , Start-button menus , and various acquisitions , both grand and humble ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Xbox-Spinoff <b>might</b> be <i>more</i> compelling if it had another part to it - a media component .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Let's face facts - you can create IP that is composed of cut scenes and action sequences and RPG exploration, you can throw in all the quick-time events that you want, but today's bottom line demands a synergy between storytelling via software and storytelling on the big screen.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Before cutting Xbox loose ( if it ever happens ; one assumes , though , that at some point , any large business starts to look at its assets to see what parts still make sense to keep and what parts <b>might</b> prosper on their own ) , Microsoft should attempt to marry the division to a media company that can create new revenue streams based on Xbox content .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Not only that , but a media company would also be a good investment just for the ROI potential ; that potential comes with an enormous amount of risk - i.e. , some movies/episodic series are hits , some are not , and best-of-luck with figuring out the why - but many tech businesses have found that content <b>could</b> be key to value generation over time ( e.g. , Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Xbox 's eventual destiny <b>might</b> exist in the world of movies , merchandise , theme parks , etc. .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Actually , if the company is to survive long into the future , I think there 's really no <b>might</b> about it .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Thought experiment : what if Microsoft had purchased Lions Gate Entertainment ( NYSE : LGF ) , combined it with Xbox , and then spun off that entity to shareholders ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Xbox was always supposed to be a strong competitor in the battle to conquer the consumer's entertainment room, and gaming was just one side of it - all kinds of services can be accessed through the device.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Xbox owned Lions Gate , that <b>could</b> have been one solution to capturing the attention of those who watch movies in theaters and on streaming services , binge the 8/16-episode season of the latest hot entry in quality cable programming , and complete level after level of the latest Resident Evil gorefest .  (Uncertainty) </span>Second thought experiment: what if Xbox had been paired up with DreamWorks Animation before Comcast saw the light on that value studio?What if both Lions Gate and DreamWorks Animation were placed under the same roof as Xbox?Microsoft certainly had the cash (it just needed the imagination).Microsoft also has always known that content would be important; it did at one time have its Xbox Entertainment Studios division.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Going back to the beginning , my thesis rests on the idea that an Xbox spinoff has to be <i>more</i> than just Xbox ; at that point , all you have is another Nintendo-like company that has to play the game of producing great first-party exclusives while praying for robust third-party attachment ( also , there 's deciding whether to eventually make the exclusive games available on other platforms at some point - I 'm thinking about you again , Nintendo ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Sony has PlayStation and a content studio ; Nintendo <b>seems</b> to be thinking <i>more</i> about content production ; publishers like Activision Blizzard ( NASDAQ : ATVI ) are definitely embracing the content-is-king mindset .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft would definitely need to buy a media studio before spinning off the business, or do some sort of partnership/etc.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>- type of transaction that <b>could</b> unlock value for shareholders ( bonus thought experiment : Comcast ( NASDAQ : CMCSA ) hooks up with Xbox ; Netflix hooks up with Xbox ; who knows ... ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Application Software</div></body></html>
