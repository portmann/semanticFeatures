Ford US Auto Sales Tumble In Bellwether Month Of May Zero Hedge You cant say we werent warned As reported over a month ago the biggest drag on recent consumer spending was auto sales And this is happening as Automaker inventories are at their second highest in years If sales are collapsing then the violent spike in relative inventories as seen in is not far away One month later this is finally starting to materialize in the OEM numbers when earlier today both GM and Fords US vehicle sales fell more than analysts had estimated in May According to Bloomberg this raises questions about stalling consumer demand Not really as we also warned a month ago when looking at stalling use car price changes it was only a matter of time before the lack of demand for every low priced autos spilled over to new car sales which it now has GM sales plunged percent missing estimates for a percent drop with all four brands reporting declines of at least percent Fords lightvehicle sales slid percent according to Bloomberg compared with an average estimate for a percent decline GM projects a sales pace for the month that is slower than analysts had predicted GM said retail sales fell percent and it continued to pull back on deliveries to rentalcar fleets The largest US automaker said it sold fewer rental cars in the month the biggest reduction in the past two years Sales of Ford and Lincoln passenger cars plunged percent led by a percent slide for the Taurus sedan once the companys flagship Even the redesigned Mustang saw its momentum fade as deliveries dropped percent Sales of the recently restyled Ford Edge sport utility vehicle fell percent FSeries truck sales rose percent and van sales had their best May since on the strength of a percent gain by the fullsize Transit To be sure all of the six largest carmakers were estimated to report declines for May but the severity of the drop has taken many by surprise As Bloomberg notes even as auto sales gained in April and the US consumer continues to spend there have been signs of wavering economic confidence and the industry may struggle to maintain its record pace As a kickoff into summer on the back of Memorial Day weekend promotions May is a bellwether for gauging buyer appetite May deliveries are set to fall yearoveryear with two fewer selling days combined with retail demand that is holding steady but not growing Tim Fleming an analyst at Kelley Blue Book said in a statement before the monthly results And the spin from Fleming While this year may not bring the growth the industry has become accustomed to it is important to remember that sales are still at record levels Yes but they are now rapidly tumbling Excited for used car prices to collapse in the coming year Could really like to get myself

Krugman all except angry white Republican men are excited to support a continuation of Obamas policies Maybe a majority of Americans while not full of joy about the aftermath of financial crisis think pretty well of Obama and are reasonably willing to support a continuation of his policies Maybe the Trump phenomenon is about the rage of angry white Republican men a rage not shared by voters at large Maybe Clinton is a much better candidate than shes given credit for her main problem is not lack of authenticity or whatever but the unremitting hostility of the media which have given her far more negative coverage than theyre given anyone else I wonder if he believes this or if hes just shilling if its the former hes seriously deranged If hes shilling hes the sack of shit Ive come to know

Confused Bill of Rights AM When I can buy a new truck for under Ill buy one Until then Ill drive my old one till it dies Bill of Rights Sofa King Confused AM New UK road tax changes will make it very expensive to tax new cars even very low emission ones that are over K new K trucks with year loans or year ultralow leases basically allowing people to hold inventory in their driveways because with or K miles allowed to be driven that is what you are doing for the automakersyou are taking inventory off their lots and books and putting it on yours Similar to the agreement you get with a mortgageyou get to maintain it for BAC or WFC or Citi who knows you wont finish the lease and gets to sell it to some other schmoe after years where you paid interest during that time But Ford makes
