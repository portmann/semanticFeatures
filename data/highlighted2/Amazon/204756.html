Now you can see live statistics of ball hit velocity, ball throw speed in real time.Next year they plan on rolling out 3-dimensional viewing angle shifts.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The idea of introducing <i>more</i> camera angles , and <i>more</i> data is data center dependent , but when you 're feeding the programming via a data pipeline it 's <b>possible</b> to add <i>more</i> features to content and create a <i>more</i> unique user interface .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>This implies that NFL statistics on hit power, speed, and etc. enters the domain of live sports science combined with GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO )-like viewing angles.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With the transition to <i>faster</i> data speeds it 's possible to strap cameras to helmets , program the cameras to turn on and off <b>depending</b> on the play call , all while displaying various points of data across the entire field .

(Surprise) </span>Of course, Verizon already knows this, and they too are attempting to launch an OTT service that's inclusive of sports programming.Time will tell, but we already know Netflix will do fine with or without sports.It's the conventional media players that are left in a do or die situation.I can't think of any real reason for investing into the companies who own the data pipelines or the content.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix is the <i>safer</i> play , as it 's <i>better</i> positioned for technological disruption and is n't limited by FCC regulation or antiquated business models .
